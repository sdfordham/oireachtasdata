    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-05-21a.10.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013052100056#WRA00800"><p>As the Deputy will appreciate, officials from the Irish authorities are in regular dialogue with all of the State supported banks in an effort to enhance stability and to facilitate the sectors&rsquo; return to profitability.  The long term profitability of the State supported banks depends on many variables, the impact of trackers is only one of those.  There has been improvement in many other variables that impact on profitability of the State supported banks.  I would draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention in particular, to cost reductions, improved funding costs, reduced ELG costs as a result of the ending of the ELG scheme, expected reductions in impairments and Net Interest Margin improvements all of which should have positive impacts on profitability.     </p><p>  Obviously unprofitable tracker mortgages represent a drag on the profitability of the State supported institutions and my officials continue to discuss possible solutions with those institutions and market participants.  The Deputy will recognise that there would be a cost associated with the removal of unprofitable tracker mortgages from the balance sheets of the State supported institutions and this cost would have to be borne by some entity. </p><p>  The Deputy should be aware however that the State supported banks&rsquo; tracker mortgages are not a homogenous group of mortgages and the terms on which they were written can and do vary.  In particular, while a significant number of tracker mortgages, especially those written during the later stages of the boom had low contractual margins over base rates, it is not the case that all tracker mortgages are unprofitable.  The profitability or otherwise of a tracker mortgage is a function of a number of variables including the base rate, the margin the borrower is contracted to pay over the base rate and the funding cost to the institution of that mortgage. </p><p>  As the Deputy is aware the State supported banks provide a considerable level of disclosure on their financial performance in their annual reports and other financial statements.  Copies of these reports can be found on the websites of each of the State supported institutions.  These institutions provide detailed information on their mortgage portfolios.  The impact of tracker mortgages, as a group, on the financial performance of each State supported institution is not explicitly shown however. </p><p>  As no decision to transfer the tracker mortgage portfolios of the State supported institutions to any other entity has been taken, I cannot outline the impact that such a transfer would have on the long term profitability of the State supported banks. 	</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-05-21a.15.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013052100057#WRB00400"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 61 and 63 together. </p><p>  It is to be expected that staff will move between the Central Bank and the financial sector in both directions.  This can be healthy to the extent that it allows the Central Bank to gain access to high-level sectoral expertise while allowing those with regulatory experience to move into the industry and support a compliance culture.  This process needs to be managed in a way that ensures the independence and integrity of the Central Bank is preserved and seen to be preserved.  To address this, a Human Resources Strategy has been developed by the Central Bank, which includes as key elements talent management and succession planning.  I have been informed by the Central Bank that it has appropriate policies and procedures in place to deal with departures of senior personnel to take up roles in the financial services sector.   Specifically, this potential issue is taken into account when drafting new contracts for certain roles or reassigning staff to other duties if a potential for conflict arises.  </p><p>  The Central Bank Code of Ethics requires that in the event of an employee intending to leave the employment of the Central Bank to take up alternative employment, self-employment or business, they are obliged to provide early notification to line management when a conflict of interest exists, or might be perceived to exist, between those duties held in the Central Bank and those to be undertaken with the new employer, in self-employment or in business.  In such circumstances, the Central Bank may assign alternative tasks to the individual while their notice period is being served. </p><p>  The notice period may be lengthened in excess of the contractual or statutory notice period by mutual agreement where it is felt that it is in the best interests of the Central Bank and the employee.</p><p>  I am informed by the Central Bank that there is no practice there of rehiring retired directors or other retired staff in order to increase their individual pension benefits.  In very exceptional and limited circumstances, the Central Bank may re-engage retired staff subject to public sector norms and pension scheme rules but pension benefits do not increase as a result of this re-engagement.</p></reply>

This also applies to any assumption of potential asset price appreciation, as well as the estimated costs related to a potential foreclosure of property; and</p><p>- Lenders need to use an appropriate interest rate when discounting future income flows, which should take account of the lender's cost of funds. </p><p>  The Central Bank will assess compliance with these principles in its supervisory audit of compliance with the targets, including through analysis of a sample of modifications.</p><p>  The Central Bank has now written to each of the 6 specified institutions to set out the reporting timelines required with regard to the public and non-public targets of each institution and the target levels.</p><p>  It is fair to say that progress is underway and the Deputy may wish to note that in the Central Bank's Q4 2012 mortgage arrears statistics, the Central Bank has indicated that overall there were around 23,430 mortgage accounts that had permanent restructure types at the end December 2012.  In addition, the two pillar banks have indicated that each bank will assess at a minimum 1,500 cases each month to determine whether the mortgage is sustainable and identify the most appropriate forbearance treatment.</p><p>  Separately from this Central Bank action, the new personal insolvency system, in particular the new resolution frameworks provided for in the Personal Insolvency Act, will be shortly be available to borrowers who are in significant difficulty in their mortgage repayments.  Utilising this process, the borrower will be in a position to consult an independent personal insolvency practitioner and where necessary to make a formal and realistic personal insolvency arrangement proposal to all eligible creditors, including a mortgage lender.  In such a situation the creditors will be obliged to formally consider and vote on the arrangement as proposed by the debtor.  I would also remind the Deputies that, under the mortgage advisory service developed by the Department of Social Protection, independent financial advice is available to borrowers who have been offered a long term forbearance option by the lender, and a panel of around 2,000 qualified accountants is now in place to provide this service.   </p><p>  Taken together, the framework is in place to enable banks to work with distressed homeowners to reach sustainable solutions for dealing with their personal indebted situations.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-05-21a.24.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013052100057#WRB01100"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 64 and 75 together.  </p><p>  The Bank Recovery and Resolution (&ldquo;BRRD&rdquo;) proposal aims to introduce an effective recovery and resolution framework for credit institutions and investment firms at national level to ensure minimum harmonisation at EU level.  The proposed directive provides for three stages of crisis prevention and management: a preventative stage, an early intervention stage and a resolution stage.  Part of the resolution stage provides for a bail-in tool which is a mechanism for allocating losses to shareholders and creditors of the institution under resolution in accordance with an established bail-in hierarchy.</p><p>  The BRRD proposal, as published by the Commission, provides that under bail-in losses would in the first instance be allocated to shareholders.  Once shareholders claims have been exhausted subordinated creditors would then be written down.  Only when these claims have been exhausted could senior creditors be written down. </p><p>  The hierarchy of claims for bail-in in the BRRD proposal that was published by the Commission last year does not differentiate between different classes of senior creditors such as depositors with deposits over &euro;100,000 (uninsured depositors) and senior bondholders.  This matter is the subject of on-going debate in the Council negotiations on the BRRD file.</p><p>  At ECOFIN earlier this month I asked finance ministers to consider the scope and design of the bail-in tool in the BRRD directive.  Among other things, these discussions focused on how bail-in would apply to uninsured depositors (i.e. deposits greater than &euro;100,000).  I proposed that these depositors should be given a higher ranking in the hierarchy of claims than other senior debt.  In effect they would only ever bear losses after other senior creditors such as bondholders. </p><p>  I am glad to report that the discussion provided the Presidency with sufficient clarity on the position of Member States to enable us to press ahead with our efforts to achieve agreement on this file.  On the question of how deposits are affected I noted convergence on a number of points:</p><p>  - agreement among Member States that deposits under &euro;100,000 must be fully guaranteed;</p><p>  - considerable support for depositor preference for uninsured deposits i.e. they would be the last category to be bailed-in.</p><p>  The Deputies will be aware that the Government fully adheres to the EU policy of guaranteeing deposits of &euro;100,000 per customer, per bank.</p><p>  The objective of the Irish Presidency in placing this item on the May ECOFIN agenda was to try to achieve a common understanding on this issue which would help to unlock discussion on other areas of the BRRD notably the financing element.  </p><p>  I am proposing to bring the BRRD dossier back to the ECOFIN on 21st June with a view to reaching a Council agreement on the overall BRRD proposal.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-05-21a.27.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013052100057#WRB01300"><p>As the Deputy is aware, on 6/7 February the liquidation of IBRC was agreed in the Houses of the Oireachtas and the IBRC Promissory Notes were replaced with longer-dated Irish Government Bonds.  This followed extensive discussions with our European partners at all levels, particularly in the later stages of 2012 and into 2013.   </p><p>  The new arrangements go a long way towards addressing the systemic liquidity issue in the Irish banking system and substantially improve the debt position of the State, while materially improving our ability to regain access to the bond markets and exit the Troika programme. </p><p>  The Promissory Notes were replaced with a portfolio of Irish Government bonds comprising: </p><p>- three tranches of &euro;2 billion, each maturing after 25, 28 and 30 years; </p><p>- three tranches of &euro;3 billion, each maturing after 32, 34 and 36 years; </p><p>- two tranches of &euro;5 billion, each maturing after 38 and 40 years.</p><p>  The principal benefits from this arrangement are:</p><p>- The Promissory Notes are gone.  They were exchanged for long term Government Bonds, with an average maturity of 34 to 35 years as opposed to the 7 to 8 year average maturity on the Promissory Notes. </p><p>- The maturity of the bonds have significant benefits from a market perspective as it ensures the liability to repay is beyond most credit investors&rsquo; time horizon.</p><p>- A reduction in the State&rsquo;s General Government deficit of approximately &euro;1 billion (0.6% of GDP) per annum over the coming years, which will bring us closer to attaining our 3% deficit target by 2015.</p><p>- A significant element of the interest payments on the Government bonds, which are held by the Irish Central Bank, will ultimately be returned to the Exchequer in the form of Central Bank dividends.</p><p>- The State will be borrowing &euro;20 billion less cash over the next 10 years due to the cashflow benefit of this arrangement.  Next year the cash flow benefit will be &euro;2.3 billion (excluding initial transaction costs).  </p><p>- The arrangement will lead to a substantial improvement in the State&rsquo;s debt position over time.</p><p>- The housing of all the 'wind down assets' in one entity (NAMA) will result in just one wind-down vehicle.</p><p>  The substantial benefits of this arrangement flow from the exchange of the Promissory Notes for far more efficient financing from the State&rsquo;s perspective.</p><p>  This Government is aware that this solution does not address other challenges in the Irish banking system.  However it was an important step in restoring the health of the Irish banking sector and confidence in the Irish economy.  We have been seeking and will continue to seek a comprehensive solution to the remaining structural and funding issues in our banking sector, in conjunction with our European partners.  We will continue to participate in the development of the ESM and the structuring of the Single Supervisory Mechanism to ensure that Ireland will benefit, on similar terms to other member states, from developments in this regard.	</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-05-21a.30.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013052100057#WRB01500"><p>In 2011, I requested that the Central Bank examine ways to improve Ireland's payment infrastructure.  The Central Bank established a Steering Committee which prepared and submitted the National Payments Plan to me.  The membership of the Steering Group was to act as representatives for all sections in society, including marginalised and disadvantaged groups.<i></i> Government subsequently approved the plan in April 2013.    </p><p>  The National Payments Plan will target improving consumer payments systems, modernising business payments, promoting electronic payment methods, reducing costly cheque usage, increasing the efficiency of the use of cash and ensuring that Ireland meets its commitments under the Single European Payments Area Regulation.  The National Payments Plan outlines that if Ireland were to match best practice in Europe, savings of up to &euro;1 billion per annum could be made to the economy.  This would result in better value for the customer, lower back-office administration cost for Government, lower administration cost for business and lower operating costs for financial institutions. </p><p>  On the specific query that the Deputy has raised, the National Payments Plan has made a recommendation surrounding the use of one and two cent coins in Ireland.  There is evidence that one and two cent coins are not actively used by consumers.  It is expensive to continually mint and re-issue new coins.  The National Payments Plan does not envisage that one and two cent coins would be abandoned; they would remain legal tender. </p><p>  The Steering Committee intends to trial the use of a rounding convention in a pilot project in a mid-size Irish town.  The rounding convention is entirely voluntary on the part of both consumers and retailers.  This rounding convention operates successfully in other jursidictions inside and outside the EU e.g. the Netherlands, Finland, Australia and New Zealand.  The pilot is expected to run in August/September of 2013 and to finish by November 2013.  The report on the basis of the pilot project will be submitted to and reviewed by the Steering Committee, which will subsequently report to Government through my Department.  An appropriate Government decision informed by that report will follow.</p><p>  A change in the legal tender status of these coins requires action at EU level.  Consideration of this issue is currently ongoing at EU level.

One of these building blocks is an integrated financial framework or banking union which comprises three elements (a) an integrated system for the supervision of cross-border banks in the form of the single supervisor mechanism (&lsquo;SSM&rsquo;), (b) a recasting of the deposit insurance scheme directive (&lsquo;DGS&rsquo;) to further harmonise national DGSs, and (c) a European harmonised Bank Recovery &amp;amp; Resolution scheme commonly referred to as the BRRD.    Significantly the statement of the Euro area Summit clearly stated that when a single supervisory mechanism was in place for banks in the euro area the ESM could, following a regular decision, have the possibility to recapitalise banks directly. Furthermore to complete the Banking Union initiative the European Commission will this summer bring forward proposals for a Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM) to coordinate the application of resolution tools to banks. The European Council of December 2012 noted the Commission&rsquo;s intention to submit a proposal for an SRM for Member States participating in the SSM to be examined as a matter of urgency during the current parliamentary cycle of the EP i.e.,  before May 2014.</p><p>  The stated position of the Ecofin is that the building blocks for Banking Union should be put in place as soon as possible. This is a sensible approach and our work as Presidency is helping to advance Banking Union in as speedy a manner as possible. As we move into the final weeks of our Presidency we will continue to afford top priority to the legislative files relating to Banking Union in line with the conclusions of the European Council which set out a time frame and series of steps for achieving this.</p><p>  The Irish Presidency is giving absolute priority to all the files relating to the promotion of Banking Union in line with the ambitious agenda for Banking Union. We have achieved agreement on the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) - a very significant step forward towards ensuring financial stability and thus facilitating growth. </p><p>  We have also achieved agreement on the Capital Requirements Directive IV, which aims to strengthen the capital requirements for banks and the overall effectiveness of regulation for the sector and enhance financial stability.  </p><p>  We have made good progress towards agreement on the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive as the essential next step, with a view to agreement by June of this year, as envisaged by the European Council. Once this has been agreed, the European Commission is expected to submit a proposal for a single resolution authority, which will build on the work now underway. The remaining work on the DGS can commence once the financing elements of the BRRD have been agreed.</p><p>  An important complement to the Banking Union package is the development of an operational framework for the direct recapitalisation of banks by the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) which should include the definition of legacy assets. It is expected that the ESM guidelines on the Direct Banking Recapitalisation instrument will be completed by end June. 	</p></reply>

Revenue's overall approach to managing compliance is to undertake a range of targeted interventions that are most appropriate for dealing with the specific risks presented in individual cases. In 2012, Revenue carried out more than 537,000 compliance interventions, which yielded more than &euro;492 million.   I am advised also that Revenue continues to develop innovative ways of identifying non-compliance and bringing to account those who fail to comply with their tax obligations, including those who seek to evade their responsibilities through the use of offshore accounts and structures. They are assisted in this work by robust legislation to support compliance activities, including, for example, the recent obligation that has been placed on merchant acquirers and other payment settlement entities to make returns of transactions, principally credit card transactions, to Revenue. Their work is also supported and enhanced with appropriate technology, including their Risk Evaluation Analysis and Profiling (REAP) risk identification system and capture of data from multiple sources.</p><p>  Ireland has been to the forefront in acting against the use of offshore accounts for the purposes of evading tax. Revenue set up a dedicated unit, tasked with identifying and investigating Irish residents engaged in this form of tax evasion, in 2001. Further investigations targeting the settlement of funds and assets on trusts and similar offshore structures were initiated in 2009. Schemes of voluntary disclosure and investigations undertaken have, to date, resulted in collection of &euro;1.1 billion in tax liabilities, statutory interest payments and penalties, of which almost &euro;19 million was collected in 2012.  These investigations are ongoing and most recently have<font color="#2F2F2F"> led to the uncovering of two types of cash extraction schemes with total tax at risk of &euro;198.5 million. </font>  Recent developments have also included analysing details of payments made in Ireland using foreign credit cards. Revenue will continue to act in a very determined way to deal with tax evasion in all its forms.</p><p>  Ireland is also committed to working closely with other countries to combat offshore tax evasion. 69 bilateral Double Taxation Agreements and 21 Tax Information Exchange Agreements are in place which ensure a system of full exchange of tax information. In addition, in December 2012, Ireland became one of the first countries in the world to sign an <i>Agreement with the United States of America to Improve International Tax Compliance</i><i>and to Implement FATCA</i>   (that is, the United States Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act).  This type of agreement is now being hailed as the emerging international standard for the automatic exchange of tax information. Revenue also participates in the OECD Forum for Tax Administration's Offshore Compliance Network, which is a forum for the countries concerned to share information and experiences on practical issues relating to the fight against offshore evasion.</p><p>  Combating tax fraud and evasion has also been a priority during our Presidency of the EU and work has been taken forward in a number of key areas. Following a very productive discussion on the issue at the informal ECOFIN meeting in April, Commissioner Semeta and I issued a joint letter to ECOFIN Ministers inviting them to agree a range of measures to tackle tax fraud and evasion. Significant progress was made in this regard at the ECOFIN meeting on 14 May, at which agreement was reached on a mandate for negotiating amendments to the Savings Tax Agreements with Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Andorra and San Marino to ensure equivalence of measures with the EU. Also at the ECOFIN meeting on 14 May, Ministers adopted Council Conclusions strongly welcoming the European Commission's Action Plan on tackling tax fraud, evasion and aggressive tax planning, and reaffirming their commitment to collective action in this area working in close cooperation with the OECD and the G20. The issue of tax fraud and evasion is an important agenda item at the European Council meeting on 22 May and it is intended to return to the matter at the ECOFIN meeting in June.  </p><p>  Finally, I am advised by Revenue that they have published detailed guidance in relation to employer withholding tax obligations for international employees working in the State which  clarifies a number of anti-avoidance measures introduced in the Finance Act 2006 to combat non-compliance with employer statutory requirements.  </p></reply>

An unsustainable debt position has been reached by many borrowers, which needs to be addressed for the benefit of both borrowers and lenders alike.  I have been informed by the Central Bank that this initiative is being implemented to establish, on a test basis, an approach to deal with both secured and unsecured debt in a sample of approximately 750 cases where borrowers have debts with multiple lenders. The Central Bank envisage that the participants in the pilot framework will be the main retail lending banks and the credit unions that have agreed to participate, as well as certain other unsecured lenders. This pilot framework contains a restructuring waterfall that will be applied to each borrower that agrees to participate, in order to establish the most appropriate modification to put him or her on an affordable repayment path. The pilot framework is expected to commence in June and will operate for a period of three months, after which the results will be assessed to establish the effectiveness of the framework and to determine the appropriate next steps.    </p><p>  The Central Bank are actively encouraging the involvement of all lenders in the process to ensure maximum effectiveness of this learning and information gathering pilot stage, and are encouraged to have a number of lenders engaged to date. The Central Bank have written to all credit unions individually to invite them to participate in the pilot framework and are confident that the pilot framework will offer outcomes which support borrowers and will allow the Central Bank to test and learn from this approach.</p><p>  It must be borne in mind that a key issue in a decision to opt out by some lenders is that borrowers from these institutions cannot be part of the pilot framework to restructure their debt. For example, if a distressed borrower has multiple debts and one of their lenders is not involved in the pilot scheme then they cannot be part of the pilot scheme and cannot avail of the benefits.  </p><p>  I am aware of the concerns expressed by the Irish League of Credit Unions regarding the Central Bank initiative and its view that the arrangements under the Personal Insolvency Act should be applied to the resolution of multiple debts owed by distressed borrowers, including credit union members.  While that regime is indeed available, the Central Bank pilot scheme will offer the opportunity for distressed borrowers - including credit union members - to resolve their debts without the need to enter into the formal statutory process.  In this respect, it is important that credit union members are not left with a more limited range of options than are available to customers of other financial institutions.  It is in this spirit that the Central Bank has written to all credit unions to make them aware of the pilot so that the credit unions can decide whether their participation is in the interests of their members, including members with distressed debts across multiple lenders.  </p><p>  Credit unions have been invited by the Central Bank to nationwide information seminars on the pilot scheme to discuss its objectives and approach.  The Irish League of Credit Unions has been invited to attend at these sessions and provide input into the content of them.  Notwithstanding their official stance on the pilot programme, the Irish League of Credit Unions has played a constructive role in working with the Central Bank and other lenders to address this difficult issue and credit unions continue to have an important role to play in supporting distressed borrowers in resolving their problems. </p></reply>

While the framework was an initiative of the Central Bank, the Central Bank informed the Mortgage Arrears Steering Group of the progress on its discussions with lenders on the Central Bank&rsquo;s intention to introduce such a scheme.</p><p>  Many distressed borrowers have multiple debts with different lenders and have to deal with each lender on each debt.  The Central Bank has advised that this framework can help those borrowers because the lenders are agreeing to a coordinated approach for resolution of all of the borrowers&rsquo; debts.   In addition, many distressed borrowers are not insolvent and therefore will not be eligible for an arrangement under the personal insolvency regime, but do need to have an appropriate solution in place to deal with their debts.  This framework aims to test the feasibility and costs of implementing such solutions for borrowers.  The framework also has the potential to reduce the costs and time it will take lenders operating on an individual basis to deal with distressed borrowers, while also potentially resulting in only the more challenged cases proceeding to the new established personal insolvency regime. The Central Bank has also advised that there is no legislative basis by which unsecured creditors can be forced to accept write-downs in outstanding debt under the Central Bank&rsquo;s voluntary framework. Nevertheless, as a result of the Central Bank&rsquo;s initiative, a number of secured and unsecured lenders have agreed a burden sharing framework and will now, with the Central Bank&rsquo;s oversight, participate in the development and operation of this Framework on a test or pilot basis.</p><p>  The Central Bank is actively encouraging the involvement of all lenders in the process to ensure maximum effectiveness of this learning and information gathering pilot stage, and it is encouraged that a number of lenders have agreed to become engaged. The Central Bank advises that it has written to all credit unions individually to invite them to participate in the pilot framework and it is confident that the pilot framework will offer outcomes which support borrowers and will also allow the Central Bank to test and learn from this approach.</p><p>It must be borne in mind that a key issue in a decision to opt out by some lenders is that borrowers from these institutions cannot be part of the pilot framework to restructure their debt. For example, if a distressed borrower has multiple debts and one of their lenders is not involved in the pilot scheme,   then such borrowers cannot be part of the pilot scheme and cannot avail of the benefits that can accrue from the operation of the framework.</p><p>  All existing protections afforded by the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code and Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA)  will continue to apply to participating borrowers.   The framework will not include borrowers with buy-to-let or business related debts.   It is envisaged that the Pilot will start in June and run for approximately 3 months after which the results will be assessed to establish the effectiveness of the framework and to determine the appropriate next steps.  </p><p>  The recent Central Bank initiatives in the mortgage arrears area, in particular the Mortgage Arrears targets initiative announced last March and the more recent framework pilot on the development of a coordinated, holistic and voluntary approach by secured and unsecured lenders, is consistent with the overall whole of Government approach to deal with the mortgage arrears problem.  In particular, the Government, while significantly modernising Ireland&rsquo;s bankruptcy and insolvency law and procedures, has also advocated and encouraged borrowers and lenders to address situations of debt difficulty, where possible, on a bilateral and informal basis, and the recent Central Bank initiatives should underpin that process.</p><p>  Recent announcements by Government such as the launch of the Insolvency Service of Ireland (ISI) are important steps in the overall framework to deal with mortgage arrears.  Borrowers seeking specific information on support available can contact the ISI&rsquo;s helpline for information on insolvency matters or can seek advice from the general mortgage arrears information service for general mortgage arrears queries.</p></reply>

I am informed by Revenue that LPT is a self-assessed tax so in the first instance it is a matter for the property owner to calculate the tax due based on his or her assessment of the market value of the property.  The Commissioners have also comprehensively explained the purpose of the Revenue Estimate and advised property owners that the Revenue Estimate may be used as the self-assessed valuation band, only where the property owner is satisfied that it fairly reflects their own valuation for their property.  For the purposes of LPT, values for properties under &euro;1 million are organised into valuation bands, with a range of &euro;50,000 in each band.  As property owners will not be required to provide a precise value for their property, it is anticipated that for the most part overpayments of LPT should not happen.  </p><p>  The initial valuation of a property on 1 May 2013, assuming it is made in good faith, is valid up to and including 2016 and will not be affected by any increase or decrease in property prices or other changes, during this period.  This will ensure a measure of certainty for all property owners.  Accordingly, where an owner assesses that the value of a residential property on 1 May 2013 places it in a particular valuation band but, due to a general decrease in property prices after that date the reduction in the value of the property would place it in a lower valuation band, the owner will not be entitled to a refund of tax.  By the same token, if the property increases in value in that period, no additional charges will apply. The owner will, however, have the opportunity to re-assess the value of the property on the next valuation date, which is 1 November 2016. </p><p>  Notwithstanding the above, I am advised by Revenue that Section 26 of the 2012 Act (as amended) provides for the possibility of a refund where an overpayment of LPT was made due to an error or mistake on a Return or a statement made by the liable person, subject to certain conditions being satisfied.  This might arise, for example, where a liable person had paid their LPT charge but they subsequently discovered that their property was exempt from the charge.  In the context of Section 26 where an error or mistake is proven, I am advised that once a true and complete Return has been prepared and delivered to Revenue and all the information required to make a determination on the case has been provided, a refund may issue where a claim for repayment is submitted within the normal four year time limit. </p><p>  The Revenue Commissioners have advised me that they will issue detailed guidelines later in the year setting out the procedures to be followed by those who consider that they have either over or under valued their property for LPT purposes.</p></reply>

The Commissioners have confirmed that in excess of 948,522 LPT Returns have been filed up to close of business on 20th May 2013.  This represents 57% of the total Returns issued.  Of the Returns received, 657,157 w<b>e</b>  re filed electronically and 291,365 were paper Returns.  </p><p>  With the 28 May on-line filing deadline approaching, I take this opportunity to outline the options available to residential property owners. Depending on the owner's requirements, one of the following options will address their particular needs.  Property owners can login to LPT on-line at www.revenue.ie themselves using their PIN and the Property ID that was provided to them as part of the general issue of LPT Returns earlier this year.  For property owners for whom e-filing is not practical, I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the legislation provides that another person may file an LPT Return on-line on their behalf.  Alternatively, they can visit their local Revenue office where computers and assistance to file on-line will be available.  Owners may also contact the LPT helpline on 1890 200 255 (mobile phone users can contact the helpline on 01 702 3049) to file a Return on-line.  To avail of this option, the caller needs their property details, PPSN and details of the bank account or other source from which they wish the payment to be deducted.  </p><p>  I have indicated to the House on a number of occasions, most recently in my reply to Questions 20686 and 20652 (numbers 92 and 87 of 1 May),  that owners who have not received a return from Revenue must still self-assess the amount of LPT due, complete and file their LPT Return and pay the tax due.  They should contact the LPT helpline on 1890 200 255 or they can login to LPT on-line and file a return by clicking on the &quot;I have not received a Property PIN&quot; tab.  </p><p>I am also advised that the LPT helpline, and Revenue's offices, have been operating extended opening hours this week and will do so until Tuesday 28 May.  Details of the extended hours are available from the Revenue website <i><font color="#0000FF">www.revenue.ie</font></i>  .</p><p>  Given the range of options that have been made available by Revenue to assist people experiencing any type of difficulty in meeting their LPT obligations and, the fact that owners of residential properties have already filed in excess of 948,522 Returns, I am very satisfied with the current arrangements that Revenue has in place and with the rate of filing. </p></reply>

All of the revocations were at the request of the bank concerned and the rationale for the revocation was a commercial decision for each of the banks involved. The Deputy may be aware that this subject was raised in the House last week and the details of these bank closures can be found in PQ Ref: 22277/13.   Since the onset of the financial crisis, Ireland in conjunction with its European partners has sought to improve supervision and regulation of the financial services sector. This is necessary to ensure a solid basis for the operation of the financial services sector in future and to ensure that the banking sector contributes to growth in the real economy. Regulation of banks in Ireland has intensified since the crisis, in line with evolving practice worldwide. The Central Bank attaches priority to its statutory responsibility to ensure the proper and effective regulation of financial service providers and markets, but is careful to avoid placing an undue burden on regulated firms.</p></reply>

This is also conditional on continued successful programme implementation being confirmed by the Troika together with completion of the 9th review of the Irish adjustment programme and of the 7th review of the Portuguese programme. The 9th review of Ireland&rsquo;s programme has now completed all approval stages by both the IMF and the EU.    The principal benefits of the maturities extension will be the smoothing of our debt redemption profile, the consequent improvement in our ability to fund ourselves in the financial markets and the beneficial impact on our debt sustainability. It is not a measure intended to directly improve our deficit. Accordingly the extension of maturities will not have any impact on Budget 2014.</p><p>  Any cash savings that may arise would only build up gradually over the full lifetime of the extended maturities. </p><p>  As to its impact on the duration of post programme surveillance, I have already explained, in response to a Parliamentary Question on 21 March 2013 (PQ No 59), that until the details of the implementation of the maturity extension are known, it will not be possible to assess the impact, if any, of such changes on the duration of the post-programme surveillance arrangements.    </p><p>  Formal approval by Ministers for the extension of our EFSF and EFSM loans is now expected to be provided next month, after which the details of its implementation can be finalised. </p></reply>

The initial Pilot evaluation suggests that the lower than expected take-up of the SBA was due the lack of a &lsquo;trigger event&rsquo; amongst the target cohort in the pilot locations, such as a requirement to have an income or benefit payment made to a bank account.</p><p>  The Strategy for Financial Inclusion in Ireland noted that the post office network has the potential to play a key role in the delivery of basic payment accounts.  It is a generally accepted view that many of the financially excluded trust the post office network.  It is also clear that many of the financially excluded make use of An Post&rsquo;s services already and that many of them use An Post branches for the receipt of social welfare payments and benefits. When the Pilot commenced An Post could not on its own offer transactional banking services to its customers as it required arrangements with banking providers to do so. However, we did secure a limited offering of the Standard Bank Account through post offices in the New Ross area from November 2012.</p><p>  I am advised that the report of the FIWG on the Pilot will be submitted for my consideration in a few weeks, following which I expect that the Report will be presented to Government and published.</p><p>  I understand that one of the initial conclusions from the Pilot is that the involvement of the post office network will be one of the key requirements for successful national roll-out of the Standard Bank Account. My Department through the Financial Inclusion Working Group will work closely with all potential providers including An Post over the coming months to optimise the availability of the Standard Bank Account nationally.</p></reply>

I am advised by NAMA that, in any case where there is any concern that there may have been a possible data breach, the matter is investigated in compliance with the Data Protection Commissioner&rsquo;s Personal Data Security Breach Code of Practice and, where required by the Code, notified to the Data Protection Commissioner. Matters referred to the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner are dealt with by that Office in accordance with its statutory remit.</p><p>  I am assured by NAMA that it regards any data breach with the utmost seriousness and that it assiduously implements any actions required by the Commissioner&rsquo;s Code of Practice, or recommended to it by the Commissioner in response to breach notifications, to safeguard against possible future breaches. NAMA&rsquo;s primary concern is to meet its obligations under the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003 to process personal data in compliance with those Acts, including taking appropriate measures to protect the security of such data.  As there is a well-established statutory framework in place to deal with unauthorised data disclosures, I consider that such disclosures are best managed by the Commissioner and by NAMA within that framework.</p></reply>

It can include Money Market Funds or other &ldquo;deposit taking&rdquo; investment products, Special Purpose Vehicles which perform liquidity or maturity transformation, Exchange Traded Funds and other funds which provide credit, firms which provide credit guarantees, insurance/reinsurance firms which issue or insure credit.  Shadow banking typically has the following characteristics maturity or liquidity transformation across the balance sheet, where the sources of funding are of shorter maturity or the assets are inherently illiquid; credit creation funded by leverage, which boosts certain measures of the money supply.</p><p>  Shadow Banking, if well regulated, can perform important functions in the financial system and parts of the Shadow Banking system can contribute positively to the flow of credit and liquidity and help to promote economic growth. Regulatory proposals on Shadow Banking seek to appropriately reflect a balance between the need for better risk management and enhanced transparency and stronger financial stability, and the need for increased and more diversified financing to the economy.</p><p>  I have been advised by the Central Bank that the reported comparison is not appropriate as the assets and liabilities are primarily held in off-shore sub-custody networks managed by custodians. Interruption and/or failure of a shadow banking entity would not necessarily directly impact Ireland. Shadow banking entities do not benefit from access to the Irish deposit protection scheme nor do they have access to Central Bank liquidity.</p><p>  On the other hand, shadow banking activities make use of various services located in Ireland such as legal advice, tax advice, accountancy advice, asset servicing, subscriptions and redemptions, valuations and listing.  Most of these are high value added activities to the Irish economy through income tax receipts.  The Commission will in summer 2013, as a follow up to their Green Paper of March 2012, and the international work coordinated by the Financial Stability Board, address the systemic problems related to shadow banking. My Department is awaiting the publication of the Commission&rsquo;s proposals and will engage fully with efforts to improve regulation of shadow banking.</p></reply>

I have no statutory role in relation to regulated financial institutions passing on the European Central Bank interest rate change.  It is a commercial matter for each institution concerned.  Neither have I responsibility for the interest rate paid to depositors by the financial instructions.</p><p>The Central Bank has responsibility for the regulation and supervision of financial institutions in terms of consumer protection and prudential requirements and for ensuring ongoing compliance with applicable statutory obligations.  The Central Bank has, however,  no statutory role in the setting of interest rates by financial institutions, apart from the interest rate cap imposed on the credit union sector in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Union Act, 1997. </p><p>  The mortgage interest rates that financial institutions operating in Ireland charge to customers are determined as a result of a commercial decision by the institutions concerned.  This interest rate is determined taking into account a broad range of factors, including European Central Bank base rates, deposit rates, market funding costs, the competitive environment and an institution&rsquo;s overall funding arrangements. </p><p>  I would remind the Deputy that in late 2011 the Taoiseach asked for the Central Bank&rsquo;s opinion on developments regarding mortgage interest rates and on possible action by the Central Bank in that regard.  In a letter to the Taoiseach dated 11 November 2011, the Deputy Governor of the Central Bank stated that the Central Bank would not be seeking the power to have regulatory control over the setting of retail interest rates. He indicated that experience of such controls in the past, and in other countries, did not encourage the Central Bank to believe that such a regime would be advantageous in net terms as the banking system recovers its normal functioning. Binding controls tend to reduce the availability of credit and channel it to the most creditworthy customers, starving smaller and less secure customers from credit. Binding controls would have a chilling effect on the entry of sound competitors in the market. By absolving banks from their responsibility to price risk accurately, binding interest rate controls would, especially during the recovery phase, impede progress towards the re-establishment of bank management practices that can ensure a healthy and free-standing banking system no longer dependent on the Government for bail-outs. The Deputy Governor mentioned also that, within its existing powers, and through the use of persuasion, the Central Bank would continue to engage with specific lenders which appear to have standard variable rates set disproportionate to their cost of funds and this is a course of action I expect the Central Bank to continually appraise. </p><p>  On specific economic assessments of changes to interest rates, I would refer the Deputy to the recent Stability Programme Update 2013 which published analysis done by the ERSI using their HERMES model of the effect of a 1% change in interest rates on key macroeconomic variables on the economy.  The simulations show the impact that a 1 percentage point increase in the rate in the first year for the following four years beginning in 2013 could reduce GDP by up to 1.7 per cent by 2016 and would add 1 percentage point to the deficit as a percentage of GDP by 2016. While the simulated effect is broadly symmetric, the proximity of policy rates to the zero lower bound means the potential magnitude of the effect could be larger for a rate increase compared to a rate decrease.</p></reply>

This represents a very substantial contribution by NAMA in the context of the limited number of available residential properties in Ireland controlled by its debtors and receivers and the range of policy measures being adopted by this Government to meet demand for social housing provision.  The onus for determining the suitability for social housing of the properties identified by NAMA rests, in the first instance, with the local authorities, which assess, in conjunction with the Housing Agency, the demand for identified houses and apartments by reference to a number of criteria.  As soon as local authorities have confirmed demand for units, the Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) are asked to confirm their interest and to take the practical steps necessary to complete the lease or purchase of the properties.</p><p>  I am advised that to date demand has been confirmed by the local authorities for 1,574 of the properties that NAMA has made available. Another 502 properties are being evaluated bringing the overall total that may ultimately be deemed suitable to 2,076.  The local authorities have confirmed that there is no demand in respect 1,226 of the properties.  I am advised by NAMA that, in the time required to assess and confirm demand for units, 806 properties were sold or privately let by their owners or duly appointed receivers. </p><p>  Of the properties for which demand has been confirmed, 294 properties have been delivered for social housing to date, with contract terms signed in respect of a further 73 properties. This brings the overall total of residential properties completed and committed to social housing to 367 properties, across 19 developments in ten counties.  A further 334 are at an advanced stage of negotiation between NAMA debtors or receivers and various AHBs. </p><p>  I am advised by NAMA that once demand has been confirmed for properties and contracts signed there is no impediment to the early delivery of properties by its debtors and receivers. However, issues such Multi-Unit Development compliance, planning compliance, site resolution and outstanding completion works often need to be addressed before the properties are ready for occupation.  NAMA, through its debtors and receivers, is working to resolve these issues as a matter of priority on the identified developments. </p><p>  I am further advised by NAMA that it established the Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV), National Asset Residential Property Services Limited, for the purpose of acquiring properties from its debtors and receivers in order to speed up their direct leasing to housing authorities.  I understand that the Irish Council for Social Housing (ICSH) has recently agreed to the lease template put forward some time ago by NAMA and I expect that this will expedite the early delivery of properties.</p><p>  NAMA is working closely with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Minister of State for Housing and Planning in relation to this very important initiative and all parties are committed to the maximum possible delivery of residential units in 2013.  The Deputy will appreciate that the housing authorities have a key role in this regard and the Housing Agency is working very closely with these bodies to facilitate delivery of units.

Paragraph 10 of Section 14 provides that relevant employers must submit an annual return to the Revenue Commissioners detailing, inter alia, the number of employees and the amounts of exempt income claimed under the programme. As 2012 was the first year of the programme, this return was not sought until after the end of the tax year 2012 in order to ensure that an accurate picture as possible of take up levels over a full tax year could be provided. </p><p>  At the time of its introduction, it was estimated that for every 100 assignees that avail of the programme up to the maximum level of relief, the tax cost would be just over &euro;5 million. Employer returns received to date for 2012 indicate that there were 6 individuals who qualified for the relief with 2 of them receiving an aggregate total tax-free remuneration of &euro;39,767. Job increases were reported as numbering 26 with 2 jobs also reported as retained because of the relief. It is expected that the 4 individuals who are not reported in the employer returns as receiving tax-free remuneration are expected to claim it when they submit Form 11 tax returns for 2012 in late 2013.</p><p>  It is possible that not all employers have submitted a SARP return yet. Also, the figures provided do not include the details for claims that are not included in employer returns received to date but will be made in the Form 11 tax returns for 2012 to be filed under the self-assessment system in October/November of 2013.</p><p>The scheme was introduced for an initial three-year period ending on 31 December 2014, at which point it will be reviewed. At that stage we should have additional information regarding the number of individuals availing of the exemption, the sectors of industry that the individuals are employed in, the cost of the programme and the number of jobs created or retained as a result of the relief. All of this information will feed into the review. Depending on the outcome of that review, I will decide whether the relief should be retained.</p><p>  It is worth nothing that the existence of similar incentives in other European countries such as the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland would indicate that such incentives can be a persuading factor when companies decide where to locate investment projects. In tandem with our corporation tax rate, this relief will help us to compete for Foreign Direct Investment.</p></reply>

On  12 March 2012 I wrote to Mr Diarmuid O&rsquo;Flynn, a member of the group referred to by the Deputy. In that letter I made the following points to Mr O&rsquo;Flynn: </p><p>1. Reputation, reliability and commitment were essential elements to regaining our financial independence and that reneging on senior debt would not enhance the Irish position and may put contagion pressures on Eurozone countries.  </p><p>2.  If we were to postpone or suspend payment to creditors in IBRC this would have a significant impact on both the Bank and ultimately the State in that it could lead to the Bank becoming insolvent with an increase in the cost to the state to resolve IBRC and the financial market&rsquo;s view of Ireland as a place to do business or invest would be seriously undermined.  </p><p>3. The value of support we receive from our European Partners far outweighs any short term gain from imposing burden sharing on the bonds in question in the face of European opposition to such a move.</p><p>  However as I have said in my letter to Mr O&rsquo;Flynn  I was  eager to have Promissory notes examined to see if they could  be re-engineered in a better way for the State.  The promissory notes were replaced with a portfolio of Government bonds in February 2013. This may not have been possible had I followed the recommendations set out by the Group referred to by the Deputy in his question. The provision of a longer term non-amortising (up to 40 Years) portfolio of Government bonds to replace the amortising Promissory Notes which occurred in February 2013 will have benefits from a market perspective as it ensures the liability to repay is beyond most credit investors&rsquo; time horizon. This transaction was noted by the ECB.</p></reply>

The Central Bank established a Steering Committee which prepared and submitted the National Payments Plan to me.  Government subsequently approved the plan in April 2013. The National Payments Plan will target improving consumer payments systems and increasing the efficiency of the use of cash amongst other things. The National Payments Plan could result in savings of up to &euro;1 billion per annum in the economy.  The National Payments Plan makes a recommendation surrounding the use of one and two cent coins in Ireland. There is evidence that one and two cent coins are not actively used by consumers. It is expensive to continually mint and re-issue new coins. The National Payments Plan does not envisage abandoning these coins; they would remain legal tender. </p><p>  The Steering Committee intends to trial the use of a rounding convention in a pilot project. The rounding convention that will be trialled in the pilot is entirely voluntary on the part of both consumers and retailers. The location for the pilot project has not yet been identified. I am advised that it will be chosen on the basis of objective criteria i.e. of sufficient size and representative of Ireland&rsquo;s population. The pilot is expected to run in August/September of 2013 and to finish by November 2013. A report on the basis of the pilot project will be submitted to and reviewed by the Steering Committee, which will subsequently report to Government through my Department. A Government decision informed by that report will follow.</p><p>  A change in the legal tender status of these coins requires action at EU level. Consideration of this issue is currently ongoing at EU level. On 14 May the Commission issued a communication to the European Parliament and Council relating to the continued issuance of the one and two cent coins.</p></reply>

While the Central Bank is not mandating any particular model of restructuring and while sustainable solutions will be arrived at on a case-by-case basis, there are some fundamental principles that must be respected, as follows:</p><p>  The affordability assessment of the borrower needs to be based on both their current and prospective future servicing capacity for all borrowings; assumed prospective future increases in the debt servicing ability of the borrower must be credible and conservative.  The Central Bank has informed me that it will assess compliance with these principles in its supervisory audit of compliance with the targets, including through analysis of a sample of modifications.</p></reply>

The Government&rsquo;s focus is now firmly fixed on exiting from the programme.  It is the Government&rsquo;s intention to achieve a successful and durable exit from our programme and we are doing all we can to this end. We continue to meet our programme conditions and our strong implementation record has been recognized by our external partners. The recent highly successful sale of long term bonds by NTMA is another very significant step towards regaining full market access.</p><p>  The options available to Ireland on exiting the programme fall into two broad categories. A successful exit without any further support or a successful exit supported by the ESM&rsquo;s and the  IMF&rsquo;s precautionary backstop facilities. By way of information, the precautionary financial assistance which the IMF and the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) can provide is as follows:</p><p>- The ESM Treaty provides, in Article 14, that the Board of Governors may decide to grant precautionary financial assistance in the form of a precautionary conditioned credit line (PCCL) or in the form of an enhanced conditions credit line (ECCL).  The Treaty also provides for the conditionality, terms and conditions to be attached to such assistance. Further information in relation to these instruments is available on the ESM website at http://www.esm.europa.eu/.</p><p>- The IMF has a number of precautionary or standby type facilities including Flexible Credit Line (FCL), the Precautionary and Liquidity Line (PLL), the Extended Funding Facility (EFF) and the Stand By Arrangement (SBA). These different instruments are designed to address different sets of circumstances, and the terms and conditions attaching to them are structured accordingly. Further information on these instruments is available on the IMF website at http://www.imf.org/. </p><p>  All relevant options will be considered in the light of what will be appropriate for Ireland at the time of our exit. The issue of our exit options has yet to be fully considered by Government and accordingly no decisions have been taken to date.</p><p>  In relation to the ECB&rsquo;s Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT), the Governing Council of the ECB made a decision to establish OMTs on 2nd August 2012, and issued a press statement on 6th September 2012 which outlined its technical features. According to this ECB Press Release, the purpose of OMT is: &ldquo;Safeguarding an appropriate monetary policy transmission and the singleness of the monetary policy&rdquo;. The ECB press statement also notes that the ECB&rsquo;s Governing Council will decide on the start, continuation and suspension of OMT, following a thorough assessment, in full discretion and acting in accordance with its monetary policy mandate.  It is therefore clear that the decision on whether to grant OMT or otherwise in any particular case is a matter for the ECB, which is an independent body.</p></reply>

In addition, they defraud customers who unknowingly buy them, and can pose health and safety risks.  The Revenue Commissioners are responsible for acting against the importation of counterfeit goods into the State from outside the EU.  I am advised that Revenue made a total of 5,580 seizures of such goods, with a value of &euro;5,437,334, during 2012.  In the first quarter of 2013 there were 1,540 seizures with a value of &euro;819,684.  The range of goods seized is extensive and includes body care items, clothing and accessories, mobile phones and other electronic equipment, CDs, DVDs and toys.  </p><p>  Action against counterfeit goods that are in free circulation within the EU is the responsibility of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I am advised that Revenue and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na work closely together, and share intelligence on an ongoing basis, in tackling the overall problem of counterfeit goods. There is close cooperation also at international level, including, for example, participation by Ireland in international operations coordinated by the World Customs Organisation. </p><p>  The active cooperation of intellectual property rights holders is also essential in dealing with this problem, and they can provide valuable assistance to the work of the enforcement authorities through practical steps such as responding quickly to requests for confirmation of the status of suspected counterfeit goods. </p><p>  The penalties for illegal importation of counterfeit goods are set down in section 186 of the Customs Consolidation Act 1876. On summary conviction, a fine of &euro;5,000 or a term of imprisonment not exceeding 12 months, or both, can be imposed. On conviction on indictment, a fine of &euro;126,790 or, in the case of goods with a value exceeding &euro;250,000, a fine of three times the value of the goods (including duty and tax), or a term of imprisonment up to 5 years, or both a fine and imprisonment, may be imposed. There are no proposals at present to increase these penalties, but the position will be kept under review. </p><p>  I recognise the value of raising the awareness of consumers of the negative impact of the trade in counterfeit goods, and the potential safety risks involved, and believe that the holders of intellectual property rights have a key role to play in conveying this message to consumers. I understand that Revenue works with other stakeholders, where possible, to highlight the problems associated with such goods and will continue to avail of all opportunities that arise to raise the public&rsquo;s awareness regarding counterfeit goods.	</p></reply>

The future development of Irish REITs will depend very much on market response to the product, so it is not possible to state the number, if any, of REITs which will be introduced by the end of 2013.  REITs by their nature are large collective investment vehicles which take time to form &ndash; the time frame for large property transactions is calculated in months rather than weeks, and the public listing of a company is also a significant undertaking.</p><p>  I have however received feedback from a number of sources indicating that interest is being expressed in the Irish REIT framework.</p></reply>

However I understand the Central Bank has entered into a contract with HP to provide the physical data centre environment to host its IT systems, manage the technical infrastructure aspects of these systems and provide hosting facilities at a backup data centre for the purposes of business continuity and replacing existing facilities which are at &lsquo;end of life&rsquo;.  HP will not have access to any of the banks business applications. The security of the technical aspects of the systems will be achieved through a combination of physical and logical protections, procedural and process protections, security features including encryption where necessary and on-going monitoring and reporting features. The steps taken comply with the Central Bank&rsquo;s internal security policies and those of the ECB and are underpinned by the contractual and legal arrangements with HP.</p><p>  The new data centre environment will negate the requirement for the Central Bank to build two new data centre facilities and there will be no &lsquo;outsourcing&rsquo; of Central Bank staff arising from the contract with HP.  HP was engaged following a competitive tender process, which included assessment across a number of criteria including security and cost. The process was approved by the Central Bank Commission. </p><p>  I am informed by the Central Bank that some other Central Banks have engaged external specialist private companies to provide elements of the services similar to those which will be provided under this contract.  It is to be expected that other Central Banks will evaluate external data centre options when they come to an &lsquo;end of life&rsquo; scenario with their existing facilities.</p><p>  In relation to security arrangements, the Central Bank is not in a position to disclose or discuss the details of its security model or operations. However, security operations are reviewed regularly to ensure they operate to current best practices and in the most effective and efficient manner.</p></reply>

The mission is the first stage in the review process which concludes with consideration and approval by the IMF and the EU.  I have regular meetings with EU Finance Ministers on numerous issues including the programme. During recent meetings, I have emphasised that the Government&rsquo;s focus is now firmly on our exit strategy from the Programme, our re-entry into the financial markets and improving our debt sustainability.  I also emphasised that it is Ireland&rsquo;s intention to achieve a successful exit from our programme and we are doing all we can to this end. My EU Finance Minister Colleagues are broadly supportive of our effort and recognise our strong implementation performance.

Regulation of derivatives has been part of the Councils discussions since September 2010, when the Commission published its proposal for the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) to regulate this market in the context of over-the-counter (OTC) trades.  The G20 agreed at the 2009 Pittsburgh summit on the need to improve the transparency and oversight of less regulated markets &ndash; including derivatives markets - and to address the issue of excessive price volatility in commodity derivatives markets. In response to this, in October 2011 the European Commission published a revised MiFID proposal (&lsquo;MiFID II)&rsquo;.</p><p>  MiFID II is a much broader and a more ambitious package that deals with both OTC derivatives and exchange traded derivatives. </p><p>  MiFID II consists of a Directive (MiFID) and a Regulation (MiFIR). The objective of MiFID II is to address some of the policy and regulatory issues that have emerged since MiFID I came into force in 2004. It aims to make financial markets more efficient, resilient and transparent, strengthen the protection of investors, mitigate systemic risk and protect against market abuse.  The new framework will also increase the supervisory powers of regulators and provide clear operating rules for all trading activities.</p><p>  EMIR and MiFID II are expected to result in a tighter regime for all derivatives, including food commodities, whether traded OTC or through exchanges. The measures are intended to keep pace with trends in derivatives trading, and in line with G20 commitments.</p><p>  The Irish Presidency has prioritised this dossier and has continued the Council Working Party negotiations (at Attach&eacute; level) in an effort to secure a Council General Approach in order to begin negotiations with the European Parliament via trilogues. </p><p>  The Central Bank of Ireland is the competent authority in this country for the purposes of derivatives legislation.</p></reply>

The proposed Directive was endorsed by the Council through the EU Member States' ambassadors at the<b><i></i></b>meeting of the Permanent Representatives' Committee in Brussels on 8th May.  Before its formal adoption it has to be voted on at Plenary by the European Parliament.  The new rules will strengthen the rights of future mortgage holders across the EU.  They do not apply to existing mortgage credit agreements. Some of the provisions of the proposed Directive are as follows:</p><p>- Improved pre-contractual information to consumers including a new European Standardised Information Sheet (ESIS) making it easier for people to compare mortgages;</p><p>- New rules for advertising mortgages to include, for example, clearer information on the annual percentage rate;</p><p>- Improved credit-worthiness assessments - tougher rules for credit assessment of people applying for mortgages;</p><p>- Intermediaries should have authorisation from the relevant supervisory authority;</p><p>- New competence requirements for mortgage lenders;</p><p>- Improved knowledge and competence requirements for staff of banks and credit intermediaries providing mortgages;</p><p>- Increased choice for consumers by allowing credit intermediaries to operate cross borders;</p><p>- Consumers will also benefit from a guaranteed period of time before being bound by an agreement for a mortgage (through a period of reflection, a right of withdrawal, or both);</p><p>- Where property valuations are conducted they will need to respect principles in line with the Financial Stability Board;</p><p>- Consumers will be granted a general right to repay their loans early. </p><p>  The proposed Directive also allows for high level principles in relation to financial education for consumers and in relation to arrears and foreclosure.  It imposes a requirement to adopt measures to encourage creditors to exercise reasonable forbearance before foreclosure proceedings are initiated.  The new rules, set out in this proposed Directive, will also help improve comparability of mortgage products, greater transparency in the provision of mortgage material across Europe and should help the development of a cross-border mortgage market.</p><p>  With regard to accountability, Member States will be required to designate the national competent authorities empowered to ensure the application and enforcement of this proposed Directive and will be required to ensure that they are granted investigating and enforcement powers and adequate resources necessary for the efficient and effective performance of their duties.</p><p>  Member States will also be required to ensure that the authorities designated as competent for ensuring the application and enforcement of specific articles of this proposed Directive are competent authorities included in Article 4(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 establishing a European Supervisory Authority (European Banking Authority) i.e. EBA members, and where they are non-EBA members, Member States will be required to ensure they cooperate with the European Banking Authority as required under the proposed Directive in relation to the specific articles in question.</p><p>  Finally, the agreement on this proposed Directive marks the achievement of another key Presidency goal, contributing to consumer protection and strengthening Europe's mortgage system.</p></reply>

I feel it is important to highlight to the Deputy that at present the Scottish Budgetary system has limited powers in relation to revenue-raising measures.  Accordingly, the Scottish Equality Statement is primarily an impact assessment on Government spending.  Mr. John Swinney MSP, the Scottish Cabinet Secretary for Finance, Employment and Sustainable Growth, sets out in his introduction to the Equality Statement that he commends it &ldquo;as a tool to assist with the scrutiny of our spending decisions (...) and as a commentary on the equality impact of our spending plans (...)&rdquo;.  The Equality Statement does not deal with revenue or taxation measures and as such the scope to provide a detailed analysis of the Scottish model is limited.  Any issues relating to the allocation of spending resources and its impacts are matters for my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, to deal with in the first instance. </p><p>  I feel it is important to highlight the progressive nature of the Irish taxation system when discussing matters of equality. Ireland has been consistently assessed highly by the OECD for the progressivity of our taxation system. In the OECD rating system on the progressivity of taxation, where less than 100 is regressive and above 100 is progressive, most EU countries had a progressivity rate of between 120 and 140. Ireland, in comparison, had a progressivity rate of 182.</p></reply>

The background to the Judicial Review is that the taxpayer entered into what Revenue considers to be a tax avoidance scheme.  The scheme involves the transfer of share rights and results ultimately in the extraction and distribution of funds tax free to the taxpayer.  Revenue issued a written notification to the taxpayer that a Revenue investigation had commenced into his tax affairs for certain tax years.  They also advised the taxpayer that he no longer had the opportunity to make a qualifying disclosure.  A qualifying disclosure, also known as a voluntary disclosure, entitles a taxpayer to a lower rate of penalties when the tax liability is computed.</p><p>  The central issue considered by the High Court in the Judicial Review proceedings was whether the taxpayer was entitled to make a qualifying disclosure.  The High Court ruled that in the circumstances of the case Revenue were entitled to refuse a qualifying disclosure to the taxpayer on the grounds that Revenue&rsquo;s investigation into his tax affairs had already commenced.</p><p>  The High Court judgment was not, as such, concerned with matters that determine whether a tax liability arises in relation to the tax avoidance scheme.</p><p>  Revenue has identified 76 companies to date that availed of the scheme with funds of c.&euro;181million extracted tax free.  A number of the cases are the subject of tax appeals and the final amount of related tax liability, if any, will ultimately depend on the final outcome of these appeals.  I am informed that consequently the Revenue Commissioners are not in a position at present to quantify any tax liability that may become payable.	</p></reply>

The President of Eurogroup speaks on behalf of Eurogroup and held a press conference after the meeting on Monday afternoon.  The Eurogroup discussed a range of issues and released statements on Greece and Cyprus.  The Ecofin Council met on 14th May 2013 and as Ireland holds the Presidency of the Council of the EU, I as the Minister for Finance chaired the meeting.  Minister of State, Brian Hayes TD represented Ireland at the meeting.  The meeting was attended by representatives of all 27 EU Member States and of Croatia (who has observer status until their accession into the EU on 1st July), representatives of the Commission and the European Central Bank, the European Investment Bank, the Economic and Financial Committee and the Economic Policy Committee.  The following issues were discussed.</p><p><b>  Banking Recovery and Resolution </b></p><p>  The Council discussed a proposal for a directive establishing a framework for the recovery and resolution of credit institutions and investment firms, focusing in particular on the design of the bail-in instrument.</p><p><b>  Draft Amending Budget No. 2 to the General Budget 2013</b></p><p>  The Council reached a political agreement on draft amending budget no. 2 for 2013, on the basis of a proposal from the Irish Presidency. Draft amending budget no. 2 for 2013 is about meeting outstanding payment needs in the 2013 EU budget for which the Commission proposed a total amount of &euro;11.2 billion.  The Council's political agreement is to provide &euro;7.3 billion in a first stage and to focus this amount on measures to support economic growth, create jobs and tackle unemployment, especially among young people, and as a second stage, to take all necessary steps to ensure EU's obligations are met on the basis of further information from the Commission.  The Council also noted that the agreement in the draft amending Budget has been linked to the negotiations on the Multiannual Financial Framework and as such the Council stated that &quot;nothing is agreed until everything is agreed&quot;.</p><p><b>  Savings taxation </b></p><p>  The Council approved a mandate for the Commission to negotiate amendments to the EU's agreements with Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Andorra and San Marino on the taxation of savings income. </p><p>  The aim is to ensure that the five countries continue to apply measures that are equivalent to the EU's directive on the taxation of savings income, which is being amended. The Commission will negotiate on the basis of a draft directive amending the savings directive (2003/48/EC), aimed at improving its effectiveness and closing certain loopholes so as to prevent its circumvention.</p><p>  The Council also discussed a draft directive aimed at strengthening the EU's directive on the taxation of savings income (2003/48/EC). It agreed to revert to the matter at a forthcoming meeting, in the light of comments made by Ministers.</p><p><b>  Tax Evasion and Fraud </b></p><p>  The Council then adopted Council Conclusions on Tax Evasion and Fraud which reaffirm that all Member States recognise the importance of taking effective steps to fight tax evasion and tax fraud, and recognises the need to tackle aggressive tax planning.</p><p><b>  Macroeconomic Imbalances</b></p><p>  The Council considered the Commission's publication last month of its in-depth reviews of macroeconomic imbalances in 13 Member States and adopted Council conclusions on the issue. </p><p><b>  Towards a deep and genuine Economic and Monetary Union</b></p><p>  The Council took note of the presentation by the Commission of two communications on the further development of the EU's economic and monetary union (EMU) and held a brief exchange of views.  The communications relate to the introduction of a &quot;convergence and competitiveness instrument&quot; and <i>ex-ante </i> coordination of national economic policy reforms.  They follow up on work carried out by the European Council, which last December called on its President to present in June 2013, after consultations with the member states, possible measures and a timetable for the further development of EMU.</p><p><b>  Follow-up to International Finance meetings</b></p><p>  The Council took note of the outcome of International Finance Ministers' meetings held in Washington D.C. on 18-21 April, namely:</p><p>- G20 Finance Ministers' and Central Bank Governors' meeting;</p><p>- Annual spring meetings of the IMF and the World Bank.</p><p>  Discussions in Washington covered the global economic situation; the G20 framework for growth; reform of the international financial architecture; financial regulation; financing for investment; and energy, commodities and climate finance.</p><p>Over breakfast on the morning of the 14 May, the President of the European Council Herman Van Rompuy made a presentation on tax evasion and fraud and this was followed by an exchange of views. Ministers were then debriefed on the outcome of the <i>Eurogroup</i> the day before and discussed the <i>economic situation</i>, on the basis of a presentation given by Vice President Olli Rehn on the Commission's Spring European Economic Forecasts. </p><p>  It is evident from the above list that the Council completed a very full programme of work at this meeting. </p></reply>

On 27 March 2013, the Commission proposed that Budget 2013 be increased by &euro;11.2 billion, which the Commission has estimated as the amount required to meet outstanding payment needs from 2012 and expected payment needs in 2013. The ECOFIN Council on 14 May 2013 reached a political agreement to provide &euro;7.3 billion as a first stage and to take all necessary steps to ensure that the EU's obligations are honoured in a second stage on foot of further information from the Commission on implementation, the possibilities for redeployment of funds within the budget and budget revenues.  The ECOFIN also stated that this agreement would be formalised when the negotiations on the EU Multiannual Financial Framework 2014-2020 are concluded and that &lsquo;nothing is agreed until everything is agreed&rsquo;.</p><p>  Ireland will contribute approximately 1% of the additional amount finally agreed for the EU Budget.

With that in mind, I am unsure as to the premise of the Deputy's question.  Companies operating in Ireland are chargeable to corporation tax at the 12.5% rate on the profits that are generated from their trading activities here.  A higher 25% rate applies in respect of investment, rental and other non-trading profits, as well as certain petroleum, mining and land dealing activities, while chargeable capital gains are taxable at the capital gains tax rate of 33%.  I am not aware of companies having issues with complying with these corporate tax rates.</p><p>  Unlike some other countries who have a high headline rate of corporation tax but also have a significant number of reliefs, the approach in Ireland is transparent.  We have a relatively low headline rate of corporation tax which is applied to a broad base and there are only a small number of targeted incentives in Ireland.  Such reliefs include, for example, the R&amp;amp;D tax credit and the 3 year exemption from corporation tax for start-up companies.  These few reliefs are tightly focussed: firstly on the creation of additional employment as is consistent with current Government policy, and secondly on areas of innovation with a view to generating high value-added economic activity in the country.</p><p>  In relation to the compliance burden arising from taxation more generally, the Deputy may be interested to note that Ireland was ranked 6th in the world and 1st in the EU for ease of paying taxes in a report published in April by PwC, the World Bank and the IFC entitled <i>'Paying Taxes 2013'.</i></p></reply>

It can include Money Market Funds or other &ldquo;deposit taking&rdquo; investment products, Special Purpose Vehicles which perform liquidity or maturity transformation, Exchange Traded Funds and other funds which provide credit, firms which provide credit guarantees, insurance/reinsurance firms which issue or insure credit.  Shadow banking typically has the following characteristics: maturity or liquidity transformation across the balance sheet - where the sources of funding are of shorter maturity or the assets are inherently illiquid; credit creation funded by leverage - which boosts certain measures of the money supply.</p><p>  Shadow Banking, if well regulated, can perform important functions in the financial system and parts of the Shadow Banking system can contribute positively to the flow of credit and liquidity and help to promote economic growth. </p><p>  In general, regulatory proposals on Shadow Banking seek to appropriately reflect a balance between the need for better risk management and enhanced transparency and stronger financial stability, and the need for increased and more diversified financing to the economy.  </p><p>  Shadow banking activities make use of various services located in Ireland such as legal advice, tax advice, accountancy advice, asset servicing, subscriptions and redemptions, valuations and listing.  Most of these are high value added activities to the Irish economy through income tax receipts. </p><p>  The Commission will in summer 2013, as a follow up to their Green Paper of March 2012, and the international work coordinated by the Financial Stability Board, address the systemic problems related to shadow banking.

It is the largest implementation of a self-assessment tax system in the history of the State.  As a new service that will have exceptional temporary pressures at particular stages of its initial implementation, it was difficult to predict the level of contact during the introductory phase and consequently, the resources required to handle queries from members of the public.  Revenue considered a number of options for the provision of a phone call service to handle queries from members of the public.  It was necessary to ensure that the introduction of LPT would not adversely affect Revenue&rsquo;s capacity to deliver for the Exchequer in relation to their overall priority of maintaining and improving levels of compliance across the range of taxes and duties.</p><p>  Following an open competitive tendering process, the contract was awarded to Abtran.  As part of the contract Abtran must meet Revenue customer service standards as well as industry ISO and PCI standards.  To ensure the standards are met and maintained, both in English and Irish, Revenue provided training and training material and maintains a presence in Abtran on an on-going basis. </p><p>  The conditions of the agreement between Abtran and Revenue require the company to specifically:</p><p>1.Deliver information and assistance to taxpayers having difficulty understanding Local Property Tax (LPT) and completing their returns and making payments.</p><p>2. Assist taxpayers to navigate a new online system for filing returns and payments for LPT. </p><p>3. Escalate calls to a Revenue call service where taxpayer specific information is required to resolve the call.</p><p>4. Make outbound calls to taxpayers with information on their Property Tax queries where requested by Revenue to do so.</p><p>5. Provide telephony infrastructure and supports to allow direct transfer to Revenue </p><p>6. Provide support services and resources including account management and quality control </p><p>  I am advised that cost of the service to Revenue is dependent on the volume of calls handled and that a total of &euro;67,000 was spent on the service delivery during Q1 2013.  Revenue publishes quarterly lists of payments to suppliers over &euro;20,000 and the continued cost of the call service will be published on that basis.  In regard to the Deputy&rsquo;s question on the cost of calls to the Helpline I am informed that the price is dependent on the individual&rsquo;s phone network as well as the type of &lsquo;phone package&rsquo; that the individual has with his/her operator. </p><p>  In regard to the issue of credit card abuse by an employee of Abtran, I am advised by Revenue that the issue was first brought to its attention late on Thursday night 9 May 2013.  The issue related to people who filed and paid via telephone through the LPT Helpline and who used credit or debit cards as the payment method. In total, the details of 11 credit/debit cards were improperly obtained by an &lsquo;unauthorised&rsquo; Abtran employee.  The incident did not impact on anybody who filed and paid via computer nor did it affect any of the other available payment options for Local Property Tax (LPT).</p><p>  I am assured that Revenue is extremely concerned about the incident and has been in constant contact with the company at a senior level since the incident occurred.  I am informed that the matter is now in the hands of the Garda&iacute; and in the circumstances it would not be appropriate to comment further on that aspect of the matter.  None of the card holders suffered any financial loss.</p><p>  In regard to security, Abtran was able to very quickly identify the person responsible for the inappropriate access because it has very sophisticated call management and recording systems available to log all calls.  On concluding its investigation, Abtran assured Revenue that the incident was an isolated matter relating to a single individual. It was not related to any technology or systems breach and was not related to the secure on-line payments system for LPT. </p><p>  When Revenue extended the facility to file and pay on-line, via the LPT Helpline, special arrangements were put in place with Abtran in line with best practice, including setting up a filing team who are located in a &lsquo;clean&rsquo; and secure environment with additional monitoring features, who do not have access to mobile phones or any other facility to record personal or payment details.  The person in question was not a member of this team and had no authority to request any payment details from customers.</p><p>  Since the incident also constituted a data breach, Revenue reported it to the office of the Data Protection Commissioner on Friday and is receiving advice from that office.</p><p>  Revenue would like to reassure people that payment of tax by either credit or debit card is completely secure and that in the unlikely event of any illegal access, the card owner will not suffer any loss. </p><p>  Finally, I commend Revenue for its very swift response to the incident.</p></reply>

Those plans are being evaluated by my Department currently.  It is not possible at this stage to reveal precise individual details bar what has been put into the public domain.  I can confirm that all three institutions have put forward pension changes to varying degrees as part of their respective overall responses.  </p><p>  I am constrained as to what I can say presently due to commercial sensitivities and perhaps, more critical at this stage, industrial relations concerns as the normal protocols continue and need to be respected and observed by all parties.  This is something I have advocated throughout this process.  I am anxious, therefore, that all the participants in these discussions are given space and time to conduct these critical negotiations. </p><p>  Accordingly, I would encourage all sides to engage in these discussions proactively through the appropriate forums in view of the serious and critical consequences for all concerned.  In this context, the Government readily acknowledges the sacrifices and changes made by bank employees to date at all levels and recognises that this has been achieved without major industrial unrest in what is a critically important sector.</p><p>  It follows that, at this stage, it would not be appropriate or realistic to specify a timeframe for the savings to be delivered.  However, in view of the fact that the three institutions continue to be loss making the timely delivery of such savings is critical to their viability and to the future employment prospects of their employees.</p><p>  There is on-going monitoring of costs and implementation of and adherence to policy, including remuneration, with the three banks.  This is achieved through a variety of measures such as compliance certification, monthly management meetings with the respective institutions, annual published reporting by them and parliamentary oversight.  All three institutions are in compliance with the present Government policy on remuneration which includes, amongst other matters, a remuneration cap and a prohibition on the awarding or payment of bonuses.</p></reply>

However, the cash basis of accounting provides traders with the option to account for VAT on a cash receipts basis.  This means that the trader is not required to pay VAT until payment for the supply is actually received.  Availing of this option assists firms in the critical area of cash flow.  In order to avail of the cash receipts basis of accounting for VAT, a business must either a) be supplying goods or services, where 90% of the supplies are to persons who aren&rsquo;t registered for VAT or b) have an annual turnover which is less than &euro;1.25 million.</p><p>  As part of a number of measures to assist small to medium enterprises, Budget 2013 increased this turnover threshold from &euro;1 million to &euro;1.25 million with effect from 1 May 2013.  This increase will have a once off cost to the Exchequer of &euro;20 million.  Over 800 businesses are expected to benefit from this change.</p><p>  Although it is possible to increase the threshold to a level higher than &euro;1.25 million, the cash basis cannot be used to replace the normal VAT arrangements across the board which might be the case if an excessively high threshold were used, given 66% of taxpayers are already using the cash basis system.  In addition an increase in the threshold to &euro;2 million or &euro;2.5 million would be very costly to the Exchequer.  Increasing the threshold to &euro;2.5 million, for example, would cost the Exchequer &euro;150 million.  Accordingly, I have no plans to further increase the threshold at this time.</p></reply>

We remain on course to reduce the deficit below 3 per cent of GDP by 2015.  </p><p>  Encouragingly, domestic demand showed tentative signs of stabilisation in the second half of last year, with personal consumption increasing in each of the last two quarters and investment returning to full-year growth for the first time since 2007.  While developments in the labour market have been relatively positive of late - with employment increasing over the last two quarters and the unemployment rate falling by 1 percentage point since February 2012 - a recovery in domestic activity remains a precondition for sustained employment growth. In this regard, it is encouraging to note that my Department is now forecasting domestic demand to return to modest full-year growth this year, and to strengthen gradually over the next few years.  On this basis, employment is expected to return to modest growth in 2013 and to continue expanding thereafter.</p><p>  Finally, I would like to emphasise that the Government remains committed to tackling the unacceptably high level of unemployment. Reflecting this, the <i>Action Plan for Jobs 2013</i> set out over 333 actions to be undertaken in the coming year to support job creation and complement measures already untaken in the <i>Jobs Initiative</i> and the <i>Pathways to Work</i>.</p></reply>

These arrangements include mortgage to rent, trade down mortgages, equity participation, interest rate reduction, sale by agreement, and split mortgages.  I have been informed by the Central Bank of Ireland that the majority of lenders have introduced, or are in the process of introducing, a split mortgage arrangement.  A split mortgage warehouses a part of what remains unamortised from the initial capital sum in what can be called "Part B" of the loan.  The Part B is not serviced unless the borrower's financial position improves significantly in the future, in which case the split is revised in line with the new circumstances - with the provision that, in order to preserve incentives, only a fraction of the new resources are applied to the loan.  The maximum amount that can be warehoused is dependent on each lender&rsquo;s own internal criteria.  The split mortgage, like all other forbearance and modification arrangements, is based on affordability and sustainability of the arrangement from both the borrower&rsquo;s and the lender&rsquo;s perspective and is one of the key measures being introduced by lenders in assisting their distressed borrowers.  All of the products offered by the banks have been prepared in the context of the Central Bank&rsquo;s Mortgage Arrears Resolution Strategy.</p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, in the context of the performance targets set by the Central Bank for borrowers in arrears over 90 days, lenders will have to satisfy the Central Bank as to the sustainability and affordability of long term solutions offered given that the Central Bank will be conducting a supervisory audit of compliance with the targets including thorough analysis of sample modifications offered by the institutions.</p></reply>

However, I believe that the report would have more accurately reflected the Government&rsquo;s extensive assistance to emigrants had the Council sought the views of the Irish Abroad Unit of my Department during their research.     Today, our Diaspora engagement policy has two key strands, namely the Emigrant Support Programme (ESP) and the Global Irish Network.</p><p>  The Emigrant Support Programme provides direct assistance to Irish emigrants, both long-standing and new.  Since 2004, Irish groups ranging from those providing front line services to those most at need including the elderly, isolated, vulnerable and new arrivals to those working in the culture and heritage space have received grants of over &euro;100 million under the Programme. At present, we work with almost 200 Irish community organisations in over 20 countries and despite the economic situation, I ensured the ESP budget for 2013 - &euro;11.6 million - remained at the same level as in 2012. </p><p>  The programme provides extensive funding to organisations that act as first port of call for new emigrants, including the GAA, the London Irish Centre, the Irish Canadian Immigration Centre in Toronto and several similar groups in Australia. We also support a wide range of business and graduate networks around the world.</p><p>  Among the Irish based organisations who receive ESP funding is Crosscare Migrant Project which offers pre-departure services to Irish citizens considering emigration. Crosscare also provide training to mainstream service providers on emigration and returners&rsquo; issues and work in conjunction with Irish welfare organisations abroad (many also funded by ESP) and statutory and voluntary service providers in Ireland including the probation service, Salvation Army and Safe Home.</p><p>  Officials from my Department will meet the National Youth Council of Ireland shortly to discuss some of the findings and recommendations from their report with a view to seeing if there are areas where the Council and the Department might be able to cooperate in future. </p></reply>

President Higgins has sent a message of condolence to the President of the Republic of Bangladesh, H.E Mr. Hamid Abdul in this regard.      </p><p>  I understand that earlier this week the government of Bangladesh agreed to lift legal restrictions on forming trade unions in most industries, including the garment industry.  Previously, workers were required to obtain permission from factory owners before unionising.</p><p>  I share the concern of Ireland's UN and EU partners regarding the current state of labour conditions in Bangladesh.  I support the statement made by   EU High Representative Catherine Ashton and EU Trade Commissioner Karel De Gucht on 30 April which called upon the Bangladeshi authorities to act immediately to ensure that factories across the country comply with international labour standards including International Labour Organisation (ILO) conventions.</p><p>  Ireland's commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights is a fundamental feature of our foreign policy.  Under Ireland's new policy for International Development - One World, One Future, we are committed to ensuring that economic development is compatible with human rights, including the right to decent work.  Our engagement in this area will be informed by, among other international standards, the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.  In this regard, Irish Aid currently provides assistance to the International Labour Organisation's (ILO) <i>'Decent Work Agenda'</i> through a partnership programme that covers the four year period 2012-2015.</p><p>  At the Human Rights Council's most recent Universal Periodic Review of Bangladesh, Ireland recommended that Bangladesh ensure widespread, unannounced and rigorous factory inspections and that where breaches of the Labour Act 2006 occur those responsible are held accountable in a manner sufficient to ensure deterrence</p><p>  Regarding   the accord on Building and Fire Safety in Bangladesh referred to in the Deputy's question, Ireland welcomes the active engagement of Irish and international firms who have signed up to this voluntary agreement and encourages others to do so in an effort to prevent any recurrence of the recent tragic events in Dhaka.  </p></reply>

The Council is made up of eight Member States: Canada, Denmark (including Greenland and the Faroe Islands), Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden and the United States as well as six Permanent Observer States: France, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, United Kingdom. The Arctic Council does not offer states or organisations Observer Status. Rather, those wishing to secure Observer Status must formally apply to the Council for consideration.    To date, Ireland has not applied for Observer Status. When assessing a State&rsquo;s suitability for Observer Status, issues such as its expertise in areas relevant to the region and its ability to support the work of the Council are key determinants. In this context, the extent to which a State has participated in research programmes in the region is especially important. </p><p>  The EU has applied for Observer Status of the Arctic Council. The application was considered at a Ministerial meeting in Kiruna, Sweden last week. A decision on the EU&rsquo;s application has been deferred pending further discussions on bilateral issues between the EU and Canada. We are hopeful that the EU&rsquo;s application will be successful and we look forward to contributing, through the EU, to greater cooperation in the management of the Arctic region.</p></reply>

The vast majority of the paragraphs relate to services.  There are just five references to goods that are exempt in Schedule 1.  These include the supply of dentures or other dental prostheses; the supply or importation of human organs, human blood and human milk; the supply of water by a local authority, the importation of goods by certain international bodies, and the supply of goods that were used for business purposes by a person who did not have VAT deductibility.  A business engaged in the supply of VAT exempt goods does not charge VAT on those supplies and is not entitled to deductibility for VAT incurred on goods or services used in the supply of those goods.</p><p>  It is important to distinguish between supplies of goods that are exempt from VAT and those that are zero rated.  A business engaged in the supply of zero rated goods does not charge VAT on those sales but is entitled to deductibility for VAT incurred on goods or services used in connection with those sales.  A wide range of goods is liable to VAT at the zero rate.  These include most food and drink of a kind for human consumption, oral medicines, children&rsquo;s clothing, certain books and certain medical equipment and appliances.</p><p>  I would point out that the exemptions and zero rating in Irish VAT legislation must comply with the exemptions and conditions on VAT rating laid down in the EU VAT Directive.  Ireland is unable to introduce or apply exemptions or to vary VAT rates in a manner that is not in accordance with this Directive.</p><p>   	</p></reply>

In 2012, for example, over 1,000 convictions were secured in relation to non-filing of a range of revenue returns; over 500 summary criminal convictions for a range of tax and duty offences and 50 convictions for serious tax and duty offences which were prosecuted on indictment.  At the end of 2012, a total of 197 cases were at various stages of the investigation and prosecution process.</p><p>  However, while prosecution is an important element of Revenue's compliance framework it is, and will always be, a minor one in number terms.  Revenue carries out a wide range of compliance and enforcement interventions with the strategic objective of increasing timely compliance, and targeting those who do not comply.  Much of this compliance takes place in the context of the published Code of Practice for Revenue Audit, which provides, <i>inter alia</i>, that where a taxpayer makes certain types of voluntary disclosure, a range of reduced penalties can apply and that Revenue will not initiate an investigation with a view to prosecution of the taxpayer.  Such voluntary disclosure arrangements are a feature of self-assessment tax systems. They also serve the purpose of enabling Revenue to optimise the efficient use of resources.</p><p>  I am satisfied that the existing legislation provides a firm basis for prosecution of appropriate cases where tax and/or duty offences have taken place.  I am also satisfied that Revenue's approach to compliance interventions, which includes provision for voluntary disclosure, is a sensible and balanced one.</p></reply>

This is a normal feature of on-line transaction systems.  In circumstances where they do not immediately have access to a printer, it is a simple matter to paste the number into another application on the tablet or mobile device or to just note down the number in writing. </p><p>  They will in many instances also have evidence of their LPT payments from their own financial records.  For example, for those who pay by single debit authority, direct debit or by debit/credit card, a record of the transaction will be available through their own financial institution records.  I am also advised that, where customers opt to pay LPT using one of the Revenue appointed third party payment service providers, receipts will issue for each payment made. The appointed payment service providers are An Post Taxpay, Payzone and Omnivend.

In addition, the interest ceiling can vary depending on if the individuals are in the <i>first seven tax years of their qualifying loan.</i>   In such circumstances, individuals are entitled to higher interest ceilings, which are known as the &lsquo;first time buyer&rsquo; ceilings. For such individuals, the ceilings are &euro;10,000 per annum for a single individual and &euro;20,000 per annum for married couples and civil partnerships. For individuals that are in their eight or subsequent years of their qualifying loan, lower interest ceiling apply, known as the &lsquo;non-first-time buyer&rsquo; ceilings.  For such individuals, the ceilings are &euro;3,000 per annum for a single individual and &euro;6,000 per annum for married couples and civil partnerships. The same ceilings apply for mortgages taken out in 2009 as apply in other years.</p><p>Furthermore the rules relating to the rates at which relief is given vary depending on whether the claimant is a &ldquo;First Time Buyer&rdquo; or a &ldquo;non First Time Buyer&rdquo;.

This is similar to the number seen in the previous wave.</p><p>  At the same time even fewer SME Directors (8%) have purchased property financed by bank debt, secured on the business, since 2005.&rdquo;</p><p>  However, it is the case that, in his past reports on the adherence by Bank of Ireland and AIB to the lending targets, the Credit Reviewer has highlighted the property debt overhang as a potentially constraining issue for SMEs. Some of these debt issues may be addressed in the context of the Personal Insolvency arrangements which are coming into force shortly for those debts held by insolvent business holders in a personal capacity. Where the debt overhang is a core debt in the business itself, the debt may be reviewed in the context of restructuring strategies for SME debts which are being implemented by the financial institutions with the oversight of the Central Bank.</p><p>  During the first quarter of 2013, the Central Bank of Ireland formally advised the covered banks of the specific Key Performance Indicators and metrics for the SME Distressed portfolios that they are required to submit on a quarterly basis.  By the end of June 2013, the Central Bank will set quarterly institution-specific performance targets for covered banks to move distressed borrowers onto longer-term solutions.  The targets set will reflect the banks&rsquo; capacity, processes and systems.   </p><p>  All of the actions taken by my Department to ensure credit availability for SMEs such as the lending targets, the establishment of the Credit Review Office and the work of the State Bodies Group apply to all SMEs, including those who may have property related debt.  The Temporary Partial Credit Guarantee scheme which addresses the situation where the SME is outside the risk appetite of the banks may also be relevant to property related debt.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-05-21a.339.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013052100062#WRG05100"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 164 and 182 together. </p><p>  I am informed by the Central Bank that the main SME lenders in the Irish economy have SME exposures of greater than &euro;50bn in aggregate, c.50% of which are classified as in &#8220;distress&#8221;.    For the avoidance of doubt, the Central Bank has indicated to me that these c&euro;25bn of loans are 'distressed' loans which relates to loans that are graded as 'Watch'/ 'Vulnerable' or Impaired based on the banks' internal credit grading system - i.e. not all are impaired. </p><p>  During the first half of 2012, the Central Bank of Ireland commissioned a review by external consultants of the distressed SME operations in BOI and AIB.  This review examined areas such as organisational structure, staffing (skills &amp;amp; resources), work-out strategy and execution ability.  </p><p>  Following the outcome of this review the Central Bank commenced a project in the second half of 2012 to drive the effective and timely resolution of the SME distressed loan portfolios through improved bank management of distressed loans and appropriate workout strategies.    The priority is to ensure that the banks implement longer term resolution strategies on a case-by-case basis.  This also incorporates property debt overhang. </p><p>  A key focus of the project is to ensure that banks adopt a proactive approach to the management of distressed SME loans via appropriate restructuring on a case by case basis and identifying property debt resolution strategies, where required. </p><p>  During the first quarter of 2013, the Central Bank of Ireland formally advised the covered banks of the specific Key Performance Indicators and metrics for the SME Distressed portfolios that they are required to submit on a quarterly basis.  By the end of June 2013, the Central Bank will set quarterly institution-specific performance targets for covered banks to move distressed borrowers onto longer-term solutions.  The targets set will reflect the banks' capacity, processes and systems.   </p><p>  The Government recognises that SMEs are the lifeblood of the economy and will play a vital role in the recovery of employment growth in our country. It also recognises that businesses with legacy debts may be viable. One of the key priorities of the Programme for Government is to ensure that an adequate pool of credit is available to fund SMEs in the real economy during the restructuring and downsizing programme.</p><p>  The Government has taken a number of actions, particularly where SMEs have been refused credit, to improve the situation in relation to credit availability to SMEs. </p><p>  At national level, the Temporary Partial Credit Guarantee scheme addresses the situation where the SME is outside the risk appetite of the banks. This can arise because the SME's lack of collateral or the banks' lack of understanding of the business model, the market, the sector or the technology. The three main SME lenders are all participating in the Guarantee scheme. In addition, the Microenterprise Loan Fund Scheme will provide loans of up to &euro;25k to start-up, newly established, or growing microenterprises employing less than 10 people, who have commercially viable proposals that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by banks. </p><p>  The Government has also been active at national and European level to promote and develop non-bank avenues of credit for the SME sector. Enterprise Ireland has a range of initiatives and programmes available for businesses at various stages of the growth cycle. The NPRF has put a number of funds in place to help meet SME financing needs in Ireland: </p><p>Details of the schemes can be found on the websites of the relevant bodies, as well as on the Department of Finance website at <i><font color="#0000FF"></font></i>, a document which consolidates the State supports available for SMEs.</p><p>  In addition, my Department has produced the first in a series of information newsletters dealing with credit and funding issues for the Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) sector.  The newsletter provides information on the various State and private initiatives aimed at increasing the SME sector's awareness of and access to credit and funding, as well as focusing on positive stories from the sector.</p><p>  The Government has also led, at European level, efforts to promote and develop non-bank avenues of credit for the SME sector.  In December 2012 the Department of Finance hosted a High-Level Workshop on <i>Non Bank Funding of Growth and Jobs in Europe, </i>and the report of this event is now available on the Department's website. Ireland's commitment, during its EU Presidency, is to facilitate and encourage the development of an appropriate set of policy options that will support long term financing of growth and employment in Europe, with the provision of capital to SMEs a key aspect of this.  In this context the Irish Presidency is fully supportive of the Commission's work in this area as highlighted by the publication in March of a Green Paper on Long-Term Financing of the European Economy.  The Irish Presidency ensured that the issue of long-term financing, including non-bank funding, was discussed at the Informal ECOFIN in Europe.  It was agreed at the ECOFIN that the Economic and Financial Committee of the European Council would be asked to progress this issue. </p></reply>

By way of background, I am advised that since July 2011 paper receipts no longer issue in respect of tax payments generally.  This decision was taken on the basis that the vast majority of taxpayers conduct business with Revenue via its online service or via their employer, if they pay income tax under PAYE.  These services facilitate direct access to payment information and therefore customers have no need for a paper receipt.  The change has resulted in significant cost savings in terms of postage, stationery and staff resources.   This arrangement now applies to Local Property Tax (LPT) and customers who file online receive an online acknowledgement and have ongoing access to their return and payment details.  I am also advised that, where customers opt to pay LPT using one of the Revenue appointed third party payment service providers, receipts will issue for each payment made.  The appointed payment service providers are An Post Taxpay, Payzone and Omnivend.  Similarly, customers who file online over the telephone via the LPT helpline receive a paper acknowledgement of their payment from Revenue within two weeks.</p><p>  Customers who file and pay using the paper LPT return do not receive a paper receipt.  They will of course have evidence of LPT payments through their own financial institution records.  However, in circumstances where a payment fails for whatever reason, then Revenue will make direct contact with the customer.</p></reply>

In addition to formal press briefings arranged around events such as end-year results and annual report launches, informal media briefings are also provided by the NTMA and NAMA from time to time.  Official press releases published by the NTMA, NAMA and related agencies are accessible on the relevant website.  In addition to such releases, the NTMA may issue statements to individual journalists or groups of journalists and responds in writing to media queries on an on-going basis.  The hourly rates charged by the service provider are commercially confidential.  I provided full details of the overall costs of the provision of this service, which was put in place following a public procurement process, in my reply to the Deputy of 7 May last.  The level of costs incurred reflects the very significant increase in domestic and international media interest in and queries to the NTMA following the establishment of NAMA in 2009 and the entry of Ireland into the EU Programme of Financial Assistance in 2010.  The arrangement whereby the NTMA&rsquo;s internal communications resources are supported by an external service provider allowed it to increase the resources applied to the service in a flexible manner and without incurring a permanent increase in its cost base.</p></reply>

It is important too for the continued development of Ireland as a centre for international financial services and as a location of choice for international foreign financial services firms. A vibrant secure well regulated financial sector is a core part of a stable business environment.  A range of reforms have been introduced to underpin a more effective and efficient financial regulatory regime.  The Central Bank Reform Act 2010 gave effect to significant structural changes in the operation of financial regulation in Ireland. The Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Bill 2011, which completed Committee stage in April this year, further strengthens the ability of the Central Bank to impose and supervise compliance with regulatory requirements and to undertake timely prudential interventions. These reforms followed on from the reports of Prof. Honohan and Messrs. Regling and Watson which identified a range of regulatory failures which were instrumental in the financial crises. </p><p>  At EU level, the Irish Presidency has prioritised a number of dossiers which balance responsible governance with the need to avoid unnecessary burdens, thereby ensuring that opportunities for economic growth and job creation are maximised. That work will ensure that our regulatory framework is benchmarked against other EU and international jurisdictions and enable us to work in building growth for the future that is underpinned by a sound regulatory environment.</p><p>  Our reputation as a secure and stable hub of international business and finance must not be defined by the financial crisis but rather by our response to it and the steps we are taking to ensure that the mistakes of the past are not repeated.  International companies recognise that a sound and consistent regulatory environment is a core part of a stable business environment. My Department and I will continue to work towards a balanced regulatory regime that is consistent with both long-term growth and job creation and a more focused and proactive financial services sector.</p></reply>

A special Government Sub-Committee is already in place since March last year to address the mortgage arrears problem.  This Committee is chaired by An Taoiseach and includes all other relevant Ministers, and reflects the need for accelerated progress in this area.     At official level, my Department is taking a lead role and in that context, a high level Steering Group, chaired by the Department's Secretary General, was established to drive the implementation of the recommendations contained in the Report of the Inter-Departmental Working Group on Mortgage Arrears (the 'Keane Report').  </p><p>  The Government has put in place a comprehensive strategy to address the problem of mortgage arrears, focusing on four main distinct areas:</p><p><b>- Innovative Personal Insolvency Reform:</b> Personal insolvency reform was identified by the Keane Report as a catalyst for addressing the mortgage arrears problem and it indicated that without an effective insolvency system the mortgage arrears problem will not be resolved.   The introduction of the new Personal Insolvency Act provides new statutory insolvency frameworks to allow debtors and creditors reach arrangements on unsustainable mortgage and personal debt.  The legislation provides a legal framework for the resolution of mortgage arrears, as well as other personal debt, and it will provide certainty for borrowers and lenders alike about the consequences of non-payment and failure to reach agreement.  The Insolvency Service of Ireland, which will generally oversee the operation of the new insolvency frameworks, has now been established and it is envisaged it will be in a position to process cases later this summer.</p><p><b>- Mortgage Arrears Resolution Strategies:</b> The development and implementation of mortgage arrears strategies by individual lenders has further intensified with the Central Bank initiative of last March to set time bound and measurable targets for the main banks on their progress in addressing and resolving, on a durable basis, the position of their mortgage customers who are in arrears on their mortgage. In particular, the Central Bank is now requiring the relevant lenders to propose sustainable solutions to 20% of mortgages that are in arrears (of over 90 days) by end June, 30% by end September and 50% by end December 2013.  In addition, the more recent pilot initiative announced by the Central Bank will seek, where there are a number of lenders involved, to address a debtor's position in a holistic and fair way in the best interest of all creditors and the debtor.</p><p><b>- Comprehensive Advice and Guidance:</b> In addition to existing arrangements, the Government has introduced a range of additional information and guidance resources to assist mortgage holders through what can be a difficult and stressful process.  A dedicated website, <i><font color="#0000FF">www.keepingyourhome.ie</font></i>  , has been put in place to provide general public information on mortgages arrears issues.  In addition, there is a Mortgage Arrears Information Helpline, which is established under the aegis of the Citizens Information Board, to provide more tailored information to individual callers.  Finally, a panel of accountants has been put in place to provide &#8220;one to one&#8221; independent advice to borrowers who have been provided a long term forbearance resolution offer by their lender in respect of a mortgage on their primary home.  All of these information services are provided at no direct charge to the users of the service.</p><p><b>- Keeping families in their homes: </b>As a social housing response, a &#8220;mortgage to rent&#8221; scheme is now in place on a nationwide basis.  This option will be available to households with unsustainable mortgages and who would qualify for social housing support and meet other appropriate criteria it will allow the family, in the context of an agreed resolution to an unsustainable mortgage, to remain in their home.</p><p>The Central Bank's Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears remains a key protection and applies to mortgage lending activities with borrowers in respect of their principal private residence in the State. These protections include the establishment of a formal Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) to deal with mortgage customers who are in arrears or in pre-arrears, the establishment of a dedicated Appeals Support Unit and a separate internal appeals process by lenders to deal with individuals on a case by case basis. A copy of the Code is available on the Central Bank's website <i><font color="#0000FF">www.centralbank.ie</font></i>  . </p><p>  The Central Bank is also updating the CCMA so that it continues to provide protection to customers who cooperate with their bank while facilitating and promoting the resolution of arrears cases.  Issues being considered in the review include:</p><p>- New safeguards to ensure borrowers are given sufficient warning before being classified as 'non cooperating';</p><p>- Changes to the contact levels permitted, while ensuring consumers are not subject to harassment;</p><p>- Transparency on resolution options so borrowers have a full understanding before making a decision; and</p><p>- Consideration on whether there is merit in allowing a lender to move a borrower in arrears off a tracker rate where the lender has offered an alternative arrangement which is more advantageous in the long term.</p><p>  Further information on the review is available on www.centralbank.ie. </p><p>  The Central Bank expects to publish the revised Code very soon.</p><p>  The Government is making significant progress to address the problem of mortgage arrears and taken together believes that the ingredients of a fair resolution process for distressed borrowers are now in place.</p></reply>

The Ansbacher accounts ran from<font color="#FF0000"> </font>  1971 and the Irish business was wound up in the mid-1990s.  It did not prove possible to prosecute any person for offences that may have been committed in relation to the accounts because, in general, in excess of 10 years had elapsed from the dates that the alleged offences occurred, up to the time investigations were completed.  In this regard section 1078(7) of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides that proceedings must be instituted within 10 years from the date of the commission of the offence. </p><p>  In addition, a further difficulty for the Revenue Commissioners investigation was that very few original documents were available in relation to the Ansbacher accounts and there was no legal mechanism to compel Cayman Island entities to produce such documents.</p><p>  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they undertook detailed and extensive investigations into the operation of the Ansbacher accounts and the tax affairs of the Irish resident account-holders.  This involved the extensive use of legislative powers requiring the production by financial institutions and other third parties of books, records and documentation relevant to the tax liabilities of the account-holders.  They found the accounts system operated to be complex and secretive with Irish depositors funds held offshore and no record of the deposits in the State although the depositors had access to their funds in the State.</p><p>  The Ansbacher investigations have to-date yielded total revenue of &euro;112.71m from 142 persons.  This yield is comprised of &euro;49.05m tax and interest and penalties of &euro;63.66m.</p><p>  While I will of course, give careful consideration to any proposals that might be put to me in regard to prosecution related legislation, for evidential and fairness reasons, time limits are a feature of criminal and civil legal systems generally, and the 10-year limitation on bringing prosecutions provided for in the Taxes Consolidation Act is generally regarded as a balanced timeframe. </p><p>  The Deputy may wish to note that I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that in 2012, there was an increase of 56% in the number of convictions for serious tax offences (to 25) and an increase of 79% in number of convictions for serious duty offences (to 25), which is an increase of 67% overall when compared to 2011.</p></reply>

Generally speaking, companies operating in Ireland are chargeable to corporation tax at the 12.5% rate on the profits that are generated from their trading activities here.  A higher 25% rate applies in respect of investment, rental and other non-trading profits, as well as certain petroleum, mining and land dealing activities, while chargeable capital gains are taxable at the capital gains tax rate of 33 %.</p><p>  I would add that there is a provision in the tax code that grants relief for investment in the generation of renewable energy and is set out in Section 486B of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997.  Subject to certain limits and restrictions set out therein, any company that invests in renewable energy may qualify for this relief. </p><p>  The renewable energy generation scheme was originally set up in 1999 and the tax relief applies to corporate equity investments in certain renewable energy generation projects.  Qualifying investments are eligible for tax relief in the form of a deduction from a company&rsquo;s profits. </p><p>  To qualify for the relief the energy project must be approved by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and be in one of the following categories of technology:</p><p>- Solar</p><p>- Wind</p><p>- Hydro </p><p>- Biomass </p><p>  The value of the investment on which relief can be given is capped at the lesser of: </p><p>- 50% of all capital expenditure, excluding expenditure on lands and net of grants, or</p><p>- &euro;9.525 million for a single project. </p><p>  Investment by a company or group is capped at &euro;12.7 million per annum and unless the shares are held for at least five years by the company, the relief will be withdrawn.  The purpose of the scheme is to encourage investment in renewable energy projects and to facilitate the growth of electricity generation capacity using these sources.</p></reply>

The focus of Government is to achieve a successful exit from the Programme and a sustainable return to market based funding. We continue to meet our programme commitments and our strong implementation record has been recognized by our external partners and has given confidence to the financial markets. We continue to move towards the goal of fully regaining durable and sustainable market access during 2013. The continuation of regular Treasury Bill auctions which recommenced last July, and our bond issues to date are positive steps in this direction. The issue, in January 2013 of an existing 5-year bond in an amount of &euro;2.5 billion at a yield of 3.32% and the issue in March 2013 of a new 10-year bond at yield of 4.15%  demonstrate that we have re-connected with a diversified investor base  across many key geographic areas.</p><p>  With regard to discussions with Ms Christine Lagarde, Managing Director of the IMF, I have taken the opportunity for a regular informal exchange of views with the Ms Lagarde, in the context of her participation in meetings of the Eurogroup Ministers. Ms Lagarde undertook an official visit to Dublin in early March in the course of which she held discussions with myself, the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste.    More recently, I also met with Ms Lagarde at the Spring Meetings of the IMF and World Bank in Washington in mid-April. I also had the opportunity to speak with Ms Lagarde <i>en marge</i> of the St. Gallen Symposium in Switzerland from 1st to 2nd May 2013. My discussions with the Managing Director have allowed for an exchange of views in relation to Ireland's position under the Joint EU-IMF Programme.</p><p>  Clearly, as a country in the final year of its programme, the discussions have also covered exit strategies and the range of supports which might be available to Ireland. All options will be considered in the light of what is appropriate for Ireland.  Evidently, this will require further consideration and no decisions have been taken to date by Government.</p></reply>

These include claims from employees for contributions to occupational pension funds and from the self-employed and others for contributions to personal pension plans - Retirement Annuity Contracts (RACs) and Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs) - to the extent that these contributions have been included in their personal tax returns.   With regard to occupational pensions (that is, schemes set up by the employer), the figures in respect of employee and employer contributions are available only in aggregate form on a tentative basis. Information on such contributions is not captured in such a way as to make it possible to provide disaggregated figures by tax rate.</p><p>A breakdown of the numbers of claimants by tax rate is only available at present in respect of the tax relief for contributions to Retirement Annuity Contracts (RACs) and Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs) to the extent that these contributions have been included in the personal tax returns of taxpayers. The available data is set out in the following tables:</p><p><b>Retirement annuity contracts &mdash; by tax rate 2010</b></p><p><table><tr><th>Tax Rate</th><th>Number of Cases</th></tr><tr><td>Standard Rate (20%)*</td><td>36,281</td></tr><tr><td>Higher Rate (41%)</td><td>28,234</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>64,515<br />* Includes claimants benefiting from marginal relief or with zero tax liability</td></tr></table></p><p><div style="padding-left: 40px; margin-bottom: 10px"></div></p><p><b>Personal Retirement Savings Accounts &mdash; by tax rate 2010</b></p><p><table><tr><th>Tax Rate</th><th>Number of Cases</th></tr><tr><td>Standard Rate (20%)*</td><td>11,896</td></tr><tr><td>Higher Rate (41%)</td><td>10,338</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>22,234<br />* Includes claimants benefiting from marginal relief or with zero tax liability.</td></tr></table></p><p>The figures for RACs and PRSAs do not include contributions made by employees through employers&rsquo; payroll systems and in respect of which tax relief is provided on the net pay basis. Information on such contributions is not captured in such a way as to make it possible to provide disaggregated figures by tax rate.</p><p>The figures for RACs and PRSAs in the tax rate table are taken directly from filed income tax returns which represent about 83 % of all income tax returns expected for 2010.  The Deputy should be aware that designation of a tax rate to claimants is based on identifying the top tax rate applying to the taxable income of each claimant.  While the effect of the pensions relief may reduce a taxpayer&rsquo;s taxable income to a level where they will be liable at the standard rate, any such taxpayers are still reflected in the tables concerned as higher rate taxpayers.</p><p>Regarding the checks that are in place to ensure that people are actually paying into pension schemes, the Risk Evaluation Analysis and Profiling (REAP) system, developed by Revenue, categorises taxpayers in accordance with defined risk criteria and includes data in relation to claims made for tax credits and/or allowances including claims for pension contributions. Where a case is selected for Revenue intervention all identified risk items are identified.</p><p>I am further informed by the Revenue Commissioners that self-employed taxpayers are required to claim tax relief for pension contributions in their annual tax returns.  Where Revenue, as part of its annual compliance programmes, using the REAP system or some other means, selects a particular return for examination, the Revenue auditor would, in appropriate cases, carry out verification checks on the person&rsquo;s pension tax relief claim to ensure that contributions were actually made and that the correct amount of tax relief was claimed.</p><p>Where employers deduct pension contributions from the wages/salaries of employees, Revenue, in carrying out checks on the proper operation of the PAYE system would, in appropriate cases, seek verification that pension tax reliefs were being correctly applied, including verifying that pension contributions, both employer and employee, were actually paid into the pension fund.</p><p>I am also advised that there is no evidence to suggest that the number of people claiming pension reliefs is out of line with the number contributing to pension schemes.</p></reply>

Ten firms are currently undertaking reviews of their Payment Protection Insurance (PPI) sales.

The aim of the pilot framework is to achieve sustainable and fair outcomes without the need for the borrower to enter the statutory insolvency process.  It is focused on enhancing cooperation between lenders of secured and unsecured debt in order to resolve distressed debt in a holistic manner at an early stage.</p><p>  The Central Bank&rsquo;s framework establishes a series of principles to be applied in debt restructuring solutions for borrowers.  In particular it outlines a &lsquo;Resolution Waterfall&rsquo; which sets out a series of debt affordability scenarios.  Treatments will be applied to the borrower&rsquo;s debts in order to establish the most appropriate and affordable modification that sets the borrower on a sustainable footing for the remaining period of the loans.</p><p>  The framework will be implemented on a pilot basis by participating lenders to 750 borrowers who are experiencing significant financial difficulty repaying the mortgage on the family home and who also have other unsecured debt.  The pilot scheme will run for three months from the end of June and will conclude with a thorough review of all results to evaluate the effectiveness of the framework in dealing with such cases and to determine next steps.</p><p>  To be eligible for the framework, a borrower must be co-operating with their lenders, as defined in the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA).  It will apply to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty but who have taken reasonable steps to maximise income and curtail expenditure.  All existing protections afforded by the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code and the CCMA will continue to apply to participating borrowers.  The Framework will not include borrowers with buy-to-let or business related debts.</p><p>  The Central Bank has advised that it has been agreed among the lender participants to use an independent third party service provider as the most appropriate way to engage with borrowers, whose consent to participate in the pilot will be sought.  Discussions are underway to determine the most appropriate provider and no decision on this matter has yet been made.  However due to the short timelines involved, an important consideration in the decision making process will be the ability of the provider to provide an effective and efficient service at short notice.</p></reply>

This increase is an international phenomenon. Fuel prices are driven by a number of factors including the price of oil on international markets, exchange rates, production costs and refining costs. The rise in oil prices over recent periods reflected additional factors such as geopolitical uncertainty in Northern Africa and the Middle East with potential supply disruptions.    The Exchequer yield from excise, as excise is set at a nominal amount, does not increase as the price of fuels increase. On the other hand, the yield from VAT per litre of fuel, as VAT is set as a percentage of the price, increases as the price of fuels increase.  It should be noted however that businesses are entitled to reclaim VAT incurred on their business inputs, including VAT incurred on fuel. For example, VAT incurred on auto-diesel and marked gas oil (MGO or green diesel) used in the course of business is a deductible credit for business in the Irish VAT system.</p><p>  The Deputy will also be aware that, in the context of Budget 2013, I provided for relief from excise duty on auto diesel for qualifying road transport and passenger transport operators. </p><p>  There are no plans for further taxation adjustments as to do so could lead to significant costs to the Exchequer.	</p></reply>

Ireland assumed the Director position on May of 2012 and holds this position until May of 2015 &ndash; over that period, Denmark holds the post of Alternate Director.  After May of 2015, the positions reverse for a further three years.   The current Irish representative on the Board of Directors of the EBRD is Mr Eoin Ryan who was initially appointed to the position of Alternate Director on 12 February 2010 and he took over the Director post in May 2012. His appointment on the Board is due to end on 1 July 2013.</p><p>The previous Irish representatives at the EBRD, and the dates on which they served, as per their letters of appointment, are set out in the table below:</p><p><table><tr><th>12/2/2010 to date</th><th>Eoin Ryan</th></tr><tr><td>12/2/2007 - 11/2/2010</td><td>Anne Counihan</td></tr><tr><td>17/7/2003 - 31/7/2006</td><td>Desmond O'Malley</td></tr><tr><td>17/7/2000 -16/7/2003</td><td>Michael Flynn</td></tr><tr><td>1/7/1997 - 16/7/2000</td><td>Tony Brown</td></tr><tr><td>3/5/1994 - 30/6/1997</td><td>Brian Hillery</td></tr><tr><td>20/5/1992 - 2/5/1994</td><td>Phelim Molloy</td></tr><tr><td>17/4/1991 - 19/5/1992</td><td>Pol O'Duibhir</td></tr></table></p><p>The salary of the Irish representative at the Board of Directors is paid directly by the Bank and is not contributed to by the State. Currently, the annual gross salary for Director and Alternate Director posts ranges between &pound;124,903 to &pound;131,574 and &pound;104,939 to &pound;111,074 respectively; depending on the personal circumstances of the incumbent.</p><p>There is no annual contribution to the Bank. In terms of any liabilities associated with Bank membership, Ireland's initial subscription amounted to paid in capital of &euro;9 million with callable capital amounting to &euro;30 million. In 1996, the Government agreed to subscribe to 3,000 shares in the First Capital Increase of the Bank, of which, 675 shares were paid in via eight equal instalments amounting to &euro;6.75 million. This brought Ireland's paid in capital up to &euro;15.75 million and callable capital up to &euro;44.25 million. Following a capital increase in 2010 and 2011, Ireland's paid in capital in the Bank increased to &euro;18.78 million (this increase was funded through the bank's own reserves) and callable capital increased to &euro;71.260 million (an increase of just over &euro;27 million).  Ireland&rsquo;s shareholding within the Bank is currently 0.3% following this increase.</p></reply>

This is sometimes referred to incorrectly as the Special Assignment Relief Programme. The provision applies where the individual is sent by his or her foreign employer to work in the State for that employer or for an associated company of that employer and continues to be paid from abroad. Under the provision, such individuals may have the tax on the income from the foreign employment that is attributable to duties of that employment exercised in the State reduced to the greater of the tax due on either (a) &euro;100,000 plus 50% of the income of the employment over that amount; or (b) the income from that employment remitted to the State (any tax deducted by the employer via the PAYE system is deemed to be a remittance).

It is expected that the 4 individuals who are not reported in the employer returns as receiving tax-free remuneration are expected to claim it when they submit Form 11 tax returns for 2012 in late 2013. It is also possible that not all employers have submitted a SARP return yet.

This average rate was compiled on the working assumption that taxation of this income source would be applied at each taxpayer&rsquo;s marginal tax rate, that is, at 20 % or at 41% as appropriate.  The Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) rate was not applied to the interest amount.   Income from these products is currently exempt from income tax so in working out the cost of the exemption one can make assumptions as to what tax rate should apply.  The information given in response to the Parliamentary Question on 30 April was in the context of the providing the cost of a number of reliefs and exemptions, which would apply either at the marginal rate or the standard rate of income tax, so an average marginal rate of tax was applied to the interest on savings certificates, savings bonds and national instalment savings to work out the costs of exempting the interest.</p><p>  As an alternative, one could assume that the income would be taxable at the higher rate of DIRT which applies to interest which is paid less frequently than annually.  In 2009, the year for which the figures were supplied, the higher rate of DIRT was 26% from 1 January to 7 April 2009 and 28% from 8 April to 31 December 2009.  On the assumption that the interest was paid evenly throughout the year, the estimated yield from applying the higher rate of DIRT to this interest income in 2009 would have been in the region of &euro;127.7 million.  The estimate does not take into account the fact that some account holders will be exempt from DIRT, including individuals aged over 65 years and whose total income, including the income subject to DIRT, is below the income tax age exemption limits (&euro;18,000 for a single individual and &euro;36,000 for a married couple or civil partners); and individuals who are permanently incapacitated, and whose tax credits cover their tax liability.</p><p>  The total interest paid under savings certificates, national instalment savings and index linked savings bonds in 2009 was &euro;465.04 million, whereas payments for those products in 2011 totalled just under &euro;164.83 million.  This would obviously affect the potential yield from applying tax on whatever basis to this interest.   	</p></reply>

Any gains attributable to that 7-year period will not be liable to capital gains tax when the property in question is ultimately sold. In order to qualify for the relief, any income, profits or gains from the properties must be subject to Irish income tax. In addition, the relief will not apply if arrangements have been put in place whose main purpose or one of whose main purposes is to secure a tax advantage, as defined in Section 546A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, and it can be shown that the relief would be less if such arrangements had not been put in place.</p><p>   The relief cannot be claimed until properties bought in the incentive period are sold after being owned for at least 7 years. Accordingly, as the incentive period has not expired, it is not possible to estimate the amount of tax lost to the Exchequer as a result of the relief. 	</p></reply>

As explained in Note 5 in the Explanation of Adjustments in the Pro Forma Transaction Impact Analysis, 80% of Central Bank surplus income is paid to the State as a dividend the following year. So, 80% of the contribution to the Central Banks surplus income in 2013 from the newly issued Government bonds will be paid over in 2014 and so on.  However, as the Deputy will be aware this new Central Bank income replaces surplus income arising from IBRC's Exceptional Liquidity Assistance (ELA) funding arrangement. The Pro Forma Transaction Impact Analysis clearly outlines the estimated net benefit to Central Bank income as a result of the promissory note restructuring.</p><p>  Turning specifically to the estimated dividend payment from the Central Bank of Ireland to the Exchequer, the estimate which underpinned Budget 2013 of &euro;1,040m was published as part of the Exchequer Borrowing Profile with the February Exchequer Returns. Since that time, the Central Bank have revised this figure upward to &euro;1,148m which has been reflected in the SPU arithmetic.</p><p>  Beyond this year, the estimates for the additional Central Bank surplus income arising from the promissory note restructuring as published in the Pro-Forma Analysis remain broadly valid although as the coupon paid on the replacement bonds is based on a floating rate, it would not be surprising if these estimates changed over time.  In respect of 2013 interest costs on the newly issued bonds, the current estimate is &euro;700m compared to the original estimate of &euro;800m. The original estimate was based on the assumption that the transaction would take place on 1 January 2013. The Central Bank is in the process of revising their estimate for dividends for 2014 and subsequent years.	</p></reply>

However, I am aware of a number of reports in the media where European Central Bank (ECB) officials, including President, Mr Mario Draghi, indicated that the ECB is considering buying asset-backed securities (ABS), among possible options to support lending to small and medium sized companies. I understand that President Draghi has said that the ECB's role in this would be mostly catalytic because the ECB works with the European Investment Bank (EIB) and with the EU Commission. I have no further details at this time.   As regards the EIB, it has highlighted SME financing as a priority for the Bank. On the domestic front, this has been evidenced when the EIB agreed to work with AIB in providing &euro;200 million for investment by small and medium companies across Ireland. This represents the latest EIB support for SMEs in Ireland since an earlier lending programme intermediated by AIB in 2011. This announcement coincided with a visit by the EIB President and the Management Committee to Ireland on 29 and 30 April 2013. The EIB delegation met with myself and a number of other Government Ministers including Minister Bruton where it was highlighted that access to funding for Irish SMEs is a priority for Ireland. </p><p>  The Deputy may be aware that Mr Werner Hoyer was appointed President of the EIB in January 2012. President Hoyer visited Ireland in July 2012. Since then there has been a deepening and widening of engagement between Ireland and the Bank. During this visit it was agreed with the Irish Authorities to establish a joint High Level Working Group (HLWG) to identify concrete and flexible mechanisms to enhance the Bank&rsquo;s support for Ireland&rsquo;s growth agenda. The EIB and Ireland are strongly committed to working together to enhance the Bank&rsquo;s activity in the country and this commitment is beginning to bear results. A solid outcome was achieved for 2012 with EIB group activity in the country approaching &euro;600m, representing an increase of over &euro;100m in 2012 over 2011 levels and covering a diversified range of sectors and transactions.	</p></reply>

The Central Bank (and its precursor the Currency Commission) has been paying its surplus income to the Exchequer since 1927 (Section 63(7) of the Currency Act 1927).    When Budget 2013 was being prepared, the Bank estimated that, as far as it could tell at that time, its surplus income in respect of 2012 would be &euro;1.040 billion and this figure was included in the budgetary arithmetic for 2013.

The maximum amounts which can be raised under the scheme are up to 80% of the cost of production for all budgets up to a maximum of &euro;50,000,000.</p><p>  Tax relief on 100% of their investment is available to individual investors and to corporate investors.</p><p>  Individual investors can invest up to &euro;50,000 under the scheme in any year of assessment and will be entitled to tax relief on that amount at their marginal rate of tax. An investor who cannot obtain relief on all his/her investment in a year of assessment, either because his/her investment exceeds the maximum of &euro;50,000 or his/her income in that year is insufficient to absorb all of it, can carry forward the unrelieved amount to following years up to and including 2015, subject to the normal limit of &euro;50,000 on the amount of investment that can be relieved in any one year.</p><p>  A corporate investor and any connected companies can invest up to &euro;10,160,000 in any 12 month period. The company will be entitled to a deduction, from its total profits, of the amount invested. There is provision for carry forward of an unrelieved amount. The total amount which can be invested by a company, in any one film, cannot exceed &euro;3,810,000.</p><p>  The Revenue Commissioners took over the certification of films qualifying for Film Relief in 2005 and my attention has not been drawn to any abuse in relation to films certified by them. Prior to then there was a number of tax avoidance schemes involving Film Relief which have been challenged by Revenue and the legislation has been changed as required over the years. </p><p>  Finance Act 2013 introduced changes to give Film Relief a new focus. The delivery mechanism of the incentive will change. Relief will not, in the future, be available to investors in qualifying films. Instead a payable tax credit of 32% will be paid directly by the Revenue Commissioners to a Producer Company, which produces a qualifying film. The legislation provides for measures to ensure that, in the event that the qualifying company does not satisfy any statutory conditions or conditions imposed by a film certificate issued by the Revenue Commissioners, any amount paid by the Revenue Commissioners can be recouped. </p><p>  The commencement of the section is subject to EU approval. The changes are expected to be effective from the 1 January 2016. The current scheme expires on 31 December 2015. </p><p>  The second question asks about the tax exemption for profits or gains from woodlands. The details in Parliamentary Question 20065/13 to which the Deputy refers relate to exemptions contained in Sections 232 and 140 of the TCA 1997. I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that profits or gains from the occupation of woodlands in the State managed on a commercial basis are exempt from Income Tax and Corporation Tax, (but not from the USC or PRSI) under Section 232 TCA 1997. Section 140 provides that distributions paid out of such exempt profits or gains are not regarded as income for the purposes of the Taxes Acts. The exemption granted to such profits, gains and dividends is, however, subject to the High Earners Restriction.  </p><p>  For chargeable periods commencing on or after 1 January 2004 details of all such profits, gains and losses must be included in the annual return of income to the Revenue Commissioners. The normal rules relating to the keeping of records and the making available of those records for inspection by the Revenue also apply</p><p>  Capital gains arising to an individual on the sale of woodlands are also exempt from CGT insofar as they relate to standing timber. Any gain attributable to the underlying land is subject to CGT. Companies and other bodies of persons are liable to CGT on gains arising from the sale of woodlands and standing timber.</p><p>  The Revenue Commissioners are not aware of any abuse of the scheme.</p></reply>

The surcharge is designed as a deterrent to encourage timely filings and payments, and compliance levels are positive.  The Irish self-assessment system ensures that there are tight controls in place for tax return filing and payment rates which are borne out by the 2012 statistics for timeliness of 98% for large cases, 96% for medium cases and 82% for all other cases, across all taxes. </p><p>  With reference to the current interest rate on late returns, I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that late filing surcharges apply to late returns whereas interest is charged on late payments.  The current rates of interest on late payments are 8% per annum or 0.0219% per day, on overdue income, corporation or capital gains taxes and 10% per annum or 0.0274% per day in respect of overdue fiduciary taxes such as VAT and PAYE/PRSI.</p><p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that given the high levels of return filing and payment compliance that were achieved in 2012, the targeted application of interest charges to cases with the most serious compliance issues is a strategy that has worked extremely well for the Commissioners and has brought about a sustainable change in compliance behaviour in a large number of cases.  In addition, it fits with Revenue&rsquo;s overall approach to compliance matters by deploying resources to the areas with the greatest risks and, the Commissioners further advise that applying interest charges in all cases of late payment would undermine what has been, on a consistent basis, a very successful compliance strategy. </p><p>  I fully support the balanced approach to collection by Revenue that tries to maximise voluntary compliance with a balanced approach to collection of arrears from businesses that run into temporary funding difficulties. Revenue&rsquo;s care and management provisions are provided for in legislation and are an integral part of the tax administration system.</p></reply>

A number of initiatives are being implemented at EU level in order to boost growth.  I believe the cumulative impact of all of these measures will be positive in terms of supporting economic activity in the EU at this difficult juncture.</p><p>  For instance, Heads of State or Government in the EU agreed on a compact for growth and jobs at the European Council in June last year.  This involves action by both Member States themselves and at EU level in order to boost growth, investment and employment.</p><p>  Measures to be implemented at the national level include the full implementation of the country-specific recommendations from the European Semester, including the pursuit of differentiated and growth-friendly fiscal consolidation, the restoration of normal lending to the economy and the promotion of competitiveness.  At an EU level, policies to promote growth include a renewed emphasis on deepening the Single Market and reducing the regulatory burden.  In addition, the recent EUR 10 billion increase in the European Investment Bank capital will allow the Bank to lend an additional EUR 60 billion to support growth and jobs and, together with the European Investment Fund, this will help to catalyse projects worth up to EUR 180 billion in 2013-2015 across the EU.</p><p>  Finally, considerable progress has been made at a euro area level to put the single currency on a more solid footing.  For instance, the establishment of the European Stability Mechanism and the ECB&rsquo;s announcement of Outright Monetary Transactions have helped restore confidence, while the enhanced system of governance will have a positive impact on economic activity and consequently on the labour market.	</p></reply>

This reflects <i>inter alia</i> the effect on demand of private sector deleveraging, fiscal consolidation and poor confidence.   For the EU as a whole and for the euro area, economic weakness is projected to continue this year, with GDP projected to contract by 0.1 and 0.4 per cent respectively.  Within the euro area, GDP is forecast to decline this year in eight of the Member States.  The European Commission is anticipating a modest recovering of the EU economy in the second half of the year, with the recovery gaining momentum next year.</p><p>  In relation to targets, I am assuming the Deputy is referring to the fiscal targets set under the excessive deficit procedure.  In this regard, some Member States may miss the deadline for correcting their excessive deficits due to the weaker economic environment.  I would point out, however, that there is scope to extend the deadline for correction in circumstances where the headline deficit is affected by weaker-than-expected growth.  These matters will be dealt with by EU Finance Ministers in the coming months.</p></reply>

The focus of Government is to achieve a successful exit from the Programme and a sustainable return to market based funding. We continue to meet the conditions set under the programme and our strong implementation record has been recognised by our external partners and has given confidence to the financial markets. We continue to move towards the goal of fully regaining durable and sustainable market access during 2013. The continuation of regular Treasury Bill auctions which recommenced last July, and our bond issues to date are positive steps in this direction. The issue, in January 2013 of an existing 5-year bond in an amount of &euro;2.5 billion at a yield of 3.32% and the issue in March 2013 of a new 10-year bond at yield of 4.15%  is a clear demonstration of this progress.   Ireland will be the first country to exit an EU/IMF programme of this type. In this context, discussions on Ireland&rsquo;s exit from the Programme took place during the recent 10th review mission and some further clarity on the possible options that might be available in terms of exit strategy was achieved.  All options will be considered in the light of what is appropriate for Ireland. Evidently, this will require further consideration and no decisions have been taken to date by Government. 	</p></reply>

GDP is projected to further increase by 1.3 per cent this year.</p><p>  The recovery of the Irish economy will continue to be led by the exporting sector which is forecast to grow by 2.3 per cent in 2013.  This, in no small part, will be aided by the improvements in price and cost competitiveness in recent years which are expected to continue into 2013.</p><p>  As a small, open economy that relies on trade and foreign direct investment, Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness is a particularly important factor in providing economic growth and jobs.  The Government continues to take steps to support Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness.  This includes the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the 12&frac12; per cent rate of corporation tax and to maintaining and enhancing our pro-business environment.  As a result, Ireland continues to attract inward foreign direct investment with the highest net job creation from this investment in a decade recorded last year. </p><p>  Labour costs in Ireland, relative to those in our main competitors, have improved substantially in recent years and are forecast to continue improving in the coming years.  For instance, the European Commission is forecasting that Ireland&rsquo;s nominal unit labour costs will have improved by 23 per cent relative to those in the euro area over the period 2008-2014.</p><p>  Consumer prices are continuing to register modest increases in line with the pattern over the last few years.  The headline HICP rate of 0.5 per cent recorded in April is the lowest in over two years.  Five years of inflation at or below the euro area average is continuing to contribute to competitiveness gains.</p><p>  Finally, strengthening competitiveness also involves implementing measures in other areas that have an effect on productivity.

The pillar banks are expected to lend to viable businesses in all sectors of the economy, including the manufacturing, service and retail sectors, and to address the needs of SMEs in financial difficulty. The Credit Review Office is available to assist businesses which have been refused credit. The Credit Review Office is currently overturning 55% of the refusal decisions referred to them and anyone who has been refused credit by the banks should avail of the services of the Office. </p><p>  Access to finance for SMEs is a key aspect of the Action Plan for Jobs 2013. It is the Government&rsquo;s vision that all viable businesses operating in Ireland should have the opportunity to access sufficient finance to meet their enterprise needs in a manner that supports growth and employment in the economy. </p><p>  The SME State Bodies Group was established in 2012 to both develop key policy initiatives to support SME access to credit and other forms of finance, and to ensure their implementation. It has continued in 2013 to engage intensively in proactively addressing issues associated with SME funding and financing in conjunction with the relevant stakeholders through the SME Funding Consultation Committee. My officials also meet frequently with additional stakeholders who wish to contribute to policy development in relation to access to finance. </p><p>  The Government has taken a number of actions, particularly where SMEs have been refused credit, to improve the situation in relation to credit availability to SMEs. </p><p>  The Temporary Partial Credit Guarantee scheme addresses the situation where the SME is outside the risk appetite of the banks. This can arise because the SME&rsquo;s lack of collateral or the banks&rsquo; lack of understanding of the business model, the market, the sector or the technology. The three main SME lenders are all participating in the Guarantee scheme. </p><p>  The Microenterprise Loan Fund Scheme will provide loans of up to &euro;25k to start-up, newly established, or growing microenterprises employing less than 10 people, who have commercially viable proposals that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by banks. 	</p></reply>

As regards the capacity of individual Member States to repay their sovereign debt, there have been a number of positive developments at EU level in recent years.  For instance, retro-fitting the euro area with the necessary tools to make it commensurate with a monetary union has been a vital step forward.  These governance reforms &ndash; including the reforms to the Stability and Growth Pact &ndash; will have a key role to play in containing fiscal imbalances in the future, and help to put the debt-to-GDP ratio on a downward trajectory, thereby improving the repayment capacity.</p><p>  In addition, the establishment of an effective backstop &ndash; initially in the form of the EFSF / EFSM and more recently in the ESM &ndash; provides, in appropriate circumstances, support to Member States in making the necessary economic and fiscal adjustments.</p><p>  Another development relates to the creation of a banking union, which is a priority and which is also an important part of the necessary reforms at EU level.</p><p>  In relation to whether or not initiatives such as Eurobonds are part of the solution, this is part of a wider debate at EU level on the future of EMU which is on-going.</p><p>  Finally, I would recall that the Heads of State or Government stated in June last year that it is imperative to break the link between banking debt and sovereign debt, and work is on-going at EU level to achieve this.	</p></reply>

This compares with an inflation rate of 1.2 per cent in the euro area as a whole. In fact, Irish inflation has now been below, or on par, with euro area inflation for every month since March 2008. This has led to significant cost competitiveness gains over this period, while also serving to protect real incomes.   Looking to the future, my Department expects inflation to remain at modest rates for the next few years. Indeed, the European Commission expects Irish inflation rates to be below European rates in both 2013 and 2014.</p></reply>

Post Leaving Certificate Centres provide further education courses up to Level 6 on the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ). However, my Department has facilitated the provision by BCFE of two courses accredited by third level institutions at Level 8 on the NFQ for a number of years and continues to do so as an exceptional measure.</p><p>  There is a need to ensure that further education resources are focused on the delivery of further education while at the same time maximising the progression opportunities for learners in further education to higher education.</p><p>  In relation to the reduction in the PLC pupil teacher ratio VECs were invited to forward impact statements to my Department on the effect of this regression on their PLC provision.  A review of all impact statements received including one from CDVEC was conducted having regard to the need to operate within overall budgetary constraints and the Employment Control Framework.  Following this review some alleviation of the reduction in teaching posts is being allowed as a transitional measure.  As a result of this CDVEC has been allowed retain ten whole time equivalent teaching posts, that it was due to lose under the new pupil teacher ratio allocation, for the 2013/2014 academic year.  Further distribution of these posts to schools and colleges under its remit is a matter for CDVEC.</p></reply>

The difficulties encountered on nine of these projects related to contractor insolvencies.  The termination of the contractor's obligation to complete the works on the tenth project was due to the contractor's default.  There was a bond in place for each of the ten projects.  The bond is used to cover costs that would otherwise accrue to the Employer (i.e. the Department, School, VEC etc.) on foot of a contractor's failure to complete the works.  As such the Employer's financial exposure is generally minimal.  Negotiations are ongoing with regard to a number of these projects and in some cases the full cost of re-tendering and completion of the works is not yet known.  The Deputy will appreciate that it is not possible to release commercially sensitive cost information which is currently the subject of negotiations.  To do so would undermine the Department's position with regard to such negotiations.</p><p>For the Deputy's ease of reference I am supplying details of the ten projects.</p><p><table><tr><th><div><b>County</b></div></th><th><div><b>Roll Number</b></div></th><th><div><b>School Name</b></div></th><th><div><b>Year in which issue arose</b></div></th><th><div><b>Reason for Re-tender </b></div></th></tr><tr><td><div>Kilkenny</div></td><td><div>61580P</div></td><td><div>Loreto Secondary School, Granges Road*</div></td><td><div>2012</div></td><td>Insolvency Event </td></tr><tr><td><div>Kildare </div></td><td><div>17674B</div></td><td><div>SN Aine Naofa, Ard Cloc, Straffan </div></td><td><div>2012</div></td><td>Termination due to Contractors Default </td></tr><tr><td><div>Dublin City</div></td><td><div>20139T</div></td><td><div>Inchicore NS, Sarsfield Road, Dublin 10</div></td><td><div>2011</div></td><td>Insolvency Event </td></tr><tr><td><div>Dun Laoghaire  Rathdown</div></td><td><div>70030E</div></td><td><div>Senior College, D&uacute;n Laoghaire, Eblana Avenue, D&uacute;n Laoghaire, Co Dublin </div></td><td><div>2011</div></td><td>Insolvency Event </td></tr><tr><td><div>Galway City</div></td><td><div>62970K</div></td><td><div>Col&aacute;iste Iogn&aacute;id SJ Bothar na Mara</div></td><td><div>2011</div></td><td>Insolvency Event </td></tr><tr><td><div>Limerick</div></td><td><div>13026P</div></td><td><div>Kilfinane National School </div></td><td><div>2011</div></td><td>Insolvency Event </td></tr><tr><td><div>Limerick City</div></td><td><div>64201T</div></td><td><div>Ardscoil Ris, North Circular Rd, Limerick</div></td><td><div>2011</div></td><td>Insolvency Event </td></tr><tr><td><div>Roscommon</div></td><td><div>65100S</div></td><td><div>Scoil Mhuire, Strokestown, Co Roscommon</div></td><td><div>2011</div></td><td>Insolvency Event </td></tr><tr><td><div>Offaly</div></td><td><div>17523D</div></td><td><div>SN Cronain Naofa, Dromakeenan</div></td><td><div>2010</div></td><td>Insolvency Event </td></tr><tr><td><div>Kildare </div></td><td><div>17662R</div></td><td><div>Scoil Bhride NS , Kill </div></td><td><div>2009</div></td><td>Insolvency Event</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Only one termination was due to issues not related to insolvency.  The contractor in question has not been successful in any tender competitions for major school building contracts since the termination date.  There are many reasons why a public works contract may be terminated and these are complex; due process has to be followed in each case.  School building projects are tendered in line with Department of Public Expenditure and Reform guidelines and public procurement procedures; these do not currently provide for sanctions where a previous contract has been terminated.</p></reply>

SNAs are allocated to schools in order to provide for the care needs of children with special educational needs attending such schools.   The NCSE operates within my Department's established criteria for the allocation of Special Education supports and the staffing resources available to my Department.</p><p>  I wish to advise the Deputy that SNAs are not allocated to individual pupils.  The NCSE allocates a quantum of SNA support for each school annually taking into account the care needs of all of the qualifying children enrolled in the school, and on the basis of the assessed care needs of the children.  It is a matter for schools to then allocate and manage these resources to assist children as their needs arise.</p><p>  All schools were advised to apply to the NCSE for resource teaching and SNA support for the 2013/14 school year by 15th March 2013.  The NCSE are currently processing these applications and schools will be notified by SENOs of their resource teaching and SNA allocation for 2013/14 in advance of the coming school year, based on the number of valid applications received.  All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.</p></reply>

In October 2012, the Department authorised the project to proceed to Stage 2b which includes applications for Planning Permission, Fire Safety Certificate, Disability Access Certificate and the preparation of tender documents.  Due to competing demands on the Department's capital budget, imposed by the need to prioritise the limited funding available for the provision of additional school accommodation to meet increasing demographic requirements, it was not possible to include this project in the five year construction programme announced last year.  Schools which have not been included in the five year construction programme, but which were  previously initiated will continue to be progressed to final planning stages in anticipation of the possibility of further funds being available to the Department in future years.  The building project for the school referred to by the Deputy remains available to be considered for progression in this context.</p></reply>

I understand that although the Children's Rights Alliance consulted with other groups on the content of the Report Card relating to Traveller children, it did not consult with my Department in relation to developments concerning Traveller education.  My Department would be keen to be consulted on future occasions in order to ensure a balance in the commentary as well as a currency of information.</p><p>  This Government, through its various interventions in the education sector, is committed to improved retention rates, better learning experiences and improved outcomes for all children, including children who are members of the Travelling community.  Recorded Traveller participation rates in education in recent years show an increase.  In the 2004/05 school year, approximately 1,850 Traveller pupils aged between thirteen and eighteen (inclusive) were recorded as enrolled in post-primary schools and this increased to 2,698 in 2011/12 school year.  The majority of Traveller students transfer from primary to post-primary education.  Participation rates in the junior cycle have steadily improved from 1,598 Traveller students recorded in 2004/05 to 1,898 in the 2011/12 school year.  The number of Travellers progressing to senior cycle has consistently improved in recent years from 260 in 2004/05 to 800 in 2011/12.  Some 25% of young Travellers leave mainstream post-primary education, before completion of the senior cycle.</p><p>  Current policy in relation to Traveller education is underpinned by the Report and Recommendations for a Traveller Education Strategy which was launched in 2006, following wide ranging consultation with relevant stakeholders including Traveller representative groups.  The Strategy covers, in a very comprehensive manner, aspects of Traveller Education from pre-school right through to further and higher education within a lifelong learning context.  The principle of inclusion is at the core of the Strategy and, accordingly, the focus of both current and future provision is on the development of a more inclusive school environment through the whole school planning process, teaching practice, admissions policies, codes of behaviour and whole school evaluation.  In keeping with this principle, additional resources provided in the education system are allocated on the basis of individual educational need rather than that of ethnic or cultural background.  Implementation of the Strategy is undertaken by the Department of Education and Skills in consultation with representatives of the Traveller community through the Traveller Education Strategy Advisory and Consultative Forum.</p></reply>

They will continue to be a feature of our education landscape.  As part of the Budget 2012 decisions, the number of pupils required to gain and retain a classroom teaching post in small primary schools is being gradually increased between September 2012 and September 2014.  During this period the pupil threshold for a 2-classroom school is being increased to 20 pupils.  In these extremely challenging times, all public servants are being asked to deliver our public services on a reduced level of resources and teachers in small schools cannot be immune from this requirement.  The phasing of these measures can provide the schools concerned with time to consider the potential for amalgamation with other schools where this is feasible. If amalgamations do take place, they will be voluntary and follow decisions taken by local communities and not by the Department.</p><p>  How best to sustain provision for widely dispersed and small Protestant communities does present as a particular challenge especially in any locality where enrolment in their schools is declining to single figures and amalgamation is not an option because there is no other school nearby. The Government is intent in fostering pluralism in school provision.  Supporting minority churches in maintaining their schools is part of that policy.</p><p>  A Value for Money examination of small schools is being carried out and my Department expects to publish the analysis and findings in the near future.  I hope that this report will foster constructive engagement both in the Oireachtas and among all interested parties in looking at the challenges ahead and how best to make provision for primary education in rural and dispersed communities.</p><p>  My Department and I will continue to engage with the relevant education sector stakeholders, including the Church of Ireland, in relation to education provision for all areas.  In addition to this my Department has expanded the existing appeals process so that it is accessible to the schools that are affected by the budget measure.  In this regard small schools will not lose their classroom post if they are projecting sustainable increased enrolments in September 2013 that would be sufficient to allow them to retain their existing classroom posts over the longer term.  The detailed arrangements in relation to the appeals process are set in the Department's Staffing Circular 0013/2013. The Appeals Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.</p></reply>

As far as my Department is aware neither Universities nor Institutes of Technology are planning to increase the academic year to a third semester and therefore no estimate is available of any potential savings that might be accrued from implementing such a measure.  As indicated to the Deputy previously, under the Croke Park Agreement revised contract hours were agreed for lecturers which has brought about the delivery of in excess of 250,000 extra lecturing hours annually.  Based on the most conservative figures for hourly pay rates, the total cost if those extra hours were paid for would be in the order of &euro;21.25 million annually.  My Department is continuing to work to ensure that further efficiency measures are achieved within the higher education sector.</p></reply>

The Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (DCENR) has responsibility for overall implementation of the plan and chairs the Cross-Departmental group tasked with ensuring that all the actions contained in the plan are delivered.</p><p>  In terms of energy efficiency in educational buildings, for the past fifteen years the Planning and Building Unit of my Department have been using a process called the DART approach to develop sustainability and energy efficiency.  This acronym focuses on four key areas, namely; Design, Awareness, Research and Technology.  The policy is informed by the Building Unit Professional and Technical staff, driven by its technical guidance documents and updated by continued energy research and development.</p><p>  My Department is at the forefront of design with respect to sustainable energy efficiency (including water conservation and efficiency) in school buildings and this performance has been recognised at both national and international level with sustainable energy awards for excellence in Design and Specification.  In conjunction with Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI), my Department has developed an &quot;Energy in Education&quot; website www.energyineducation.ie which I launched in October 2012.  The website is designed to help school boards of management, principals, teachers, administrators, caretaking staff, pupils and parents to improve energy use practices and to reduce school operating costs along with helping to protect the environment for future generations.  The principles of NEEAP supports the energy efficiency programme and approach of the Department of Education &amp;amp; Skills both in new build and with existing schools that saw significant investment through the Energy Efficiency Insulation Scheme 2009, the Water Conservation Scheme 2010 and the Summer works schemes.</p><p>  DCENR and SEAI have responsibility to collate all energy consumption data for the public sector and are presently testing the system that will facilitate this.  The data obtained from this process will help formulate energy upgrades to existing building stocks.  In parallel with this DCENR and SEAI are working on a National Energy Services Framework to be published shortly which will facilitate the development of an energy performance contracting (EPC) model for the upgrade of existing buildings; it is envisaged that this process will help identify the proposed models for delivery relating to schools.</p></reply>

The level of grant cannot be disclosed at this point as to do so could prejudice the tendering process.  In December 2012, the school was refused funding under the Emergency Works Scheme for repairs to the science laboratory as the scope of works for which funding was sought was outside the terms of the scheme. An emergency is deemed to be a situation which poses an immediate risk to health, life, property or the environment which is sudden, unforeseen and requires immediate action and, in the case of a school, if not corrected would prevent the school or part thereof from opening.</p><p>  The school was unsuccessful in its application for funding for curricular requirements under the 2011 Summer Works Scheme. Due to the scale of demand for funding under the scheme at that time, it was not possible to grant aid all applications. As applications for works in the higher categories were prioritised, it was not possible to include the school concerned in the list of successful applicants.</p></reply>

The policy of my Department is to secure the maximum possible level of inclusion of students with special educational needs in mainstream primary and post-primary schools, or where a special school or special class placement may be required to ensure such placements are provided for.</p><p>  Pupils with Down syndrome attending mainstream schools may receive additional teaching support in primary schools, either under the terms of the General Allocation Model (GAM) of teaching supports, if the pupil's educational psychological assessment places the pupil in the mild general learning disability/high incidence disability category, or through an allocation of individual additional resource teaching hours which are allocated by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), if the child is assessed as being within the low incidence category of special need, as defined by my Department's Circular Sp Ed 02/05.</p><p>  Pupils with Down syndrome may be allocated resources under the category of mild general learning disability, or under the categories of moderate general learning difficulty or Assessed Syndrome, in conjunction with another Low Incidence disability.</p><p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has a formal role under the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act, 2004 in advising me in relation to any matter relating to the education of children and others with disabilities.</p><p>  My Department requested that the NCSE consider the issue of whether Down syndrome should be reclassified as a low incidence disability in all instances, regardless of assessed cognitive ability, in the context of its preparation of comprehensive advice on how the educational system supports children with special educational needs in schools.</p><p>  The NCSE report on Supporting Children with Special Educational Needs in Schools has now been published and is available on the NCSE website www.ncse.ie. The report recommends that under the new resource allocation model proposed by the NCSE in its report, children should be allocated additional resources in line with their level of need, rather than by disability category.  The NCSE has recommended that in the short-term pupils with Down syndrome pupils who are in the Mild General Learning Difficulty (Mild GLD) category should continue to be supported by schools' Learning Support allocation in the same way as other pupils with a Mild GLD. </p><p>  However, the NCSE report states that it is confident that the introduction of a new allocation model will overcome the difficulty posed by all children with mild general learning disabilities, including children with Down syndrome, who have additional difficulties and who can be supported according to their level of need and in line with their learning plan process. In the meantime, schools are reminded that they can differentiate the level of learning support granted to ensure that available resources are used to support children in line with their needs.</p><p>  I have requested the NCSE to immediately proceed to establish a Working Group in order to develop a proposal for a new Tailored Allocation Model, which is set out as one of the principal recommendations of the report.</p></reply>

In keeping with this principle, additional resources provided in the education system are now allocated on the basis of individual educational need rather than that of ethnic or cultural background.</p><p>  Recorded Traveller participation rates in education in recent years show an increase. In the 2004/05 school year, approximately 1,850 Traveller pupils aged between thirteen and eighteen (inclusive) were recorded as enrolled in post-primary schools and this increased to 2,698 in 2011/12 school year.</p><p>  The majority of Traveller students transfer from primary to post-primary education. Participation rates in the junior cycle have steadily improved from 1,598 Traveller students recorded in 2004/05 to 1,898 in the 2011/12 school year. The number of Travellers progressing to senior cycle has consistently improved in recent years from 260 in 2004/05 to 800 in 2011/12. In 2012, 579 Travellers were enrolled on the VEC Youthreach programme and 672 Travellers participated in the Back to Education Initiative (BTEI). The estimated number of Travellers attending third level is 3% compared to 53% of the general population. The &lsquo;Equal Access&rsquo; survey of the ethnic and cultural backgrounds of entrants to higher education in 2010/11 indicates that 31 who identified as Travellers attended third level compared to 24 in 2008/09. This survey occurs on a voluntary and confidential basis as part of the annual registration process of twenty-seven higher education institutions and is co-ordinated by the HEA. As this survey is based on the principle of self - identification, the actual number of Travellers in third level could be higher.</p><p>  This Government, through its various interventions in the education sector, is committed to improved retention rates, better learning experiences and improved outcomes for all young people, including young people who are members of the Travelling community.</p></reply>

Further Education and Training is accessed by all manner of learners, ranging from adult learners to early school leavers. It is delivered in formal classroom settings and in less formal settings based in the community.  It is essentially a flexible form of education that can meet the diverse needs of learners in the most appropriate setting.</p><p>  Since the publication of the Bill a number of concerns have been raised regarding the definition of further education and training. I am aware that many providers want greater recognition of this dimension to be reflected in the legislation.</p><p>  At Committee Stage on 1st May, I undertook to examine the issue further.

The arrangements for the subsequent laying of documents before the Houses of the Oireachtas reflect this requirement and are consistent with the principles of good governance and transparency.</p><p>  The requirements for the timely production and submission of accounts of bodies and funds (Circular 4 of 2011) require that accounts of bodies or funds should be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas within three months of their being audited by the C&amp;AG. Departments are responsible for the compliance of all bodies under their aegis with these requirements and are required to ensure that all relevant bodies under their aegis are notified of and fulfil these requirements. The main provisions are as follows:</p><p>- The accounts or financial statements of bodies of funds under the aegis of Departments and Offices and audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General should be presented to the sponsoring Department by each body within one month of the audit certificate on the accounts being issued by the Comptroller and Auditor General, together with any report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on the accounts.</p><p>- Each Department is required to lay the audited accounts of bodies and funds under its aegis before the Houses of the Oireachtas within two months of such accounts being received by the Department, together with any report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on the accounts.</p><p>- Where a Department must first present these accounts to the Government, Departments are required to do this at the earliest opportunity and in such cases Departments must, in any event, lay the accounts of the body or fund before the Houses of the Oireachtas within three months of their being received by the Department.</p><p>- In the case of bodies which must first present their audited accounts at the Annual General Meeting of the body for adoption, the accounts should be sent to the parent Department within one month of the AGM at which the accounts are adopted, and if possible not later than three months after the Comptroller and Auditor General has issued the audit certificate on the accounts.</p><p>  In the context of the reference to private sector requirements, the reporting timeframes outlined above are shaped by public accountability requirements, taking account of the statutory framework for the production, audit and transmission of accounts. These arrangements are kept under review by this Department, in consultation with the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p></reply>

The Tribunal is one of the front-line services directly affected by the current turbulence in the labour market. The Tribunal hears claims under 18 separate pieces of legislation, some of which are lodged as direct claims to the Tribunal and others which come to the Tribunal by way of appeal or implementation of a Rights Commissioner&rsquo;s recommendation/decision.</p><p>I am informed that the current average waiting periods by region are as follows:</p><p><table><tr><th>Region</th><th>Average Waiting Times for Hearing</th></tr><tr><td>Dublin </td><td>70 weeks</td></tr><tr><td>Country Regions (outside Dublin)</td><td>79 weeks</td></tr></table></p><p>The Tribunal conducts hearings in about 31 locations. Where the number of cases is relatively small, the Tribunal may wait until a sufficient number of cases are on hand to make a visit worthwhile.  In such areas, 5 days of Hearings may reduce the &ldquo;waiting time&rdquo; in the area concerned by 30 to 40 weeks. I understand that the Tribunal targets areas with the longest waiting period and highest level of claims outstanding; within the resources it has currently available.</p><p>The Tribunal is pro-active in driving efficiencies.

My Department has had previous contacts with the Deputy's correspondent on this issue.</p><p>  Enterprise Ireland has a broad system of financial and non-financial supports in place to assist clients through all stages of the business development cycle. My Department has provided the Deputy's correspondent in this matter with the contact details of the relevant Development Adviser in Enterprise Ireland who is available to discuss his proposal with him and who can provide him with details of the supports available from Enterprise Ireland to entrepreneurs and early stage companies that have an innovative product, service or technology, and have the potential to achieve exports sales and create employment. These supports include:</p><p>  New Frontiers Entrepreneur Development Programme</p><p>  This national incubation programme offers successful applicants a package of supports to help accelerate their business development and to equip them with the skills to successfully start and grow a company.</p><p>  HPSU Feasibility Grant</p><p>  Used to investigate the viability and potential of an innovative/high potential start-up and the development of an Investor Ready Business Plan.</p><p>  Innovative HPSU Fund (Equity)</p><p>  The Innovative HPSU Fund allows Enterprise Ireland to offer equity investment to HPSU clients, on a co-funded basis to support the implementation of company business plans. First time and follow-on equity investments in HPSUs are supported under this offer.</p><p>  Mentor Grant</p><p>  Used to support the cost of a Mentor Assignment. Enterprise Ireland can match an entrepreneur with an experienced business mentor to assist the start-up phase or advise on specific areas of a company development plan.</p><p>  Innovation Voucher</p><p>  Innovation Vouchers, worth &euro;5,000, are available to assist a company to work with a registered college or knowledge provider to explore a business opportunity or technical problem. </p><p>  Internet Growth Acceleration Programme (iGAP)</p><p>  A 6 month intensive management development programme aimed exclusively at high potential internet/games companies. </p><p>  County Enterprise Board Funding</p><p>  As I outlined previously, funding from the County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) would be suitable for small start-up enterprises, such as those linked with the SIABH hub proposal. Eligible clients may qualify for a Priming Grant, which is a business start-up grant that is available to micro enterprises within the first 18 months of start-up. The grants are subject to certain criteria, such as commercial viability, avoidance of displacement of jobs elsewhere in the economy, creation of sustainable employment, etc. The typical Priming Grant payable is 50% of the investment or &euro;80,000, whichever is the lesser, although funding of up to &euro;150,000 may be provided in exceptional circumstances. Students wishing to engage with the local enterprise board following graduation may wish to note that the contact person for Dublin CEB is Greg Swift, CEO, 5th Floor, O'Connell Bridge House, Dublin 2, tel: 01-635 1144, email: gswift@dceb.ie, website: www.dceb.ie, although contact details for all CEBs are available on www.enterpriseboards.ie.&quot;</p><p>  Microenterprise Loan Fund</p><p>  It is a requirement of all approved applications that matching funding is available from the applicant for investment in the venture.  This requirement for matching funding is a proven technique in stimulating change, in that the commitment of entrepreneurs to development projects is significantly increased by virtue of the promoter having a financial interest in the success of the business. In this regard, the availability of the Microenterprise Loan Fund might be of benefit to Mr Bell&rsquo;s students in overcoming this condition.</p><p>  The Microenterprise Loan Fund was launched on the 27 September 2012 to improve access to credit for entrepreneurs and micro-enterprises and to facilitate the growth and expansion of viable businesses from all industry sectors which have been refused access to credit by banks.</p><p>  The Fund provides support in the form of loans of up to &euro;25,000, available to start-up, newly established, or growing microenterprises employing less than 10 people, with viable business propositions, that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by banks.

There is an obligation on receivers to comply with the legislative provisions applicable to them.  Sections 319 and 321 of the Companies Act 1963 provide that a receiver must send to the Registrar of Companies an abstract detailing the assets of the company of which he has taken possession, their estimated value, the proceeds of sale of any such assets and of his receipts and payments for each six months period following his appointment.  If a receiver makes default in complying with Section 319, or if applicable Section 321, he is guilty of an offence.  The offence may be prosecuted summarily or on indictment and the penalties are set out in Section 145 of the Companies Act 1990, as amended.</p><p>  From information contained in my reply today to the Deputy&rsquo;s Dail question in relation to numbers of filings of six-monthly abstracts in 2012, it would appear that receivers do not fail to file the required abstracts, but many fail to file them within the statutory deadline. While non-compliance with a statutory deadline is not desirable, the Companies Registration Office (CRO) is not in a position to prosecute every case of late filing of statutory submissions.  The CRO prioritises its limited enforcement resources towards the key compliance measure of securing the filing of Section 125 annual returns and financial statements by companies.</p><p>  Section 322 (1) (a) and (2) of the Companies Act 1963 provide that if a receiver fails to file returns, accounts or other documents which he is required to do by law, and fails within 14 days of the serving of a notice requiring him to do so, a creditor or member or the registrar of companies may apply to the court for an order directing the receiver to make good the default within such period as may be specified in the order. There is no provision applicable to a former business owner who is not a member or creditor.  Section 322 (3) provides that this does not affect the operation of any other enactment imposing penalties on receivers for similar statutory breaches to those set out in subsection (1).</p></reply>

Budget 2013 provided for the cessation of the &euro;300 cost of education allowance for new and existing BTEA participants from January 1st, 2013.  The practice of uprating those on means reduced payments up to the maximum personal rate of &euro;188 per week was discontinued for new entrants only from January 1st, 2013. A new maximum rate of &euro;160 per week for persons under 25 year olds who commence BTEA after 1st January 2013 was introduced. Those engaged with BTEA before 1st January 2013 and who are progressing, or who are mid-course will not be affected by the Budget changes relating to 'uprating'.</p><p>  The BTEA scheme remains an attractive scheme for social welfare recipients who wish to further their education.  A significant majority of those entering BTEA are in receipt of the maximum personal rate of payment of &euro;188 per week, which compares favourably with other State funded supports for those pursuing education.</p><p>  The Department has recently published a review of employment support schemes, including BTEA, and held a stakeholders' forum where review recommendations were discussed.

Assessments of eligibility are based on medical reports and other evidence furnished by the applicant and the applicant's treating physician. The assessment is made in accordance with the Department's evidence-based medical guidelines and protocols.  Applicants who are not satisfied with a given decision have the right to request a review of that decision by a deciding officer or of appeal to the independent social welfare appeals office.</p><p>  The person concerned originally applied for invalidity pension on 27 February 2012.  The claim was awarded up to 2 May 2012, when the person in question claimed jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit and, subsequently, commenced a FETAC course.</p><p>  On 15 April 2013 this department received a claim for invalidity pension from the person concerned, with a request for consideration of backdating to 21 January 2013 &ndash; the date on which he ceased participation on the FETAC citing medical reasons.  The evidence provided by the claimant in support of his claim was examined by a medical assessor who was of the opinion that the person concerned is not eligible for invalidity pension as he does not satisfy the medical conditions.  A deciding officer disallowed the claim and the person concerned was notified of this decision and the reason(s) for it on 20 May 2013 and of his right to a review of the decision or to appeal to the social welfare appeals office.</p><p>  All of the relevant evidence in this case has been submitted to another medical assessor for further review and the outcome is expected shortly.  Upon receipt of the opinion of the medical assessor, a deciding officer will decide whether a revised decision to award the pension is warranted and the person in question will be notified directly of the result.</p></reply>

This will begin in 2014 with the abolition of the State pension (transition) thereby standardising State pension age for all to 66 years. The State pension age will be further increased to 67 years in 2021 and to 68 years in 2028. These changes apply to all fully insured employees, including some public servants.</p><p>  Public servants (including civil servants) who are due to retire aged 65 in January 2014 will be able to draw their occupational public service pension at age 65.  The changes regarding State pension (transition) will have no impact on public servants (including civil servants) who are on modified social insurance.</p><p>  However, for those public servants (including civil servants) who are fully insured, their public service pensions (and contributions) are, like many occupational pension schemes, integrated (or co-ordinated) with social welfare benefits.  This means the occupational pension paid is based on the assumption that the pensioner also receives the State pension (transition or contributory).</p><p>  Where this does not happen, a discretionary supplementary pension may be payable under the relevant public service pension scheme to bridge the gap.  In this instance, a supplementary pension is only payable where the individual, through no fault of their own, does not qualify for social welfare benefit or qualifies at less than the maximum personal rate.  It is therefore necessary to claim any available social welfare benefits in order to receive a supplementary pension.  This situation is not new and already applies to public sector workers who have a retirement age below 65.</p><p>  For other workers, the main social welfare payments available to those who leave employment before pension age are jobseekers benefit and job seekers allowance.  Persons aged between 65 and 66 years are generally entitled to receive payment up to the date on which they reach pensionable age (66 years).</p><p>  It should be noted that until the 1970s, the standard age for receipt of State pension was 70 years of age. Increasing longevity and significant improvements in health status mean that people can work longer to support themselves in retirement. Raising State pension age and the abolition of the State pension (transition) is a necessary step in ensuring the sustainability of pensions into the future.

Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.</p><p>  The homemaker's scheme makes qualification for the State pension (contributory) easier by disregarding time spent out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme was introduced in and took effect from 1994.  Eligibility for the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme is conditional on firstly meeting the standard qualifying conditions for State pension.</p><p>  There are no plans to review the effective date for this scheme as backdating the scheme further than 1994 would involve considerable costs.  The 2007 Green Paper on Pensions indicated that to back-date the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme to 1953, the year when the unified system of social insurance was introduced in Ireland, would cost the Exchequer in the region of &euro;160 million. Costs in relation to this scheme, under the current rules, are expected to increase in the coming years due to the increase in female employment rates since 1994.</p><p>  In relation to women and social insurance payments, it is worth noting that the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund confirms that the Fund provides better value to female rather than male contributors.  Those with lower earnings and those with shorter contribution histories, mostly women, have and will continue to obtain the best value for money from the Fund.  The social solidarity principle which underlies the Fund is reflected in the fact that, for those at the higher end of the income distribution, the Fund is redistributive and they generally get back less than they pay in.</p><p>  While my Department will keep the homemaker's scheme under review, any improvements which could result in further costs for the Exchequer could only be considered in a budgetary context in an improved fiscal environment.</p></reply>

This is in line with wider Government policies and objectives such as better public services, better and more effective ePayments and is aligned to the objectives of the National Payments Plan published by the Central Bank recently. The progression to electronic payments is a critical element of the National Payments Plan which aims to reduce the very high levels of cash usage in the Irish economy, thereby contributing to improved national competitiveness.</p><p>  All welfare customers paid through the post office network are paid in cash.  This is an inherently expensive means of paying customers.  This approach is inefficient, costly and imposes security risks on customers and staff alike who handle, distribute and receive these monies. The Government needs to move to more modern approaches for distributing these vast sums of money to customers weekly.</p><p>  As the current contract with An Post expires at the end of 2013, the Department is undertaking two public procurement competitions for the delivery of welfare payments and will provide for progression over time from cash to electronic payment methods.</p><p>  The first procurement for over the counter cash services for social welfare customers commenced in December 2012 and is now well advanced.  This will replace the existing service contract with An Post and will ensure continuity in the delivery of cash payments to the Department&rsquo;s almost 1 million cash payment customers.  I anticipate a contract for these services will be signed by the summer and will provide similar services to customers to those they currently enjoy.  The term of the contract will be for a two year period up to 31 December 2015.  The contract may be extended, for one or more period(s) of twelve months each, up to a maximum of six years in aggregate.  The services being procured under this RFT will be for a transitional period as the Department progressively increases levels of electronic payments.</p><p>  In addition, and to further support the migration towards electronic payments, the Department will be procuring an ePayment solution(s) to complement the existing facility to make payments directly into customers&rsquo; accounts in financial institutions. It is anticipated that notification regarding this procurement will issue by end June 2013 and a new electronic payment method will be in place for customers towards the end of 2014.</p><p>  Public sector contracts for the supply of products and services are generally subject to a competitive tendering process. This ensures that the taxpayer receives value for money and ensures that all potential suppliers are given the opportunity to put forward the most efficient, effective and competitive solutions for consideration and evaluation. The award of public sector contracts with a significant financial value is subject to various EU Directives. Because of the financial value of this particular service, the Department was required to publicly invite tenders for the new contract to deliver social welfare payments when the current contract with An Post expires at the end of this year.</p><p>  I am conscious of the important role of the post offices around the country, notably the extent to which it is now a one stop shop where people can pay bills, purchase mobile phone top ups, use the passport application facility, pay local property tax and carry out a range of banking and other financial services.  The Government has stated its commitment to maintaining the post office network in the Programme for Government.</p></reply>

The Department's objective in this area is to raise educational and skills level among the long term unemployed, in order to help them to meet the requirements of the labour market. The back to education programme was introduced to provide a comprehensive range of options from which an unemployed person can choose, or be directed to, the most appropriate for his/her needs. Amongst the supports available are the back to education allowance scheme (BTEA) and the part time education option (PTEO). These supports may be available to persons on qualifying social welfare payments. Courses leading to a qualification as a special needs assistant may be eligible for both these schemes. </p><p>  A  person wishing to pursue a course of study under the back to education allowance will have to satisfy a number of conditions such as being a certain age, in receipt of a prescribed social welfare payment for a specified time period, pursuing a full time course of study leading to a recognised qualification in a recognised college and progressing in the level of education held by the client with reference to the national framework of qualifications among others. BTEA is essentially a social welfare replacement income which is paid in lieu of the relevant social welfare payment that qualifies the applicant for participation in the scheme.  </p><p>Courses of education from second level to Higher diploma level (H Dip) in any discipline (level 8 in the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ) or a Professional Diploma in Education (Primary and Secondary Teaching; level 8 in NFQ) are eligible courses. Some private colleges are recognised for back to education allowance purposes provided the course being pursued has HETAC , FETAC or Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI) recognition<b>.</b></p><p>  However, if a person wishes to pursue a part time education course they may be able to do so while retaining their jobseekers payment under PTEO of the back to education programme.  They must apply at their local social welfare office and verify that participation on the course does not reduce their availability for work and that they are genuinely seeking work.  </p><p>  The Department of Social Protection does not offer specific income supports for students outside of the back to education programme and there are no plans to provide additional funding other than the back to education programme for courses leading to a special need assistant qualification.</p></reply>

In order to increase activation capacity the Department is considering the contracting of employment services to complement the existing capacity of the department.  In that regard, the Department engaged the Centre for Economic and Social Inclusion (CESI) in November 2012 to provide expert advice and assistance with the design and delivery of a contracted employment service model. The consultants recently produced a report and this is currently being evaluated. I expect the evaluation to be completed in the near future. The question of tendering for the provision of additional activation services will be then considered by Government. </p><p>  As part of its current employment service provision, the Department already contracts with external providers for the delivery of both the Local Employment Service (LES) and Job Clubs.  Employment services, including career planning, engagement with employers and job search assistance, are provided under contract by these organisations to clients who are activated by the Department.  The Department funds this contracted provision to the value of approximately &euro;25m per annum and these organisations employ approximately 390 staff, who are engaged in the provision of these services.</p><p>  In addition, the Department intends to significantly increase its own complement of activation case workers by redeploying staff from other activities. The number of such case workers should rise from c.300 to c.600 by the end of the year.</p></reply>

The State pension age will be further increased to 67 years in 2021 and to 68 years in 2028. </p><p>  For workers who retire at 65 and who cannot or do not wish to remain in the workforce, the main social welfare payments available to those who leave employment before pension age are jobseeker's benefit and jobseeker's allowance.  Persons aged between 65 and 66 years are generally entitled to receive payment up to the date on which they reach pensionable age (66 years).<b></b>  Any jobseeker's benefit recipient may be subject to activation measures.</p><p>  It should be noted that until the 1970s, the standard age for receipt of State pension was 70 years of age. Increasing longevity and significant improvements in health status mean that people can work longer to support themselves in retirement. Recent pension reforms including the raising of State pension age and the abolition of the State pension (transition) are necessary steps in ensuring the sustainability of pensions into the future.  The recently published OECD report on the Review of the Irish Pension System confirms that reforms are necessary if we are to continue to put pension provision on a sustainable footing given the changes in demographics, the deficit in the Social Insurance Fund, and the difficult fiscal situation.</p></reply>

Donegal.  There are offices in Ballyshannon, Letterkenny, Buncrana, Carndonagh, Dungloe, Milford and Donegal Town as well as a number of outreach services.  </p><p>  Between 2002 and  February  2011, a full time information officer service was provided  in Buncrana. The combination of funding available under the  Jobs Initiative Scheme operated by Inishowen Development Partnership Ltd and a funding allocation from Donegal CIS equivalent to a 0.5 post allowed for the delivery of a service five days a week in Buncrana Citizens Information Centre.</p><p>  Since February 2011, the Jobs Initiative Scheme resource is no longer available.  In order to provide a service in Buncrana,  Donegal CIS reallocated resources to provide cover on two days each week pending recruitment to fill the 0.5 post allocated to the Centre.  Following recruitment in October, a part-time Information Officer has now been permanently allocated to the Buncrana office so that a service can be provided on three days per week.  In addition to this permanent part time Information Officer, a second Information Officer works in Buncrana CIS for 1.5 days per week. </p><p>  Information and assistance on the range of services and schemes offered by my Department can be obtained in Buncrana Social Welfare Local Office.</p><p>  Donegal CIS also provides targeted information sessions to local groups and communities where a need is identified or to meet specific requests.  </p><p>The Citizens Information Board operates a national helpline, telephone 0761 07 4000, which provides a comprehensive and confidential information service to people throughout the country, Monday to Friday from 9am to 9pm.  Further information is provided on a broad range of subjects on the citizen's information website   , which aims to meet customer demands for fast, easy access to comprehensive information on rights and entitlements.</p><p>  While the number of callers to the service has increased by approximately 8% in recent months, local management, by actively monitoring demand and keeping the level of service under ongoing review, is satisfied that the current level of available resources allocated to Buncrana CIS is adequate to meet service needs.</p></reply>

This was in keeping with the recommendations of Justice Quirke following the Peatlands Forum and with the motion agreed unanimously by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 7th March, 2012.</p><p>  RPS consultants have been engaged to carry out the necessary scientific work to underpin the National Raised Bog Special Areas of Conservation Management Plan and to inform the future restoration and management of each of the raised bog SACs.  This work is being overseen by an independent steering group with input from the Peatlands Council. Draft proposals for each of the sites will be discussed with affected parties as part of this process. </p><p>  I am determined that, in collaboration with the Peatlands Council and local turf-cutting communities, substantial progress will be made on the plan over the coming months.  My Department has stepped up contact with turf-cutting groups to seek long-term solutions to the issues for their particular bogs, in compliance with EU and national law.  I hope that with the constructive engagement of local turf-cutting communities, the draft Plan can be completed by November, in time to submit an application to the European Commission under Article 6(4) of the Habitats Directive, if required, prior to the 2014 cutting season.</p><p>  It should be noted that my Department, with oversight by the Peatlands Council, is also preparing a separate overall national Peatlands Strategy to guide the Government's approach to the management and conservation of all Ireland's peatlands.</p></reply>

The surveys indicated probable high levels of movement within these waters which made estimating the population difficult.</p><p>  Preliminary analysis of samples taken from the Barrow Transitional Water indicates a mean eel age of 9 years ranging from 4 to 15 years old.  The average growth rate is 3.78 cm per year. The high growth rate confirms the importance of the transitional waters as a productive habitat for eels.</p><p>  The surveys provided important data, but estimating silver eel escapement/production for transitional waters remains extremely challenging.  This is because of the difficulties in obtaining density estimates for eels in large water bodies and quantifying the migratory habits of eels moving upstream into the rivers and/or leaving the transitional water as silver eel.</p><p>  To overcome these challenges a clearer indication of the movement habits of eels in estuaries and expanding knowledge of population density is now required.  Therefore the research priority now is to continue the eel tagging studies undertaken in 2012 into 2013 rather than repeat the previous surveys.</p><p>  It is critical for all concerned that knowledge on eel movement within the estuary is developed and improved and for that reason acoustic tagging and tracking studies are paramount.  However,I am advised by IFI that if further eel survey work is required after the tagging programme, they will again consider a role for fishermen in that context.</p></reply>

Prices in the electricity retail market are fully deregulated and similarly for gas, except in the case of BGE tariffs for domestic consumers.  Customers can therefore avail of competitive offerings from electricity and gas suppliers.  Prices are set by suppliers and are commercial and operational matters for them.  I have no statutory function in the setting of electricity or gas prices.</p><p>  With regard to the regulation of gas prices the position is that up until 1 October 2011 the CER regulated Bord G&aacute;is Energy tariffs for its residential and smaller business customers but price regulation for the latter group ended at that point.  The CER still regulates the Bord G&aacute;is Energy tariffs for its residential customers.  The timing for complete deregulation of the residential segment of the gas market, as has taken place in the electricity market, is an issue under active review by the CER.</p><p>  Electricity and gas costs in Ireland are influenced by various drivers, including global gas and oil prices, the costs of capital, exchange rate fluctuations, the small size of the Irish market, geographical location and low population density.  Global gas and oil prices are by far the most significant factor in the case of Ireland. Prices have risen sharply since the start of 2011 driven by events in the Middle East, North Africa and Japan and demand from China and India.  Ireland is at the mercy of international fossil fuel prices which dictate the retail price of electricity.</p><p>  At a national level, the competitive energy market in place helps put downward pressure on prices.  In addition, we must focus on all possible additional actions to mitigate costs for business and domestic customers, including rigorous regulatory scrutiny of the network costs component of retail prices.</p><p>  I am committed to working with enterprise and with the energy sector to ensure that the costs of energy are as competitive as possible.  In this context, promotion of energy efficiency measures is an area within our control where action can be taken to reduce energy costs.</p><p>  Energy efficiency represents a significant opportunity for both businesses and households to reduce their energy costs.  There are energy efficiency measures in place to assist both business and domestic energy consumers, with significant funding allocated to them.  The Energy Efficiency Fund, which I announced in February and which will commence funding specific measures in the near future, will assist energy efficiency projects in the public and commercial sectors.</p><p>  Promotion of indigenous sustainable sources of energy will help offset the impact of volatile fossil fuel prices. The Government has a target of 40% of electricity being generated from renewable sources envisaged by 2020.

I have no direct statutory function in relation to connections to the gas network.</p><p>  In 2006, the CER approved a new network connections policy which enabled reassessment of the feasibility of connecting certain towns to the gas network.  This policy was updated in 2011.  In order for any town to be connected to the gas network, certain economic criteria need to be satisfied as a prerequisite.</p><p>  The policy allows for the appraisal of a town either on its own or as part of a regional group of towns.  The policy framework provides that, over a certain period, the costs of connecting a town, or group of towns, to the network are recouped through the actual economic consumption of gas and the associated tariffs.  Otherwise, uneconomic projects will increase costs for all energy consumers.</p><p>  Having regard to the CER policy on new towns connections, Bord G&aacute;is Networks, and more recently Gaslink, have carried out a comprehensive review of towns not connected to the national gas network.  In April 2010, Gaslink published its 'New Towns Analysis Phase 3'<i></i>  report.  The study included a review of the feasibility of connecting 11 towns in the West and North West region, including Sligo town.  However, the Gaslink report found that none of the towns qualified for connection on economic grounds.</p><p>  Nevertheless, Gaslink continues to review towns which did not qualify for connection under the Study and other towns on an ongoing basis.  The key factor which would qualify a town or group of towns in any future review would be a significant increase in demand for natural gas, probably resulting from the addition of a new large industrial or commercial facility.</p><p>  Where, taking account of CER decisions on new towns connections, it is determined that a town qualifies for such a connection, it is then a matter for BGE to determine the optimum funding option, which may include any available EU funding mechanisms, having regard to statutory limits and controls on expenditure.</p></reply>

The Scheme offers a basic broadband service, in line with EU State aid clearance, to fixed residences and businesses located within certain designated rural areas.  Under the terms of the contract which my Department has in place with &#8220;3&#8221;, the NBS service provider, the NBS mobile wireless service is required to offer minimum download and upload speeds of 2.3Mbps and 1.4Mbps respectively, subject to a maximum contention ratio of 18:1.  The NBS satellite service, which is utilised in a small number of cases for technical reasons associated with the location of the premises, offers minimum download and upload speeds of 3.6Mbps and 384 kbps respectively, subject to a maximum contention ratio of 48:1.</p><p>  The Rural Broadband Scheme (RBS) was launched in 2011 in recognition of the fact that despite the widespread availability of broadband throughout Ireland, there still remained individual premises that were unable to receive broadband provision.  This Scheme was aimed at making a basic broadband service available to un-served premises in rural areas, not already covered by the NBS.  Commercial service providers were in a position to offer services to all applicants from County Louth under the Scheme who agreed to engage with them.</p><p>  Details of the service providers who operate in County Louth can be found on ComReg's website at   , while more detailed information on the broadband products offered by these service providers should be available on their respective websites.</p><p>  I also referred in my response to Parliamentary Question No. 407 of 14 May last to the formal mapping exercise being undertaken by my Department.

The market has since developed into a well-regulated market, supporting a multiplicity of commercial operators, who provide services over a diverse range of technology platforms.  Details of broadband services available in each County, including County Cork, can be found on ComReg's website at .</p><p>  Decisions by private operators relating to investment in infrastructure, including the upgrading of broadband services, are taken purely on commercial grounds, having regard to the cost of service provision and the anticipated revenue returns from any such investment.  You will appreciate, therefore, that I do not have a role in this regard.</p><p>  The State can only intervene to ensure access to broadband services in areas where the competitive market has failed to deliver such services, as in the case of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS) and the Rural Broadband Scheme. </p><p>  With basic broadband services widely available across Ireland, the focus is now on accelerating the roll out of high speed services.  The Government's National Broadband Plan, which I published in August last, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed services of at least 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses, well in advance of the EU's target date of 2020, and that significantly higher speeds are available to as many homes and businesses as possible.</p><p>  During the preparation of Ireland's National Broadband Plan, the commercial market operators indicated that they expect to provide 70Mbps to 100Mbps services to 50% of the population by 2015.  Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway in both fixed line and mobile high speed broadband services, particularly in urban and semi-urban areas.</p><p>  The Government is also committed in the Plan to investing in areas where high speed services are not commercially viable and will not be provided by the market.  In an important milestone towards delivery of this commitment in the Plan, my Department has appointed experts to assist it in the design, planning and procurement of the State-led investment.  Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations including stakeholder engagement will be ongoing throughout 2013 with a view to the launch of a procurement process in 2014.</p><p>  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, we are committed to increasing the availability of next generation speeds significantly, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in a digitally enabled society.</p><p>  I would reiterate that the Government remains committed to ensuring that all parts of Ireland, including Castletownbere, County Cork, will have at least 30Mbps connectivity, through public or private sector investment, as outlined in the National Broadband Plan.</p></reply>

The Housing Aid for Older People measure provides increased levels of grant assistance for a suite of works which are similar in nature to those previously assisted under the SHAE . I have no proposals to reintroduce the SHAE.</p><p>  On 22 February I announced capital allocations to local authorities under the suite of Grants for Older People and People with a Disability amounting to &euro;42.750 million. In allocating the available funding across all 34 city and county councils I did so in as transparent and as fair a way as possible. In framing the 2013 allocations, my Department wrote to each local authority requesting details of the numbers and value of grants where work had been approved to commence. Between them, local authorities reported contractual commitments in respect of approved grants totally &euro;18 million. This year I allocated local authorities the full amount of their contractual commitments in the first instance. The balance of the available funding was allocated on the basis of each authority&rsquo;s share of the new applications on hand in January 2013. </p><p>  In order to deal with any acute or particular difficulty which might arise in the operation of the schemes over the course of the year I set aside a small capital reserve. I recently approved supplementary allocations totalling &euro;1.2 million for 13 local authorities. I will consider further applications from local authorities where similar difficulties have arisen. </p></reply>

The statement emphasises a housing-led approach which is about accessing permanent housing as the primary response to all forms of homelessness. The availability and supply of secure, affordable and adequate housing is essential in ensuring sustainable tenancies and ending long-term homelessness.   </p><p>  When I published the statement I announced a set of indicators which will be used to demonstrate the dynamics of homelessness as it is addressed. These indicators will give a clearer picture of homelessness in Ireland and, in quantifying its on-going extent, will support the bringing forward of realistic and practical solutions.   </p><p>  While it is clear that a proportion of funding must be used to provide sufficient bed capacity to accommodate those in need of emergency accommodation, it is equally important that resources are channelled to deliver more permanent responses in a more focused and strategic way. The arrangements for devolving homelessness funding to the lead housing authority in each of the 9 regions in 2013 will seek to ensure that the measures being pursued by housing authorities reflect the housing-led approach, that actions are in place towards achieving the target of ending long-term homelessness by the end of 2016 and that evidence to support progress will be presented through the reports on the indicators.   </p><p>  While the Homelessness Policy Statement I published is focussed on adult homelessness, that is individuals of 18 years of age or older, my colleague the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs is currently overseeing a review of the Youth Homelessness Strategy. The Health Service Executive leads on the implementation of the Youth Homelessness Strategy and is also responsible for the provision of health related and social care services for homeless individuals, including some services oriented specially at individuals in the under 25 age group. </p></reply>

The Local Government Management Agency is administering the Household Charge system on a shared   service/agency basis for all county and city councils.   </p><p>  I understand from data provided by the Agency that as of 1 5 May 2013 the total number of registrations for the Household Charge is 1, 234,637 .

The Guidelines elaborate on the physical development policies for rural areas as set out in the Government's <i>National Spatial Strategy</i> (2002) which, <i>inter alia</i>,<i></i>promotes sustainable rural settlement as a key component of delivering more balanced regional development.  The Guidelines set out how planning authorities should frame their development plan policies for the different types of rural areas which may exist within the development plan area, such as rural areas close to large towns and cities or those suffering from population decline.  They also provide guidance to planning authorities on dealing with planning applications for rural housing including consideration of issues such as exceptional health circumstances.</p><p>  The application of the provisions of the Guidelines in an individual case is a matter for the relevant planning authority, or An Bord Plean&aacute;la, where appropriate.</p><p>I have no plans to provide a means for planning applications based on medical circumstances to be considered centrally.

In addition, the Act contains provisions relating to the setting of rent and rent reviews and sets out the procedures and notice periods that must be complied with when terminating a tenancy.

The statutory certificates of completion underpinning the procedures outlined must be signed by a registered professional i.e. a person who is included on the statutory registers of architects or building surveyors maintained in accordance with parts 3 and 5 respectively of the Building Control Act 2007 or on the register of chartered engineers established under the Institution of Civil Engineers of Ireland (Charter Amendment) Act 1969. </p><p>  Architects, Building Surveyors and Chartered Engineers are the construction professions typically involved in the design of construction works in Ireland. It is open to persons who possess the requisite experience and competence in the design of buildings to seek inclusion on either of the statutory registers of architects or building surveyors as established under Part 3 and Part 5 respectively of the Building Control Act 2007. Inclusion on either register will enable a person to sign statutory certificates of compliance as provided for under the new regulations when they come into effect on and from 1 March 2014. Given that the regulations were signed into law on 8 March 2013, a reasonable period of transition has been given during which persons who may be entitled to inclusion on either register may now seek to so register. There is no question of unregistered persons being allowed to sign statutory certificates of compliance when they come into effect on and from 1 March 2014. </p><p>  I have <font color="#333333"> </font> recently asked Mr. Garrett Fennell, Solicitor, who is currently serving as the Chairperson of the Admissions Board relevant to the register of Architects, to carry out an independent review of the experience to date in relation to the operation of the register with a view to identifying any further improvements that can be made at this point.  The terms of reference for the review specifically address the matter of how the registration of practically trained architects can be further encouraged and I look forward to any recommendations and views the review report may offer in this regard in the coming months.      </p><p>  My Department will continue to work closely with the professional bodies, including the RIAI and the Construction Industry Federation to ensure a smooth transition to the new arrangements for the control of building activity. The RIAI has not to date raised any concerns     with the Department along the lines referred to in the question. </p></reply>

Neither of the matters to which Deputy Doherty refers impact upon the considerations which resulted in the Government taking the decision which it did.   It will be recalled that those considerations involved a substantial concern that any legislative scheme involving interference in the contractual relationships of private parties would find it extremely difficult to survive a Constitutional challenge.  In addition, the Government was advised that any model proposed would require the payment of compensation to landlords whose rights were infringed in order to ensure that the proposal would be compatible with the Constitution and with the European Convention on Human Rights. </p><p>  With regard to providing assistance to businesses in relation to this matter, absent legislative intervention, NAMA is playing a role in dealing with problems caused by upward only rent reviews applying to NAMA properties.   I have been advised that, by end-April 2013, the Agency had granted 222 applications for rent abatement with an aggregate annual value of about &euro;14 million which represents the annual value of rent due to NAMA that it has agreed to forego in order to help businesses survive.  A further 52 applications were under review at that date.  Of the 284 eligible applications received only 10 have been refused representing a 96% approval rate by NAMA.   The practice of NAMA in this area is one which I would commend to landlords in the commercial property market and in the retail sector in particular.</p><p>  More generally, the importance of supporting the retail sector is widely recognised across a range of Government Departments.   I would draw the attention of Deputy Healy-Rae to the Action Plan for Jobs which lies within the remit of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  I would also note the continuing action which is being taken to reduce the costs for doing business for all businesses and which is intended to have a positive impact on areas such as energy, local authority rates, and the administrative burden involved in companies complying with Government regulations and tax systems.</p><p>  Regarding the feasibility of establishing a register for commercial tenancies, the Property Services (Regulation) Act 2011 provides for the establishment and maintenance of a Commercial Leases Database by the Property Services Regulatory Authority.  This Database will assist in providing readily accessible, accurate information in order to determine the market rent payable in respect of comparable commercial properties.

A wide range of stake-holders have now provided views on the Bill reflecting its modern balance of interests between those of the legal professions and those of business or private clients who avail of legal services.  This process has included the very detailed Second Stage debate of the Bill which took place from 16 December 2011 to 23 February 2012.  The following July, in supporting discussion of the Bill, my Department hosted a conference on "Regulatory Reform for a 21st Century Legal Profession" with guest speakers from home and abroad who shared their experiences of legal sector reform including the Legal Services Commissioner of New South Wales and the Chief Executive of the Legal Services Board for England and Wales.  In terms of written submissions, I have received just under 50 since publication of the Bill representing nearly 30 interested parties along with dozens of individual letters from concerned members of the public and practitioners and the formal observations of other Government Departments.  The submissions have come from a wide range of bodies including the main legal professional bodies and associations, academics, civil liberties and human rights organisations, private businesses and government entities.  For their part, the Law Society, the Bar Council and the King's Inns have provided substantive views which are among those to which consideration continues to be given.  In addition, over the past 18 months both I and my officials have, together and separately, had meetings with various interested groups and bodies.  Alongside those representing the legal professions, these have included such entities as the Competition Authority, the Consumers' Association and the Committee of Heads of Irish University Law Schools.  The fruits of these ongoing consultations and submissions will be reflected in the amendments I intend to make to the Bill at Committee Stage in July and I have already identified a number of specific areas of the Bill where this will be the case.  As I have previously announced, amendments to the Bill will be made available for consideration prior to the commencement of Committee Stage and, pending that event, I continue to encourage, receive and consider submissions on the Bill.</p></reply>

The Equality Tribunal is independent in the exercise of its quasi-judicial function and has jurisdiction to investigate and decide upon complaints of discrimination under the Employment Equality Acts, the Equal Status Acts and the Pensions Acts.  The Equality Tribunal also provides a statutory mediation service.  The Equality Tribunal is one of the front-line services directly affected by the current turbulence in the labour market.  I am informed that the average waiting time for a hearing at the Equality Tribunal is approx. 129 weeks.  However, in cases where the complainant and respondent opt for mediation, a mediation hearing is arranged in less than 3 months of initial lodgement of the complaint.  The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation believes it is essential that there are efficient and effective mechanisms to develop harmonious and productive workplaces and to assist employers and employees to avoid and resolve disputes.  I understand that Minister Bruton proposes to establish a two-tier Workplace Relations structure.  This means that from next year two statutorily independent bodies will replace the current five.  There will be a new single body of first instance to be called the Workplace Relations Commission and a separate appeals body, which will effectively be an expanded Labour Court.  All complaints will be dealt with by a single body of first instance where the aim will be to have a hearing within three months from the time the case is lodged.</p></reply>

Under the terms of the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995, as passed by the Oireachtas, the Legal Aid Board is independent in the operation of its functions and decisions on individual cases are a matter for the Board.  Under Section 7(3) of the Act, I am precluded from exercising any power or control in relation to any particular case with which the Legal Aid Board is or may be concerned.  The Deputy might further wish to note that the solicitor/client relationship is protected by privilege in accordance with the terms of Section 32 of the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995 and therefore the Board does not provide information to third parties regarding a person who may or may not be a client of the Board.  Finally, while I can advise the Deputy that a person who is refused legal aid has the right to appeal this decision to an Appeal Committee which is made up of non-executive members of the Board, again I have no role in this process.</p></reply>

In this regard, policing measures are in place to address difficulties experienced by local residents in relation to public disorder and anti-social behaviours.  These include the designation of certain areas as &lsquo;hotspots&rsquo; for such activities and the provision of additional high-visibility patrols, including regular patrols by uniform and plain-clothes units, including the Community Policing and Garda Mountain-Bike Units, local Detective and Drug Unit personnel, supplemented as required by Divisional Crime Task Force and Traffic Corps personnel.  I am also advised that a High Visibility Policing Plan is in place for the Dublin Region, including the Dublin City catchment area, which results in dedicated high-visibility patrols in key commercial and public thoroughfares at strategic times, as dictated by crime-trends and foot-fall for the areas in question.  This initiative is closely monitored by local Garda Management and is continually reviewed to ensure it targets prevailing trends and meets the needs of the community.  Garda strategy is further supported by policing initiatives including Operation Stilts which are designed to address the incidence of drug related anti-social behaviour and theft.  The objective of Operation Stilts is to intensively police affected areas such as the North Quays, Boardwalk, and adjacent streets to prevent and disrupt the activities of individuals involved in anti-social behaviour and drug related offences.  Local Garda Management closely monitors the allocation of all resources in the context of crime trends, policing needs and other operational strategies in place on a District, Divisional and Regional level, to ensure optimum use is made of Garda resources, and the best possible Garda service is provided to the public.

The positions of the Taxing Master and their offices are governed by the Courts Officers Act 1926 and the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act 1961.  Their powers and duties are governed by the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act 1961 and the Courts and Court Officers Act 1995.  There are currently two Taxing Masters who perform functions of a judicial nature in respect of legal costs with the aim of establishing a fair relationship between the services rendered and the cost of those services.  In order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have made enquiries and the Courts Service has informed me that the waiting time for taxation of a bill is currently 12 weeks.  I am informed that a number of measures have been introduced in the Taxing Masters' Office to tackle backlogs including improved scheduling of cases and practitioners have been informed that all requisite documentation is to be lodged at the commencement of the taxation process.  It has also been necessary to inform parties that taxation cannot be completed due to the requisite documentation not being lodged or where proofs are not in order.  I am informed that the Senior Taxing Master has indicated to practitioners that he will take any application for urgent taxation and regularly does so.  In addition, he has indicated that any complaints by practitioners regarding delay should be brought to his direct attention.  The Deputy may also be aware that the Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011 provides for the establishment of a new Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicator which will deal with disputes about legal costs.  The new Office, headed by a Chief Legal Costs Adjudicator, will modernise the way disputed legal costs are adjudicated with greater transparency.  The Office will be empowered to prepare Legal Costs Guidelines.  It will establish and maintain a publicly accessible Register of Determinations which will include the outcomes and reasons for its determinations about disputed legal costs.  The Bill is scheduled for Committee Stage during July.</p></reply>

All eight reports have been published and are available electronically at <i>www.morristribunal.ie</i> and on my Department's website, <i>www.justice.ie</i>.  As the Deputy is no doubt aware, the passage of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act was the main response from Government to implement the recommendations from the Morris Tribunal.  That Act clarified the respective roles and responsibilities of the Minister and the Garda Commissioner and provided for the strengthening of the regulatory framework governing the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including the establishment of Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate.  I assume that the Deputy is referring to issues arising in the recent report of the Ombudsman Commission into the use of informants by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The first report of the Morris Tribunal recommended that there should be a periodic independent audit of Garda informant handling procedures by an outside authority, with power to make inspections and see documents and to monitor and review the informer management system.  In December 2010 my predecessor as Minister, at the request of the then Garda Commissioner, appointed retired High Court judge, Mr. Justice Thomas Smyth, as the Independent Covert Human Intelligence Sources Oversight Authority.  The functions assigned to Mr. Justice Smyth are to review and monitor the use within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of Covert Human Intelligence Sources; to ensure compliance with the code of practice of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for the management and use of Covert Human Intelligence Sources; to communicate any matters, he considers appropriate, including recommendations, to the Commissioner of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and report to the Minister at such intervals, being intervals of not more than twelve months, on discharge of his functions.  The most recent report of Mr Justice Smyth, which I have already put in the public domain, stated that he was satisfied than An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na were in substantial compliance with the code of practice.  I have indicated that I will publish such reports in the future.  I am satisfied that the recommendations arising from the Morris Tribunal have been addressed in this regard by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Deputy will be aware that the GSOC has also submitted recommendations inter alia, with regard to the management of Covert Human Intelligence Sources and these will, of course, be considered fully.</p></reply>

Where the conduct that is the source of grievance is conduct which is alleged to be unprofessional, a complaint would lie to the professional body concerned.  Sections 40(6) and (7) of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 provide for recourse to material relating to, or information of evidence given in, proceedings heard other than in public, for the purposes of a statutory inquiry into professional misconduct.  Therefore, neither the fact that a case is before the Children Court, nor the fact that it is being held <i>in camera</i>, would prevent a complaint being made to the professional body or bodies responsible for the conduct of the legal, medical or other professional involved.  In relation to lawyers, as the Deputy would be aware, the disciplinary bodies concerned would be the Law Society or the Bar Council.  A medical expert or practitioner would be subject to the complaint and disciplinary structures of the relevant branch of the medical profession under which he or she is represented.  In dealing with such complaints the disciplinary bodies concerned would have to be cognisant of their obligations arising from the fact that they are dealing with matters that have arisen before the Children Court and were subject to the <i>in camera</i>  rule.  The Deputy will wish to be aware that the Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011, which is due to commence Committee Stage shortly, will establish a new, independent Legal Service Authority with responsibility for the oversight of both solicitors and barristers.  There will be a new complaints system to deal with complaints about professional misconduct independent of both the Law Society and the Bar Council backed up by a Legal Practitioner's Disciplinary Tribunal.  Members of the public who wish to make complaints will no longer do so through the Law Society or the Bar Council but through the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority.</p></reply>

There are currently no persons authorised to practice in the State as personal insolvency practitioners (PIPs).  The public will be informed in advance when the ISI are ready to process such applications, which it is anticipated will be in the coming weeks.  I am advised by the ISI that there are currently no target for the number of PIPS, and the numbers authorised will very much depend on the interest of persons wishing to become PIPs.  However, I can inform the Deputy that, of the over 1,200 telephone and email contacts which the ISI has received since it launched its Information Campaign, almost one third of these were from persons interested in becoming PIPs.  In order to apply to become a PIP, an applicant must be a solicitor, barrister, a qualified accountant, a qualified financial advisor, or must hold a qualification in either law, business, finance or other appropriate similar qualification to the satisfaction of the ISI recognised to at least level 7 of the National Qualifications Framework.  All potential applicants, in addition to their existing professional qualifications, will have to demonstrate evidence of the applicant's satisfactory knowledge of the provisions of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 and the law generally as it applies to the insolvency of individuals and in particular statutory provisions relating to such persons.  I am advised by the ISI that the professional bodies, such as the Law Society, the Institute of Bankers and the accountancy bodies have begun relevant training courses.  Interest in these courses has been high, and I understand that some bodies will be running more courses in the coming months.</p></reply>

Since commencement of its operations in 2007, the Ombudsman Commission received a total of 26 referrals pursuant to section 102 concerning road traffic fatalities.  These 26 referrals pertained to the death of 30 individuals, including civilians and members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  All 26 referrals have been closed following consideration. </p><p>  In 22 of the 26 referrals, no Garda misbehaviour was identified and no further action was deemed warranted by the Ombudsman Commission.  Four files were submitted to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions who directed &ldquo;no prosecution&rdquo; in relation to three of these cases. One member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was convicted following prosecution.   I am advised by the Ombudsman Commission that they regret that the other statistical information requested by the Deputy is not readily available and would involve the compilation of statistical data over several years, the generation and collation of which would place an inordinate burden on the organisation in terms of time and resources. The Deputy, however, may be interested in the data provided in the Annual Reports which are available from the website of the Ombudsman Commission (www.gardaombudsman.ie). </p></reply>

The key anti-discrimination measures, the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act, 1989, the Unfair Dismissals Acts 1977, the Employment Equality Acts and the Equal Status Acts specifically identify Travellers by name as a group protected. The Equality Act 2004, which transposed the EU Racial Equality Directive, applied all the protections of that Directive across all of the nine grounds contained in the legislation, including the Traveller community ground.<b></b>  All the protections afforded to ethnic minorities in EU directives and international conventions apply to Travellers because the Irish legislation giving effect to those international instruments explicitly protects Travellers. </p></reply>

I understand that no court venue has been singled out for or indeed exempted from the review.  </p><p>  In this context of that review, courthouses in Clones and Ballyconnell were identified as venues that should be considered for closure subject to a detailed assessment and the preparation of a business case. Through this process the Service has established a general framework within which such venues are being assessed taking into account a range of criteria such as caseload, proximity to an alternative venue, physical condition of the building, availability of cells etc.  The likely impact on other Justice agencies, such as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Irish Prison Service, is also taken into account.  The consultation process in relation to the future of Ballyconnell, which included consultation with the judiciary, the Cavan Bar Association, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Prison Service, Probation Service and Cavan County Council, was completed earlier this year and a report was considered by the Building Committee at its meeting on 21st February, 2013.  The Building Committee decided that the closure of Ballyconnell should be recommended to the Courts Service Board. In accordance with the protocol all those who had been consulted previously were informed of the decision of the Building Committee and were invited to make further submissions which would be placed before the Board for consideration. I am informed that no submissions were received and the Board at its meeting on 15th April, 2013 approved the closure of Ballyconnell and the amalgamation of the Ballyconnell District Court area with Cavan District Court area. It is expected that court sittings at Ballyconnell will cease before the end of the year.</p><p>  I understand that no decision in relation to the future of Clones courthouse has been taken to date but that the consultation process has been concluded and the views received will be taken into account in the decision making process which, as the Deputy is aware, is a matter for the Courts Service Board under the provisions of the Courts Service Act 1998.</p></reply>

As Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine I do not have a role in setting prices.  However, as most processors in Ireland are co-operatives, dairy farmer members are represented at Board level in those organisations.  Dairy markets are performing strongly at present, and processors have announced an increase in their milk price in recent weeks.</p><p>  While market volatility means there will always be short term fluctuations in dairy prices, the medium term prospects for global dairy markets are good.  Growth in global population and wealth is forecast to stimulate strong levels of demand for dairy products.  Against that background, I believe that prospects and opportunities for the dairy sector will expand significantly over the coming years.</p></reply>

Following consultation with Met Eireann, Co Ops, the farming organisations, Teagasc<font color="#004080"> </font>and the advice of officials working on the ground, the decision was taken to allow a further two weeks for fodder to be imported into the country with a doubling of the transport subsidy fund.  Fodder, eligible under the scheme and delivered into the country will be covered up to next Friday 24 May. I have also decided, as an exceptional measure, that any definite purchases that have been placed by that date, but which will be delivered during the following week, will be included under the scheme.</p><p>  To date some 2,000 loads of imported fodder, amounting to about 30,000 tonnes, have benefited from my Department's contribution to these transport costs.  My Department will continue to monitor the situation on a day by day basis.  This remains a very challenging situation for farmers and the extension to 24 May will allow both farmers and Co Ops to have some certainty around the supply of fodder over the coming weeks.  It is also important that while continuing to focus on the emergency fodder position in the short term, farmers should also focus on growing and conserving fodder for next winter's needs. We should be maximising production in the coming period and I have asked Teagasc to prioritise this policy in their advisory campaigns over the summer months.</p><p>  It is clear that the main cut of silage will be delayed this year and as a consequence we need to look at the potential for the growing of additional fodder later into the season.  In this regard I have also raised a number of specific issues within the Nitrates regulations with my colleague Minister Hogan, Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government with a view to ensuring we maximise the opportunity for fodder production this year.</p><p>  The Animal Welfare Hotline which I established remains open for those with emergency situations or who need information about where to source fodder:<font color="#004080"> </font>1850 21 19 90 (Low-call).  The majority of calls received are enquiring about fodder availability and these callers are being referred to Co-ops in their respective areas.  Those farmers with animal welfare issues (i.e. animals starving) are being referred to the DVOs where there are systems in place to deal with them on a case by case basis. Further information on the scheme is available from the Department website. .</p></reply>

In response, I have introduced a specific Scheme, the Imported Fodder Transport Scheme, designed to assist towards the transport costs of imported fodder and maintenance of stocking levels. The situation has prompted action by the wider industry and farm bodies, which is very welcome. In keeping the situation under constant review, I decided, given the ongoing shortages in some areas, to extend the Imported Fodder Transport Scheme to 24 May and to double the funding available to &euro;2 million. Simultaneously, my Department&rsquo;s Emergency Welfare System continues to respond to individual emergency situations. The scheme will cover any definite purchases that have been placed by that date but which will not be delivered until the following week.</p><p>  Mindful of ongoing difficulties, I also decided that a formal request should again be made to the EU Commission seeking agreement to pay an advance from 16 October of the 2013 Single Farm Payment which, being the first day of the new EU financial year is the earliest potential payment date and almost two months ahead of the standard timeline. It will be recalled that my successful approach to Commissioner Ciolos for agreement to making an advance payment of the 2012 Single Farm Payment was prompted by the very wet weather experienced throughout last summer.</p><p>  With specific regard to the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme, the 2013 Scheme, as already announced, is focussed on the protection of the smaller and most disadvantaged. It must also be borne in mind that the minimum stocking density requirement is equivalent to one ewe per eligible forage hectare and cannot in any way be regarded as onerous. It will be recalled that, in response to budgetary realities, it was decided to re-focus the Scheme, with greater consideration been given to those contributing most to achieving the aims of the Scheme, which are:</p><p> - Ensuring continued agricultural land use, thereby contributing to the maintenance of a viable rural society;</p><p> - Maintaining the countryside;</p><p> - Maintaining and promoting sustainable farming systems, which, in particular, take account of environmental protection requirements. </p><p>  Given the restrictions faced by those farming in recognised Disadvantaged Areas and mindful of the aims of the Scheme, as outlined, it will be readily appreciated that appropriate stocking levels are crucial. In this regard, balance must be struck between the need to ensure that at least the minimum is done to ensure the land is adequately utilised and grazed, while at the same time being sufficiently aware of the natural constraints. In this regard, it is clear that the minimum stocking levels currently set under the Scheme achieve this twin objective.  Thus, the terms of the 2013 Scheme remain as previously announced.  Farmers with genuine fodder-related stocking difficulties may avail of the force majeure provisions of the Scheme.</p></reply>

In this context, &euro;5m of Exchequer funding was made available in 2012 for the establishment of a Beef Technology Adoption Programme (BTAP) to encourage the adoption of best management practice on beef farms.</p><p>  In order to qualify for the 2012 Beef Technology Adoption Programme, applicants were required to have satisfied one of the following criteria:</p><p>- Farmers with suckler cows must be current participants in the Suckler Cow Welfare Scheme (AWRBS), that is, they must have received payments under the Scheme on 2010 born calves <b>and</b> have applied to participate in ICBF HerdPlus prior to applying for the Programme.</p><p>- Beef farmers without a suckler herd must have applied to participate in ICBF HerdPlus prior to applying for the Programme. Any farmer finishing animals to slaughter must have applied for membership of the Beef Quality Assurance Scheme (BQAS) before the application date for this Programme and must be a member of the scheme by 31<sup></sup>  October 2012. He/she must also have finished a minimum of 15 cattle to slaughter in 2011. </p><p>  Nationally, 5,685 applicants satisfied the entry requirements, In addition to the entry criteria, however, applicants were also required to attend a minimum of five Discussion group meetings/approved National Events, and successfully complete two Tasks, selected from a menu of eight Tasks. Eligibility for payment required that participants be confirmed as having attended the required minimum number of meetings and to have completed their chosen two Tasks; to date a total of 4,809 participants have been paid.  All unpaid cases are being reviewed and, where eligibility is confirmed, payment will issue; those confirmed as unsuccessful will be advised accordingly, in writing. In common with all Schemes/Programmes operated by my Department, those who are found to be unsuccessful will be afforded the right of appeal. </p><p>  Regarding Bovine Viral Diarrhoea (BVD) testing, this activity arises in the context of one of the tasks related to the completion of a herd health plan in consultation with a veterinary practitioner.

Fodder, eligible under the scheme and delivered into the country will be covered up to next Friday 24 May. I have also decided, as an exceptional measure, that any definite purchases that have been placed by that date, but which will be delivered during the following week, will be included under the scheme.</p><p>  To date some 2,000 loads of imported fodder, amounting to about 30,000 tonnes, have benefited from my Department's contribution to these transport costs.  My Department will continue to monitor the situation on a day by day basis.  This remains a very challenging situation for farmers and the extension to 24 May will allow both farmers and Co Ops to have some certainty around the supply of fodder over the coming weeks.</p><p>  It is also important that while continuing to focus on the emergency fodder position in the short term, farmers should also focus on growing and conserving fodder for next winter's needs. We should be maximising production in the coming period and I have asked Teagasc to prioritise this policy in their advisory campaigns over the summer months.</p><p>  It is clear that the main cut of silage will be delayed this year and as a consequence we need to look at the potential for the growing of additional fodder later into the season.  In this regard I have also raised a number of specific issues within the Nitrates regulations with my colleague Minister Hogan, Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government with a view to ensuring we maximise the opportunity for fodder production this year.</p><p>  The Animal Welfare Hotline which I established remains open for those with emergency situations or who need information about where to source fodder:<font color="#004080"> </font>1850 21 19 90 (Low-call).  The majority of calls received are enquiring about fodder availability and these callers are being referred to Co-ops in their respective areas.  Those farmers with animal welfare issues (i.e. animals starving) are being referred to the DVOs where there are systems in place to deal with them on a case by case basis. </p><p>  Further information on the scheme is available from the Department website. .</p></reply>

This is evidenced by the fact that cattle herd incidence has fallen from 7.5% in 2000 to 4.1% in 2012 and the number of TB reactors has declined from 40,000 to 18,500 during the same period. This is the lowest recorded since the commencement of the TB eradication programme in the 1950s. The low incidence of TB over the past 4 years in particular is encouraging and indicates that the incidence has moved permanently to a new low level. The incidence of TB in 2013 is running at about 10% below the levels recorded in 2012.</p><p>  With regard to East Wicklow, an enhanced wildlife programme was introduced in that area in 2011 due to higher than average levels of TB in the area. In particular, additional staffing resources were assigned to the regional office to improve delivery of the programme. Information on expenditure on the badger removal programme is not kept in a format which would enable me to provide details of the cost of the programme in East Wicklow. However, there has been a significant improvement in the delivery of the programme since 2010 as evidenced by the fact that the area subject to badger culling increased from 27% in 2010 to 34% in 2012 and the number of badgers removed increased from 22 to 265 in the same period. In addition, notwithstanding that research has shown that there can be a time lag of a number of years between the commencement of a badger removal programme and an evident reduction in herd incidence, herd incidence in East Wicklow has fallen by 38% from 6.9% in April 2011 to 4.3% in April 2013. </p><p>  I am satisfied that the programme is being implemented effectively in East Wicklow and I am hopeful that we will continue to see a reduction in the incidence of TB in the area into the future.</p></reply>

Funding of some &euro;53.498m is available in 2013 to support the provision of youth services and programmes to young people throughout the country including those from disadvantaged communities. Targeted supports for disadvantaged, marginalised and at risk young people are provided through the Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund Rounds 1 and 2 and Local Drugs Task Force Projects. These funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 400,000 young people and involve approximately 1,400 paid staff and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country.</p><p>In 2013, my Department's Youth Affairs Unit will provide total funding to For&oacute;ige of &euro;5.93 million.</p><p><table><tr><th>Programme</th><th>Amount in 2013</th></tr><tr><td>Youth Service Grant Scheme </td><td>&euro;2,651,154 </td></tr><tr><td>Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund  (1 &amp;amp; 2)</td><td>&euro;1,195,283</td></tr><tr><td>Special Project for Youth</td><td>&euro;2,083,572</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>&euro;5,930,009</td></tr></table></p><p>This total does not include local youth clubs grants, funded by my Department, but allocated to local clubs by; and at the discretion of local VECs.</p><p>This total does not include funding provided to For&oacute;ige with respect to Garda youth diversion projects or funding from other state agencies such as the HSE.</p><p>The savings required under the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure in respect of 2013 amounted to &euro;5.393m which equated to almost a 10% reduction on 2012 funding available for the provision of youth services. In 2014 the savings required in the youth budget under the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure amount to &euro;2.976m which entails a 5% cut across most schemes and programmes and a 10% cut on the Youth Service Grant Scheme, under which For&oacute;ige receives funding as a national organisation.</p><p>Having regard to the savings requirements identified in the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure my Department has tried to ensure that, in the determination process for the allocations, the front line youth services, particularly those for the most vulnerable young people are protected as far as is possible from the impact of any  necessary reductions in funding.</p><p>My Department has tried to be as equitable as possible in achieving these savings. In considering how best to manage within the reduced budgets available, organisations are being asked to consider the scope for reducing administration costs and overheads, if this is at all possible, in order to maintain the front line youth services for young people. I have met, and continue to meet with, many youth organisations and groups to try and see how we can work together to minimise the impact of these necessary savings in order to ensure that the provision of quality youth services to young people is sustained in these challenging times.</p><p>A comprehensive Value for Money and Policy Review of youth funding has been commenced in my Department and it is anticipated that the findings of this report will inform the future development of youth programmes and services.</p><p>My Department is developing a new youth policy framework for publication later this year. The new youth policy framework will aim to enhance the provision of youth services and activities and it will, inter alia, promote co-ordination between government departments and youth sector organisations with a view to maximising the effectiveness of the State funding available to support services for young people in future years.</p></reply>

Under this legislation, my Department oversees the maintenance of a competitive and sustainable private health insurance market and monitors developments on an ongoing basis, to ensure that the market is regulated appropriately in the transition to a market-based Universal Health Insurance system. </p><p>  With particular regard to the cost of health insurance premiums, I have consistently raised the issue of costs with health insurers and am determined to address costs in the sector in the interests of consumers. Last year, I established the Consultative Forum on Health Insurance which comprises representatives from the country's main health insurance companies, the Health Insurance Authority (HIA) and my Department.  This Forum was established to generate ideas which would help address health insurance costs, whilst always respecting the requirements of competition law. I have made it clear to the health insurers that I believe significant savings can be made, the effect of which can be to contain the cost of health insurance premiums. </p><p>  Given VHI&rsquo;s very significant share of overall costs in the market, I will continue to focus strongly on the need for the VHI to address its costs.  At my instruction, the VHI recently compiled a detailed cost containment plan, which sets out savings targets for 2013 and for the 2014-2016 period, so as to minimise the need for any future premium increases. The savings targets over this period are to be achieved through a combination of initiatives including rate reductions with private hospitals and consultants, utilisation management, expansion of clinical audit, reductions in high cost drugs and prosthesis, provider reviews and the continued transition of procedures to lower cost, medically appropriate settings. </p><p>  I will continue to focus strongly on this issue, as part of measures to ensure the sustainability of the private health insurance market in the transition to a Universal Health Insurance system.</p></reply>

Within these governing EU Regulations and the Department of Health Guidelines, the TAS provides for the cost of approved treatments in another EU/EEA member state or Switzerland through the issue of Form S2.         </p><p>  A decision is made on each application in accordance with this legislation and guidelines and on the basis of a review by clinical experts. The cost of the treatment is not a deciding factor when approving an application. The treatment must not be available within the State or not available within a time normally necessary for obtaining it.</p><p>  The TAS allows for an Irish based medical consultant to refer a patient that is normally resident in Ireland for treatment in another EU/EEA member state or Switzerland, where the treatment in question meets certain criteria.</p><p>  Following clinical assessment, the referring Consultant certifies the following:</p><p>- The treatment is medically necessary and will meet the patient&rsquo;s needs;</p><p>- The treatment is a proven form of medical treatment and is not experimental or test treatment;</p><p>- The treatment is in a recognised hospital/institution and is under the control of a registered medical practitioner;</p><p>- The hospital outside the state will accept EU/EEA Form S2.</p><p>  The application to refer a patient abroad is normally assessed by the HSE within 15 to 20 working days and a determination given before that patient goes abroad. Appointments should not be scheduled prior to a decision being reached on an application. </p><p>  The situation with this particular case is that the Treatment Abroad Scheme (TAS) of the HSE received an application from the person involved and issued a letter informing him that, in line with the governing EU Regulations and Department of Health Guidelines, his application did not meet the criteria for the Scheme.  This decision was confirmed in a review of the case by the General Manager of the TAS.</p><p>  In order to advance this case a letter was issued by the TAS to the person concerned, following the review, recommending that he seek a referral to the tertiary services in Ireland in the first instance but also confirming that should his consultant identify a treatment as opposed to a request for second opinion then his free to re-apply accordingly.  I understand that the person involved has now been referred to the tertiary orthopaedic services at Cappagh Hospital by his general practitioner.  If the person involved attends these services as a public patient, and should the relevant orthopaedic specialist identify a specific treatment for this person that is not available in Ireland, the TAS scheme will promptly consider any such application under the governing EU Regulations and the Department of Health Guidelines.</p></reply>

Building on work already undertaken by the HSE, the National Treatment Purchase Fund has now taken over the reporting of outpatient waiting time data.  For the first time  data is available on www.ntpf.ie.  The collation and analysis of outpatient waiting time data in a standardised format will reveal the distribution of long waiters across all hospitals.  In the first instance, this will allow resources to be targeted towards those patients who are waiting longest and ensure that they are seen and assessed.  For 2013, a maximum waiting time target has now been set of 12 months for a first time outpatient appointment.  In parallel with reducing the numbers of longest waiters, the SDU will also work with the HSE Clinical Programmes to reform the structure, organisation and delivery of outpatient services to ensure that the right patient is seen and assessed by the right health professional at the right time.</p><p>  In relation to the particular query raised by the Deputy, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy in this matter.</p></reply>

The programme involves a number of measures, including the Performance Improvement Action Plan, development of the intermediate care service, the trial emergency aeromedical service (EAS), and the NAS Control Centre Reconfiguration Project.  In particular, the National Ambulance Service (NAS) is developing staff clinical skills in line with the development of paramedic professional qualifications by the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council. </p><p>  The NAS is a forward-looking service.  It deploys its emergency resources in a dynamic manner and on an area and national, rather than a local, basis.  It has been, and still is, undergoing major transformation, including in terms of clinical skills and work practices, application of technology and modernisation of management and infrastructure.

I have emphasised to the HSE the high priority the Government and I attach to this issue, and also the need to address NCHDs working conditions more generally.</p><p>  The Health Service Executive&rsquo;s Service Plan for 2013 specifically recognises the need to address EWTD compliance as a priority, stating that there will be a particular focus in the acute hospital service on the achievement of compliance with the European Working Time Directive amongst the non-consultant hospital doctor workforce, in line with the Implementation Plan submitted to the Commission in 2012.</p><p>  Key priorities for the HSE in 2013 are a reduction of average weekly hours worked and a reduction in the duration of shifts undertaken. The Executive is bringing a strong and particular focus to the achievement of compliance with the Directive.  New and demanding targets and timescales have been issued to hospital managers and clinical directors and progress on a site-by-site basis will be assessed against these.  The HSE has established a national group chaired by a senior executive to bring a clear and urgent focus to: implementation of the Directive, assessment of performance and site-by-site accountability for change. The HSE is also conscious of the need to implement other measures to improve the working conditions of NCHDs, including protection of training time, the implementation of formal bleep policies and the transfer of tasks often inappropriately undertaken by NCHDs to more appropriate staff.</p><p>  I am satisfied that the HSE is making every effort to improve the working hours of NCHDs and to implement other measures to improve their working conditions which will in turn facilitate the provision of improved and safer delivery of services to patients.</p></reply>

Dealing with the current high levels of suicide and deliberate self harm is a priority for this Government.  <i>Reach Out </i>our National Strategy for Action on Suicide Prevention makes a number of recommendations in relation to fast track referrals to community-based mental health services, effective response to deliberate self harm, training, stigma reduction, etc.  Consequently, the HSE's National Office for Suicide Prevention (NOSP) has developed a range of initiatives to support people who are suicidal and also to support their families, friends and peers in recognising and responding appropriately to signs of emotional distress and suicidal thoughts.  Area 15 of<i> Reach Out </i>deals with marginalised groups including travellers.</p><p>  Suicide within the traveller community was shown to be a major problem by the findings of the All-Ireland Traveller Health Study which was published in 2010.  This study determines traveller suicide rates to be significantly higher than in the general population. </p><p>  There has been a significant amount of work done with  groups, providing information, conducting training and developing resources.  The National Traveller Suicide Awareness Project (NTSAP) is a collaboration of traveller organisations, the NOSP and Exchange House and it has been at the forefront of promoting awareness within the traveller community and amongst healthcare providers and a spectrum of support services.  Crosscare National Traveller Suicide Awareness Project has been funded by the NOSP and is working to develop a response to the issue of traveller suicide.  The project works directly with around 500 travellers per year and indirectly through networking at national, regional and local events.  The project also provides support in prevention and postvention situations.</p><p>  In 2012, the project focused on engaging traveller men as a key priority along with providing ongoing support to groups in developing appropriate responses to address the identified needs.  A particular focus on bereavement support was identified along with developing more meaningful relationships with mental health services.</p><p>  Overall, fourteen men's groups received funding from NOSP in 2012; networking was initiated and awareness was raised pertaining to the work of the project.  As well as funding NTSAP and the male traveller development project the NOSP also funds the delivery of ASIST (Applied Suicide Intervention Skills Training) and Safetalk to traveller groups.  All agencies funded by NOSP are required to be available to, and work with, minority groups.</p></reply>

In the interest of probity, the HSE is obliged, irrespective of the age of the person, to ensure that a person&rsquo;s eligibility is correctly recorded in line with the eligibility legislation and the national guidelines. The HSE aims to ensure that every person who is entitled to the medical card schemes is given the opportunity to avail of their entitlement. </p><p>Medical cards for persons aged 66 years are generally reviewed every 4 years and for those under  66, the length of validity is 3 years.  Depending on the individual's circumstances, it may be issued for a shorter period. If an individual's circumstances change - or those of a dependent - he/she must inform the HSE, as he/she may no longer be eligible.   In addition to the standard assessment and review processes, random audits of eligibility will also be undertaken by the HSE on an on-going basis. If selected for review under this process, the Medical Card holder will be informed and requested to submit up to date income details.</p><p>  Any medical card holder undergoing a review to renew a medical card, who genuinely engages with the HSE in that review, will not have their entitlement withdrawn before the review is complete. This applies, regardless of the expiry date shown on the medical card and the reviewee is also advised of the appeals process. </p></reply>

Such systems are critical for the support of patient safety and improved quality of care. The development of EHRs within the HSE and on a national basis poses considerable challenges but I am confident that the introduction of hospital groups will allow the health service to progress access to enhanced patient information systems between hospitals within the group structures. </p><p>  There are a number of examples of systems in place currently which allow the sharing of data at local, regional and national level. These would include NIMIS (National Integrated Medical Imaging System),  the Primary Care Re-Imbursement Service (PCRS) prescriptions database, the financial Information Management Reports (IMR) reporting data warehouse and the Endoscopy Reporting system (currently being implemented). In addition, there is a national messaging solution which allows data to be shared between various entities within the wider health sector. </p><p>  My Department is currently developing an eHealth strategy that will outline the core building blocks required to develop the optimum environment to support the development of information systems required to enhance patient care, connected health, efficiency and reform. It is working closely with the HSE and HIQA in developing the necessary supporting infrastructure and information standards. The legislative environment required to underpin the governance for health information systems including EHR's will be provided for in the Health Information Bill to be published before the end of this year.</p></reply>

The future growth in healthcare will be in the services such as ambulatory care (including chronic disease management and day surgery), diagnostics and rehabilitation which will be based in smaller hospitals.  As a result of these emerging models of healthcare delivery, and the aging population, the total volume of activity of the smaller hospitals will grow substantially and no smaller hospital will close as a result of either the Hospital Groups Report or the Framework for Smaller Hospitals. This increase in volume is particularly evidenced in Roscommon where day case discharges have increased by 26% from 3,798 in 2010 to 5,127 in 2012.</p><p>  Hospital groups will be required to submit a strategic plan within one year of formation which will outline its plans for future services within the group area, including those to be delivered in each smaller hospital. Smaller hospitals will play a crucial role in the delivery of services and when groups are established, services can be exchanged between sites. This will result in the enhancement of activity in smaller hospitals and will allow them to focus on the provision of care that is safe and appropriate.</p><p>  The implementation of the Framework for these smaller hospitals has largely been completed around the country and the objective is to complete the remaining necessary changes dependent on required capacity being available in the regions and hospital groups concerned. </p></reply>

As outlined in that paper, many of the key building blocks for UHI have been progressed. </p><p>Of major significance is the recent Government decision to reorganise public hospitals into more efficient and accountable hospital groups that will deliver improved outcomes for patients. That decision was informed by two expert reports, namely, <i>The</i><i>Establishment of Hospital Groups as a Transition</i><i>to Independent Hospital Trusts</i> and <i>The Framework for Development - Securing the Future of Smaller Hospitals.</i></p><p>  Other key building blocks which have been progressed include the work of the Special Delivery Unit in significantly reducing waiting times for scheduled and unscheduled care; the enactment of the Health Insurance (Amendment) Act 2012 providing for a new scheme of risk equalisation for the private health insurance market; the delivery of a 'Money Follows the Patient' policy which was published in February and which provides for a fairer and more transparent means of funding  healthcare, and the approval of national healthcare standards and ongoing work in relation to supporting licensing legislation. </p><p>The Department is currently undertaking detailed work in relation to the preparation of a <i>White Paper on Universal Health Insurance.</i>   Broadly, this involves the development of detailed policy proposals covering issues such as the design of the UHI model, the scope and composition of the UHI basket of services and funding and financial support mechanisms for UHI.  </p><p>A special UHI Design Team has recently been set up to oversee and support the work involved in the design of the UHI model and the preparation of the <i>White Paper on Universal Health Insurance.</i>   The work involved in UHI design is both complex and technical and, as a consequence, the Design Team will be supported by specialised expertise at appropriate junctures. To this end, the Department has recently engaged legal expertise to assist in deliberations in this area. Work on the development of detailed policy proposals is proceeding with a view to publishing the White Paper as early as possible.</p><p>  The reform programme is a major undertaking that requires careful planning and sequencing over a number of years and full implementation of UHI will take some time to achieve. I anticipate that by 2016 the necessary groundwork will be in place to enable us to phase in  implementation of UHI, as promised in the Programme for Government.

I established a Special Action Group on Obesity (SAGO) with whom I meet regularly to progress the obesity prevention agenda.  The Special Action Group on Obesity comprises key stakeholders from a wide range of Departments, the HSE and other interested parties and is chaired by the Department of Health. SAGO is already concentrating on a range of measures including Calorie posting in restaurants; Healthy Eating Guidelines, including the Food Pyramid; Sugar Sweetened Drinks Tax; Marketing of Food and Drink to Children;   Treatment Algorithms; Opportunistic Screening and Monitoring; Vending Machines in Schools and a Physical Activity Plan. SAGO is also currently looking at ways of reducing food consumption from the top shelf of the food pyramid, in accordance with this Department's Healthy Eating Guidelines.</p><p>  I am aware that obesity and nutrition are represented in the current medical undergraduate curriculum and the level of representation varies, a matter which is within the remit of the different universities. However, in establishing the Special Action Group on Obesity, a key action was to guide and standardise treatment practices throughout the country. SAGO works closely with the Health Service Executive, the Irish College of General Practitioners and in conjunction with other professional bodies, and, as mentioned previously, has developed treatment algorithms for both adults and children. These algorithm obesity tools are being used nationally in the treatment of adult and childhood obesity.</p><p>  Healthy Ireland, a Framework for Improved Health and Well-being, forms the basis of how a whole-of-government and whole of society approach to health and well-being will be delivered.

The active substance sibutramine is however currently to be found in unauthorised brands of slimming products sold illegally on the internet either directly from abroad or imported into Ireland and sold by mail order and by person to person contact sales.</p><p>At present, internet / mail order supply of prescription medicines is prohibited in Ireland. The Irish Medicines Board (IMB) works closely with Revenue&rsquo;s Customs Service to prevent the illegal supply of mail order medicines into Ireland. This co-operation has led to the seizure of many individual packets of medicines and has resulted in a number of prosecutions and other enforcement actions involving website operators.</p><p>During the period 2010 - 2012 the following quantities of illegal slimming medicinal products containing sibutramine were detained by Revenue&rsquo;s Customs Service;</p><p><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Quantity</th></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>290,240 tablets/capsules;</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>251,883 tablets/capsules;</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>153,042 tablets/capsules</td></tr></table></p><p>The IMB has consistently stressed the dangers of buying medicines online and urges consumers not to risk their health by using these illegal medicines. In 2012 the IMB issued a precautionary message to consumers on the health dangers of taking any sibutramine containing slimming product. The precautionary message listed the names of 38 illegal products known to contain sibutramine, over 20 of which had been detained, from time to time, by Revenue&rsquo;s Customs Service at the point of entry to the State.</p><p>In cooperation with the Customs Service, the IMB follows up with the intended recipient of each of these attempted supplies and explains that the product is illegal and the health risks associated with seeking to source and use such products. The IMB has also detained sibutramine containing products illegally on sale in Ireland.</p></reply>

Whereas the National Clinical Programme for Asthma is not mentioned in the National Service Plan, it is included in the Operational Plan.  Implementation of the programme is ongoing and will continue in 2014.  To date, different work streams of the National Clinical Programme for Asthma have resulted in the following initiatives:</p><p>  -	The preparation of a Model of Care &ndash; this is currently in development.</p><p>  -	The establishment of Asthma Check (Chronic Disease Watch Asthma &ndash; structured review) &ndash; this has been submitted to the Irish College of General Practitioners (ICGP) for review.</p><p>  -	The preparation of Acute Emergency Asthma Guidelines for Adults - this has been submitted to the National Clinical Effectiveness Committee (NCEC) for review and feedback.</p><p>  -	The preparation of Acute Emergency Asthma Guidelines for Paediatrics &ndash; these have been completed. </p><p>  -	Asthma Control in General Practice &ndash; these guidelines have been signed off by ICGP and are being implemented.</p><p>  -	Asthma Educational Programme &ndash; this is available online at www. hseland.ie. </p><p>  -	Practical workshops have been delivered locally by Clinical Nurse Specialists to nurses in Primary and Secondary Care.</p><p>  Nurses and other health professionals have been enrolled in an asthma education module.  This education module is based on the National Asthma guidelines.  This supports healthcare staff in the delivery of evidenced based care and education for patients.  In partnership with the Asthma Society, patient information documents have been developed to support this initiative.</p><p>  Patients are not enrolled in the National Clinical Programme for Asthma.  Furthermore, at present, a register on asthma prevalence does not exist.  Therefore, data on the numbers of persons currently suffering from asthma is not available.  However, survey-based data is available from the Central Statistics Office's (CSO&rsquo;s) Quarterly National Household Survey 2010 Health Module.  According to this survey, 7% of adults indicated that at some point in their lives they had been diagnosed with asthma.</p><p>  It is not possible to provide the Deputies with information on the number of asthma patients who are included in the General Medical Services (GMS) Scheme or the Drug Payments Scheme (DPS).

This policy constitutes a fundamental element in the Government&rsquo;s health reform programme. There has been no change to the Government&rsquo;s over-arching commitment to this goal. This Government is the first in the history of this State to have committed itself to implementing a universal GP service for the entire population. </p><p>  Having examined the progress made in the universal GP care plan, it became clear that the legal and administrative framework required to provide a robust basis for eligibility for a GP service based on having a particular medical condition is likely to be overly complex and bureaucratic for a short-term arrangement. Relatively complex primary legislation would be required in order to provide a GP service to a person on the basis of their having a particular illness. The assessment system for such an approach would have to be robust, objective and auditable in order to have the confidence of this House as well as the general public. This legislation would have to address how a person could be certified as having such an illness, and who could do this, and how to select the diagnostic basis for medical conditions. As well as primary legislation, there would be a need for secondary legislation to give full effect to this approach for each condition. While it would not be impossible to achieve this, it would take several months more to finalise the primary legislation, followed then by the preparation of statutory instruments. In my view, this would entail putting in place a cumbersome legal and administrative infrastructure to deal with what is only a temporary first phase on the way to universal GP service to the entire population. </p><p>  The Cabinet Committee on Health has discussed the issues relating to the delay in the initial step of the roll-out of the universal GP service. In doing so, it has considered the importance of weighing the balance between, on the one hand, resolving the legal issues but with a further delay and, on the other hand, with the need to bring forward an important Programme for Government commitment with the minimum of further delay. </p><p>  No decision has been taken by the Cabinet Committee or by Government on changing the first step of the plan to extend GP care without fees to persons with chronic illnesses. Instead, it has been agreed that we should prepare and set out a number of alternative options with regard to the phased implementation of a universal GP service without fees.  Minister Reilly and I expect to report back to the Cabinet Committee in the near future. As part of this work, consideration will be given to the approaches, timing and financial implications of the phased implementation this universal health service.  </p><p>  The Government has already made clear its commitment to delivering on the implementation of a GP service for the entire population by providing additional financial resources in the two most recent Budgets. The HSE Vote now contains funding of &euro;30 million for this year for an initial phase of the provision of GP services as part of this Programme for Government commitment.</p><p>  To conclude, far from abandoning its commitment to universal GP care, this Government is determined to expedite the implementation of a national GP service for the entire population, something to which no previous Government has ever aspired. </p></reply>

Section 11 of the Taxi Regulation Bill 2012 places an obligation on an applicant for or holder of an SPSV licence to inform the National Transport Authority (NTA) of any other occupation that involves driving. Under Section 19 of the Bill the NTA is provided with powers to make regulations concerning taxi drivers' hours. </p><p>  However, this is a complex legal area and it is my intention that the Bill puts in place a provision that is balanced and proportionate having regard to the rights of individuals relating to privacy and to earn a livelihood. Taking account of legal advice which suggests that there are legal difficulties in applying restrictive measures in this area  I intend bringing a further amendment to the Bill.   </p><p>  In accordance with the recommendations of the Taxi Regulation Review Report, arrangements have been put in place for the sharing of data on small public service vehicles licences and drivers with the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Protection. This is intended to combat tax and social welfare fraud by dishonest operators in the business.</p><p>  I do not have information on the number of taxi drivers availing of social welfare benefits.</p></reply>
