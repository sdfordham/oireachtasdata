    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-10-16a.11.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012101600053#WRA00900"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 58 and 68.</p><p>  The Department will spend an estimated &euro;847 million on illness benefit payments in 2012.  The number of people claiming illness benefit and other disability payments has increased greatly in the past 10 years &ndash; a 44% increase from some 170,000 to some 247,000 between 2001 and 2010.   Alongside those figures, the House will be aware that the Social Insurance Fund, from which illness benefit payments are made, is seriously in deficit, to the tune of some &euro;1.5 billion in 2011.  That is the background against which the question of introducing a scheme of statutory sick pay for both the public and private sectors is being considered. </p><p>  As well as contributing to tackling the deficit in the social insurance fund, a statutory sick pay scheme would help to limit progression from short-term illness to long-term illness or disability.  It would also serve to bring Ireland into line with practice in other countries in this area.  And, finally, it would contribute towards enhancing the health of the workforce more generally and addressing levels of absenteeism.  As has been pointed out by the OECD, where the State bears all the costs of illnesses, there is less incentive for employers (whether in the private or public sector) to engage actively in managing the costs involved.</p><p>  In considering this question, I have to say again that I, along with my colleagues in Government, am acutely conscious of the pressures facing employers in the current economic climate, and in particular, the pressures facing smaller and medium-sized enterprises.  The Government is equally conscious of the need to maintain competitiveness, facilitate business opportunities and generate sustainable employment.  In this regard, I should emphasise that the three day waiting period which currently applies in respect of Illness Benefit would also apply in any scheme of statutory sick pay.</p><p>  The question of providing for possible compensatory mechanisms for particularly vulnerable employers is just one of a range of complex issues that need to be addressed before any decision could be taken by Government on the possible introduction of a statutory sick pay scheme.  In the event that Government were to decide to proceed with a scheme of this nature, an impact assessment would form part of the preparatory measures. </p></reply>

    <ques id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-10-16a.13.q" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1065" speakername="Robert Troy" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012101600053#WRA01000"><p>To ask the Minister for Social Protection if she is considering changing the inclusion of child support in the calculation of means in lone parents allowance applications; and if she will make a statement on the matter. <b>[44423/12]</b></p></ques>
    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-10-16a.14.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012101600053#WRA01100"><p>The Revised Estimates for my Department provide for expenditure of &euro;1,062 million on the one parent family payment scheme in 2012.  One parent family payment is a means tested social assistance payment for men and women who are bringing up a child or children with the support of a partner.  There are currently over 89,000 people receiving this payment.  The weekly amount of the payment to each recipient depends on the weekly means of the parent.   When assessing means for the one parent family payment, account is taken of all cash income which the person is receiving.  Thus, for example, where a recipient has earnings from employment, the first &euro;130 per week is disregarded and the balance is assessed at 50%.</p><p>  Where a recipient is in receipt of a maintenance payment, this payment is also assessed as means.  Initially, a person&rsquo;s housing costs, if any, of up to &euro;95.23 per week are disregarded for those who pay rent or a mortgage.  Maintenance above this level is assessed at 50%.  Similar arrangements apply across a range of other social assistance schemes such as disability allowance and jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.</p><p>  As a result of this approach, a recipient will always retain at least half of any maintenance paid.  I consider that these arrangements are appropriate in that there is always an incentive to seek and receive a maintenance payment in respect of the child, the recipient himself or herself or both, as appropriate. Accordingly, I have no plans, at present, to change the assessment of maintenance payments for entitlement to the one parent family payment and similar payments. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-10-16a.17.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012101600053#WRA01300"><p>The JobBridge Scheme has made significant progress to-date since it came into operation on the 1<sup>st</sup> July 2011. 11,201 internships have commenced to date with 5,125 participants currently on an internship as at 15<sup>th</sup> October 2012 and over 2,200 opportunities presently advertised on .  The take-up has been particularly strong in the SME sector with this sector accounting for 6,481 or 58% of all placements to-date.  It is very encouraging that 35% of those participants who have finished their internship in the SME sector have immediately progressed into employment at the end of their internship.  There has also been very strong participation in JobBridge from the youth unemployed.  3,156 or 28% of all placements to-date are from aged under 25.  In addition, 5,082 or 45% placements have been taken up by those aged between 25-34.</p><p>  Among the most important reasons indicated by host organisations for participating in JobBridge include that the scheme enables the organisation to evaluate potential future employees and because the scheme contributes to national policy by providing internship opportunities to unemployed.  Securing access to additional skills was also seen as a very important reason by organisations.</p><p>  It is also worth noting that employment progression outcomes from JobBridge compares very favourably with European averages for work placement schemes.  An interim report on the evaluation of the scheme has just been completed by Indecon and will be published shortly.  This will provide more comprehensive data on the progression outcomes of interns post-internship.  </p><p>  JobBridge, like any active labour market intervention, needs to be carefully evaluated in order to consider the possibilities of positive or negative effects, and whether it is likely to increase employment probabilities for participants.  Consequently, the Department is committed to the continuous monitoring and review of the operation of the JobBridge scheme on an on-going basis.  The Department has conducted 380 monitoring visits this year and I wish to advise the Deputy that 95% of these visits were of a satisfactory nature.</p><p>  As at end September, 2,295 or 41% of internships were completed in full, while 3,297 or 59% were completed early. While this may appear to be of initial concern, I am satisfied that the records indicate that a very high proportion of early completers did so to take up a job and 66.3% of early completers have secured paid employment.  This is largely as a result of the skills and experience gained while undertaking their internship.  In other cases, early completers returned to training or education, returned to job search, took up another placement etc.</p></reply>

There are currently approximately 90,000 customers in receipt of this payment.   </p><p>As the Department currently funds approximately 30% of the private rented sector it is essential that State support for rents are kept under review and reflect current market conditions.  New maximum rent limits came into force on 1 January 2012 and are in place until June 2013.  These new limits were set after an analysis of the most up to date market data available.  For all counties, major urban population centres were tested as part of the rents review to ensure that rent supplement applicants can access temporary housing arrangements whilst seeking employment opportunities.  The emphasis of the rent limit review was to ensure that maximum value for money for tenants and the taxpayer was achieved whilst at the same time ensuring that people on rent supplement are not priced out of the market for private rented accommodation. </p><p>  The revised limits are applicable to new rent supplement tenancies from January 2012 and existing tenancies on review.  Approximately 40,000 rent supplement claims have been awarded in 2012 indicating that accommodation can be secured within the new limits.  Where rents are in excess of the limit, customers are being asked to contact their landlord and renegotiate the rent.  Where landlords do not agree to reduce the rent within the limits, staff will discuss the options open to the tenant, including seeking alternative accommodation. </p><p>  Officials administering the scheme advise that customers are securing alternative accommodation within their locality.  Any customers who have specific issues in relation to relocating should discuss these issues with Department officials who are continuing to provide support and advice to customers in addressing their accommodation and other needs.  There will be no incidence of homelessness due to these changes.</p><p>  Officials in my Department continue to examine the impact of the rent limits on those who claim rent supplement but at this stage I have no plans to revise the existing rent limits. <b></b></p></reply>

The quality of customer service that social welfare recipients receive at post offices is important to the Department and to An Post, which has responsibility for that service.  In that regard, I am informed that An Post has taken a number of measures to improve service at Lucan Post Office, including extending opening hours. </p><p>  The Department actively monitors the numbers of its customers accessing post offices on particular days and from time to time makes arrangements to transfer some payments to alternative collection days to minimise any potential for queuing.  The process of changing payment days is complex and must be managed closely to ensure that customer service is not interrupted.  The impact of this change is monitored by the Department in consultation with An Post.  For example, in March this year some 240 customers who normally received payments at Lucan Post Office on a Friday payday were moved to a Tuesday payday and An Post has given positive feedback on the impact of that change of payment days.</p><p>  I would like to assure the House that the Department will continue to work closely with An Post to monitor the effectiveness of the remedies put in place up to now and to consider what further scope for improvement is available.  I will discuss the Deputy&rsquo;s suggestions regarding a visit to this office with him but I would like to assure him that I am familiar with the position. </p></reply>

That Government agreed a structural adjustment programme which is subject to a monthly and quarterly reporting process as well as on-going discussions with the Troika on all expenditure headings, including social protection.  The latest quarterly review commenced this week.  </p><p>  The arrangements governing Ministerial meetings with the Troika on their quarterly delegation visits to Dublin are that my colleagues the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform meet with the delegation on behalf of the Government.  Consequently, apart from an initial meeting immediately on taking office, I have not formally met with the Troika recently to discuss the Irish social protection system generally or disability allowance, in particular.  However, I have met members of the Troika informally. </p><p>  Officials from my Department, and from other Departments, meet with the Troika delegation as part of each quarterly review.  Commitments in the Funding Programme which relate to my Department are discussed with the Troika delegation, the achievement of commitments is noted where relevant, and the agreement is revised to reflect any new or follow-on commitments made in the course of the quarterly review, as appropriate.  All of the commitments in the social protection area that were required to be delivered up to the present time have been delivered in full and on time. </p><p>  After each quarterly review, both the European Commission and the IMF publish the findings of their review in what are known as occasional papers or country reports, respectively.  The most recent of these was published in September and related to the Troika delegation visit in July.  In these reports, the Commission and the IMF may identify areas of social welfare expenditure which they believe merit examination in the context of the continuing reform of the system and fiscal consolidation.</p><p>  Although the Troika may identify areas of expenditure which they believe merit examination, any changes to the schemes operated by the Department will be decided by the Cabinet, subject to the approval of the Oireachtas, in the context of the on-going review of expenditure generally and in the context of deciding the fiscal consolidation measures to be included in Budget 2013.  </p></reply>

I note that, as reported, a significant amount of the costs of running a home relates to significant mortgage repayments.  </p><p>  In this regard, I recently announced a three-phased approach to establishing a comprehensive Mortgage Arrears Information and Advice Service to provide the necessary supports to assist people in mortgage distress.  The approach differentiates between mortgage information and mortgage advice. The first two involve the enhancement of the website   and the establishment of a Mortgage Arrears Information Helpline within the Citizens Information Board both of which focus on the provision of comprehensive mortgage arrears information in particular to people in arrears or pre-arrears. </p><p>  The third element of the service is the provision of independent financial advice to mortgage holders who are being presented with long term mortgage resolution proposals by their lenders<b>. </b>This advice is provided by a panel of accountants drawn from members of the main accountancy institutes in Ireland who have agreed to participate and support this independent service.  <b></b></p><p>  The Government is acutely aware of the difficulties that many households are facing in meeting their mortgage repayments and addressing these difficulties is at the forefront of Government&#8217;s agenda.  The new service providing distressed mortgage holders with independent financial advice taken together with the Personal Insolvency Service and the Mortgage to Rent initiatives clearly demonstrate the commitment of Government to tackling the personal debt burden being carried by ordinary people.&#8221; </p><p>  With regard to the adequacy of social welfare payment levels in general, the Revised Estimates for my Department provides for expenditure of &#8364;20.55 billion in 2012 on a wide range of income supports and other services.  This expenditure represents 39% of Gross Current Government Expenditure and impacts in some way on almost every single person and business in the State, either directly or indirectly.  The weekly payment rates of all primary welfare payments were fully protected in Budget 2012 and the Government will consider the appropriate level of expenditure in 2013 in the context of the forthcoming Budget. </p></reply>

Of these, over 22,000 are getting half rate carer&rsquo;s allowance in addition to another social welfare payment at an annual cost of some &euro;90 million.  The carer&rsquo;s allowance scheme is based on demand and not on a fixed budget and therefore, I am satisfied that all claimants who are eligible and fulfil the scheme criteria will be awarded the allowance.   </p><p>  The means test for carer&rsquo;s allowance is one of the most generous means tests in the social welfare system.  The income disregard is &euro;332.50 per week for a single person and &euro;665 per week for a couple.  A couple with two children can earn up to &euro;35,400 and qualify for the maximum rate of carer&rsquo;s allowance, as well as the household benefits package and free travel while a couple earning &euro;59,300 will still qualify for the minimum rate of carer&rsquo;s allowance, as well as the household benefits and free travel. In Budget 2012, the basic rate of carer&rsquo;s allowance and the respite care grant were not reduced.</p><p>  The Department is committed to ensuring that claims are processed as expeditiously as possible.  Processing times vary across schemes, depending on the differing qualification criteria.  In the case of carer&rsquo;s allowance, a high level of documentary evidence is required from the customer which can take longer to process.  Similarly, because it is a means-tested payments, some cases can require more detailed investigation thereby lengthening the decision making process. </p><p>  However, I am confident that the Department is taking appropriate action to improve processing times.  The carer&rsquo;s allowance section has recently completed a major service delivery modernisation project to improve the efficiency with which it processes applications from clients for carer&rsquo;s allowance.  A noted improvement was achieved in September with claims processing substantially exceeding claim intake.  While, it will take a number of months before the backlog is reduced to a fully acceptable level, the allocation of available resources to this task will remain under review.</p><p>  With regard to welfare expenditure for next year, no decisions have been made at this stage.  In the current economic climate every scheme in my Department must be kept under review.  As part of the deliberative process for the next Budget, my Department will analyse, in so far as possible, the distributive and poverty impact of possible social welfare changes. These impacts will be taken into account in arriving at the final decisions on the Budget. </p></reply>

The Commission is currently reviewing relevant youth policies across the Member States with a view to making its proposals.  The Commission&rsquo;s proposals are expected to be published in December, and achieving political agreement on these proposals in the Council will be a major objective of Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency in the first half of 2013.</p><p>  In the broadest terms, discussions to date indicate that a guarantee approach would involve identifying a specific target group of young people and ensuring that, within some specified time period after entering unemployment, each of them had either found a job or been placed in an appropriate education, training or work experience programme. </p><p>  However, there is considerable variation among Member States with regards to the possible implementation of any such guarantee, in terms of the target groups covered and the extent and nature of the policy commitments made.  The target group may include all persons aged under 25 who become unemployed, or be limited only to those who leave school with low qualification levels and remain &quot;not in employment education or training&quot; (NEET). The specified time period to which the guarantee relates may also vary, as may the type of intervention that is seen as meeting the guarantee.  Experience suggests that the core of any &quot;guarantee&quot; approach requires detailed and human-resource intensive administrative processes and information systems, usually within the public employment service.</p><p>  The Department is reviewing arrangements here in the light of these various approaches.  In particular, we are currently assessing the possible implications of any proposal in terms of the administrative, financial and programme resources that would be required.  These resource demands are likely to be particularly acute in Ireland given the current scale of youth unemployment.  However, more precise estimation will not be possible until the details of the Commission&rsquo;s proposals are finalised. </p></reply>

The overall aim is to provide short-term assistance and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer.  There are currently approximately 90,000 persons in receipt of rent supplement, for which the Government has provided &euro;436m in 2012.   </p><p>  Historically rent supplements have been administered at a local level by the Community Welfare Service directly to the customer.  As a result of the large increase in claims being made in recent years, with the number of persons in receipt of the allowance increasing by 62% during the period from 2007 to 2011, it was considered that the processing of rent supplement claims could be delivered more efficiently through centralised units in some areas.  Departmental officers who were formerly community welfare officers continue to assess applications for rent supplement within the centralised units.  The establishment of rent units also supports front line staff to focus in the delivery of basic payments and exceptional and urgent needs payments. </p><p>  Customers living in one of the areas covered by a rent unit can obtain a rent pack from their local departmental representative.  This pack contains detailed information and all the relevant application forms.  This rent pack can also be requested by phone from the relevant unit.  Information on the areas covered by rents units throughout the country is available on the Department&rsquo;s website. </p><p>  The timescale for determining individual applications for rent supplement is dependant, among other things, on the availability of the required information, such as details of the applicant&rsquo;s income, bank statements, information from landlords, etc.  In addition, some aspects of the applications are inevitably time consuming and delays can occur where further investigations or third party evidence is required.  Delays can also arise if the applicant is slow to respond to requests for additional information.  If the Deputy has a concern in relation to processing delays in a particular rent unit or in respect of an individual, they should provide this detail to the Department for follow up.  </p><p>  The delivery of services in relation to processing rent supplement applications is  subject to on-going review.  However, I have no plans at this time to reverse the establishment of some centralised rent units.  I am satisfied that staff makes every effort to decide rent supplement claims in an efficient, effective and timely manner. </p></reply>

A waiting period is considered essential to enable people to engage in job search and consider options available to them.  BTEA confers entitlement to income support for an extended period and to avoid distortions due to pull factors to the Live Register for the purpose of accessing schemes of this nature.  The qualifying period for the second level option is 3 months (78 days) in recognition of the need for more urgent intervention for this cohort, while the qualifying period for third level courses is 9 months (234 days).  A person awarded statutory redundancy may access BTEA immediately, provided an entitlement to a relevant social welfare payment is established. </p></reply>

The weekly minimum contribution is &euro;30 for a single adult household and &euro;35 for coupled households.  Many recipients pay more than this amount because recipients are also required, subject to income disregards, to contribute any additional assessable means that they have over and above the appropriate SWA rate towards their accommodation costs.</p><p>  I have no plans at this time to amend the personal contributions to mortgage interest supplement.

Currently, (to the end September 2012) there are 49,183 people in receipt of payment on this scheme.  The refusal rate on invalidity pension claims in the period 1/1/2012 to 30/9/2012 was 64%.  The rate of refusal is dependent on the extent to which the claims meet the qualifying conditions for the scheme.  In 2011, the corresponding figure was 56%.</p><p>  The large increase in the number of invalidity pension claims being made in 2011 and 2012 is a major factor in the increased refusal rate.  The increased invalidity pension claim intake relates to changes made to the qualifying conditions for short-term illness benefit, which is now limited to a maximum of 2 years.  As a consequence, there has been an increase in the number of claimants seeking to avail of the longer term invalidity pension.  However, such claimants may not satisfy the medical conditions necessary to establish a permanent incapacity to work and/or may not satisfy the social insurance contribution conditions necessary to qualify for an invalidity pension.  People who are refused for any of these reasons may apply/qualify for an alternative social welfare payment.  </p></reply>

Ordinary employees who have access to the full range of social insurance benefits pay Class A PRSI at the rate of 4%.  In addition, their employers make a PRSI contribution of 10.75% in respect of their employees, resulting in the payment of a combined 14.75% rate per employee under full-rate PRSI Class A.  (For employees earning less than &euro;356 per week, the rate of employer&rsquo;s PRSI is 4.25%).  </p><p>  The third Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund, as at 31 December 2010, was completed by consultants KPMG in June 2012 and laid before each House of the Oireachtas on 24 August 2012.   The Review covers a 55 year period from 2011&ndash;2066 and builds on the findings of the 2000 and 2005 Actuarial Reviews of the Fund.</p><p>  One of the issues examined in the 2010 Review was the long-term cost implications to the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) and the break-even contributions rates required to provide invalidity pensions to the self-employed and to provide jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit for self-employed workers.  The report found that the effective annual rate of contribution, or the required contribution as a percentage of salary, needed to provide the core full-rate State pension (contributory), which is the benefit currently available to self-employed contributors, is approximately 15%.  This compares favourably with the 4% rate currently paid by the self-employed.  An incremental increase in contribution rates from approximately 15% to 16% would be required if jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit in addition to core State pension (contributory) is provided.  The average contribution rate required for the core State pension (contributory) plus jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit and the invalidity pension is estimated to be in the region of 17.3%.</p><p>  Last year I established the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare to meet the commitment made in the Programme for Government.   The Advisory Group will, inter alia, examine and report on issues involved in providing social insurance cover for self-employed persons in order to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable.   </p><p>  The Advisory Group&rsquo;s overall method of working is based on producing modular reports on the priority areas identified in the Terms of Reference.  Where possible, the aim is to provide recommendations that can be acted upon in time for the annual budget, estimates and legislative cycle and to allow the Government to best address its commitments under the EU-IMF Programme of Financial Support.  The Group has been considering the issue of social insurance coverage for the self-employed and will submit its report once its examination of the various questions has been completed. </p><p>  Self-employed workers may establish eligibility to assistance-based payments such as jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and disability allowance.  In the case of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance they can apply for the means-tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.  In general, their means will take account of the level of earnings in the last twelve months in determining their expected income for the following year and, in the current climate, account is taken of the downward trend in the economy.  As in the case of a non-self-employed claimant for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance or disability allowance, the means of husband/wife, civil partner or co-habitant will be taken into account in deciding on entitlement to a payment  .</p><p>  Any proposals to extend additional cover to the self-employed will have to be considered in a budgetary context, taking account of the finding of the Actuarial Review that the self-employed achieve very good value for money compared with the employed &ndash; when the comparison includes both employer and employee contributions in respect of the employed person.  </p></reply>

INTREO is the integrated employment activation and supports service model that this Government promised to deliver in the Programme for Government and in &lsquo;Pathways to Work&rsquo;.     INTREO is the name for the new service model of the Department integrating the employment services and community programmes formerly of F&Aacute;S, and the Community Welfare Services (CWS) formerly of the HSE and the income support services provided by the Department itself.  </p><p>  The integration of functions and the transformation of the way the Department delivers its services were always envisaged as a multi-annual and iterative process of transformation.  The launch of INTREO in Sligo on Monday is a key milestone in that transformation process.</p><p>  Building upon the skills and processes in the enlarged Department, a new activation concept, the one-stop-shop has been developed and has been rolled out in four pilot offices, Sligo, King&rsquo;s Inns Parnell Street, Dublin  Arklow and Tallaght.   </p><p>  Other offices in Ballymun, Kilkenny, Buncrana, Coolock,  Finglas and Dundalk will go live before the end of the year.  INTREO will be then be rolled out to all the Department&rsquo;s offices nationwide by the end of 2014, in a programme that is being carefully managed in a live operating environment. </p><p>  INTREO&rsquo;s one-stop-shop offices includes a single integrated decision-making team that integrates and streamlines the processes formerly undertaken by the different agencies now amalgamated into the Department.  Already clients are seeing the benefits of the integrated decisions process in terms of shorter decision times and in the reduced recourse to supplementary payments in offices where integrated decisions are in operation.  </p><p>  On being awarded a claim, the client will also be asked to sign a &lsquo;social contract&rsquo; with the Department.  The client acknowledges their responsibility to work to secure employment at the earliest possible opportunity, on the understanding that failure to adhere to those undertakings may result in the reduction or withdrawal of income support payments.</p><p>  The most significant demands of the Pathways approach are i) profiles of clients to inform the approach taken to activation; ii) Early engagement with clients through group engagement sessions; iii) One to one interviews with case managers.</p><p>  Progress under each of these headings is as follows (a) the Profiling of all new claimants has been operating in the four pilot one-stop shop locations and is now also operating in all other DSP offices. The roll-out programme has been completed ahead of the December 2012 target; (b) The Department targeted to involve 30,000 clients in group engagements with 20,500 by the end of August.  In fact, more than 42,000 clients had been involved in group engagements by that time; (c) The Department committed to holding 90,000 initial one-to-one guidance interviews with clients by the end of August 2012 but almost 110,000 had been held by that date.  That figure doesn&rsquo;t include the 98,000 follow-up meetings held by the end of August.</p><p>  INTREO is also refocusing the Department&rsquo;s relationship with employers. </p><p>The level of contact with employers at national and local level is already increasing. For example   Springboard Recruitment fairs were held in conjunction with HEA in Dublin, Galway and Cork during September. I am working on a further series of seven employer briefings over the next two months starting in Limerick on Friday.</p><p>  The launch of INTREO marks a watershed in the way the Department responds to the needs of today&rsquo;s Ireland.  INTREO puts the flesh on the Government&rsquo;s policy initiatives to put Ireland back to work. </p></reply>

The aim of rent supplement is to provide short term income assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer.</p><p>  In March 2012, the Government approved in principle to transfer responsibility for the provision of rental assistance to persons with a long term housing need from my Department, currently provided through rent supplement, to housing authorities using a new Housing Assistance Payment (HAP).  A multi-agency steering group has been established to develop proposals to give effect to this transfer.  The group is chaired by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and consists of representatives from the Departments of Social Protection; Public Expenditure and Reform; Office of the Revenue Commissioners; the County and City Managers Association, and the Housing Agency. Proposals will be brought to Government before the end of this year including proposed amendments to legislation, if required.</p><p>  It is planned that pilot testing of HAP arrangements will commence during the second half of 2013 with general roll out and commencement of transfers from January 2014. Policy matters and reporting in relation to the HAP scheme is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government. </p><p>  The new arrangements will achieve a key Government commitment of removing barriers to employment and at the same time returning rent supplement to its original purpose of a short-term income support.</p></reply>

This includes &euro;540 million of new savings to be achieved in Budget 2013. </p><p>  The CER also stated that the Department would look at three broad areas, namely children and families, people of working age and retired and older people to identify further indicative savings.

As part of the Budgetary deliberative process, the Department will analyse, in so far as possible, the distributive and poverty impact of possible welfare changes to all welfare recipients including different family types including those with children and male/female poverty impacts.  Finally, the Department will prepare a similar analysis of the overall Budget 2013 tax and welfare packages when they are finalised.  </p></reply>

The existence of the Funding Standard itself is not the central issue in relation to whether a scheme is properly funded. Rather the responsibility rests with the employer and the trustees for ensuring that the scheme is properly funded and managed. However, the Funding Standard does provide the regulatory mechanism for ensuring that a scheme can live up to the &ldquo;promised&rdquo; level of pension benefits.   The fundamental problem facing pension schemes is that pensions have become significantly more expensive, because of increasing life expectancy and lower than expected investment returns which are reflected in increased annuity rates. The recent facility to purchase sovereign annuities will enable a higher rate of return to apply, but only in the case of those schemes which actually purchase the bonds/annuities.  </p><p>  While it is acknowledged that increased annuity rates are causing significant problems for pension schemes, this reflects the real cost of benefits. If the Funding Standard is changed in such a way that understates the cost of the benefits (by using prescribed non-market rates, or by using sovereign bond rates without a corresponding commitment to buying sovereign annuities on wind-up), then the members may be misled about the ability of the scheme to meet its obligations, and the on-going funding of the scheme will not be enough to close the deficit. This would be likely to make things worse, as future benefits would accrue at a faster rate than they were being paid for. </p><p>  The requirement for a risk reserve is being introduced from 2016, to provide a level of protection for scheme members against future volatility in financial markets. It is accepted that the requirement for a risk reserve presents an added challenge for schemes, however, guidance issued by the regulator identifies options which the scheme can consider in meeting this requirement by 2023.</p><p>The Pensions Board recently announced that the timeframe for pension schemes to submit funding proposals has been extended to 30 June 2013. This extension will give schemes additional time to help them address the issues they are facing.    It should be noted that the changes to the Funding Standard are being implemented over the next 11 years, not immediately. This is the longest recovery period generally allowed in any European country.</p><p>  Overall, the changes made to the regulatory structure for defined benefit schemes are intended to bring increased stability to pension promises in the future and lessen schemes&rsquo; exposure to risks.</p></reply>

It is working closely with the Office of Public Works (OPW), which has responsibility for the acquisition of all accommodation requirements for the Department, to that end.    There are currently four projects in hand with the OPW which, on completion, will fully address its office accommodation problems in Newbridge.  One of these projects will be completed by the end of this year. Planning permission has been granted in the case of a second project and a third is at the design stage. Both of those projects will be completed in 2013.  </p><p>  The fourth project is the largest and most complex of the four. While the other three projects will provide a welcome alleviation of the current office accommodation problems, a fully satisfactory outcome will not be achieved for either staff or customers until the fourth project is completed. It is still at a very early stage of development and it is not possible to give a realistic completion date until further progress is made in site selection and detailed design. </p></reply>

An overpayment will arise where, in accordance with Part 11 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, a revised decision is made by a deciding officer on a claimant&rsquo;s claim resulting in a retrospective reduction in his/her entitlement.    The Department categorises overpayments as fraud, non-fraud and estate cases.  In 2011, there were a total of 63,310 overpayments amounting to &euro;92.4m.  Fraud cases arise mainly on foot of false declarations by customers concerning their employment, income or family status while non-fraud cases are primarily due to customer, third party or departmental error.   Estate cases arise where undisclosed means by customers (usually pensioners) come to light after their deaths.</p><p>  The breakdown of the 2011 overpayments is as follows:</p><p>- Fraud - &euro;34.9m involving 20,585 cases; </p><p>- Non-fraud - &euro;46.0m involving 42,354 cases; and</p><p>- Estate - &euro;11.5m involving 371 cases. </p><p>  The Department is fully committed to recovering 100% of all overpayments. An outstanding overpayment will result in a reduction of all future entitlements up to and including State pension and potentially a claim on any estate.  An overpayment will remain on a customer&rsquo;s record until fully recovered. The Department endeavours to seek the maximum level of repayments from customers in order to encourage prompt repayment of all debts.  Effective debt recovery is seen an integral part of the deterrent to fraudulent claiming. </p><p>  The Department&rsquo;s Central Overpayments and Debt Management Unit is the central reporting area for all the Department&rsquo;s overpayments and it monitors debt recovery policies and practices across the various scheme areas with a view to improving the level of debt recovered. However, it is important to point out that each of the Department&rsquo;s primary scheme areas and local offices has a localised debt management function.  The number of staff specifically involved in the management and collection of debt will depend on the claim load and the level of overpayments in each of these areas.</p></reply>

It should be noted that expenditure this year on child benefit, qualified child increases on primary social welfare payments, the family income supplement and the back to school clothing and footwear allowance is estimated to be just over &euro;3 billion. The Government is conscious that these payments are an important source of income for families, particularly during a time of recession and unemployment. Furthermore, the Government is committed to tackling Ireland&rsquo;s economic crisis in a way that is fair, balanced, and which recognises the need for social solidarity. In addressing the problems with the public finances, the Government will seek to ensure that resources are allocated fairly and that less well-off families are protected in so far as possible.  Furthermore, the Government is acutely aware of the need to address child poverty as a priority as part of the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion 2007-2016 (NAPSincl) and in the Programme for Government. The recently completed review of the national poverty target also highlights the importance of addressing child poverty and will be published shortly.</p><p>  I assume that the statistics cited by the Deputy relate to the recently published CSO report entitled &ldquo;Survey of Income and Living Conditions (SILC): Thematic Report on Children 2004 &ndash; 2010&rdquo;.  The report publishes data related to household incomes for seven-year period up to 2010 and is derived from the CSO&rsquo;s annual Survey on Income and Living Conditions (SILC) from which data in relation to poverty up to 2010 had already been published.   The report therefore covers a period before this government&rsquo;s term of office began.</p><p>  The Department is aware that the publication shows that average weekly gross income for all households with children less than 18 years did fall from &euro;1,288.33 in 2009 to &euro;1,184.00 in 2010 or a fall of 8.1% in the year. I am also aware that the corresponding data for households without children under 18 years were &euro;924.65 and &euro;902.23 respectively representing a fall of 2.4% in the year. </p><p>  It should be borne in mind that these trends largely reflected the decline in household incomes generally, as a consequence of the economic downturn.  Direct income of households with children (largely income from employment and self-employment) fell by almost 11% in the year 2010.  In fact, it was an increase in average transfer payments of almost 2% that moderated the loss of gross income for such households to 8.1%.   The operation of the tax and social contribution system served further to moderate this loss in net incomes to 7.4% compared to 2.3% for households without children.</p><p>   While we must acknowledge this considerable loss in purchasing power, the moderation in the loss from direct to net incomes is largely due to the relative effectiveness of the social welfare system and the effect of family related social transfers.  It  can also be observed from CSO data in how the at risk of poverty rate for people living in households with children in 2010 decreased from 49.4 per cent when all social transfers were excluded to 18.7 per cent when all social transfers were included: a reduction of nearly 31 percentage points. This clearly demonstrates the role that social transfers, play in protecting people in households with children from poverty. More generally, the SILC data from this report also shows that the poverty reduction effect of social transfers for children has risen continuously from around 40% in 2004 to over 60% in 2010 as the social welfare system became more effective in addressing poverty in households with children. </p><p>  Nonetheless, I am conscious that achieving a better design of the overall system of child income supports raises complex issues about the effectiveness and efficiency of the full range of income supports currently provided to families and their children. In this context and in line with a commitment in the Programme for Government, I established an Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare last year, which has been tasked with recommending cost-effective solutions as to how employment disincentives can be improved and better poverty outcomes achieved, particularly child poverty outcomes. The Advisory Group prioritised the area of family and child income supports and has completed its work on this area. Their report is currently receiving my consideration and will assist the Government in considering the effectiveness and efficiency of the current system of child income supports.</p><p>  Any plans to change child and family income support payments will be a matter to be decided in a budgetary context and announced on Budget day. As the Government meets and acts collectively, Ministers regularly consult with their colleagues in Government on policy proposals and any implications that they might have in terms of children&rsquo;s rights.  </p></reply>

CE helps unemployed people to re-enter the active workforce by breaking their experience of unemployment through a return to a work routine and to assist them to enhance/develop both their technical and personal skills.   The maximum participation limits for CE are 3 years in total for those under 55 years of age, and 6 years in total for those of 55 to 65 years of age. Off-shore islander clients are exempt from CE participation caps. Persons in receipt of one of the four qualifying disability-related social welfare payments are eligible for one additional year on top of these two limits, i.e., 4 years for those under 55 and 7 years for those of 55 to 65. </p><p>  The length of time a person can remain on CE is dictated by a number of factors (as governed by the eligibility rules of CE):</p><p>- Age of the person  Department of Social Protection (DSP ) payment and duration;</p><p>- Previous participation on CE since April 2000;</p><p>- Whether they are considered job-ready;</p><p>- Budgetary limitations</p><p>  The overall duration limits are strictly enforced to maximize the number of places available for potential clients. There are no plans to extend the time limits on CE. The emphasis on shorter-term interventions on CE as part of the Pathways to Work Initiative is to assist the maximum number of eligible persons via participation on the scheme. The current rules governing CE eligibility allow for 10% persons engaged on a year&#8217;s placement to have their time extended into a second year if they can demonstrate that they would benefit from such an extension.</p><p>The aim of CE still remains as an active labour market programme with the emphasis<font color="#FF0000"> </font>  on progression into employment.  There is a wide range of client groups which need access to CE &#8211; lone parents, persons with disabilities, stabilised substance abusers and unemployed persons.  DSP at all times is obliged to accommodate the needs of all these groups in terms of participation on Community Employment.  The programme is managed within this context, with consideration to the availability of resources and the needs of participants and the community.</p></reply>

It is expected that spending on Social Insurance Fund schemes, services and administration will be on target for the full year but the Social Insurance Fund deficit will be in the region of &euro;2.1 billion to &euro;2.2 billion due to the shortfall in PRSI contributions.   The Department&rsquo;s expenditure is incurred almost entirely on payments to individual recipients based on predetermined qualifying conditions and rates of payment, most of which are set out in legislation.

Over the same period, the Earnings, Hours and Employment Costs Survey (EHECS), which is the more reliable source for public sector employment estimates according to CSO, reported an annual fall in employment of 25,800 for the 'Total Public Sector including Semi-State bodies' sector. This includes a reduction of 5,300 related to Census 2011 temporary field staff over the year.    The annual fall in employment for quarter 1 2012, as reported in the QNHS, was 18,100 and for Quarter 2 2011 was 37,800. The annual fall in public sector employment from EHECS for those quarters was 21,900 and 2,300 respectively.

All payments are made from the Social Insurance Fund (SIF).  There are two types of redundancy payment made from the SIF - rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership or liquidation.  </p><p>  It is the responsibility of the employer to pay statutory redundancy to all their eligible employees.  An employer who pays statutory redundancy payments to their employees is then entitled to a rebate of a portion of that payment from the State.  Rebates to employers and lump sums paid directly to employees are paid from the Social Insurance Fund.  </p><p>  Significant and increasing amounts have been paid out in redundancy rebates to employers from the SIF in recent years.  While the SIF is constituted primarily from employer contributions, the taxpayers&rsquo; contribution is also significant.  One of the factors which influenced the Government&rsquo;s decision to revise the rebate rate was the increasing cost of rebates in recent years.</p><p>  I am very concerned about the deficit in the Social Insurance Fund.   In term of redundancy rebate payments to employers, &euro;152.2 million was paid out in 2006; &euro;167.4 million in 2007; &euro;161.8 million in 2008; &euro;247.9 million in 2009; &euro;373.2 million in 2010 and &euro;185.3 million in 2011.  The amounts paid out in lump sums to employees have also increased.   The Budget 2012 changes were given legislative effect in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2012. The new changes apply where the date of dismissal by reason of redundancy occurs on or after 1 January 2012.  </p><p>  I do not see why this country should continue to borrow money to plug the hole in the Social Insurance Fund in order to fund the cost of making people redundant &ndash; often from very profitable companies.  </p><p>  As part of the deliberations on Budget 2012, the approach taken in other countries was examined and it was decided that the 60% level of rebate is not sustainable in the current economic climate.   While this may cause difficulties for employers it should be noted that redundancy rebate payments to employers are not common in many EU and other jurisdictions.  The new arrangements bring Ireland more closely into line with practice in other countries.   </p><p>  It is not proposed to introduce a tiered system of redundancy rebate rates or to make exceptions for small businesses.</p></reply>

It enables those in receipt of certain social welfare payments to continue to receive a payment while pursuing an approved full-time education course that leads to a higher qualification than that already held.  One of the key requirements to access this scheme is that a person must progress in the level of education held with reference to the national framework of qualifications among others.  It is my intention to retain the requirements in respect of progression in education as a feature of the BTEA in line with the necessity that State support for education purposes is grounded on a student progressing from one qualification level to a higher one.   The Springboard initiative funded by the Department of Education and Skills is available to unemployed and those previously self-employed to up-skill or re-skill in areas where sustainable employment opportunities may arise as the economy recovers.  This can involve undertaking a course of study at a lower level of qualification already possessed by the applicant.  Participants on jobseeker's payments may pursue Springboard courses and retain their payments while an entitlement exists under the PTEO.</p></reply>

The aim of rent supplement is to provide short term income assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer.</p><p>  The maximum rent limits were set after an analysis of the most up to date market data available. For all counties, major urban population centres were tested as part of the rents review to ensure that rent supplement applicants can access temporary housing arrangements whilst seeking employment opportunities. The emphasis of the rent limit review was to ensure that maximum value for money for tenants and the taxpayer was achieved whilst at the same time ensuring that people on rent supplement are not priced out of the market. The Department will continue to monitor rent levels throughout the country but at this point I have no plans to revise the existing rent limits.</p><p>  Analysis shows that for County Kildare, there are properties available within the maximum rent limits for rent supplement recipients.  The number of rental properties available in North Kildare is somewhat lower than the numbers available in the rest of the county and therefore impacts on the number of accommodation units available for rent supplement. The maximum rent limit for a couple or one parent family, with two children in County Kildare is &euro;725. </p><p>  Latest figures show that there are currently 4,329 rent supplement recipients in County Kildare. When compared with Census 2011 household data this shows that 36% of properties rented from private landlords are in receipt of rent supplement in County Kildare. Figures also show that there are over 900 rent supplement recipients in the Leixlip, Maynooth and Celbridge areas in North Kildare, indicating that it is possible to secure accommodation in these locations within the rent limits.     A multi-agency steering group has been established to develop proposals to give effect to this transfer.  The group is chaired by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and consists of representatives from the Departments of Social Protection; Public Expenditure and Reform; Office of the Revenue Commissioners; the County and City Managers Association, and the Housing Agency.  </p><p>Discussions regarding the use of National Asset Management Agency (NAMA) properties for social housing have not taken place with the Department for Environment, Community and Local Government.  Policy in relation to the proposed use of NAMA properties for social housing and local authority housing lists are a matter for my colleague the Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government.</p></reply>

There is one Executive Officer from the National Economic and Social Council, which is the only agency under the aegis of my Department, on career break.  Seven staff from my Department availed of the civil service special incentive career break scheme which was introduced for a limited time in 2009.  This scheme provided for payment of a third of gross salary to a maximum of &euro;12,500 per annum for three years for those who availed of it.  As such a cost arises for my Department under this scheme but no costs arise under the other career break scheme available to staff in my Department which provides for unpaid leave only.</p><p>  To date, &euro;219,984 has been paid by my Department to the officers who availed of the incentivised career break scheme.  No staff were hired temporarily to cover those on career break under either scheme and the savings on the pay bill so far are &euro;1,073,163.  In keeping with normal practice for recording staff numbers, staff availing of the scheme are not counted in the staff numbers returns which Departments make to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  It is not possible to estimate the cost arising in 2013, for the return of staff who availed of the scheme, as it is not yet clear when vacancies will be available.  The working patterns of the staff concerned (e.g. full time, mornings only, week-on / week/off) and whether they might wish to extend their career breaks are other factors that would affect the costs arising from their returning to work.  One of the staff concerned has applied for a career break extension.  Changes to the career break schemes are centrally agreed and as such are a matter for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p></reply>

This was already a key feature of my Department's Customer Charter, which undertakes that customers who wish to conduct their business through Irish can do so.  However, because the primary focus of my Department's work is on dealings with Government and other Departments and Agencies, we do not experience a significant level of demand from the public for service in Irish.  Nevertheless, in keeping with the spirit of the Act, we are fully committed to improving the service we provide in Irish and to developing, on an ongoing basis, a positive culture that encourages the use of Irish both within the Department and with our customers.</p><p>  As required by the Act, we have set out our commitments in this regard in our current Official Languages Scheme.  As my Department was already providing a bilingual service as part of our customer service commitments prior to the Official Languages Act 2003, it is difficult to quantify exactly how much is directly attributable to the implementation of the Act.</p><p>  In 2011, a total of &euro;19,735.69 was incurred in relation to the Irish language:  Translation - &euro;12,506.55; Advertising - &euro;7,069.14; Language courses - &euro;160.  As one would expect, most of the translation costs were in respect of translation from English to Irish, in order to provide a better service to those who wish to receive material in or conduct their business through Irish; to reflect the national nature of my Department&rsquo;s work; and to fulfil our obligations under the Official Languages Act.  Most of the expenditure on advertising related to public notices for the National Day of Commemoration, and to the Department&rsquo;s entry in the State Directory pages of the phone books.  This figure does not include the long-standing practice of advertising in Irish in the Iris Oifigi&uacute;il, which predates the introduction of the Official Languages Act.</p><p>  With regard to bodies under the aegis of this Department, the cost to the National Economic and Social Development Office (NESDO) of implementing the Official Languages Act 2003 in 2011 was &euro;992.36. This related entirely to translation costs of the annual report of the office for the year ended 31 December 2010.</p></reply>

Last month my colleague, the Minister of State for Trade and Development, Mr. Joe Costello, T.D., launched the &lsquo;Winning Business in Africa&rsquo; Report in collaboration with the Irish Business and Employers Confederation. This valuable report focuses on opportunities in energy and renewable energy, infrastructure, water and mining and identifies over 100 projects in African countries, valued at up to &euro;12 billion, for which Irish companies can bid over the next five years.    The report included a reference to the Global Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Fund, to which the Deputy refers in his Question.  It is a public-private partnership initiated by the Directorate General for Environment and the Directorate General for Europe Aid Cooperation Office (AIDCO) of the European Commission. We do not have specific information on individual applications by Irish companies to this fund.  However, more generally, I am pleased to note that trade with Africa continues to grow. Irish exports of goods and services to Africa were valued at over &euro;2.7 billion in 2011 and figures from the Central Statistics Office show an increase of 7% for the first five months of 2012 over the same period last year.</p></reply>

In such cases, the Passport Service will issue a passport within 3 working days.  A fee of <b>&#8364;</b>55, which is additional to the applicable fee for the issue of a passport, must be paid by the applicant.  When applying through a public office, the applicant must state clearly at the time of application that the passport is needed urgently and must provide satisfactory evidence of the need to expedite the application.  An expedited service is not provided in cases where the applicant is a first time adult applicant and cannot be guaranteed where an applicant cannot produce his/her previous passport due to loss or theft.    In cases where a passport is required for travel necessitated by an emergency such as the death or illness of a family member receive the highest priority and are generally turned around on the same day.  This service is available at the Passport Service public offices.  Outside of normal opening hours, a duty officer service is in place to deal with similar emergencies which cannot await the reopening of a public office.</p><p>  I should point out that the standard processing time for all passports received through the Passport Express Service available through post offices is 10 working days.  Applications made over the counter in the Passport Office in Dublin City Centre or in Cork during the peak season of application demand are processed within 15 working days.</p></reply>

The Government decided in December 2011 to allocate a budget in the order of &euro;60m over 2012 and 2013 to resource the Presidency, which excludes security costs. This budget is broadly in line with budgets for recent Presidencies and is less than the budget for the Irish Presidency in 2004 where total expenditure was in excess of &euro;93 million.</p><p>  An effectively managed Presidency will deliver long-term reputational benefit for Ireland.  Short-term benefits include significant benefits for the local economy from an influx of up to 15,000 delegates, press and representatives of NGOs who will use local services including hotels, restaurants, taxis etc. over the six month Presidency period.  The use of Dublin Castle and a small number of other state-owned venues mainly in Dublin to host most Presidency meetings will reduce venue hire, transport and set-up costs, not to mention significantly reducing the &ldquo;carbon footprint&rdquo; of the Presidency.  To date, expenditure on Presidency related items by all Departments is just over &euro;4.2 million. However, that figure is expected to rise rapidly as additional staff is deployed to the Presidency and payments to service providers and suppliers begin to fall due over the coming months.</p><p>  The procurement of most logistical requirements for the Presidency is being centralised to reduce costs, reduce administrative burden, and increase efficiencies. Procurement is being carried out on a collaborative basis involving principally my Department, the National Procurement Service and the Office of Public Works. Purchasing is being conducted in a transparent and competitive basis in compliance with relevant EU and national rules which, among other things, require that contracts over certain value thresholds (&euro;130,000 for goods and services) be advertised and open to EU-wide competition.  It is too early to say at this stage how much of the procurement spend will accrue to domestic firms, but I can confirm that domestic suppliers and service providers are actively and successfully competing for tenders to date.</p></reply>

To successfully deliver on that objective we need to tackle the ongoing financial crisis, and restore stability to the Euro zone, but the focus must be on generating growth in the EU economy and getting Europe back to work.  </p><p>  During the Presidency the Government will deliver on its ambitions through a range of policy and legislative measures that cut across a broad range of policy areas which will push forward the growth and jobs agenda.  As an export-driven economy, Ireland has reaped the benefits of the European Single Market, but the global economy has evolved.  One of the aims of the Single Market Act II, which was published by the European Commission on 3 October, will be to respond to changes in the economy, particularly by exploiting the potential of the digital economy for business and consumers.  </p><p>  As Presidency Ireland will work to underpin and stimulate research and innovation across the EU for the coming decade by advancing agreement on the Horizon 2020 framework programme which can play an important role in boosting the EU economy, generating smart and sustainable growth and jobs, and strengthening the Union&rsquo;s global competitiveness.  The Presidency will deliver a major effort in the field of research and innovation with a range of thematic events planned and a commitment to advance decisions on key legislation in this rapidly growing area where the EU can become a global leader.  </p><p>  Ireland will make significant advances in the external trade agenda during its Presidency and will hold a meeting of Trade Ministers in Ireland during the Presidency which will focus on the EU-US trade relationship.  </p><p>  The Presidency will make special efforts to address the problem of youth unemployment across the EU and will work closely with partners to seek solutions to tackle this fundamental challenge.  </p><p>  Europe&rsquo;s economy can only grow if there is stability and confidence in the EU economy.  For this reason, the Irish Presidency will work to ensure the effective implementation of recent economic governance measures, and to make progress on the Banking Union proposals.  The third main priority of the Irish Presidency will be the EU&rsquo;s future budget to underpin growth and to sharpen Europe&rsquo;s global competitiveness.  The Irish Government supports the Cyprus Presidency in its efforts to reach agreement on the MFF and stands ready to take forward the necessary implementing legislation to ensure that the EU has a budget to support programmes that are of major economic importance to Member States such as CAP, CFP and Horizon 2020 (the EU's future framework programme for research and innovation) for the 2014-2020 period.  These programmes can play a key role in spurring economic growth and creating employment.  </p><p>  Work on the Irish Presidency is a top priority across all Departments as the Presidency nears.  The Government met with the College of Commissioners on 3 October in Brussels and the President of the European Parliament also visited Dublin on 3-4 October.  We were pleased with the outcomes of the both meeting which confirmed that there is broad agreement between the Government and partners on the main priorities and objectives that we have identified at this stage of planning for our Presidency.  Issues discussed at the meetings will feed into the drafting of the Presidency programme which will be published in December.  </p><p>  </p></reply>

Discussion focussed on the heightened tensions currently existing between Syria and Turkey and the dangers of the conflict spreading into the wider region. Considerable attention was also devoted to the worsening humanitarian situation, with 1.5 million Syrians internally displaced and an estimated 300,000 refugees having fled to neighbouring countries.   Syria was also discussed at a dinner meeting which I and my EU counterparts had with Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov last Sunday evening, prior to the Council. I had already met with Foreign Minister Lavrov while attending the UN General Assembly in New York last month and had discussed Syria in detail at that stage and encouraged Russia to use its considerable influence on the situation to end the violence and promote a meaningful political transition in Syria.</p><p>  The Foreign Affairs Council agreed detailed Conclusions on Syria which made clear that the EU continues to stand by the Syrian people in their courageous struggle for freedom, dignity and democracy. The Council also expressed deep concern concerning the spill-over effects of the Syrian crisis in neighbouring countries and strongly condemned the shelling by Syrian forces of Turkish territory, including the attack on the border town of Akcakale on 3 October.</p><p>  The absolute priority remains stopping all violence and ending oppression and, in this regard, the Council once again warned against the dangers of further militarisation and radicalisation of the conflict. The Council also expressed its full support for the efforts of the UN/Arab League Joint Special Representative, Lakhdar Brahimi, to secure an early ceasefire and promote an overall political settlement. </p><p>  The Council also addressed the rapidly deteriorating humanitarian situation and recalled the moral imperative for the international community to step up assistance to all affected populations in Syria and neighbouring countries. Ireland, for its part, is already making a substantial contribution to humanitarian relief efforts, having provided &euro;2.45 million in assistance to date, principally channelled through UNHRC, ICRC and WHO. Development Minister Costello also visited Zatari refugee camp in Jordan at the end of August.</p><p>  I have consistently reiterated that there needs to be accountability for all the very many serious human rights violations committed in Syria and that is why nationally we support referral of the situation by the UN Security Council to the International Criminal Court. The Council for its part equally reiterated that all those responsible for serious human rights abuses must be held accountable and welcomed the extension of the mandate of the UN Commission of Inquiry investigating such events in Syria.</p><p>  The Council also approved a further round of restrictive measures targeted against the Assad regime and it supporters, giving the Syrian government&rsquo;s continuing clear failure to end repression and desist from waging war and inflicting horrendous suffering on its own people. While EU sanctions have been effective in increasing pressure on the Assad regime, I continue to believe the most effective measure which could be taken now to end the violence in Syria would be the imposition of a comprehensive arms embargo by the Security Council.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-10-16a.234.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/951" speakername="Eamon Gilmore" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012101600056#WRD02200"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 139 and 140 together.</p><p>  This summer's parades in Northern Ireland were once again marred by outbreaks of violence, most significantly in North Belfast where there were serious disturbances in the Ardoyne on 12 July and in the Carrick Hill/Carlisle Circus area over several evenings in late August and early September.  Such violence is totally unacceptable.  The disturbances in Carrick Hill/Carlisle Circus resulted in injuries to 65 PSNI officers.  I condemn those involved in violence against the police service and I am pleased to note that charges have been brought in a number of cases. </p><p>These riots caused serious concerns regarding community relations in advance of the parades commemorating the centenary of the signing of the Ulster Covenant, which took place on Saturday 29 September. In the event, the parades, which involved 208 bands and over 30,000 marchers, passed off without violence, following extensive behind-the-scenes efforts, although several breaches of the Parades Commission determinations were reported to the authorities. </p><p>  I commend the First Minister and Deputy First Minister for moving quickly to defuse the situation and using their offices to liaise with the various interested parties, as well as the efforts of MLAs, Councillors, the churches and community representatives.   </p><p>  Respect is the key to preventing and resolving violence related to parades and sectarianism, and I applaud efforts to facilitate dialogue between residents and parade organisers. I have discussed this matter with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland on a number of occasions since she took up office, and we agreed to work together to support efforts to address division and sectarianism and to help promote the shared future agenda.</p><p>I would like to welcome the apology provided by the Royal Black Institution for the incident outside St Patrick&rsquo;s Church in Carrick Hill on 25 August, and hope that this will clear the way for further progress in relation to parades in Belfast.  </p><p>  Irish Government officials monitored events leading up to the Covenant parade closely and used every opportunity to underline the importance of dialogue and respect. They remained in regular contact with local residents and clergy in advance of the parade, as efforts were made to address residents' concerns. At the request of the residents, the feeder parades were monitored on the ground by my officials. Both the Taoiseach and myself were fully briefed as the situation evolved, and I was heartened that the parade passed off peacefully. </p><p>  It must be recognised that the Parades Commission also played a key role in working to promote a peaceful outcome to the Covenant parade. It continues to work to address the parades issue in a very challenging environment, and it is essential that the determinations of the Parades Commission are respected and upheld as the rule of law.</p><p>  The scenes of rioting in early September made international headlines and underlined the urgent need to address the root causes of division and sectarianism in Northern Ireland. They also underlined the potential for sectarian acts to destabilise the situation generally and for new flashpoints to emerge. In the absence of a clear strategy to address the causes of division in Northern Ireland, events such as those we have seen in recent weeks risk damaging community relations in general, undermining economic regeneration strategies for Belfast and tarnishing Northern Ireland&rsquo;s improving international reputation for stability and political progress. </p><p>  These events underline the importance and urgency at this time of the Northern Ireland Executive delivering on and implementing an agreed Strategy for Cohesion, Sharing and Integration.</p></reply>

It is a vehicle for reconciliation and better understanding on the island but is also a mechanism for ensuring a more efficient delivery of services and a more coordinated approach to job creation and recovery, North and South.</p><p>  The establishment and first meeting last week of a North/South Parliamentary Forum was a significant and welcome step forward in developing a vital dimension to this cooperation.  This body will meet twice yearly on a rotational basis and I am confident that it will add to the momentum for closer cooperation. </p><p>  There has been valuable progress in cooperation through the North-South Ministerial Council and the North South Implementation Bodies.  </p><p>  Across a range of issues, the NSMC is facilitating economic and social sector activities on a cross-border, all-island basis. Ministers have re-iterated their commitment to practical cooperation on economic cooperation and to explore areas where potential cost savings might be achieved. The potential benefits of developing markets for both jurisdictions has been recognised.  </p><p>In the area of transport, Ministers have agreed on a detailed timetable for the drafting, passage and enactment of parallel legislation, north and south, by 31 December 2014 to allow the mutual recognition of penalty points across Ireland.  </p><p>  In the tourism area, Tourism Ireland continues to build on the success of the 2011 marketing campaign which showed a growth in overseas visitors to the island for the first time since 2007.  </p><p>  InterTradeIreland is working to encourage and stimulate greater co-operation to increase applications to EU Framework Programmes, including enhanced levels of SME participation. </p><p>  Earlier in the year the Special EU Programmes Body had a successful open call for INTERREG IVA applications with 91 applications received requesting &euro;217.6 million.</p><p>  In the field of environment, good progress has been made on repatriation of illegally dumped waste.  </p><p>  Education is a sector of great promise; among the joint work being undertaken is a joint attitudinal survey to inform cross-border pupil movement and school planning and liaison between the two Teaching Councils with the objective of facilitating full mobility of teachers across both jurisdictions.  </p><p>  In health, there is ongoing collaboration on minimum unit price for alcohol and proposals for a North/South Alcohol Forum to develop strategies in both jurisdictions on alcohol misuse.  Planning is well advanced for the establishment of a radiotherapy unit at Altnagelvin. Construction will commence in 2013 with the unit being operational in 2016.  </p><p>  A Memorandum of Understanding enables continuation for the next five years of joint programmes in education, training, research and prevention by the Ireland-Northern Ireland-US National Cancer Institute Cancer Consortium. </p><p>  The St Andrews Agreement also provided for a review of the existing North South bodies and to examine the case for additional North South bodies and areas of co-operation, as well as a replacement for the Irish Lights Agency.  </p><p>  The first element of the Review, on value for money and efficiency of the North South Bodies, has been largely agreed.  However progress on the Second and Third Terms of Reference of the Review, which include the case for additional bodies and areas of co-operation within the NSMC, has been disappointingly slow.  This is currently the subject of reflection and consultation and I am hopeful that progress can be made at the forthcoming plenary meeting on 2 November.</p></reply>

Ireland&rsquo;s Council of the Presidency of the EU during the first six months in 2013 will be a critical element of this process.  The Government looks forward to using the Presidency to define and promote policy and legislation that can benefit the lives of millions of citizens in Ireland and across the EU.  </p><p>  Work is underway on the administrative planning for the EU Presidency which is being taken forward by my Department.  This work involves close coordination with the Department of the Taoiseach, with other Government Departments and with the OPW.  An Inter-Departmental group meets on a regular basis to update on policy and developments in this area. In tandem with this, a meetings coordinators network comprising all Departments was established early in 2012 and now meets on a monthly basis to discuss detailed logistical planning for events that will take place in Ireland during the Presidency.  </p><p>A Government decision of 20 December 2011 agreed, inter alia, that &quot;additional resources in the order of &euro;60million, plus security costs&quot;, is required to fund the Presidency and that Dublin Castle and other State-owned properties in Dublin will be the default venues for all Presidency-related events in Ireland. In addition, the planning approach agreed foresees the provision of centralised services to Departments for the Presidency where it is advantageous to do so. </p><p>  This centralised approach, led by my Department, is being adopted in order to reduce overall resource costs, to ease the administrative burden for other Departments and to avoid duplication of effort.  This includes a centralised procurement scheme for all goods and services that will be required for the running of the Presidency which is nearing completion.  </p></reply>

The collection is integrated with the collection of PAYE in the case of employees, and with the self assessment system in the case of other taxpayers.  Landlords are expected to include tax USC and PRSI with their annual return of income and pay the appropriate amount.  Revenue selects cases for intervention based on the presence of various risk indicators and other information available. This targeted approach is supported by Revenue&rsquo;s Risk Evaluation Analysis and Profiling System (REAP) which contains considerable information on all self-assessed taxpayers, including taxpayers with rental income.</p><p>Projects, specifically aimed at investigating landlords, are regularly undertaken in all Revenue regions with a view to monitoring the rental sector.

Revenue currently has over 2,000 staff engaged on activities that are dedicated to target and confront non-compliance.  These front-line activities include anti-smuggling and anti-evasion, investigation and prosecution, audit, assurance checks, anti-avoidance and debt collection.  Revenue has an enforcement presence at all key airports and ports and at other strategic locations throughout the State.  Enforcement strength at particular locations is regularly augmented with additional personnel on a risk-assessment basis, or when particular operations are taking place. Revenue enforcement officers also target the illicit tobacco trade at the post-importation level at inland locations.</p><p>  The Deputy will appreciate that for reasons of operational sensitivity the Commissioners are not in a position to provide details of enforcement deployment at any given location.  The Deputy will be aware that Revenue&#8217;s overall staff numbers have been reduced over the past two years in the context of Government policy on civil service numbers.  However, the Revenue Commissioners assure me that their enforcement resources have been prioritised and are reinforced as necessary for particular operations.</p><p>  Revenue employs a broadly based strategy in order to intercept illegal tobacco product and to prosecute those involved in the trade.  This involves the optimal deployment of enforcement resources at points of importation and inland through the use of risk analysis and profiling methods and the employment of modern detection technologies.  A key element in this strategy is the development and sharing of intelligence between enforcement agencies at a national, EU and international level.  Revenue enforcement officers target this illicit trade at the post-importation level by carrying out intelligence-based operations and random checks at retail outlets, markets and private and commercial premises, in order to disrupt the internal distribution network for illicit tobacco.  </p><p>  In 2011, a total of 109.08m cigarettes and 11,158 kgs of tobacco, with a retail value of &#8364;49.95m, was seized by Revenue.

The illegal tobacco trade also takes much needed funds from the exchequer, hurts legitimate trade and funds criminal activity.</p></reply>

I launched the public consultation on tax residence rules in May this year, wherein I invited interested parties to make submissions on possible revisions to the current residence rules for the taxation of individuals.</p><p>  This consultation process has now concluded.  A total of eight submissions have been received and these will be published in due course, as indicated when the consultation was announced.  My officials are considering the submissions and will be advising me on possible further changes as part of the preparations for Budget 2013.</p><p>  The Programme for Government indicated that, as part of its fiscal policy, the Government will ensure that &ldquo;tax exiles&rdquo; make a fair contribution to the Exchequer.  In Budget 2012 I abolished the &ldquo;citizenship condition&rdquo; for payment of the Domicile Levy to ensure that individuals could not avoid the levy by renouncing their citizenship.  I also stated that I intend to keep the contentious issue of the tax treatment of &ldquo;tax exiles&rdquo; (which is linked to the tax residence rules) under constant review.  </p><p>  While the application of the rules in particular circumstances is being considered, the taxation of individuals in the State is broadly in line with the system prevailing in most other OECD jurisdictions, that is to say &mdash; </p><p>(a) individuals who are resident in the State for tax purposes are taxable here on their worldwide income; and </p><p>(b) individuals who are not resident for tax purposes pay tax here only on income arising in the State and on income derived from working here.</p><p>  The OECD model tax convention describes a &lsquo;Centre of Vital Interest&rsquo; test as one of the criteria used to resolve the problem of dual residence of individuals.  It refers to the place where the taxpayer's personal and economic relationships are closer.  It is one of the criteria used as a &ldquo;tie breaker&rdquo; in Double Taxation Agreements to determine in which state an individual is resident.  Specific mention was also made in the consultation document to its use as an additional criterion on other jurisdictions.</p><p>  The application of the residence rules and all related matters are under consideration in the run up to Budget 2013.</p></reply>

I have no role in the day-to-day commercial and operational decisions of the banks, which include these matters.  These decisions are taken by the board and management of the institution.  Notwithstanding the fact that the State is a significant shareholder in the institution, I must ensure that the bank is run on a commercial, cost effective and independent basis to ensure the value of the bank as an asset to the State, as per the Memorandum on Economic and Financial Policies agreed with the EU Commission, the ECB and the IMF.  However, the Government is aware of the significant difficulties some homeowners are facing in meeting their mortgage obligations and it is committed to advancing appropriate measures to assist those mortgage holders who are experiencing real and genuine difficulty.  In this regard, the Government is now actively implementing the main recommendations contained in the report of the Inter-Departmental Working Group on Mortgage Arrears. </p><p>  A number of significant milestones have now been achieved: The Personal Insolvency Bill was approved by Government and published last June and the Committee stage of the Bill was passed by the D&aacute;il last month;  the Minister for Housing and Planning has formally launched the &#8220;mortgage to rent&#8221; scheme on a nationwide basis; lenders have now provided details to the Central Bank on their proposed forbearance and loan modification options and some forbearance measures have been introduced on a pilot basis with a further roll out later in the year; also an extensive independent mortgage advice framework has now been put in place by the Minister for Social Protection comprising (i) an enhanced website <i><font color="#0000FF">www.keepingyourhome.ie</font></i> (ii) a Mortgage Arrears information helpline, and (iii) the provision of free independent &#8216;one-to-one&#8217; professional financial advice to borrowers when considering a long term forbearance/resolution offer from their lender.  The list of accountants providing this service is located on the www.keepingyourhome.ie website.</p><p>  The Government remains very committed to progressing these measures, which are in addition to existing supports such as the protections afforded by the Central Bank Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, to assist genuine mortgage holders in difficulty and the Government sub-committee on mortgage arrears, which is chaired by An Taoiseach, continues to meet to ensure this receives priority attention across relevant Departments and agencies.</p></reply>

(see page 3 of NAMA Quarterly Report, 31 March 2012 for additional detail)</p><p>  The Agency advises that net profit on disposal of loans is recorded in its Section 55 Quarterly Accounts and in its year-end consolidated income statement.  The cumulative amount to 31 March 2012 is &#8364;89.7m. These documents are available on the Agency&#8217;s website, www.nama.ie.  The Section 55 Quarterly Accounts for the three months ending 30th June 2012 are currently being considered by Government and will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas in due course. </p><p>  The Agency advises that in the case of a loan sale, it disposes of the entire par debt and that therefore the matter of debt compromise does not arise.  For the debtor, the only change is that there is a new loan note holder.<b></b>  NAMA operates a phased an orderly programme of disposal of both assets and loans to achieve the best possible outcome for the taxpayer. </p><p>  The Agency advises further that it has launched an active loan sales process, having recently established two sales advisory panels one for Europe and one for the US.  NAMA&#8217;s objective in any loans sales transaction is to achieve the best outcome for the taxpayer. In this context, the disclosure of the additional information sought by the Deputy could adversely affect the Agency&#8217;s competitive position.  Providing such information would be commercially counterproductive for the taxpayer as it would be of greatest benefit to potential loan purchasers.  </p></reply>

ARFs are not pension schemes per se. They are investment options into which the proceeds of certain pension arrangements can be invested on retirement. Under the &ldquo;ARF option&rdquo; individuals are entitled to take their retirement lump sum and, with the balance of their pension fund, purchase an annuity, invest in an ARF or take the balance in cash subject to tax.  Where the ARF route is chosen, beneficial ownership of the assets in the ARF vests in the individual.    ARFs are managed by Qualifying Fund Managers and any investment income or capital gains arising are exempt from tax while the funds are invested in the ARF. There is no requirement on Qualifying Fund Managers who hold and manage ARFs on behalf of individuals to provide data to my Department or to the Revenue Commissioners in relation to the value of ARF assets, the numbers of ARFs held by them or, in the context of the question, on the accrued income or gains arising from the investments in such funds. I am not, therefore, in a position to provide the definitive statistical data requested by the Deputy.</p><p>  Electing to invest in an ARF or to receive the balance of a pension fund in cash are subject to conditions. The conditions include the requirements that the individual be over 75 years of age or, if younger, that the individual has a guaranteed level of pension income (&ldquo;specified income&rdquo;) actually in payment for life at the time the option is exercised.  </p><p>  Finance Act 2011 increased the &ldquo;specified income&rdquo; limit from the previous fixed amount of &euro;12,700 introduced in 1999, to a variable amount equal to 1.5 times the maximum annual rate of the State Pension (Contributory) at the time the option is exercised, bringing the &ldquo;specified income&rdquo; limit to &euro;18,000 per annum at present.  This is the only income requirement attaching to the qualifying conditions for an ARF at retirement.</p><p>  I should point out that sums withdrawn from an ARF are subject to tax at the individual ARF-owner&rsquo;s marginal income tax rate. The 2006 Budget and Finance Act introduced an imputed or notional distribution of 3% of the value of the assets in an ARF on 31 December each year, which notional amount is taxed at the ARF owner&rsquo;s marginal income tax rate. This measure was introduced because the internal review of tax relief for pensions provision undertaken by the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners in 2005 found that the ARF option was largely not being used, as intended, to fund an income stream in retirement but, in certain cases, was being used to build up substantial funds in a tax-free environment over the long-term. The imputed distribution measure is designed to encourage the use of ARFs, as intended, in the way of actual draw downs being made which are subject to tax.</p><p>  The annual imputed distribution of ARF assets was increased from 3% to 5% in Budget and Finance Act 2011 in respect of asset values as at 31 December 2010 and future years. It was further increased from 5% to 6% for ARFs with asset values in excess of &euro;2 million at 31 December 2012 and future years. I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that there was a yield of about &euro;11 million from the taxation of the annual imputed distribution of ARF assets for 2011.</p></reply>

The arms-length standard has been<i></i>promulgated by the OECD and is already incorporated in Ireland&#8217;s double taxation treaties.  The transfer pricing provisions are set out in Part 35A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 and require, inter alia, that companies have records available to enable an assessment of whether the transfer prices being used have been set in accordance with the statutory requirements.  The need to set transfer prices is an everyday reality for the companies concerned, given that the majority of cross-border transactions occur <i>within</i> multinational groups, rather than between multinational groups.  The recent provisions have clarified the requirements under Irish law in relation to this normal aspect of a multinational group&#8217;s business, bringing a renewed focus among the companies concerned to ensuring that pricing conforms to the <i>arm&#8217;s-length standard</i>   and that the required records are available. While compliance with the provisions will be monitored and consequent adjustments to income and tax payable may arise, the purpose of the Finance Act 2010 provisions is to provide a clear statutory statement of the requirements in this area. </p><p>  With regards to increased taxation following the introduced of these rules, it is too early to say if this has been the case.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the transfer pricing rules introduced in the Finance Act 2010 apply for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2011. Accordingly, the first annual corporation tax returns affected are for the year ended December 2011 and were due for filing in September 2012.  The Deputy should be advised that compliance with the provisions will be monitored.  As with any other rules in relation to the computation of income for tax purposes, should any adjustments to income, resulting in additional tax, prove necessary, these will be made.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-10-16a.354.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012101600058#WRF01800"><p>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the full year yield, estimated by reference to 2012 incomes, that would result from increasing the average effective tax rate of the top 5 % of income earners from the existing average rate of 36% to 50%, would be of the order of &euro; 2.9 billion.     The corresponding full year yield from increasing the average effective tax rate of the top 10% of income earners (which clearly includes the top 5% of income earners referred to above) from the existing average rate of 33% to 40%, would be of the order of &euro; 1.9 billion.</p><p>  The Deputy should note that to increase the effective tax rate to 50% and 40% for the top 5% and 10% of income earners respectively would mean having to increase the top marginal rates of tax significantly and would also involve restricting access to the basic tax credits and tax bands as well as all tax reliefs in addition to the restrictions that are already in place for certain categories of higher income earners.  The top marginal rates of tax are currently 52% and 55% for PAYE workers and self-employed respectively.  While it is not possible to be precise the top marginal rates of tax would increase to in excess of 70%.  </p><p>  The marginal tax rate is described as the tax rate that applies to the last euro of the tax base.  Marginal tax rates are important because they influence individual decisions to work more or indeed to work at all.  The OECD working paper Tax and Economic Growth indicates that &ldquo;there is also the possibility that high top marginal rates will increase the average tax rates paid by high-skilled and high-income earners so much that they will migrate to countries with lower rates resulting in a brain drain which may lower innovative activity and productivity&rdquo;  . Higher marginal tax rates for earners may also incentivise a greater level of tax evasion and contribute to the development of a shadow economy.</p><p>  The Deputy may wish to note that the top 5% of income earners earn 24% of the total gross income and already pay 43% of the total income tax and 39% of the total income tax, USC and PRSI. While the top 10% of income earners earn 35% of the total gross income and pay 59% of the total income tax and 53% of the total income tax, USC and PRSI.   </p><p>  The yield figures are estimates from the Revenue tax-forecasting model using actual data for the year 2009 adjusted as necessary for income and employment trends in the interim. These are, therefore, provisional and likely to be revised. In addition, it should be noted that Gross Income is as defined in Revenue Statistical Report 2010.</p></reply>

would draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to the  Revenue Commissioners&rsquo; obligation to observe confidentiality in relation to the taxation affairs of individual taxpayers and small groups of taxpayers.  Accordingly, they are not in a position to provide a breakdown in relation to incomes exceeding &euro;10 million as requested, due to the relatively small numbers of companies with incomes in excess of that level.</p><p>Regarding the tax rates, all companies operating in Ireland are chargeable to corporation tax at the 12.5% rate on their trading profits.  A higher 25% rate applies in respect of investment, rental and other non-trading profits. This rate also applies in respect of certain petroleum, mining or land dealing activities.  Companies&rsquo; capital gains are effectively chargeable at the capital gains tax rate and the rate was increased; from 20 per cent to 22 per cent for disposals on or after 15 October 2008; to 25% for disposals on or after 8 April 2009 and; to 30 per cent for disposals on or after 7 December 2011.</p><p>With regard to the effective tax rate, the Deputy has been advised in my previous replies to his questions on this subject that there are different ways of measuring the effective rate of corporation tax depending on the variables that are used.  As there is no single internationally agreed comparative measure in place, I am not in a position to provide such a measure.</p><p>That said, when responding to questions in the House last year, I did mention that one estimate of the effective rate of corporation tax in Ireland is 11.9%.  This figure came from a 2011 <i>Paying Taxes</i> study produced by the World Bank and PriceWaterhouseCoopers as part of an annual <i>Doing Business</i>   report and includes a measurement of effective tax rates across 183 countries. This effective tax rate was calculated based on the tax obligations of a standardised company operating in each country of the study and using standard assumptions regarding exemptions, deductions and allowances.</p><p>Another recent study by the European Commission &ndash; <i>Taxation Trends in the EU 2011</i>   - also indicates that Ireland has an effective corporate tax rate which is close to, or indeed higher than, the statutory 12.5% rate (the rate identified is, in fact, higher than 12.5% perhaps because of the higher 25% tax rate that applies, generally, to non-trading profits).</p><p>The above calculations are to give the Deputy examples of the differences that exist in comparative studies on effective tax rates, depending on how the rate is calculated or who carries out the calculation.  However, the fact that these effective tax rates are close to our headline rate is reflective of the strong transparency around Ireland&rsquo;s 12.5% corporation tax regime.</p></reply>

The entitlement to recovery is based on the trader having a valid VAT Invoice for the business input.  The entitlement is not dependent on whether the trader has paid the amount shown on the invoice.  Changing the entitlement along the lines suggested by the Deputy to make it dependent on proof of payment would result in a cash-flow advantage to the Exchequer and cash-flow disadvantage to traders.</p></reply>

I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they are very mindful of the unfair competitive advantage to be gained by those businesses that do not fulfil their tax obligations. Revenue&rsquo;s tax and duty compliance programmes are under constant review to ensure that they are focussed on the areas of greatest risk, including risks from the shadow/hidden economy.  I am advised that Revenue tackles the problem of tax and duty evasion through their range of compliance and audit interventions including through targeted special projects. Case interventions are undertaken based on Revenue&rsquo;s assessment of compliance risks, the level of those risks and other relevant information available. In 2011 Revenue carried out over 11,000 audits of businesses and individuals as well as over 546,000 other compliance checks. These resulted in additional yield for the Exchequer of almost &euro;483m.</p><p>  Revenue uses a wide range of methodologies to identify those who under-declare their income and/or are operating in the shadow/hidden economy, and deploys the full range of compliance interventions to tackle those risks. Activities undertaken can include covert surveillance, cold calls to businesses and venues as well as pre arranged aspect queries on specific items. There is a strong focus on cash businesses, given its potential high-risk nature, and I am informed that in the first eight months of 2012 audits specifically targeted at these businesses have yielded over &euro;12m.</p><p>  I am further advised by the Commissioners that, regarding the retail and wholesale motor vehicle parts and accessories sector, 17 Audits have been carried out so far in 2012, yielding &euro;331,165. In 2011, 37 audits were carried out in this sector, yielding &euro;483,070. These statistics are compiled from Revenue&rsquo;s records and I am informed that for the purpose of their records, the motor vehicle parts and accessories sector includes the tyre distributor industry.</p><p>  Revenue holds meetings with trade and representative bodies nationally and locally through the Hidden Economy Monitoring Group where the risks posed by shadow/hidden economy activities are discussed.  Furthermore, Revenue encourages anyone who has specific information regarding any business that is engaged in tax evasion, to submit the details to their local Revenue office.</p></reply>

The estimated savings indicated at the time in respect the Budget and Finance Act 2011 change in the SFT were quite conservative, based as they were, on incomplete data and using very broad assumptions.

Lump sum amounts up to &euro;200,000 are paid free of tax. They are also paid free of USC. The portion of a lump sum between &euro;200,001 and &euro;575,000 is taxed on a ring-fenced basis at 20%. This means that no tax credits or other tax reliefs can be set against this portion of the lump sum. No USC is chargeable. Any amount of a lump sum in excess of &euro;575,000 is taxed at the individual&rsquo;s marginal rate of tax (credits and other tax reliefs are available). In this instance, USC is chargeable on the excess. These amounts are lifetime amounts with prior lump sums aggregating with later lump sums.

As there is no general requirement for data on the number of persons who are receiving payments of retirement lump sums of less than &euro;200,000 to be returned to my Department or to the Revenue Commissioners, I am not in a position to provide definitive figures on the Exchequer impact of reducing the tax-free retirement lump sum amount from &euro;200,000 to &euro;100,000.</p><p>  As an exercise that might provide some indication of the scale of the savings involved, it is estimated that just over 33,000 individuals in the public service would be on salaries of over &euro;67,000 and less than &euro;133,500 which, under existing pension scheme arrangements generally applying across the public service, would deliver retirement lump sums of between &euro;100,000 and &euro;200,000 to persons retiring after a full 40 year career. If it is assumed that these individuals would retire in line with retirement trends from the public service in a normal year (about 2.5%), then the additional tax yield from taxing lump sums in excess of &euro;100,000 at 20% could be about &euro;8 million in a full year.</p><p>  I have no data on which to provide a similar estimate in relation to the private sector. I should point out, however, that one significant difference between public sector and private sector pension schemes is that private sector schemes invariably allow scheme members the option of commuting part of their pension fund for a tax-free lump sum. The option of receiving benefits in the form of pension only is not available to members of public sector schemes. Depending on the impact of any tax charge on retirement lump sums, the option to commute part of a pension fund may no longer be exercised by private sector pension scheme members or may be exercised in a manner that reduces the value of the lump sum taken to minimise or avoid any immediate tax charge.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-10-16a.399.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012101600059#WRG00300"><p>An annual imputed distribution rate of 5% applies to approved retirement funds (ARFs) with asset values of &euro;2 million or less and, from this tax year, to &lsquo;vested&rsquo; Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs where benefits have commenced) on the same basis. A higher imputed distribution rate of 6% applies from this tax year to ARFs and/or &lsquo;vested&rsquo; PRSAs with asset values of more than &euro;2 million. I assume the Deputy is suggesting an increase in the imputed distribution from 6% to 7% for ARFs and/or &lsquo;vested&rsquo; PRSAs of more than &euro;2 million in value and an increase from 5% to 7% where the asset values are greater than &euro;1 million and less than &euro;2 million.   I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that information provided to them in the context of the tax paid on these deemed or imputed distributions does not include information on the value of the ARFs out of which the distributions are deemed to arise. There is therefore no basis on which a definitive estimate of the impact on the Exchequer of the change mentioned in the question could be compiled. </p><p>  As an exercise that might provide some indication of the scale of the additional tax yield involved, data made available to my Department from private sector sources provides a breakdown of ARFs by value in respect of a number of providers representing an estimated 40% of the ARF market. There is no similar data available in relation to &lsquo;vested&rsquo; PRSAs.</p><p>  Out of a total value of some &euro;2.4 billion in ARFs under management by these providers where the average ARF value was just over &euro;127,000, the total value of those ARFs representing individual funds of over &euro;1m and under &euro;2 million was &euro;274 million. The total value of those ARFs representing individual funds of over &euro;2m was &euro;137 million. Based on a very rough extrapolation of these figures to arrive at a broad potential estimate for the total value of ARFs with assets in excess of &euro;1 million, the estimated additional tax yield from applying increased imputed distribution rates to such ARFs as set out above would be about &euro;6.5 million in a full year. </p><p>  It is important to note that the deemed or imputed distribution measure is designed to encourage draw downs from ARFs and &lsquo;vested&rsquo; PRSAs so that they are used, as intended, to fund a stream of income in retirement in the same way as a retirement annuity, for which ARFs are supposed to operate as a more flexible alternative. The measure, in itself, does not give rise to significant tax revenues as it does not apply to actual draw-downs from ARFs and &lsquo;vested&rsquo; PRSAs, which are taxed in the normal way. Moreover, increasing the annual percentage notional distribution for ARFs and &lsquo;vested&rsquo; PRSAs as suggested in the question would further increase the risk that the retirement income derived by the owners from such funds could be depleted before death.</p></reply>

This working group had a series of meetings to discuss issues of concern to the haulage industry including the matter of an essential users rebate. I have recently received a submission from the group and I am considering the matters raised. </p><p>  On the matters of green diesel and fuel laundering, I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they are very conscious of the threat posed by the illicit trade in mineral oil products, and in particular by the laundering of markers from diesel. They have, therefore, made action against this criminal activity one of their priorities.</p><p>  Enforcement action is taken at all stages of the fuel supply chain, targeting both those involved in laundering and those who sell laundered fuel, and notable successes have been achieved. Between 2010 and the present, 18 oil laundries and 583,000 litres of oil have been seized, along with oil tankers and other vehicles. In addition, some 1.3 million litres of illicit fuel have been seized, the large majority from retail outlets or in the course of delivery to such outlets. As well as this, the licensing regime for the sale of road fuels has been tightened up to make it more difficult for launderers to get their product onto the market. Revenue has undertaken a vigorous campaign to close unlicensed outlets and outlets that are not complying with licensing requirements. 32 filling stations were shut down in 2011 either because they didn&rsquo;t have a licence or were in breach of licence conditions, and a further 24 have been closed to date this year.</p><p>  I wish to inform the Deputy also that legislative action has been taken that will provide improved underpinning and support for action to control and supervise the fuel supply chain and in that way restrict the ability of launderers to source marked fuel for laundering and also restrict their ability to get their illegal product onto the market. As well as a strengthening of the licensing requirements for the sale of auto-fuel, a new system of licensing for the sale of marked fuels came into operation on 1 October. Revenue has power to refuse a licence where the applicant does not show to their satisfaction that any condition they may attach to the licence can be satisfied, and to revoke a licence if the holder fails to comply with any of its terms.</p><p>  There will also, from the start of 2013, be a new requirement for all fuel traders to make monthly returns to Revenue detailing their fuel transactions. This will be an important new source of information on the fuel supply chain and will, for example, assist in the identification of unusual or suspicious patterns of activity.</p><p>  In addition, the Revenue Commissioners are working closely with Her Majesty&rsquo;s Revenue and Customs in the UK on the development of a more effective fuel marker. An Invitation to Make Submissions was issued jointly by the two organizations in June. This has generated considerable interest across a number of countries and I am advised that the indications are that a significant number of proposals will be submitted by the closing date of 30 November.</p></reply>

Revenue&rsquo;s tax and duty compliance programmes are under constant review to ensure that they are focussed on the areas of greatest risk, including risks from the shadow/hidden economy.  There is a strong focus on cash businesses, given its potential high-risk nature, and I am informed that in the first eight months of 2012 audits specifically targeted at these businesses have yielded over &euro;12m.   In this regard, I am advised by the Commissioners that regarding the retail and wholesale motor vehicle parts and accessories sector, 17 Audits have been carried out so far in 2012, yielding &euro;331,165. In 2011, 37 audits were carried out in this sector, yielding &euro;483,070. These statistics are compiled from Revenue&rsquo;s records and I am informed that for the purpose of their records, the motor vehicle parts and accessories sector includes the tyre distributor industry.</p><p>  Revenue holds meetings with trade and representative bodies nationally and locally through the Hidden Economy Monitoring Group where the risks posed by shadow/hidden economy activities are discussed.  Furthermore, Revenue encourages anyone who has specific information regarding any business that is engaged in tax evasion, to submit the details to their local Revenue office. </p><p>  With regard to the operation of cash sales, the Deputy should be aware that a trader supplying goods is not required to register for VAT unless their annual turnover exceeds &euro;75,000.</p></reply>

One is a provision for a retirement relief to incentivise timely business and farming asset transfers and the other is a relief from capital gains tax on the disposal of certain property, where that property is bought during the &quot;incentive period&quot; from 7 December 2011 to 31 December 2013 and is held for seven years.  As yet, no information is available on the number of people who have availed of retirement relief as restructured in the 2012 budget because they will be applied for via personal income tax returns for 2012 which will not be submitted until late in 2013.  It is not anticipated that these returns will include a provision for the separate capture of specific information in relation to these incentives.  The claims in question are expected to be merged and allowed with other allowable claims to the extent that they are unlikely to be separately identifiable.  As regards the number of people who have availed of the capital gains tax incentive for property purchased before the end of 2013 and introduced in Budget 2012, the relief cannot be claimed until a property bought in the incentive period is owned for at least seven years.  This means the earliest full tax year that this relief can be claimed is 2019 and these returns are not due to be filed until late 2020.</p></reply>

These recommendations were agreed by all members of the Commission, including credit union stakeholders.  The report states that the level of additional services that may be provided by credit unions will depend on the business model of the credit union within the new tiered regulatory approach.  It will be up to each credit union to decide its own model.  Section 48 of the Credit Union Act 1997 governs the provision of additional services by credit unions and allows decisions to provide additional services to be made by members at a general meeting.  As recommended by the Commission, the Credit Union Bill 2012 amends the 1997 Act provisions by allowing decisions to provide additional services to be made either by members at a general meeting, or by the board of directors.  Once this decision has been made, the credit union must obtain approval from the Central Bank to provide this service, unless that service has been exempted from requiring such approval by regulations previously made by the Minister or, under new proposals, by the Central Bank.  A credit union must ensure that it has appropriate systems and controls in place when providing additional services.</p></reply>

In such circumstances, I do not have details of the number of people or firms which provide such services.  Debt collection services apply across a significantly wider range of activities than the recovery of money for financial products, for example for utilities, rents, other consumer debts and also debts between businesses.  The Minister for Justice and Equality is responsible for legislation - the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997 - which applies to all debt collectors that operate across any or all sectors of the economy, including private individuals and debt collecting firms.  Under section 11 of this Act, it is an offence to demand payment of a debt in a way that is designed to cause alarm, distress or humiliation.  A person found guilty of offences under this Act is subject to large fines and up to 14 years imprisonment.  The Deputy might wish to note that in the case of financial institutions which use debt collection firms, the Central Bank has imposed requirements that offer protection to consumers under its revised Consumer Protection Code.  The code obliges the regulated entities it covers to ensure that any outsourced activity, such as debt collection, complies with the requirements of the code.  This means that outsourced activity should uphold principles in the code such as the requirement for institutions not to exert undue pressure or undue influence on a customer, to act honestly, fairly and professionally in the best interests of customers, to act with due skill, care and diligence in the best interest of its customers and to prohibit personal visits or oral communications except in specified circumstances.  Similarly, there are provisions in the Central Bank's Consumer Protection Code for Licensed Moneylenders which provide protections to consumers in relation to the debt collection activities of licensed moneylenders, including where they outsource this function to a third party.  In view of the responsibility of the Minister for Justice and Equality in relation to the Non-Fatal Offences against the Persons Act 1997, the Deputy may wish to seek further clarification on the matter from him.</p></reply>

The Government has imposed SME lending targets on the two domestic pillar banks for the three calendar years between 2011 and 2013. Both banks were required to sanction lending, including lending for working capital purposes, of at least &#8364;3 billion in 2011, &#8364;3.5 billion this year and &#8364;4 billion in 2013 for new or increased credit facilities to SMEs. Both banks achieved their 2011 targets.  In terms of the pillar banks, the precise information reported to my Department and the Credit Review Office is commercially sensitive.  As such, there is limited specific detail that can be divulged on the tracking of the banks&#8217; performances. However, the Deputy may wish to note that the independent Credit Review Office, as part of its remit, monitors the banks&#8217; progress in relation to the targets and reports on a quarterly basis.  Mr. Trethowan&#8217;s ninth quarterly report was published on 8 October last, and is available at <i>www.creditreview.ie/docs/NinthQuarterlyReport%20fromJohnTrethowan.pdf</i>.  Mr. Trethowan states in the report that &#8220;&#8364;3.5bn of sanctions for each bank is a very challenging target, however the remaining five months typically show more lending activity and I am of the view that, after a slow start to the year, the targets will be a challenge but still may be achieved&quot;.  Data provided by the Central Bank indicates that the drawdown of new lending by non-financial SMEs from credit institutions in Ireland was &#8364;1.2 billion in the first six months of 2012.  Figures for the equivalent period in 2011 show drawdowns of &#8364;1.6 billion.  Excluding SMEs in the property related sectors these figures show drawdowns of new lending of &#8364;866 million in the first six months of 2012.  Figures for the equivalent period in 2011 show drawdowns of &#8364;1.1 billion.  For the Deputy&#8217;s information, the relevant statistics for credit made available to small business are accessible at <i>www.centralbank.ie/polstats/stats/cmab/Documents/ie</i>.  (Table A.14.1 - Credit Advanced to Irish-Resident Small and Medium Sized Enterprises).  The Deputy should note that the lending figures provided by the pillar banks to my Department and those provided by all banks to the Central Bank have different objectives and measure different aspects of lending.  These differences are outlined in Mr. Trethowan&#8217;s ninth quarterly report.</p></reply>

The Government recognises the important role of Credit Unions as a volunteer co-operative movement and the distinction between them and other types of financial institutions.  The Commission on Credit Unions was established to review the future of the credit union movement and make recommendations in relation to the most effective regulatory structure for Credit Unions, taking into account their not-for-profit mandate, their volunteer ethos and community focus, while paying due regard to the need to fully protect depositors savings and financial stability.  The Commission published its Report in April 2012.  The Report of the Commission was agreed by all members including the Irish League of Credit Unions.  If we are to build confidence in credit unions, it is important that all those who wrote and agreed the Commission report continue to stand behind it.  The Credit Union Bill 2012 reflects the recommendations made by the Commission on Credit Unions and provides legislative basis for over 60 of those recommendations.  The Government has already shown its commitment to the sector.  A figure of &euro;500 million has been put aside for the restructuring and stabilisation of credit unions at a time when the Government faces difficult budgetary choices and competing needs for scarce resources.  There is an onus on the credit union movement to embrace the necessary changes to ensure this commitment on behalf of the taxpayer delivers a viable sector into the future.  The Government&rsquo;s commitment to implementing the Commission Report is backed by solid early delivery of major elements of it - the publication of the Credit Union Bill 2012, the commencement of fitness and probity and contributions under the Deposit Guarantee Scheme and the appointment of the Credit Union Restructuring Board and early commencement of its work.</p></reply>

My Department is a shared services provider and acts as agent for a number of other Government Departments/Offices in the making of payroll, pensions and general payments.  Bank charges are one of the factors in decisions on the selection of new bank accounts following tendering processes.  In many cases, interest charges do not arise for the Office of the Revenue Commissioners.  Over 99% of payments issued by my Department are in electronic form.  In the case of the Revenue Commissioners, 98% of payments are electronic and the figure is 100% for the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p><p><table><tr><th><b>Department/Agency</b></th><th><b>Financial institution</b></th><th><b>Purpose of account</b></th><th><b>Fees 2011</b></th><th><b>Fees 2012 (est.)</b></th></tr><tr><td>Department of Finance</td><td>Danske Bank (NIB)</td><td>Public bank account for payment of invoices to suppliers and expenses to staff </td><td>&#8364;429.30</td><td>&#8364;374.00</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>B.O.I.</td><td>Public bank accounts for the payment of salaries to staff members</td><td>&#8364;2,045.39</td><td>&#8364;2,600.00</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Central Bank</td><td>The PMG Supply Account is the Account through which Government voted expenditure is transacted</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Central Bank</td><td>The Exchequer Account is an Account for all payments and receipts of Government unless otherwise provided by law</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Revenue Commissioners</td><td>A.I.B.</td><td>a/c for receipt of EFT payments</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>A.I.B.</td><td>Daily lodgements.</td><td>&#8364;145,807.25 </td><td>&#8364;90,250.10 </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>A.I.B.</td><td>Receipt of EFT payments &amp;

However, there are two significant sets of proceedings which predate the findings of the tribunal but which are concerned with the matters canvassed by that tribunal and the conclusions reached by that tribunal.  The cases in question are (i) Comcast International Holdings Incorporated, Declan Ganley, Ganley International Limited and GCI Limited <i>v</i>. The Minister for Public Enterprise, Michael Lowry, ESAT Telecommunications Limited, Denis O'Brien, Ireland and The Attorney General, and (ii) Persona Digital Telephony Limited and Sigma Wireless Networks Limited <i>v</i>. The Minister for Public Enterprise, Ireland and the Attorney General.  Both of these cases allege wrongdoing in respect of the awarding of the second GSM Licence award, which was the subject matter of second module of Moriarty Tribunal report delivered March 2011.  As the Deputy will appreciate, because both of these cases are <i>sub judice</i>, it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on them.</p></reply>

The requirement for Carpentry and Joinery provision has been particularly affected, having fallen from a high of 168 blocks nationally in 2008 to an expected national requirement for 17 blocks in 2012/13. </p></reply>

In last year's Budget, all 195 second-level school in DEIS were given targeted support by a more favourable staffing schedule of 18.25:1. This is a 0.75 point reduction compared to the existing PTR of 19:1 that applies in non fee-paying second-level schools.

There are one thousand one hundred and eighty nine primary teachers, eighty three special needs assistants and three hundred and four teachers in secondary and community/comprehensive schools currently on career break.  The period of absence on career break is a period of unpaid leave for the person availing of it.  The teachers and special needs assistants employed as replacements are generally paid on a lower point of the incremental scale and accordingly there are no additional costs associated with the operation of this scheme.  The operation of the scheme does not impact on overall numbers employed.</p><p>  Circular 10/2011, which was issued in February 2011, introduced a revised Career Break scheme for registered teachers in recognised primary and post primary schools.

In keeping with this commitment, the <i>Comprehensive Expenditure Report 2012-2014</i>   introduced a range of budgetary reforms including a Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF), published in December last year.  The key features of the MTEF include multi-year aggregate expenditure ceilings along with Ministerial expenditure ceilings.  The multi-annual dimension to the ceilings encourages a more focused approach to medium-term structural and strategic planning of expenditure within departments.</p><p>  As a further incentive to encourage prudent and responsible management of expenditures within the allocated Ministerial ceilings, the MTEF includes a provision for Departments to carryover some portion of any unspent current expenditure allocation from one year to increase the expenditure ceiling for the next year.  This feature will operate in a similar manner to the capital carryover facility which was introduced in 2004 as part of the multi-annual capital investment framework and has been operating successfully since its inception.</p><p>  Initial expenditure ceilings were set out in the <i>Comprehensive Expenditure Report 2012-2014</i> and currently form the basis of the Estimates 2013 discussions.  The <i>Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Bill 2012</i> aims to put these reforms on a permanent statutory basis by replacing the corresponding section of the <i>Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act 2011.</i>  This is also in keeping with EU/IMF Programme commitments to introduce fixed expenditure ceilings into law.  This important innovation in Irish policy-making will put Ireland&#8217;s resource allocation and planning in line with best international practice and I look forward to discussing and debating the provisions of the Bill before the Oireachtas in the coming weeks.  The full operational details of the MTEF, including the arrangements for current carryover, will be set out in a Circular from my Department, and initial consultations on the form of the draft Circular are already under way at official level.</p></reply>

Payments are made in respect of members of the party elected to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and members elected/nominated to Seanad &Eacute;ireann at the last preceding general election or a subsequent bye-election or, in the case of Seanad &Eacute;ireann, nominated to it after the last preceding general election.  The conditions governing entitlement to payment of the allowance are set out in the Act.  The primary restriction in the Act on the use of the allowance is that it may not be used in respect of election expenses.</p><p>Under the legislation, the amounts paid to the parliamentary leader of a qualifying party are calculated on the following basis:</p><p><table><tr><th>TDs</th><th>Opposition Parties &#8364;</th><th>Government Parties* &#8364;</th></tr><tr><td>First 10 members</td><td>71,520</td><td>47,680</td></tr><tr><td>11 members to 30</td><td>57,214</td><td>38,143</td></tr><tr><td>More than 30 members </td><td>28,616</td><td>19,077</td></tr></table></p><p><table><tr><th>Senators</th><th>&#8364;</th></tr><tr><td>First 5 members</td><td>46,766</td></tr><tr><td>Over 5 members </td><td>23,383</td></tr></table></p><p>*The legislation provides that, in the case of a qualifying party forming part of the Government, the combined allowances due in respect of TDs of that party are reduced by one third.</p><p>The legislation also provides that payments may be made to a member of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, who at the last preceding general election or at a subsequent bye-election was elected as a member other than as a member of a qualifying party.  Such qualifying Independent TDs are entitled to an annual rate of &euro;41,152. A similar provision in the Act provides for an annual payment of &euro;23,383 for Independent Senators.</p><p>The total amounts of the allowances paid to 25 February 2012 and number of payments made in respect of each party and each Independent TD and Senator is at Appendix I. Payments specified in respect of qualifying members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann are for the period 25 February 2011 to 25 February 2012, with the next payments falling due on the 28 February 2012.  Having regard to members of Seanad &Eacute;ireann, in the case of elected members, the allowance was payable from 26 April 2011; for members nominated by the Taoiseach, the allowance was payable from 20 May 2011.

However, the terms of the three year Special Incentive Career Break Scheme, which commenced during the second half of 2009, are such that they involve additional costs to all Departments.  These costs are more than offset by savings in salaries and employers&rsquo; PRSI.</p><p><b>Special Incentive Career Break Scheme</b></p><p>Since its commencement, 30 staff from my Department availed of the Special Incentive Career Break Scheme. The cost to the Department per year was as follows:</p><p><table><tr><th><div><b>Year</b></div></th><th></th></tr><tr><td><div>2009</div></td><td><div>&#8364;55,775</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2010</div></td><td><div>&#8364;278,134</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2011</div></td><td><div>&#8364;276,671</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2012</div></td><td><div>&#8364;214,450</div></td></tr></table></p><p>Estimated saving in respect of Incentivised Career Breaks are as follows:</p><p><table><tr><th><div><b>Year</b></div></th><th><div><b>Salary</b></div></th><th><b>Estimated saving</b><br /><b>Employer PRSI*</b></th></tr><tr><td><div>2009</div></td><td><div>&#8364;196,168.97</div></td><td><div>&#8364;19,500</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2010</div></td><td><div>&#8364;687,930.21</div></td><td><div>&#8364;73,300</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2011</div></td><td><div>&#8364;640,540.32</div></td><td><div>&#8364;73,300</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2012</div></td><td><div>&#8364;419,799.09</div></td><td><div>&#8364;48,900</div></td></tr></table></p><p>* <i>These figures are notional as no employer contributions were paid for the duration of the scheme and are based on 2009 contribution payments extrapolated forward for 2010, 2011 to end September 2012.</i></p><p>To date, nine staff have applied for an extension of their career break, under normal terms and conditions and at no additional cost, therefore, to the Department.  A further five staff remain on the scheme and have the option to extend their break (again, at no additional cost to the Department).  It is not possible at this point to provide figures in relation to the cost associated with staff resuming duty in 2013 as staff are required to serve a waiting period of up to 12 months before being reinstated, and some or all of the remaining staff may be redeployed to other Departments before their waiting period expires.</p><p>In relation to the agencies under the auspices of my Department, the granting of career breaks is an operational matter for the agencies concerned and I have asked them to respond directly to the Deputy.</p><p>Compilations of statistics on career breaks across the Public Service as a whole and issues relating to reforms which have taken place are a matter for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform which has central responsibility for the Career Break Scheme.</p></reply>

Ensuring that more micro and small businesses can start up, expand and export is a key pillar of our plans for jobs and growth. That is why the Government has decided to implement an ambitious reform in the delivery of service to small and micro business. This will include: The development of a new Small and Micro Business Division within Enterprise Ireland (EI) as a centre of excellence in the provision of supports to the small and micro enterprise sectors;The dissolution of the County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs), of which Meath CEB is one, and the transfer of their functions, assets and liabilities to Enterprise Ireland (EI), and;The establishment of Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) to provide a high quality, innovative, &ldquo;one-stop-shop&rdquo; support service for small businesses within Local Authorities, and providing early access to the services of national bodies; Integration of key local authority business services into the Local Enterprise Office and promotion of a local environment in which enterprise can thrive.</p><p>  Not only is it important that this restructuring is conducted as a priority, we must ensure that the new model is fit for purpose. A high level Implementation Working Group (IWG) Chaired by my Department is currently progressing the range of issues involved, including a focus on functions, structures and staffing, all of which will form the basis of a detailed and ambitious Service Level Agreement between Enterprise Ireland and the Local Authorities. A project plan is also in preparation which will set out clear milestones and timelines for implementation. In tandem with the work of the IWG my Department is engaged with the Office of the Attorney General regarding the detailed primary legislation that will be necessary to implement the new arrangements.</p><p>  It should be noted that it is business as usual for CEB clients, with no disruption or diminution of services. It is my intention to complete the transition process as rapidly as practicable, and I aim to give administrative effect to the new structures as soon as possible, in advance of the formal enactment of legislation.  </p><p>  I will shortly announce details with Enterprise Ireland of the new small and micro business division. Before Christmas, I expect to set out details of the legislative path to underpin these reforms which I hope can be completed in Quarter 2 of 2013 and by the end of the year I intend announcing details of the Service Level Agreement between Enterprise Ireland and the local authorities that will cover a full range of services and targets to be delivered by the LEOs. </p></reply>

However, in general, conditions of employment in excess of statutory entitlements are determined by negotiation and agreement between employers and employees or a trade union acting on their behalf.</p><p>  There are already in place a range of statutory entitlements aimed at supporting the goals of making workplaces more family friendly. Legislative measures which provide for statutory entitlements include maternity leave, adoptive leave, carer&rsquo;s leave and parental leave, along with all the other employment rights legislation. </p><p>  There is no statutory entitlement to a career break. Rather, an employee is entitled to avail of such leave where a provision exists in the employee&rsquo;s terms and conditions of employment that provides for career breaks.</p><p>  In this regard, it is a matter for individual enterprises to establish policies that reflect the reality of the workplace and meet the many diverse needs of employees.  This is best achieved through consultation and discussion with the aim of achieving tailor made solutions to the benefit of the workforce and the employer.</p><p>  Accordingly, I have no plans to introduce legislation to provide for a statutory right to a career break for workers.</p></reply>

Kildare, to serve its global and regional customers in the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) Region, was taken by the Kerry Group.  </p><p>  I understand from Enterprise Ireland that the agency during its meetings with the Kerry Group on the potential location of the Global Technology and Innovation Centre, while primarily focussed on winning the project for Ireland, discussed various regional options within Ireland.  </p><p>  It became quickly evident that the Group&#8217;s location decision would be largely driven by the need for maximum efficiency in terms of customer accessibility.  Proximity to an international airport was therefore a key determining criterion.  This Global Centre will function as a hub for the Group&#8217;s clients who will be moving in and out of Ireland on an intensive basis as research and innovation projects get underway.  </p><p>  The achievement of balanced regional growth continues to be a core objective of Government. Enterprise Ireland (EI) activity in Co. Kerry is focussed on the creation of new jobs through supporting entrepreneurs to set up new High Potential Start-Up companies; on the retention and creation of new jobs in existing companies through the support of company development plans; and enhancing the innovation capability of Ireland through support of research in companies and third level institutions.  </p><p>  EI actively engages with its client companies and has a number of supports and initiatives in place to assist companies.  There are 124 EI client companies in Co. Kerry employing more than 3,000 people in full-time jobs.  In 2011, EI paid almost &#8364;2.6m in financial support to client companies in Co. Kerry.  EI has also approved funding towards the development of Community Enterprise Centres in Co. Kerry.</p><p>  New Frontiers, Ireland&#8217;s national Entrepreneur Development Programme is delivered at a local level by the Institutes of Technology. The Programme aims to support the creation of high-value knowledge-based Irish owned businesses and is currently underway in the Institute of Technology, Tralee with 9 local companies participating on the Programme. </p><p>The Kerry County Enterprise Board has primary responsibility for the delivery of State support to the indigenous micro-enterprise sector i.e. businesses which employ 10 or less workers. <b></b>  They play a central role through the provision of financial and non-financial support in assisting many micro-enterprises in developing their growth potential and, in developing into strong export entities where they have sufficient mass to access the services of Enterprise Ireland. </p><p>  IDA Ireland&#8217;s strategy for County Kerry is to work with Local Authorities and relevant infrastructure and service providers to: influence the delivery of appropriate infrastructure to the region; attract new Investment; progress the development of a knowledge economy so that the region can compete both nationally and internationally for foreign direct investment (FDI); work with the existing IDA client-base and help them to further develop their presence; and, provide modern property solutions with supporting infrastructure.  Through its network of overseas offices, IDA Ireland markets the linked hub locations of Killarney in South Kerry and Tralee in North Kerry for new FDI. IDA is particularly targeting the ICT, International Financial Services and Globally Traded Business sectors.  </p><p>  While the IDA seeks to influence the location, it must be remembered that in all cases, it is the investor who decides where to locate.</p></reply>

The estimated expenditure on child benefit for 2012 is around &euro;2 billion in respect of some 1.15 million children. </p><p>  The Government is conscious that child benefit, as a universal payment, can be an important source of income for all families, especially during a time of recession and high unemployment. The social protection system also provides assistance to low income families with children through the payment of qualified child increases on primary social welfare payments and through the family income supplement payment. Both of these provide a level of assistance which is directly or indirectly linked with household&rsquo;s income.</p><p>  I am conscious that achieving a better design of the overall system of child income supports, including child benefit, raises complex issues about the effectiveness and efficiency of the full range of income supports currently provided to families and their children. In this context and in line with a commitment in the Programme for Government, I established an Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare last year, which has been tasked with recommending cost-effective solutions as to how employment disincentives can be improved and better poverty outcomes achieved, particularly child poverty outcomes. The Advisory Group prioritised the area of family and child income supports and has completed its work on this area.  I am currently reviewing their report which I will then discuss with my colleagues in Cabinet. </p></reply>

The State pension is a very valuable benefit. Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  Recent changes to State pension supports the direct link between contributions made and the rate of pension received which underpins State pension policy.  By aligning the rate of pension with the contribution made ensures that those who contribute more during a working life, benefit more in retirement.</p><p>  The recently published Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund confirms that benefits offer excellent value for money for those on the lower part of the income distribution, those with shorter contribution histories, and the self-employed.  The social solidarity principle which underlies the Fund is reflected in the fact that, for those at the higher end of the income distribution, the Fund is redistributive and they generally get back less than they pay in.</p><p>  Notwithstanding the changes in the contribution rules and associated rates of payment which were introduced in September 2012, those with lower earnings and those with shorter contribution histories will continue to obtain the best value for money from the Fund.  This is because the negative impact of these changes continues to be outweighed by the lower contributions paid into the Fund in respect of these workers. </p><p>  The report looked at the value for money provided by the Fund on a range of individual scenarios and found that:</p><p>- Those on lower incomes fare considerably better than those on higher incomes. </p><p>- Those with dependants achieve better value for money (when assessing value for money on an individual rather than on a per household basis).</p><p>- Those with short contribution histories have the potential to fare better than those with full contribution histories, which is particularly helpful for women who take time out of the workforce for caring purposes.</p><p>- The Fund provides better value to female than to male contributors.</p><p>- The self-employed achieve very good value for money compared with the employed &ndash; when the comparison includes both employer and employee contributions in respect of the employed person.</p><p>- For those at the higher end of the income distribution, the Fund is redistributive and these individuals generally get back less than they pay in.</p><p>- Higher value for money is achieved where benefits in addition to the State pension (contributory) are accessed.</p><p>  In relation to the homemakers scheme, women who leave the workplace for caring purposes can, if eligible, avail of the homemakers scheme which helps to provide a higher rate of pension for those who meet the qualifying conditions.  It should be noted that women who do not qualify for a pension or are affected by the rate band change may, if their spouse is in receipt of a State pension contributory, receive a qualified adult payment at a higher rate where they satisfy a means test.  A State pension non-contributory pension, which is a means tested payment, may also be payable.  I have no proposals to backdate the homemakers scheme given the policy issues and costs involved. While my Department will keep this scheme under review, any improvements which could result in further costs for the Exchequer could only be considered in a budgetary context.</p><p>  Sustainable public finances are a pre-requisite for future economic stability and growth, as well as being a pre-requisite for maintaining and developing our social protection system. The Government&rsquo;s priority is to secure economic recovery, promote growth and employment.  To this end, the State must pursue a determined deficit reduction strategy.  Accordingly, there will be an on-going requirement to curtail expenditure in 2013 and in later years.  There are, therefore, considerable challenges ahead including the need to protect, as far as possible, the key income supports and services operated by my Department.  These services and supports impact in some way on the lives of almost every single person in the State.  The scope and scale of this expenditure plays a key role in the wider economy and helps to partially offset the effect of the downturn.</p><p>  The Government is committed to tackling Ireland&rsquo;s economic crisis in a way that is fair, balanced, and which recognises the need for social solidarity.  The appropriate level of overall expenditure by my Department, including expenditure on weekly and other payments, will be considered in the context of Budget 2013 and subsequent Budgets.</p></reply>

Currently the average time taken to award a carer&rsquo;s allowance application is 28 weeks.  I acknowledge that the time taken to process carer&rsquo;s allowance claims at present is not satisfactory but I am satisfied that the Department is taking appropriate action to resolve the situation.</p><p>Carer&rsquo;s allowance section has recently completed a major service delivery modernisation project to improve the efficiency with which it processes applications from clients for carer&rsquo;s allowance. The project involved the development of IT functionality and associated business process re-organisation.  Full deployment of the new system for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance was completed in June 2012.  The outcome of the review is the division of work into two streams. One concentrates on dealing with new claim intake and processes these without delay and the other on the backlog which is ring-fenced with a clear and targeted plan for its elimination.  Implementation of the plan commenced on Monday 3 September and is closely monitored and managed to ensure it achieves its objectives.  In September the number of claims decided substantially exceeded claim intake.  However, it will take a number of months before the backlog is reduced to an acceptable level. </p></reply>

Over &euro;2 million has been paid in rent deposits during 2012.  There is no automatic entitlement to this payment and each application is determined by the person administering the SWA scheme based on the particular circumstances of the case taking account of the nature and extent of the need. Such payments are confined to occurrences which are considered to be unexpected, unforeseen or exceptional.  This form of assistance may be payable to those relying on the private rented market to meet their housing needs who are on low incomes and may not be in position to provide for a deposit from within their own resources or those who are at risk of or who are homeless.  Multiple rent deposits are not generally paid to the same person and every effort is made to ensure that only one payment is made.  If the landlord or tenant terminates the tenancy, the tenant can use the returned deposit to secure a new tenancy. </p></reply>

A breakdown by grade is as follows:</p><p><table><tr><th><b>Grade</b></th><th><div><b>Number</b></div></th></tr><tr><td>Assistant Principal</td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td>Higher Executive Officer</td><td><div>10</div></td></tr><tr><td>Executive Officer </td><td><div>12</div></td></tr><tr><td>Staff Officer</td><td><div>5</div></td></tr><tr><td>Clerical Officer</td><td><div>63</div></td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td><div>91</div></td></tr></table></p><p>A total of 54 staff in the Department availed of the special incentivised career break scheme in 2009.  The cost of the incentivised career break scheme for 2011 (i.e. the amount paid to the staff who availed of the scheme) was &euro;570,837.  The resulting savings on the pay bill in 2011 was just under &euro;1.9 million.  A total of 19 of the 54 staff have opted to extend their career breaks beyond the 3 years provided for by the scheme.  No remuneration is provided for staff who extend their career breaks beyond the 3 years provided for in the scheme.</p><p>An estimated cost for the return in 2013 of all of the civil servants who availed of incentivised career breaks is unavailable, as the returning salary in each case would have to be calculated on an individual basis on the officer&rsquo;s return and, as indicated above, some officers have confirmed an extension to their career break on an unpaid basis beyond 2013. Officers that have availed of any form of career break retain the option to extend their career breaks for periods up to 5 years in total.</p><p>The statutory agencies that operate under the aegis of my Department are the Pensions Board and the Citizens Information Board.  In addition, the Office of the Pensions Ombudsman comes under the remit of the Department.  In relation to the Pensions Board there is currently one member of staff, a Higher Executive Officer, on a career break. A temporary Clerical Officer was hired to cover this career break and that this arrangement will cease with effect from 19 October 2012.  In the Citizens Information Board there is currently one staff member, a grade IV, on a career break. There was no temporary cover provided for this career break.  None of the staff in the Office of the Pensions Ombudsman are on career break.  Vacancies arising from staff availing of career breaks are regarded as permanent vacancies, and as such, if the vacancies are approved to be filled, they are filled by the assignment of permanent staff.  These vacancies count towards the reduction in numbers in the Department.  There have been no reforms introduced to the operation of the career break scheme in my Department in the last year.</p></reply>

Of that amount, some &euro;3.6 billion relates to illness benefit and the estimated cost of the scheme in 2012 is &euro;847 million.</p><p>  Against that background, there are a number of compelling reasons why the Government is giving consideration to the introduction of a scheme of statutory sick pay at this time.  Firstly, it is necessary to take steps to address the deficit in the social insurance fund from which illness benefit, amongst other insurance-based benefits and pensions, is paid. In 2011, the deficit in the Fund was some &euro;1.5 billion.   Secondly, such a scheme would help to limit progression from short-term illness to long-term illness or disability.  Thirdly, it would serve to bring Ireland into line with practice in other countries in this area. And, finally, it would contribute towards enhancing the health of the workforce and achieve active management of absenteeism.</p><p>  I am acutely conscious of the pressures facing employers in the current economic climate.

The Quarterly National Household survey indicated that there were 66,000 young unemployed aged 15&#8211;24 in Q2 2012 &#8211; representing thirteen per cent of the youth population. The majority of young people are in education and not in the labour force. With regards to those in the labour force, 34% are unemployed (this is the official unemployment rate).  Of particular concern is the continued increase in the share of youth unemployed who are out of work for more than one year. They now account for 41% of all youth unemployment.</p><p>  In the first instance, the Government&#8217;s primary strategy to tackle youth unemployment is to create the environment for a strong economic recovery by promoting competitiveness and productivity. Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth. Past experience suggests that youth unemployment, which tends to rise relatively rapidly in a downturn, can be expected to fall relatively rapidly during the recovery.  In addition to promoting economic recovery, the Government recognises the need for interim measures to support the young unemployed and keep young jobseekers close to the labour market. There are five main approaches being taken to tackle youth unemployment: education, training, job search assistance/guidance, work experience, and encouraging job creation.  These actions range across a number of Departments and Agencies.</p><p>  In terms of <b>education</b>, the Youthreach programme provides integrated education, training and work experience for unemployed early school leavers without any qualifications or vocational training who are between 15 and 20 years of age.  There are almost 6,000 places available nationwide under the Youthreach umbrella.  The Vocational Training Opportunities Scheme (VTOS) scheme, operated through VECs, provides a range of courses to meet the education and training needs of unemployed people over 21 years of age (particularly early school leavers). The most recent data indicate that there are almost 1,000 participants on VTOS who are under 25 years of age.</p><p>  The Back to Education Allowance scheme run by my Department provides income maintenance, along with a contribution to education costs, for unemployed people returning to further or higher education.  Over 6,500 young people participated in the BTEA in the last academic year.</p><p>  Over 18,000 persons aged  under 25 completed a <b>training</b> course with F&Aacute;S in 2011 (excluding evening courses).  Training allowances on eligible courses exceed what a young person would receive in jobseekers&#8217; payments, providing an incentive to take up training programmes.  The Labour Market Education &amp; Training<b></b>Fund (LMETF) is part of the Government&#8217;s 2012 Action Plan for Jobs initiative.  The Department of Education &amp; Skills has committed &#8364;20m to fund a range of education and training interventions for up to 6,500 individuals who are long term unemployed.<i><font color="#FF0000"> </font></i>There are four themes to the funding, one of which is dedicated to the cohort of under 25s.</p><p>  In terms of <b>job search assistance</b>, some 17,000 young people registered with Employment Services this year up until September 2012, representing 37% of all registrants.  Registering with Employment Services gives job-seekers access to guidance interviews, job search assistance, and training courses, as well as self-service job-seeking options.  Under the National Employment Action Plan (EAP) persons between the ages of 18 and 65 years who are approaching 3 months on the Live Register are identified by the Department of Social Protection and referred to Employment Services for interview with the aim of assisting them to enter/re-enter the labour market.  Last year, there were 35,400 referrals of under 25s to the EAP, affecting approximately 25,000 individual jobseekers (those who do not attend initially are referred again). Of those referred,   62% of clients had signed off the Live Register by the end of the year.<font color="#004080"> </font>For the first eight months of this year, there were 23,700 referrals affecting 18,300 young jobseekers. The EAP process is being changed on a progressive basis across the country to one where referral will take place immediately on becoming unemployed for those identified, through profiling, as being at greatest risk of remaining unemployed for long periods.</p><p>  There are a number of schemes/programmes available that are focussed on <b>work experience.</b>  The most relevant for young people are: JobBridge (the National Internship Scheme), and its predecessor the Work Placement Programme. Over 1,500 young people are currently participating on these schemes. The total number of placements of young people on JobBridge during its first year of operation was 2,600. Young people will also benefit from the reduced rate of employer&#8217;s PRSI, the purpose of which is to support job creation, as well as from the impact of Revenue Job Assist and the Employers PRSI Incentive Scheme.</p><p>  Finally the European Commission is currently reviewing relevant youth policies across the Member States with a view to making proposals for a European-wide approach to a &#8220;youth guarantee&#8221;  that are to be discussed during Ireland's Presidency of the EU Council.  The Commission&#8217;s proposals are expected to be published in December, and achieving political agreement on these proposals in the Council will be a major objective of Ireland&#8217;s Presidency in the first half of 2013.</p></reply>

Our records indicate that a significant proportion of individuals who have completed their JobBridge internship placement have progressed into employment with either their host organisation or another employer. A clearer picture of the progression outcomes of interns will be made available shortly on foot of the Interim Evaluation Report conducted by Indecon.</p><p>  In response to the Deputy&#8217;s other question, I wish to advise a variety of control measures and criteria have been introduced to ensure the integrity of the JobBridge Scheme. These ensure that the internship does not displace an existing position; provides appropriate training and development experience; and that appropriate mentoring and support is provided.  Firstly, the Standard Agreement signed and agreed to by both the Intern and the Host Organisation upon commencement clearly states the terms of the internship; including the specific learning outcomes the intern will gain over the course of their internship.</p><p>  Secondly, to ensure that both the host organisation and intern are abiding by the spirit and the rules of the scheme, the Department of Social Protection are involved in the continuous monitoring of internships.  To-date, 95% of the 380 monitoring visits conducted have been satisfactory. It is important to highlight that remedial action is taken in the cases that are deemed unsatisfactory.  Consequently any individual, who suspects that an internship may be in breach of the scheme&#8217;s criteria, including cases of suspected displacement and quality, may contact the JobBridge team.  All such matters are fully investigated.</p></reply>

Carer&rsquo;s allowance section has recently completed a major service delivery modernisation project to improve the efficiency with which it processes applications from clients for carer&rsquo;s allowance.  The project involved the development of IT functionality and associated business process re-organisation.  Full deployment of the new system for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance was completed in June 2012.</p><p>  Following the completion of the modernisation project, an in-depth business process improvement (BPI) project commenced for the carer&rsquo;s allowance scheme.  This project focused on optimising output and customer service and the reduction of backlogs.  The outcome of the review is the division of work into two streams.  One concentrates on dealing with new claim intake and processes these without delay and the other on the backlog which is ring-fenced with a clear and targeted plan for its elimination.  Implementation of the plan commenced on Monday 3 September and will be closely monitored and managed to ensure it achieves its objectives.  A noted improvement was achieved in September where claims process substantially exceed claim intake.  However, it will take a number of months before the backlog is reduced to an acceptable level.  The allocation of available resources to this task continues to be monitored.</p></reply>

If an employee has earned income from self-employment, PRSI as a self-employed contributor is also payable on the profits from that self-employed activity as well as from any other unearned income the individual may have.  Similarly a self-employed contributor (who is not an employee) pays PRSI on both earned and unearned income.  However if an employee has unearned income only, there is no PRSI charge on the unearned income.  Unearned income includes rental and investment income as well as income from dividends, deposits and savings and from overseas investments. </p><p>  It is difficult to estimate the projected annual yield if PRSI was extended to all sources of unearned income including income from rental property, dividends, other investments and deposit interest for both self-employed and PAYE workers who currently may not be liable to pay PRSI on these streams of income.  Based on 2009 data it is estimated that the additional yield could be in the region of &euro;20m, of which a substantial part refers to rental income.</p><p>  The Revenue Commissioners act as the Department of Social Protection&rsquo;s agent in the collection of PRSI.  Any proposal to deduct at source or withhold PRSI to be charged on streams of income which are currently exempt from PRSI would have to be discussed with the Commissioners to determine the viability of that mechanism of collection.</p><p>  It is not possible to furnish the annual yield from 2007 to 2011 and the projected yield in 2012, in respect of various categories of unearned income including rental income, dividend income and deposit interest income, as this information is not disaggregated from Class S income generally.</p><p>  One of my key goals in the Department is to reform the system of social protection to put it on a sounder financial footing in the future.  One of the matters I am most concerned about is the deficit in the Social Insurance Fund.  It is my intention to widen the PRSI income base to make certain types of unearned income, such as those outlined above, liable to PRSI.  Any proposal to bring additional sources of income within the base on which PRSI is charged would have to be considered taking account of all of the implications, including the potential for providing access to additional social insurance entitlements.</p></reply>

The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer. There are currently approximately 90,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided &euro;436 million for 2012.</p><p>  The community welfare service and the community welfare officers administering supplementary welfare allowance, including rent supplement, formally transferred from the Health Service Executive to the Department with effect from 1 October 2011.  </p><p>  In March 2012, the Government approved in principle to transfer responsibility for the provision of rental assistance to persons with a long term housing need from the Department, currently provided through rent supplement, to housing authorities using a new Housing Assistance Payment (HAP). It is planned that pilot testing of HAP arrangements will commence during the second half of 2013 with general roll out and commencement of transfers from January 2014. </p><p>  A multi-agency steering group has been established to develop proposals to give effect to this transfer.  The group is chaired by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and consists of representatives from the Departments of Social Protection; Public Expenditure and Reform; Office of the Revenue Commissioners; the County and City Managers Association, and the Housing Agency. </p><p>  The new arrangements will achieve a key Government commitment of removing barriers to employment and at the same time returning rent supplement to its original purpose of a short-term income support.</p></reply>

There are currently in excess of 740,000 customers eligible for free travel and when spousal and companion passes are taken into account, there are over 1.1 million customers with some free travel eligibility.</p><p>  The cost of the free travel scheme has risen substantially over the last 10 years from almost &euro;46 million for almost 608,000 customers in 2001 to over &euro;75 million for 726,000 customers in 2011.  My Department also provides some funding for the rural transport programme.  In line with the Government decision, expenditure on this scheme has been frozen since 2010. </p><p>  A temporary arrangement was put in place in 2005, whereby participants on the pilot employment programme, now known as the wage subsidy scheme (WSS), were allowed to retain their free travel pass for 3 years.  New participants on the WSS were not given an entitlement to a free travel pass.  In May 2009 this arrangement was reviewed and it was decided that due to the increasing numbers participating on the WSS, and the fact that WSS is not a qualifying payment for free travel, it was not possible to further extend the temporary arrangement. </p><p>  As regards the loss of free travel benefits, I acknowledge that this is difficult for the people concerned.  The measure was always intended to be a temporary measure for a very small group of people.  In receiving the pass over a number of years, however, they have benefitted from free travel which is not available to other groups who could make an equally strong case.</p><p>  To help ensure the future sustainability of the free travel scheme, a review is being carried out by officials from my Department, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the National Transport Authority.

This expenditure represents 39% of Gross Current Government Expenditure and impacts in some way on almost every single person and business in the State, either directly or indirectly.</p><p>  The Comprehensive Expenditure Report published last December, provides for additional new expenditure reduction measures of &euro;1,033 million over the next two years in the Department of Social Protection&rsquo;s budget.  </p><p>  This includes &euro;540 million of new savings to be achieved in budget 2013. Reducing overall expenditure in 2013 and beyond in line with these targets will be very challenging.  No decisions have been made at this stage as to how these targets will be met.  The Government will finalise its consideration of the budget over the forthcoming weeks and the level of expenditure by my Department in 2013 will be announced on Budget Day.</p><p>  Looking ahead to the budget, I will strive to ensure that the burden of resolving the fiscal crisis does not fall disproportionately on those who depend on income supports from my Department.</p></reply>

Those customers who are aware that they are being - or have been - overpaid by the Department should contact their local social welfare office immediately.  An overpayment recovery plan, acceptable both to the customer and to the Department, will then be agreed.  The general approach is that the recovery amount proposed would be the maximum repayment that the debtor can afford in order to recover the overpayment as quickly as possible. </p><p>  Overpayments may be recovered through regular periodic payments, deduction from the customers on-going benefit payments or by way of a single payment covering the full amount owed.  Debt holders should be aware that a Departmental debt will remain on their records until fully recovered.  This will result in a reduction of all future entitlements up to and including State pension and a potential claim on any estate following the death of a customer who owes a debt. </p><p>  A key priority for my Department is to ensure that fraudulent activity within the social welfare system is vigorously prevented and combated.  Social welfare fraud undermines public confidence in the entire system as well as being unfair to other recipients of social welfare payments and taxpayers.  Effective debt recovery is an integral part of the deterrent to fraudulent claiming.</p><p>  The Department is very conscious of its obligation to protect public money and is determined to ensure that abuse of the system is prevented and is dealt with effectively when detected.</p></reply>

Our target is that we must achieve 16% of all energy consumed by 2020 from renewable sources.  We have set out in our National Renewable Energy Action Plan (NREAP) that we will do this through 40% renewable electricity, 10% renewable transport and 12% renewable heat, which together would amount to 16% of all energy consumed in the State. </p><p>  At the end of 2011, we were at 17.6% renewable electricity, 3.6% renewable transport (biofuels) and 5% renewable heat. Together these amounted to 6.5% all energy consumed being from renewables in 2011. This means we have another 8 years within which to achieve the remaining 9.5%, which will be very challenging. </p><p>  Our NREAP and the Strategy for Renewable Energy 2012-2020 published by my Department earlier this year sets out the various policies and strategies that have been put in place on renewable energy. In the electricity sector, EirGrid&rsquo;s 2008 </p><p>  Grid25 strategy is being implemented, alongside the rollout of the Gate 3 grid connections to renewable generators. </p><p>  Onshore wind will make up the bulk of the 40% 2020 renewable electricity consumption target. In this context, it is recognised that there is an important balance to be struck between renewable energy development and the possible concerns of local communities in regard to issues such as proximity, visual amenity, and noise.</p><p>  Existing Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Wind Energy Development (published by the Department of Environment in 2006) State that in general, noise is unlikely to be a significant problem, where the distance from the nearest turbine to any noise sensitive property is more than 500 metres.  The Guidelines also advise planning authorities to seek evidence that the types of turbines proposed in a particular development will use best current engineering practice in terms of noise creation and suppression and provide quite specific limits in the permissible increases in noise above background noise from wind energy developments in order to protect neighbouring properties.</p><p>  The current system therefore provides for a degree of specificity and uniformity across all planning authorities while also leaving the final decision in the hands of the local decision makers &ndash; who have the benefit of any submissions or observations from third parties &ndash; in making their decision. </p><p>  It is considered that the introduction of mandatory minimum distances set out in statute, as proposed under the Wind Turbines Bill 2012, could effectively prohibit a planning authority from considering wind energy development that may otherwise be acceptable or even desirable from a broader energy policy perspective.</p><p>  Along with my ministerial colleagues in the Department of Environment, we feel that the issues raised in the proposed Wind Turbines Bill are best addressed through a targeted review of the existing guidelines rather than legislation.</p><p>  In order to ensure that Ireland continues to meet its renewable energy targets and at the same time ensure that wind energy does not have negative impacts on local communities, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government &ndash; in conjunction with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and other stakeholders &ndash; will undertake a targeted review of certain aspects of the Wind Energy Guidelines.  This focused review will examine the manner in which the Guidelines address key issues of community concern such as noise proximity and visual amenity and any other potential impacts as considered appropriate together with exploring ways of building community support for wind energy development.</p></reply>

The precise areas to be provided with those services will be determined by the commercial market operators.</p><p>  One of the first steps in delivering on the 30Mbps and 40Mbps commitments will be the completion of a formal national mapping exercise to determine the exact position in relation to commercial service providers&rsquo; existing and planned broadband services throughout the country, including in County Meath.  Preparatory work has commenced within my Department to expedite this task.</p><p>  The mapping exercise will identify the areas of the country where there is market failure in the provision of high speed broadband services.  It will also identify where the market is expected to succeed in the delivery of high speed broadband over the coming years.  This process is expected to take several months to complete and until then the precise areas of the country which will require State intervention will not be known.  Rollout will be targeted to commence in 2014, when the mapping, State Aids and procurement processes are complete and when the current contract for the National Broadband Scheme expires.</p><p>I would reiterate that the Government remains committed to the delivery of the speeds referred to above, to ensure that all parts of Ireland, including County Meath, have access to modern high speed broadband services.</p></reply>

Regulations and guidelines for housing authorities to give effect to section 31 are currently in preparation in my Department. When these are made authorities will have one year in which to put in place a differential rent scheme under the new provisions. While it is not the intention to introduce a national standardised differential rent scheme, the regulations to be made will more clearly set out the matters that may be included in a local rents scheme, including the level, type and sources of household income that may be assessed for rent purposes.</p></reply>

The Act allows for the direct provision of water and wastewater treatment services by a water services authority in an area where population or economic activities are sufficiently concentrated. A water services authority therefore has to take account of the economic cost in determining where it will directly undertake the provision of water and wastewater treatment services. </p><p>  In accordance with the 2007 Act, my role as the nister for the Environment, Community and Local Government in relation to water services is to facilitate the provision of safe and efficient water services and associated water services infrastructure, with responsibility for supervision of the performance by water services authorities of their functions in the water services sector. My Department's role is in developing and implementing Government policy in this area, making sure that the necessary funding is made available to finance the Water Services Investment and the Rural Water Programmes and monitoring physical and financial progress on schemes. In the period 2000 to 2011 (inclusive), over &euro;5.5 billion has been invested in the water services sector under these programmes. The overall strategy of investment in water services is to ensure that the timing and scale of investment facilitates economic and other development, achieves compliance with statutory requirements and promotes environmental sustainability objectives. </p><p>  Ireland has a very diverse water supply system, with over 950 public water supplies producing over 1,600 million litres of water daily through a network of 25,000 km of pipes. EPA data indicate that some 85% of the population is connected to public water supplies and a further 8% of the population is serviced by group water schemes covered by the drinking water regulations. The remainder of the population receives water supplies from private wells. </p><p>  Water services are generally provided in stand alone regional or local schemes of varying size and are not connected through one interconnected network. Individual water services schemes are designed for each particular location taking into account the unique features which may apply. The design, construction and cost of these schemes is dependent on a number of factors including density of properties, ground conditions and topography.</p></reply>

This scheme was rolled-out nationally in June 2012, targeting low income families whose mortgage situation is unsustainable and where there is little or no prospect of a significant change in circumstances in the foreseeable future. The scheme ensures that the family remains in their home, while ownership is transferred to an approved housing body who in turn rent it to the original owners.   </p><p>  Householders seeking to avail of the mortgage to rent scheme must</p><p>- have had their mortgage deemed unsustainable under a Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process as provided for under the Central Bank&#8217;s Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears;</p><p>- agree to a voluntary repossession of their home;</p><p>- be eligible for social housing support; and</p><p>- not have significant positive equity in the property.   </p><p>Limits on household income, property value and applicant assets also apply.

All parties have now submitted their responses to my request for proposals for a voluntary industry led solution for homeowners. The responses are now being evaluated and , together with the relevant recommendations in the pyrite report will inform the developmen t of proposals which will provide for a solution to the pyrite problem. </p><p>  The Pyrite Panel undertook a desktop study, in conjunction with stakeholder consultation, to establish facts in relation to the potential exposure to pyrite problems. The information was gathered from a number of sources including local authorities, structural guarantee providers, representatives of homeowners, private builders, construction professionals and public representatives and was cross referenced to verify, as far as practicable, its validity. According to the report, approximately 850 dwellings had a claim with a guarantee provider at March 2012. However, it should be noted that not all those   claims had been verified. The Pyrite Panel recommended the categorisation of dwellings as a mechanism to determine suitable remediation approaches for pyrite affected dwellings .     </p><p>  It further recommended that d wellings categorised as &#8220;red&#8221; should be remediated immediately and dwellings categorised as amber, where there is no significant pyrite related damage, should be monitored and only remediated if significant damage occurs.  I believe the methodology for remediation recommended by the Pyrite Panel offers a pragmatic and sensible approach. The remediation of dwellings is an expensive and disruptive process and I agree with the view expressed by the Panel that it would be unreasonable to remediate d wellings if they are not exhibiting pyrite related damage.  </p><p>  The testing and categorisation protocol, currently under development by the National Standa rds Authority of Ireland (NSAI), will address the   issue of the assessment of damage and the appropriate method for monitoring the amber category. </p><p>  My Department has set up a dedicated email address , , for dealing with pyrite related queries.</p></reply>

In 2009, over &euro;100 million was provided by my Department to support the National Regeneration Programme. Of this &euro;2.26 m was recouped to Tralee Town Council in respect of the tchels Crescent / Boherbee Regeneration   project. </p><p>  In the case of complex regeneration schemes, professional staff are involved at every stage in the project life cycle ranging from initial socio-economic appraisal, planning and design, preparation of contract documents, procurement of services and works contracts, construction supervision and post project review. Depending on the availability of resources within individual authorities and the competencies and skill-sets required to progress projects through the various stages, project staff may be assigned to a regeneration scheme from within an authority&rsquo;s own staff complement or may be procured through open competition by way of fixed term or services contract. Contract management and project supervision costs may be project-specific or may, in cases such as engineering services, health and safety services contracts or other specialist service provision, relate to a number of projects under a particular regeneration scheme. </p><p>  Based on the information available in my Department, it is not possible with the necessary degr ee of certainty to disaggregate consultant and project management/supervision fees in the case of the various regeneration projects which were being prog ressed by Tralee Town Council over the course of 2009.</p></reply>

In relation to the Poolbeg project, my Department has most recently sought an update on the matter from the City Manager in order to provide information to the Public Accounts Committee and the European Commission. The report of the Manager to the September meeting of the City Council was received by the Department and forwarded to the Clerk of the Committee on 19 September 2012. The report indicated that significant progress had been made by Covanta in relation to securing project financing for construction of the plant and by Dublin City Council in dealing with the remaining regulatory issues. It stated that the due diligence procedure is far protracted and therefore it was necessary to consider an extension to the decision/commencement date. It indicated that it would be at least four to six weeks before the revised date could be confirmed.</p></reply>

There are no plans to revise this arrangement.</p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s new waste policy, A Resource Opportunity - Waste Management Policy in Ireland, was published in July 2012.  While the policy does not contain specific measures in relation to the management of waste in schools, it does support the development of a competitive and progressive waste management industry within a revised regulatory structure. The policy contains measures to ensure that the management of waste will be in accordance with the waste hierarchy, as set out in the Waste Framework Directive, whereby prevention, reuse, recycling, recovery are favoured to the disposal of waste and that the costs of waste management are borne by the original waste producer or by the current or previous waste holders, in accordance with the polluter pays principle.  Consumers, including schools, can avail of information in relation to the prevention and minimisation of waste, thus reducing waste management costs, through the National Waste Prevention Programme administered by the Environmental Protection Agency.  The policy does not contain any proposals for a waiver system for schools. </p><p>  My Department provides funding to An Taisce to run the Green Schools programme which aims to raise awareness of environmental issues including waste reduction and the protection of the water environment. The programme helps to create an ethos of sustainability in the school, and promotes good environmental behaviour among students. Over 87% of all schools in the country are registered on the programme. Schools implement environmental plans as part of the process of gaining their Green Flags, and these not only benefit the environment but also can result in financial savings for the school.</p></reply>

The programme sets out a clear vision for the future of local government and proposals to achieve it, with particular focus on strengthening structures at regional, county and sub-county levels, expanding the role of local government, maximising operational and organisational efficiency and improving governance, oversight, local political and executive leadership and citizen engagement.</p><p>  The reform programme also reflects other work under way in relation to various aspects of local government, including local authority mergers, efficiency implementation, local government funding and alignment of local and community development with local government.  The Action Programme, which is available on my Department&#8217;s website at , outlines implementation arrangements for the reform programme and certain issues which will be the subject of further policy development work.  A number of related reports which have been published in conjunction with the Action Programme, including the report of the Steering Group on alignment of local development and local government and the report of the Waterford Local Government Committee, are also available on the site.</p></reply>

The Law Society is the independent statutory body for the regulation of the solicitors profession in the State.  Section 5 of the Solicitors Act 1954 provides for the Society to make regulations which are necessary for the carrying out of its functions and requires that such regulations be laid by the Society before each House of the Oireachtas.</p><p>  The new regulation, which prohibits the same solicitor from acting for both vendor and purchaser in conveyancing transactions, was made by the Law Society on foot of the recommendations contained in the &quot;Conveyancing Conflicts Task Force Report&quot; published by the Society in July.  The Task Force was specifically set up to look at the existing guidelines and regulations relating to solicitors acting for both parties in such transactions.  The Report, which is publicly available on the Law Society's website (www.lawsociety.ie), details the arguments that were put forward both in favour of and against the introduction of this regulation and explains the reasons behind the decision to propose its adoption.  It sets out how the Task Force undertook extensive consultations with members of the solicitors profession and other relevant interested parties and stakeholders and took account, inter alia, of the November 2010 joint HSE and UCD report concerning the &quot;Abuse and Neglect of Older People in Ireland&quot;.  The Task Force also researched and reviewed the regulatory regimes in other jurisdictions and analysed judicial and academic commentary relevant to all issues considered.</p><p>  In noting the Deputy's concerns about the possible cost implications of the new Law Society Regulation, I would expect the relevant costs to even out on the basis of the actual work being done for each party concerned and this is something that can be monitored including in the context of the new and more transparent legal costs regime to be introduced under the Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011.  I also have to acknowledge the lessons of previous litigation in this area and of our last property boom which point to the fundamental need to avoid conflicts of interests in the conduct of conveyancing transactions - be that on the part of solicitors or on the part of their clients including where multiple, elderly or otherwise vulnerable family members may be concerned.  While it would be better if such protections were not necessary at all, there can be no doubt that the new Regulation affords better protection - both to solicitors and to their respective clients - from any claims, now or in the future, that the issue of undue influence arises in relation to any conveyancing transaction concerned.  Similarly, in non-family conveyancing transactions, the interests of seller and purchaser would seem better represented and protected in their own right under the new Regulation.</p></reply>

Part 13 of the Act, which relates to anti-social behaviour by children, was commenced on 1 March 2007. These provisions set out an incremental procedure for addressing anti-social behaviour by adults and children. With regard to children, these range from a warning from a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to a good behaviour contract involving the child and his or her parents or guardian, to referral to the Garda Juvenile Diversion Programme and finally to the making of a behaviour order by the Children Court. With regard to adults, they include a warning and the making of a civil order by the court.</p><p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that up to 30 September 2012, 3,698 behaviour warnings were issued to adults and 2,242 to children. Fifteen good behaviour contracts were made in respect of a child. In addition, four civil orders (in respect of adults) and three behaviour orders (in respect of children) have been issued by the courts.</p><p>  In setting up the regime in the Act the intention was that the different interventions would address the problem behaviour. If they succeeded, there would be no need to apply to the courts for an order. It is only if they failed to lead to a behaviour adjustment by the person in question, that a court order would be applied for.</p><p>  I am further informed that three of the four orders issued in respect of adults related to persons aged between 20 and 30 and one related to a person aged between 40 and 50. The three orders issued to children related to persons aged between 14 and 17 inclusive.</p><p>  I am also informed that the majority of offences for which behaviour warnings or orders are issued appear to arise from complaints of nuisance made to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. This includes unruly gatherings, causing disturbance to local residents and failing to comply with lawful requests to desist from such behaviour. In relation to adults, many offences relate to noise, disturbance and offensive behaviour, which are frequently alcohol related.</p></reply>

While DNA testing is of huge benefit in the identification of missing persons, the scientific advice is that testing in this instance may not be successful as the extraction of DNA profiles from bones that have been in the water for a long time is extremely difficult, as the sea has been found to cause substantial degrading of DNA material.

They oblige the developer to transfer ownership of the relevant parts of the common areas to the relevant OMC within 6 months of the coming into operation of the section, i.e. before 1 October 2011. Subsection (2) defines &quot;substantially completed&quot; as developments in which sales of not less than 80% of the residential units have been closed.  </p><p>  Section 24 deals with the resolution of disputes and it provides that a person may apply to court for an order to enforce any rights conferred or obligation imposed by the Act.  The court, if satisfied that a right has been infringed or an obligation has not been discharged, may make such remedial order as it deems appropriate in the circumstances with a view to ensuring the effective enforcement of the right or the effective discharge of the obligation in respect of the development concerned.</p></reply>

Section 18 of the Act provides that the OMC must establish a scheme for annual service charges to fund expenditure on:</p><p>  - insurance;</p><p>  - general maintenance;</p><p>   - repairs;</p><p>   - waste management;</p><p>   - cleaning;</p><p>   - gardening and landscaping;</p><p>  - concierge and security services;</p><p>  - legal services and accounts preparation; and</p><p>  - other expenditure arising in connection with the maintenance, repair and management of the common areas.</p><p>  Section 18 also places an obligation on unit owners to pay the annual service charge, while section 22 provides that unpaid charges may be recovered by the OMC as a simple contract debt.  OMCs generally enter into a contract with a property management agent to provide services in respect of their development. The specific tasks of the agent are therefore dependent on the nature and extent of that contract. </p><p>  Provisions relating to the licensing of property management agents are set out in the Property Services (Regulation) Act 2011 and are implemented by the Property Services Regulatory Authority. As part of the licensing system, the Authority specifies and implements standards relating to:</p><p> - education, training and experience levels of licensees;  </p><p>  - levels of professional indemnity insurance, </p><p>  - quality of financial accounting systems, and </p><p>  - ethical standards to be observed in the provision of property services.</p><p>  The Act also empowers the Authority to investigate complaints against property management agents and to impose sanctions, including the revocation or suspension of licences, in cases of improper conduct on the part of licensees.</p></reply>

I am not aware of any other correspondence that issued in relation to this matter.  For the Deputy's information I would like to point out that neither McKee nor Cathal Brugha Barracks are in my constituency. </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>August 2012   <b></b><b></b></p><p>Dear member of the Oireachtas, </p><p>  I wish to refer to the recent re-organisation of the Defence Forces.  </p><p>  As you will appreciate, the Government is facing an extremely difficult challenge to restore the fiscal and economic wellbeing of the State.  The very significant challenges and difficult decisions involved in this process cannot be underestimated.  </p><p>  Following the Governments Comprehensive Review of Expenditure, I secured the agreement of the Government to maintain the strength of the Defence Forces at a level of 9,500 serving personnel.  While this represents a very significant commitment on the part of Government, at this strength level it was not possible to maintain the then organisational structure of the Defence Forces, which had been designed to support a serving strength of 11,500.  As a result, I asked the Secretary General of the Department and the Chief of Staff to conduct a detailed review of the organisation and structure of the Defence Forces and to bring forward proposals on an appropriate organisation for a Defence Forces of 9,500 serving personnel which could continue to deliver the services required by Government.  I accepted the proposals submitted jointly by the Secretary General and the Chief of Staff which recommended a reorganisation of Defence Forces' units based on a two Brigade structure.  </p><p>  All personnel in the Defence Forces have now been briefed on the reorganisation proposals.  They will receive further briefings and advice on the many options available to them as implementation of the reorganisation progresses.  The reorganisation implementation plan is designed to limit as far as possible the dislocation of personnel and this will become clear as the plan is implemented.  </p><p>  While the reorganisation means that units will be moved among existing locations, it maintains, as far as possible, the existing organisational strengths within the current locations.  (See enclosed table which shows the serving strength in each barracks prior to the announcement of the reorganisation, and the proposed establishment post the implementation of the reorganisation).  Certain units are being disbanded, amalgamated or relocated as part of the reorganisation.  However, insofar as is practicable, serving members in the Defence Forces whose units are being moved will have the opportunity to either move with their unit or to take up new appointments within or close to their existing locations.  In addition, very significant opportunities for training, career progression and promotion will continue to be available within the reorganised structure for the Defence Forces.  While every effort will be made to accommodate members of the Defence Forces, inevitably, some personnel will have to change location in order to fill appointments in the new organisation.  However, contrary to much of what is being stated in correspondence, there is no question of mandatorily requiring all the personnel currently serving in units changing location to move with their unit and I would like to take this opportunity to allay any concerns in that regard.   </p><p>  I am committed to maintaining the capacity of the Defence Forces to meet their operational requirements and the current reorganisation is part of that process.  I would like to reiterate that the reorganisation will be implemented in a manner which best addresses the future organisational needs and capability requirements of the Defence Forces, while facilitating as far as possible the circumstances of individual members and detailed discussions with both Representative Associations are ongoing in this regard.  I trust the above clarifies the matter for you.         </p><p>Yours sincerely,     </p><p>___________________________ </p><p><b>ALAN SHATTER, T.D.</b><b>MINISTER FOR JUSTICE, EQUALITY &amp; DEFENCE.</b></p></reply>

As the Deputy may be aware, Ireland does not become party to treaties until it is first in a position to comply with the obligations imposed by the treaty in question, including by amending domestic law as necessary. </p><p>  The ongoing implementation of our National Disability Strategy in many respects comprehends many of the provisions of the Convention.  In addition, the Inter-Departmental Committee on the Convention monitors the remaining legislative and administrative actions required to enable ratification.  At the Committee's request, the National Disability Authority, the lead statutory agency for the sector, is in the process of assisting it to assess the remaining requirements for ratification so as to ensure conclusively that all such issues will be addressed. </p><p>  One of the key requirements in this regard is the enactment of mental capacity legislation.  The Government&#8217;s Legislation Programme as announced on 18 September 2012, indicates that the Mental Capacity Bill is expected to be published in the current D&aacute;il session.  The Bill will replace the Wards of Court system with a modern statutory framework governing decision-making on behalf of adults who lack capacity.  The passage of this Bill will add substantially to the overall progress on implementation of the requirements towards ratification of the Convention.<b><font color="#000080">   </font></b></p></reply>

On 20 December 2001, the UN Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 1386 under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, authorising the establishment of an International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan, and there are fourteen UN Security Council Resolutions relating to ISAF, most recently UN Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 2069 (2012), adopted on 9 October 2012.  This latest UN Security Council Resolution extended ISAF&rsquo;s mandate for a further year until October 2013.  Ireland has participated in the NATO&ndash;led UN mandated mission since 5 July 2002, following the Government Decision of 2 July 2002, authorising the provision of seven (7) members of the Permanent Defence Force for service with the force.  The annual additional cost to the Defence Vote arising from participation by the Defence Forces in ISAF is approximately &euro;320,000.</p><p>  The continued participation by seven (7) members of the Permanent Defence Force in ISAF is reviewed annually by the Government.  The most recent decision by the Government was on 26 June 2012, when it agreed to continue to provide seven members of the Permanent Defence Force for service with ISAF for a further period from July 2012, subject to ongoing review by the Minister for Defence.  Planning for the drawdown of ISAF generally is currently ongoing and the withdrawal of the Defence Forces personnel from the mission will be coordinated within the context of the overall ISAF drawdown plan.  </p></reply>

I believe this is the optimum strength required to fulfil all roles currently assigned by Government.  The Military Authorities have advised that the strength of the Permanent Defence Force at 31 August 2012, the latest date for which details are available, was 8,838 thus requiring the recruitment of approximately 600 personnel to maintain the agreed Permanent Defence Force strength of 9,500.  This recruitment of approximately 600 personnel will be achieved within the resource envelope allocated to Defence. </p><p>  The consolidation of the Defence Forces formations into a smaller number of locations is a key objective in the ongoing defence modernisation programme and has been recommended in many reports over the past number of years. This was a key consideration of Government in addressing barrack closures as releasing personnel from security and support functions enables the operational capacity of the Defence Forces to be maintained notwithstanding the fall in strength.</p><p>For example military personnel occupied on security and support functions within the four barracks closed on 30th March 2012 have been released for operational duties leading to an efficiency gain of around &euro;5 million per annum. In addition, there are direct cash savings of approximately &euro;1.3 million per annum arising from savings on utilities, maintenance and security duty allowances in the four barracks.</p><p>  Since 1998 a total of 14 barracks have been closed.  The total amount realised to date in terms of sales of surplus property is approximately &euro;84m. This, together with income of approximately &euro;18m from the sale of other smaller military properties and married quarters has been re-invested in providing equipment and infrastructure for the Defence Forces. This approach is in line with the 2000 White Paper on Defence and the Government decision of February 2000 which approved the use of revenue arising from the sale of property surplus to military requirements for investment in equipment and infrastructure for the Defence Forces.</p></reply>

While the changes introduced in respect of the 2012 Scheme, necessitated by the budgetary situation, included a requirement to have had a stocking density of 0.3 livestock units per forage hectare in 2011, provision was made for those who did not achieve this minimum to apply for derogation, on specific conditions. Of the 10,000 farmers eligible to apply, almost 9,500 availed of the opportunity; to date, almost 80% of the cases decided upon have been successful. Those who have not been successful are being afforded the opportunity of appeal to the DAS Appeals Committee, under independent chairmanship of Mr Padraig Gibbons. </p><p>  Faced with the need to make budgetary savings for the current financial year and, mindful of the difficulties faced by those most dependent on the support which the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme provides, I chose to make technical adjustments to the Scheme terms and conditions, designed to better focus the aid on those contributing most to achieving the aims of the Scheme namely, ensuring continued agricultural land use, thereby contributing to the maintenance of viable rural communities, maintaining the countryside and maintaining and promoting sustainable farming systems, which take account of environmental protection measures. </p><p>  REPS is an agri-environment measure under the current Rural Development Programme 2007-2013.  It is designed to encourage farmers to go beyond basic good farming practice and to farm in a way that benefits the landscape, biodiversity and water quality.  Every member state must have an agri-environment measure and REPS is co-funded by the EU at the rate of 55%. The scheme has proven to be very popular with Irish farmers and confirms their commitment to farming to the highest environmental standards, a commitment I might add, that fits very comfortably with the vision of smart, green, growth as set out in my Department&rsquo;s Food Harvest 2020 strategy statement.</p><p>  I remain committed to supporting farmers who choose to farm to environmentally friendly practices and to ensuring that these farmers are rewarded for their efforts Under EU Regulations. In this regard I recently announced the reopening of AEOS with funding of &euro;20m annually, with scheme documentation now available on the Department&rsquo;s website.</p><p>  Payment rates in an agri-environment scheme must be justified mainly by reference to income forgone and additional costs incurred by the farmer because of the nature of his or her undertakings.  Also up to 20% of an additional payment may be justified by what are called &ldquo;transaction costs&rdquo;. Given the state of the public finances, in finalising my Department&rsquo;s estimates for 2012, I had no option but to announce a 10% cut in the rate of payment to existing REPS 4 applicants. This cut, which will apply to 2012 payments onwards, will be based on a cut to the transaction cost of participating farmers from &euro;28.03 to &euro;5.60 on each hectare that a transaction cost is paid.</p></reply>

The scheme will build on the success of both the Rural Environment Protection Scheme (REPS) and both AEOS 1 and 2 in delivering an annual income to farmers in return for farming to high environmental standards.  A maximum payment of &#8364;4,000 per annum will apply to individual applicants under the re-opened scheme.  As the average payments in the past have been lower than the maximum, I am confident that up to 6,000 new participants can be accepted into the scheme. </p><p>  I received EU approval for the advance payment of the 2012 Single Farm Payment.  Commencement of the payments begins today and will represent the early payment of over &#8364;500 million to farmers.  I also fully appreciate the value and importance of the other scheme payments to farmers and I remain committed to ensuring that the maximum numbers are paid at the earliest possible date, mindful, of course, of the over-riding necessity to ensure compliance with the governing EU requirements.  Payments worth some &#8364;167 million under the Disadvantaged Area Scheme have been made since 26th September last when payment began.  This funding will provide a boost to the rural economy and will benefit all areas of the country.  It is too early to estimate at this stage the level of total payments which will be made under this scheme in 2012 because there is an issue to do with qualification criteria which is working through the system. REPS payments are up to date.  A total of &#8364;64 million has been paid out to-date and I envisage that by the end of 2012 a further &#8364;121 million will be spent.  AEOS payments are well advanced and continue to issue as quickly as possible.  To date &#8364;23 million has been paid and I expect that a further &#8364;34 million will be paid out before the end of 2012. My intention is to ensure that payments in respect of 2012 are made on the earliest possible date.</p><p>  I am not in a position to give assurances with regard to any other schemes for next year because that is a budget debate and I cannot make early budget promises.  However, I am very conscious of the importance of schemes for farmers' incomes and will try to protect them as best I can. </p></reply>

Under those arrangements Ireland will have received an additional 9.3% in quota between 2007 and 2014.  However for some countries, including Ireland, these quota increases are insufficient to accommodate increases in milk production which have been driven by supply and demand dynamics and the prospect of a quota free production environment after 2015.</p><p>  I have been extremely active in seeking to secure a soft landing for all Member States in the lead-up to milk quota abolition in 2015, as envisaged in the 2008 CAP Health Check agreement.  I have discussed the matter extensively with other EU Agriculture Ministers, including in bilateral meetings with my Danish, French, German, Estonian and Finnish counterparts.  Furthermore, officials from my Department have raised this issue at EU level meetings, and at bi-lateral meetings with other Member States.  The Commission is due to prepare the second interim report on the Health Check by the end of this year and in that context we have called for it to consider measures to ensure a smooth transition to quota abolition in all countries.  </p><p>  To date, however, the Commission has resisted attempts to reconsider this issue, as it has resisted attempts to revisit the outcome of the 2008 CAP Health Check in an overall sense.  The Commission&rsquo;s view is supported by a number of Member States, some of whom are firmly against any further adjustment to the Health Check agreement.  It is also the case that only a minority of Member states is likely to be adversely affected by the current quota restrictions, and therefore persuading a qualified majority to agree to an adjustment of the current regime represents a significant challenge.  There are currently no signs of a breakthrough in this regard.</p><p>  At this point therefore, it would appear that since a majority of Member States do not support any further adjustment to the soft landing, farmers should plan for the continuation of the quota regime until March 2015. </p></reply>

The scientific advice for the southern stock  over recent years has been that the landings should be reduced and as a result there have been cuts to the TAC year on year since 2006  A rebuilding plan for the stock has been prepared by the Irish industry in consultation with the Marine Institute and submitted by the Regional Advisory Council for Pelagic stocks to the EU Commission.  The Commission has referred the plan to the EU Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for advice which is expected shortly.  There is an EU Management Plan in place since 2008 for the northern stock off the coast of Scotland and the TAC is set each year in accordance with the terms of that plan.</p><p>Over the past few years there has been increased interest in participation in these fisheries. This has raised concern about the sustainability of the stock in the context of that level of participation and in relation to the economic viability of individual quota allocations with that increased level of participation.</p><p>In 2011, I asked the fishing industry and other interested parties to make proposals on the future management arrangements for all Irish herring fisheries. The objective of the review was to deliver a policy which would ensure an economically and biologically sustainable fishery. I received over 20 sets of proposals and comments in relation to herring stocks management. It was very clear from these documents that there was no agreement within the industry as to how the future herring fishing opportunities should be managed.  I asked my Department to examine the proposals received and to prepare for me a number of options, which as far as practically possible, took the views of stakeholders into account while delivering proper and effective management.</p><p>On 22 December 2011, I published a draft policy document on the matter and I consulted and met industry regarding the draft policy, again there was no consensus.  On 8 June 2012 I issued a policy, having considered all views and having regard to the sustainability of the fisheries which I believe provides for the proper and effective management and conservation and rational exploitation of the herring stocks.  The policy is based on giving access to each of the fisheries to those with recent track record in that particular fishery.  The track record involves vessels having landed a minimum of 5 tonnes of herring in 2009 or 2010 or in 3 of the 5 years during the period 2006 to 2010.  In addition, there are some very limited specified circumstances where an earlier track record may be taken into account.</p><p>The decision made was based on a clear, detailed and objective assessment of the fisheries in recent years.  This policy is intended to ensure the long term sustainability of the herring fisheries by limiting participation in the main fisheries to those vessels which have participated in the fishery, in the 5 years prior to the commencement of the review, even at a low level. The number of vessels which were allocated quota is as follows:  2009 &ndash; 65 vessels, 2010 - 63 vessels, 2011 &ndash; 92 vessels and 2012 &ndash; 56 vessels.  The revised arrangements have been applied in the North West herring Fishery which commenced on 1/10/2012.</p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s quotas for each stock for 2011 and 2012 are as follows:</p><p><b>Table 1 Quota adjustments</b></p><p><table><tr><th>2011</th><th>ICES Area VIa South and VIIb,c</th><th>ICES Area VIa North:  </th></tr><tr><td>Quota</td><td>4,065</td><td>3,396</td></tr><tr><td>Carry over</td><td>851</td><td>309</td></tr><tr><td>Transferred</td><td>385</td><td>-385</td></tr><tr><td>Swap</td><td></td><td>75</td></tr><tr><td>Total (8696)</td><td>5,301</td><td>3,395</td></tr></table></p><p><table><tr><th>2012</th><th>ICES Area VIa South and VIIb,c</th><th>ICES Area VIa North:  </th></tr><tr><td>Quota</td><td>3,861</td><td>3,459</td></tr><tr><td>Carry over</td><td>530</td><td>319</td></tr><tr><td>Transferred</td><td>386</td><td>-386</td></tr><tr><td>Swap</td><td></td><td>24</td></tr><tr><td>Total (8,193)</td><td>4,777</td><td>3,416</td></tr></table></p><p>The table below is the data which the Deputy has requested.</p><p><b>Table 2.

My Department is participating fully in these negotiations; the intention being that whatever new regime replaces the existing Scheme will accurately reflect the physical constraints faced by Irish farmers in certain parts of the country.

To avail of this scheme, a career break of special leave without pay had to be taken for three years. The scheme provides for the payment of one third of gross pay to a maximum of &euro;12,500 per annum to successful applicants. These amounts are reduced pro rata for any person on reduced working hours under worksharing arrangements and the amount payable is subject to tax and other statutory deductions.</p><p>  My Department was established in June 2011 and involved the bringing together of civil servants from four different Departments. As such, a number of staff availing of career breaks at that time from the work areas due to transfer to my Department became the responsibility of the new Department. There were 4 such staff availing of the Incentivised Career Break at the time. Two of these were due to resume their career in August 2012. One has resigned from the service and the other is due to resume employment later this month. The remaining two are not due back until early 2013. The payroll saving in relation to these career breaks is estimated to be &euro;0.239 million. If all three remaining staff were to resume employment, their full year salary costs would be in the region of &euro;0.120 million.</p><p>  In addition to the above, there are two staff on career breaks from the Children Detention Schools, one of which is an Incentivised Career Break. The payroll saving in relation to the Incentivised Career Break is estimated at &euro;0.105 million and the full year salary should that person resume employment would be in the region of &euro;0.048 million.  Similarly, there are two staff on career breaks in  the Family Support Agency, one of which is an Incentivised Career Break. The payroll saving in relation to this is estimated at &euro;0.076 million and associated full year salary cost if they resume will be &euro;0.038 million.</p><p>  Staff on career breaks are not replaced and work is re-organised and prioritised to cope with the absence.

If any child is in need of care and protection and is unlikely to receive it at home, the HSE has a duty to ensure they receive appropriate care. </p><p>  Where a child is coming into care the HSE allocated social worker undertakes a full assessment of need, and on this basis the statutory care plan is developed. This assessment will call on a full range of professionals where required to set out a comprehensive statement of the child's needs. The care plan also determines the support and interventions needed with regard to the family situation where it is planned that a child will return home.  The care plan also directs the placement most appropriate to the needs of the child. </p><p>  Children in residential care are placed in open residential centres run by either the HSE or private/voluntary providers in communities across the country. The National Standards for Children's Residential Centres clearly set out that the social worker and the centre manager are satisfied that the placement is suitable, will meet the needs of the young person and takes account of the need to protect young people from abuse by their peers.  The HSE is responsible for the registration and inspection of private or voluntary (non-statutory) run residential centres for children and the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) inspects centres operated by the HSE. Centres are inspected under the National Standards.  </p><p>  The Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) was established under the Health Act, 2007 and replaced the Social Services Inspectorate. HIQA is an independent authority responsible for driving quality, safety and accountability in services for children, older people and people with disabilities in Ireland.  HIQA develops standards for Ministerial approval, monitors compliance with standards and carries out investigations where they believe there are reasonable grounds to do so.  HIQA inspects children&rsquo;s residential centres, special care units and foster care settings against the National Standards for Children's Residential Centres, National Standards for Special Care Units and the National Standards for Foster Care.   HIQA publishes their inspection reports on their website. </p><p>  In July 2010, the Government decided to prioritise the inspection of child protection by the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA). These inspections will be undertaken against standards to be developed by HIQA as provided for under Section 8 of the Health Act 2007. HIQA commenced work on drafting National Standards for the Protection and Welfare of Children  and convened a Standards Advisory Group to advise on their development. The Advisory Group, which comprises a wide representation of people from the health and social care sector met several times and the Child Protection and Welfare Standards were published in July 2012.   My department was involved in advising HIQA.  It is expected that the first inspections by HIQA based on the standards for child protection will take place by the end of the year.  The inspection responsibility of HIQA will continue with the new Child and Family Support Agency.</p></reply>

I have also instructed the Executive to provide fortnightly reports on the cash situation, and the Regional Directors are being required to more intensively manage the cash so as to achieve a balanced vote.</p><p>  My Department is working intensively with the HSE on proposals for submission to Government to address structural expenditure issues in the context of the 2013 Estimates. This includes reconfiguration of services, maximising the potential for flexibility under the Croke Park Agreement and curtailing expenditure in the Primary Care Reimbursement Service. These proposals are entirely appropriate and in keeping with the focus in the Programme for Government on reforming the way health services are funded and delivered to achieve greater productivity and more cost effective services.</p></reply>

Every individual will have a choice of health insurer and will have equal access to a comprehensive range of curative services.   </p><p>  In February, I established an Implementation Group on Universal Health Insurance which will assist in developing detailed implementation plans for universal health insurance and driving implementation of various elements of the health reform programme. </p><p>  The Group will also assist my Department in preparing a White Paper on Universal Health Insurance. The White Paper will outline details of the UHI model in addition to the estimated costs and financing mechanisms associated with the introduction of universal health insurance. Preparation of the White Paper is a complex process. It will involve significant financial modelling to support analysis of different design options and to help estimate the cost of UHI.

Some of the funding will also be used to advance activities in the area of suicide prevention and to initiate the provision of psychological and counselling services in primary care, specifically for people with mental health problems.  414 posts were approved to implement the &euro;35 million package of special measures for mental health. While none of these staff are in place yet, 378 of the posts are with the National Recruitment Service of the HSE at various stages in the recruitment process, 231 job offers have already been accepted and the appointments are proceeding, 109 offers have been put to candidates to express an interest, 28 posts are being filled either through transfer or are being amalgamated with other posts and the 10 posts for the National Counselling Service were advertised recently for a national panel.

The deal is an important step in reducing the cost base of the health system. It has a value in excess of &euro;400 million over the next three years and will mean </p><p>- significant reductions for patients in the cost of drugs, </p><p>- a lowering of the drugs bill to the State, </p><p>- greater access to new cutting-edge drugs for certain conditions, and</p><p>- an easing of financial pressure on the health services into the future. </p><p>  This deal, combined with the IPHA agreement reached earlier this year, means that &euro;16 million in drug savings will be made this year with much greater savings to be achieved in 2013/14/15. It is estimated that the deal will generate savings of up to &euro;116m gross in 2013. </p><p>It should be noted that the &euro;124m cost saving target for the community drug schemes in 2012 took account of a number of measures in addition to drug price reductions. These included the increase in the Drug Payment Scheme threshold effective from 1st   January 2012; the full- year effect of generic drug price reductions made in August 2011; and FEMPI reductions made in 2011. </p><p>  This landmark deal with IPHA comes as legislation aimed at reducing the cost of generic drugs makes its way through the Oireachtas. The Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Bill 2012, which will introduce a system of reference pricing and generic substitution, is a priority for this Government. It is expected that this Bill will be enacted before the end of the year and will deliver further savings in the costs of medicines for the health service and private patient. </p><p>  The Department and the HSE will shortly finalise discussions with the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers in Ireland, which represents the generic drugs industry, to deliver further savings in the cost of generic drugs. </p></reply>

In doing so, he was conscious of the significant potential cost implications for private health insurers.  </p><p>  In discussions with the insurers, the Minister indicated that he would be prepared to postpone implementation of the legislation until 2013 provided that the funds targeted in Budget 2012 for the current year could be raised through a system of improved cashflow.  </p><p>  With this in mind, the Department of Health has now agreed in principle a system of improved cash-flow and accelerated payment with private health insurers.  This will provide a once-off cash flow benefit in 2012 in the order of &euro;125m.  The details of the accelerated payment arrangements are at an advanced stage and are being finalised with the health insurers at present. Maintenance charges for private in-patient services in respect of private, semi-private and day-care accommodation in categories 1 and 2 public hospitals were increased with effect from 1 January 2012. It is anticipated that the increased charges will yield additional revenue in the region of &euro;18 million in 2012.</p></reply>

At the end of July, some &euro;43m was outstanding from private health insurers to the hospitals in question. The Department has been working with the main health insurers to agree in principle a system of improved cash-flow and accelerated payment which will provide a once-off cash flow benefit in 2012 in the region of &euro;125m for the health system.  The details of the accelerated payment arrangements are at an advanced stage and are being finalised with the health insurers at present.</p><p>  The HSE is continuing a drive to reduce the time taken to submit claims to private health insurance companies. A key element in this drive includes the implementation of an electronic claims management system in its hospitals. This system will address the deficiencies of the paper based process and will also ensure that standardised work practices are implemented across hospitals.</p></reply>

Co-location of maternity hospitals with adult acute services is the optimal solution for the provision of hospital-based maternity services, as it can provide access to the full range of medical and surgical specialties and clinical support services in sufficient volume and complexity to provide added value.  This is particularly important for high-risk mothers and babies.   Therefore it is proposed that the maternity hospitals should be relocated alongside adult acute services.  In this context the National Maternity Hospital is to be relocated to St Vincent's.  The Dublin maternity hospitals have been working with the HSE in relation to the development of their business cases for relocation.   </p><p>  Within the context of its commercial remit, NAMA advises that it is at all times open to proposals which can contribute to the achievement of broader social and economic objectives.  My officials and I met with NAMA once this year and the Secretary General of the Department also met with NAMA in June 2011.  While a variety of topics and areas of interest were discussed at these meetings, you will understand that I cannot provide detail on the negotiations and discussions for reasons of commercial sensitivity.   </p><p>  The relocation of the National Maternity Hospital to the Elm Park development adjacent to St Vincent's University Hospital was explored and considered earlier this year.   Discussions took place with NAMA in relation to the Elm Park development and these negotiations have now concluded.    While there were some discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform regarding the proposal,  formal sanction was not sought for the relocation of the NMH to the Elm Park development.  No budget has been been provided within my Department for this project as management and delivery of the health infrastructure programme is the responsibility of the HSE.    This project cannot be dealt with in isolation and must be considered in the context of the HSE multi-annual capital programme.  The HSE is required to prioritise capital infrastructure projects within its overall capital funding allocation taking into account the existing capital commitments and costs to completion over the period.   Work on the draft Capital Plan for the next multi-annual period 2013-2017 will begin shortly and will be submitted to my Department in due course.  My Department will then review the proposals and follow up with the HSE where further details may be required.   The draft Capital Plan 2013-2017 will require my approval with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  </p></reply>

They have three main objectives &ndash; to improve the quality of care, to improve access and to improve cost-effectiveness.  Their primary aim is to modernise the way hospital services are provided across a wide range of clinical areas.  This is being done through standardising access to and delivery of high quality, safe and efficient hospital services, and maximising linkages to primary care and other community services.    Currently there are 29 Clinical Care Programmes in different stages of development/implementation.</p><p>  As part of the Orthopaedic Clinical Care Programme, prospective funding for total hip and knee replacements was introduced.   Seven hospitals were initially selected and a price was agreed per procedure. This agreed price also takes account of other medical conditions which patients may have, that may impact on their length of stay.  The reforms introduced have facilitated a reduction in the average length of stay (AvLOS) for total hip and knee replacements. The introduction of new care pathways identified a target AvLOS of  7 days for total hip and knee replacement and 10 days for revision hip replacement.   As per the table below, the AvLOS for hip replacements is currently 6.7 days and for knee replacements is 6.6 days.  These are below the target AvLOS of 7 days.</p><p>  In 2012, it is projected that this will result in savings of approximately 5,200 bed days for total hip/total knee replacements.</p></reply>

As both of these Units are within my Department, this engagement is an on an on-going day-to-day basis and this will continue until the transposition is completed. The Directive is required to be transposed into Irish law by November, 2012 and its provisions will take effect from 1 January, 2013.  </p><p>  It would point out to the Deputy that many of the provisions set out in Directive 2010/63/EU are Mandatory. The Directive strongly promotes the principles of the three Rs (replacement of the use of animals to the greatest extent possible with alternative testing methods, refinement of scientific procedures to improve animal welfare and reduction in numbers of animals used). The provisions of the new Directive also strengthen the protection of animals still needed for research and safety testing. Significant changes in this regard are requirements to perform ethical evaluations prior to authorisation of projects using animals and higher standards of care and accommodation.</p><p>  The European Environment Commissioner Janez Potočnik said: &quot;it is vital to improve the situation for animals still needed in scientific research and safety testing, whilst maintaining a high standard of research and improving the focus on finding alternative methods to animal testing&rdquo;. The Commissioner has also affirmed that the European Union will soon have the highest standards of experimental animal welfare in the world. As indicated by the Commissioner, the transposition of Directive 2010/63/EU will considerably enhance the protection of animals used for scientific purposes.</p></reply>

With regard to the Health Service Executive, they have been asked to collate the data sought as soon as possible and it will be provided directly to the Deputy by them when available.</p><p>  My Department operates a standard scheme of career breaks which allow staff to take up to five years unpaid leave.  In addition, in 2009 only, Special Incentive Career Breaks were available which provided up to three years special leave, with an incentive payment of a third of gross basic salary, up to a maximum of &euro;12,500, for each year of the break.  Those on this special scheme could seek an unpaid extension to bring their total break to a maximum of five years.</p><p>  Ten staff have availed of this special scheme, as follows: 1 Assistant Principal; 4 Higher Executive Officers; 3 Executive Officers; 2 Clerical Officers.</p><p>  The cost of incentive payments to the above staff came to &euro;256,700.  Normal salary payments saved as a consequence of these special breaks came to &euro;1,119,574 giving a net overall saving of &euro;862,874.  None of the above staff have sought extensions of their special career breaks, and the pay cost of these returned staff in 2013 will be &euro;245,433.</p><p>  In addition, three staff are currently on standard unpaid career breaks as follows: 1 Assistant Principal; 2 Clerical Officers.</p><p>  Staff are not counted as part of the Department's employment numbers while on either standard or Special Incentive career breaks. There have been no additional staff employed to cover for staff on either form of career breaks. Significant reductions in staff numbers have also occurred as a result of retirements.  Remaining staff have been redeployed to best address the Department's business priorities, and this will continue on an ongoing basis as circumstances demand.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-10-16a.1670.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/982" speakername="Kathleen Lynch" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012101600066#WRBB04300"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 659 and 687 to 689, inclusive, together.</p><p>  Huntington's Disease (HD) is a genetic, neurological disorder and is classified as a rare disease.  The supports provided by the Health Service Executive (HSE) to people with HD involve a multi-disciplinary team approach to the provision of health and personal supports and incorporates assisted living services, including Personal Assistant Services, Aids &amp; Appliances and hospital, primary care and community services.  The Huntington's Disease Association of Ireland (HDAI), provides consultation, information and individualised support to those diagnosed with Huntington's Disease, their families and their health care team.</p><p>  The HSE is committed to working in partnership with voluntary disability service providers, including HDAI, to ensure that all of the resources available for people with disabilities are used in the most effective manner possible.  The HSE recognises the valuable contribution of the HDAI and approved a grant of just over &#8364;68,000 for 2012 to support the work of the organisation.  The HDAI is a member of the Neurological Alliance of Ireland and the Disability Federation of Ireland.  Both umbrella organisations provide support to the HDAI and are supported by the State through funding from the Health Service Executive.</p><p>  Medical cards are provided to persons who, under the provision of the Health Act 1970, are in the opinion of the HSE unable without undue hardship to arrange GP services and other health services for themselves and their dependants.  The assessment for a medical card is therefore determined primarily by reference to the means, including the income and expenditure, of the applicant and his or her partner and dependants.  Under this legislation, there is no automatic entitlement to a medical card for persons with specific illness such as Huntington's Disease.  There is however, a provision for discretion by the HSE to grant a card in cases of &quot;undue hardship&quot;, where the income guidelines are exceeded.  The HSE has recently set up a clinical panel to assist in the processing of applications for discretionary medical cards where there are difficult personal circumstances.</p><p>  I established a National Steering Group to develop a policy framework for the prevention, detection and treatment of rare diseases based on the principles of high quality care, equity and to be patient centred.  The policy will operate over a five year period, take account of the EU Council Recommendations on Rare Diseases (2009) and define priority actions subject to resource availability.  Similar plans are being drafted by individual countries across the EU.  Article 12 of Directive 2011/24/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 March 2011 on the application of patients' rights in cross-border healthcare establishes that the Commission shall support Member States in the development of European Reference Networks between healthcare providers and Centres of Expertise in the Member States. It is envisaged that the main added value of the European Reference Networks and therefore of the Centres of Expertise will be to facilitate improvements in access to diagnosis and delivery of high-quality, accessible and cost-effective healthcare in the case of patients who have a medical condition requiring a particular concentration of expertise or resources, particularly in medical domains where expertise is rare. Work is ongoing on at EU level on the development of criteria, structures and governance arrangements for such networks and the Department of Health is participating in the relevant Expert Groups.</p><p>  The Nursing Homes Support Scheme, <b><i>A Fair Deal</i></b>  , is a system of financial support for people who require long-term nursing home care.  The Programme for Government commits to review the Scheme with a view to developing a secure and equitable system of financing for community and long-term care which supports older people, including those with Huntington's Disease to stay in their own homes.  My Department has requested information from the HSE on the numbers of people in Co. Donegal and nationwide who have been diagnosed with Huntington's Disease and my Department will forward that information to the Deputy as soon as possible.</p></reply>

Detailed cost containment plans have been in place across the health service since the beginning of the year, but an increasing demand for services has contributed in a significant way to the ongoing deficit.  In order to deal with this, the HSE was required to introduce a range of additional cost reduction measures.</p><p>   The range of additional measures announced at the end of August amounted to &#8364;130 million.  In compiling these measures, every effort was taken to target areas that do not impact on direct client/patient services, with a view to protecting, in as much as is possible, the most essential front-line services.  The &#8364;130m of cost reduction measures is in addition to other non-operational measures to be undertaken, that have been submitted to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, including cash acceleration of receipts from health insurers and once-off transfers from capital to current within the HSE and funding available within the Department of Health's own Vote.  It is a priority for the HSE to minimise, to the greatest extent possible,  the impact on patients and clients of any spending reductions.  Therefore,more than half of the proposals focused on areas that do not have a direct patient impact such as furniture, education and training, office expenses, laptops and PCs, travel and subsistence etc.</p><p>  Prior to the announcement of the &#8364;130m additional cost reduction measures at the end of August, the Louth Meath Hospital Group had already identified the need to introduce measures to reduce its deficit, including a reduction in the usage of agency and overtime.  The Louth Meath Hospital Group is reconfiguring services across the hospital group in order to reduce agency staff costs, with every effort being made to ensure that service reconfiguration will have minimal impact on patients and clients.  Measures have already been introduced to reduce spending in relation to overtime.</p><p>It is proposed that there will be a reduction of a maximum of &#8364;8 million on home help hours between now and the end of December.  There are approximately<font color="#000080"> </font>11 million home help hours provided annually with a budget of &#8364;195 million.  It is the HSE&#8217;s intention that the impact of reductions will be minimised by ensuring that services are provided in the first instance for direct patient care. </p><p>  The Home Help Service and budget allocation in HSE Cavan and Monaghan is set out in the HSE Dublin North East Service Plan 2012, and there will be no further change to the service delivery arrangements in Cavan and Monaghan to year end.</p><p>  In Louth/Meath, the HSE has assured me that personal care hours for the most vulnerable clients will be prioritised and focus for reductions will be on domestic duties for less vulnerable patients. No current recipient of this service, who has an assessed need for the service, will be left without a service.  The number of home help hours to be provided in Louth/Meath between now and the end of the year will be reviewed on an ongoing basis as part of prudent financial management.</p><p> My Department is working intensively with the HSE on proposals for submission to Government to address structural expenditure issues in the context of the 2013 Estimates.  This includes reconfiguration of services, maximising the potential for flexibility under the Croke Park Agreement and curtailing expenditure in the Primary Care Reimbursement Service.  These proposals are entirely appropriate and in keeping with the focus in the Programme for Government on reforming the way health services are funded and delivered to achieve greater productivity and more cost effective services.</p></reply>

This delivers on a key commitment of the Government. </p><p>  Colorectal cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer among both men and women in Ireland.  Approximately 2,200 new cases are diagnosed each year, and it is cause of death in around 950 people each year.  Colorectal screening works on two fronts: it provides early detection and therefore earlier and more effective treatment, and it helps to prevent cancer in the first place by detecting pre-cancerous growths such as polyps.  It is therefore imperative that the programme commences and continues on a sustainable basis. </p><p>  When fully implemented the programme will offer free screening to men and women aged 55-74.  The programme will begin with the 60-69 age group, covering approximately some 500,000 people.</p><p>  The screening programme is the first call/ recall screening programme in Ireland to be offered to men as well as women.  Organising a national programme of this kind is very complex.  To ensure quality and safety it is imperative that the programme is introduced in a carefully managed and monitored way to minimise risks to patients and maximise best clinical outcomes.  Over time the phasing of the programme will allow development of colonoscopy capacity to cater for the full 55-74 year old population.</p></reply>

While separate National Quality Standards for both adults and children with disabilities have already been developed by HIQA, they have now brought the draft standards together in one document albeit, with the standards for adults and children being listed separately.  This draft document is now the subject of a 5 week consultation process before it can be finalised and brought before the board of HIQA.  The final agreed standards document will then be forwarded to the Department for approval with a likely publication date in early January.  </p><p>  Work is also underway in the Department on both the &lsquo;Registration and Inspection&rsquo; regulations and the &lsquo;Care and Welfare&rsquo; regulations required to bring the standards into law.  These are being developed taking into account the lessons learned with the introduction three years ago of similar regulations for nursing homes.  It is expected that the new regulatory system should be up and running by mid 2013.</p><p>  While the HIQA standards have yet to be put on a statutory footing, it is worth noting that compliance with the HIQA standards is already included in the Service Level Arrangements between the HSE and service providers in the disability sector. </p></reply>

Local offices may operate a discretionary budget which covers a wide range of items ranging from mobility aids to communication aids.  It is possible that some individuals have received orthopaedic footwear in the past from this source.</p><p>  The HSE has agreed to a number of non-service impacting cash reduction measures, which includes a &euro;3 million saving from the aids and appliances budget.  However, the HSE has not issued a national instruction to exclude items from this budget, which is decided on a case by case basis at local level.</p><p>  Approval of items is based on detailed information received and with the assistance of local prioritisation guidelines to ensure that people with the most urgent assessed needs have their needs met first, within a set monthly budget.  All professionals providing community based services will be aware of the prioritisation criteria and will provide any necessary and urgent items of equipment following appropriate assessment, as soon as possible.</p><p>  The position in the area identified in the details supplied by the Deputy, the Dublin South East / Wicklow Integrated Service Area, is that aids and appliances are provided by the HSE on the basis of a priority system and within budgets that are provided for these devices.  These priorities are set by clinical staff on the basis of patient need.  Within those constraints every effort is being taken to ensure the supply of orthotics, specialised footwear and other development supports for children.  Where there is insufficient budget to provide a device immediately, waiting lists are in place for the provision / allocation of such devices. </p></reply>

A STEMI is a heart attack caused by a blockage in the arteries.  It is diagnosed by using 12 lead ECG machines and treated by clot busting drugs (thrombolysis) or by the insertion of a wire into the artery to open it by using a balloon to allow the blood to flow to the heart muscle again.  This is known as a primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) and can only be done in a hospital equipped with an emergency catheter laboratory.  Ambulances are equipped and paramedics trained to recognize a major heart attack and to transport these patients to a primary PCI centre hospital.  PPCI services went live in Galway on October 1st  and it is anticipated that Limerick will become a 24 hour centre for these patients within the next few weeks as the programme is rolled out throughout the country following an inspection by the national clinical ACS Programme Lead. </p><p>  International evidence has shown that PPCI is the most effective treatment for major heart attacks and most countries in the developed world have moved to this model of treatment.  It is for this reason that we are striving to expand this service to the people of the Mid West.  The number of patients requiring this service out of hours in the Mid West each year is approximately 58.  Limerick has a 24/7 coronary care unit and both this and day cardiology services will shortly move to a new, state of the art critical care block.</p><p>  It is important to note that a STEMI  is not a case of cardiac arrest. Anyone suffering a cardiac arrest can be treated 24/7 in the Mid Western Regional Hospital.</p></reply>

The plan affirmed Ireland's commitment to achieving compliance with the Directive over a three-year time period.  It committed to implementing measures to compliance, including:-</p><p>a.  The implementation of new work patterns for medical staff;</p><p>b. Transfer of work undertaken by NCHDs to other grades;</p><p>c.  Organisation of hospital services to support EWTD compliance.   </p><p>  The HSE established a EWTD National Working Group in late 2011 to build on the work undertaken in this area since 2009 and accelerate EWTD compliance for NCHDs employed across the public health service.  This Group is working with hospitals on the measures required in each site to reduce NCHD working hours and to ensure that the necessary changes are given effect. </p></reply>

The HSE is bound by the definition of eligibility in the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal (Amendment) Act 2006, which requires a positive diagnostic test for applications received by the Tribunal after the specified date of 20 June, 2006.  </p><p>  A great deal of consideration has been given to the issue of recipients of Anti-D who have neither tested positive for Hepatitis C, nor had a positive Tribunal decision in their favour.  A number of women who have tested negative for Hepatitis C have experienced a variety of symptoms. However, there is no scientific proof that the symptoms are specific evidence of Hepatitis C infection.  Indeed some symptoms of Hepatitis C, such as fatigue, fibromyalgia and depression, are common conditions that occur in the general population. </p><p>  It is estimated that up to 16,000 women in Ireland were exposed to potentially infectious batches of Anti-D and approximately 1,000 of these women were infected with Hepatitis C. Extending eligibility for HAA cards to those who have tested negative for Hepatitis C would have significant implications for the scheme overall.  </p><p>  I am sympathetic to the women in question, but taking account of international practice and the rationale which led to the passing of the 2006 Act, I am satisfied that the present arrangements are reasonable in the circumstances.  I  will of course review any new information which becomes available in relation to this matter.</p></reply>

There are no staff in my Department hired temporarily to cover those on career break.</p><p>  I have asked the State Agencies under the aegis of my Department to provide the Deputy with the information requested.  If you do not receive a reply from the Agencies within ten working days, please advise my private office.</p></reply>
