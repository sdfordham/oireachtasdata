Food Wise includes more than 400 specific recommendations, spread across the cross-cutting themes of sustainability, innovation, human capital, market development and competitiveness; as well as specific sectoral recommendations. </p>  <p>  The implementation process for any strategy is vital for its success. Minister Creed chairs the Food Wise High Level Implementation Committee (HLIC), with high level representatives from all the relevant Departments and State agencies. The committee reviews progress on detailed actions on a quarterly basis, in order to identify and solve problems quickly. Stakeholders regularly present to the committee meetings on their priorities for particular sectors or themes and by the end of this year, the HLIC will have reviewed in detail progress on the five cross-cutting themes and the eleven individual sectors outlined in Food Wise 2025. </p>  <p>  In light of the UK vote to leave the EU, Brexit has been included as a standard item on the agenda of each meeting of the HLIC. It is clear that driving the implementation of the Food Wise recommendations, particularly those related to market development, competitiveness and innovation, will assume even greater importance in the light of the UK decision.</p>  <p>  The UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU reinforces the need to develop as many outlets for our agri-food exports as possible, in order to minimise our dependence on any one market. Indeed this principle of market development is already a key component of Food Wise. We have been very active in recent years in efforts to diversify markets, and in aiming to respond to consumer demands in emerging markets. </p>  <p>  The challenges linked to Brexit are immense, given the very close trading relationships between Ireland and the United Kingdom and on the island of Ireland.  We are determined to work closely with the industry and with other Governments to identify strategies and approaches that will maintain the success of the Irish agri-food and drinks sector.  </p>  <p>  I will launch Steps to Success 2017, the second progress report on Food Wise 2025, of next month.</p></reply>

They provide support to Irish farmers aimed at enhancing biodiversity, water quality and the mitigation of the future impacts of climate change while allowing Irish farmers to improve their agricultural practices.</p>  <p>  The GLAS scheme is the latest agri-environment scheme available to farmers. It forms part of Ireland&rsquo;s Rural Development Plan 2014-2020.  To date in excess of 50,000 farmers have had applications approved into the Scheme under three different tranches over a fourteen month period.  The approval of these farmers into the Scheme has been achieved a year ahead of the original target set when the Scheme was launched.</p>  <p>  Over 95% of cases in Cork have been paid and currently the applications of 136 farmers continue to be processed with payment issuing as cases are cleared.  The Department has contacted the applicants where further information to support their application is needed and we are awaiting a reply to allow the payment processing to be finalised.  The Department is continuing to review cases on an on-going basis and as they are cleared they are processed for payment.</p>  <p>  Concerning AEOS the position is that all but 33 farmers in County Cork have been paid and payments issue as files are cleared.  As 2016 is the final scheme-year of payment under AEOS 2, re-checks on payments made for all scheme years must be completed before final payment can be processed. This process is on-going and payments are issued on a weekly basis as cases are finalised.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-06-22a.14.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017062200054#WRA01000"><p>The drafting of the Forestry Programme 2014 &ndash; 2020 included the production of a Natura Impact Statement and subsequent appropriate assessment, and this process concluded that the programme did not pose a threat to the integrity of the Natura 2000 network. In parallel to this, a Strategic Environmental Assessment was also carried out. As part of this assessment, an environmental report was drafted, the purpose of which was to evaluate the likely environmental effects of implementation and non-implementation of the draft Forestry Programme. This included an evaluation of realistic strategic alternative approaches and options, as well as suggested mitigation and enhancement measures to prevent, reduce and offset any significant adverse effects on the environment arising from the implementation of the draft programme. Mitigating measures adopted by the Forestry Programme are listed under Section 6.12 of the programme document itself. All documents are publicly available on the Department's website. </p>  <p>  As regards any potential effect of afforestation on land prices, it should be noted that there are many factors which can influence land prices. Some are macro factors such as supply and demand and some are more local. Other factors include the prevailing economic climate, for example, the price of land decreasing as a result of the financial crisis of 2008/2009. There are also regional variations in terms of demand, supply and quality which influence the final price paid for land.  To claim that afforestation grants and premium rates are responsible for driving up the price of all land types across the entire country overlooks the complexity that exists within the land market. </p>  <p>  With regard to the economic aspects of forestry, I firmly believe that the sector is good for our economy and in particular, good for our people living in rural communities. Forestry generates economic activity in rural areas where other sectors of our economy cannot reach. It helps create sustainable and vibrant communities by supporting jobs throughout the forest cycle including planting, fencing, thinning, forest roading, harvesting and transportation, and replanting, and of course through the related nursery and processing sectors. In addition, numerous jobs are supported indirectly throughout rural communities, from machinery sales to local shops. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-06-22a.17.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017062200054#WRA01200"><p>My most recent meeting with Coillte was on 10 April 2017 in Macroom, Co. Cork, at the launch of Coillte Premium Partners&rsquo;, Coillte&rsquo;s new private forestry partnership product. I met with both the Chairman of the Coillte Board, Mr. John Moloney, and the company&rsquo;s CEO, Mr. Fergal Leamy, at the event. This contact is of course in addition to ongoing contact on operational and policy issues between Coillte and officials in my Department. </p>  <p>  One of the challenges facing the Irish forestry sector is the mobilisation of the private timber resource. &lsquo;Forests, products and people &ndash; Ireland&rsquo;s forest policy &ndash; a renewed vision&rsquo; indicates that timber mobilisation will play an increasing priority role, if forecasts of roundwood production, especially from the private sector are to be achieved.</p>  <p>  The &lsquo;Coillte Premium Partners&rsquo; which we discussed at our last meeting is a private forestry partnership product where the forestry partners retain ownership of their land while having direct access to Coillte&rsquo;s forest management expertise, operational capacity, planning systems, certification and sales channels.  Our timber processing sector, which provides both direct and indirect employment in rural communities, require a consistent supply of good quality timber so the wider impacts of such a scheme are timber mobilization and local employment. I was therefore pleased to launch the scheme which has the potential to support Irish forest owners and create new value in the rural economy through the mobilisation of timber from privately owned forests.</p>  <p>  I also spoke with the CEO of Coillte last month in relation to the wildfires which occurred on Coillte lands at the beginning of May, most notably in Cloosh Valley, Co. Galway.  These outbreaks were very serious, with implications for lives, livelihoods, homes, property, forests and wildlife.</p>  <p>  My colleague, Minister of State Doyle, who is the Minister of State at my Department with responsibility for forestry, subsequently visited the site of the Cloosh Valley wildfire on Monday, 15 May 2017, where I understand he met with Coillte personnel, including Coillte&rsquo;s Director of Forest Operations.  As the Deputy will recall, an extensive wildfire raged in Cloosh Valley from the weekend of 6th May 2017 until it was eventually brought under control on Thursday 11th May 2017, resulting in the estimated loss of some 1,500 hectares of forestry and 1,000 hectares of bogland.  During his visit, Minister of State Doyle saw firsthand the extent of the damage caused with the fire, its spread and the efforts to control it being the subject of the discussions.</p></reply>

Such licences would, optimally facilitate traditional fishing practices in conjunction with the establishment of a producer organisation representing vessels under a certain LOA in these designated areas.</p>  <p>  I understand that this recommendation arose in relation to requests for special concessions for certain groups to fish commercially for wild salmon.  Such matters are proper to the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and the Environment who retains responsibility for Inland Fisheries including management of wild salmon stocks.  </p>  <p>  While establishment of producer organisations is a matter for industry partcipants themselves, funding is available under the European and Maritime Fisheries Fund for which my Department is the Managing Authority.  </p>  <p>  On the matter of the Inshore Fisheries sector, the National Inshore Fisheries Forum is now the established arena for setting sectoral priorities and discussion on proposals to enhance the sustainability of that sector.  I am particularly encouraged by recent steps the Forum is taking to initiate the development of an Inshore Fisheries Strategy which will help to guide the work of the Forums in improving the opportunities available to the sector overall.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-06-22a.23.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017062200054#WRA01600"><p>Last month I welcomed the release of preliminary information from the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) regarding the uptake of the Agriculture Cashflow Support Loan Scheme. The Scheme, which was developed by my Department in co-operation with SBCI, makes &euro;150 million available to farmers at interest rates of 2.95%. Distributed and administered through AIB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank, the Scheme provides farmers with a low-cost, flexible source of working capital and allows them to pay down more expensive forms of short-term debt, ensuring the ongoing financial sustainability of viable farming enterprises. The SBCI reported that &euro;60.2m has been drawn down by farmers to the end of April. The average loan size is &euro;32,000, with more than half the loans being advanced for terms of four years or more. </p>  <p>  The Scheme was devised to be a flexible as possible and it was up to the applicant to decide the purpose for which they used the loan according to the circumstances of the farming enterprise. Finance for trading stock is a normal working capital requirement for farmers and was eligible under the Scheme. The objective of the Scheme was to address the impact of the change in the sterling exchange rate and lower commodity prices in some agriculture sectors by lowering the cost of finance. There is a significant cost saving for those who decided to use this Scheme as a stocking loan. </p>  <p>  I am pleased at the very positive reaction by farmers to the Scheme, which has proved that significant demand exists for low-cost flexible finance. I have met with the Chief Executives of the participating banks to discuss this and other access to finance issues relating to the agri-food sector. I have asked the banks to respond positively to the demand that has been demonstrated by reducing interest rates and providing more flexible terms for cash flow loans in the future.</p>  <p>  The banks advise that all of the remaining &euro;150m is committed and is in the process of being drawn down. My Department is expecting another update on the progress of the Scheme from the SBCI shortly.</p></reply>

The first phase, concerning pelagic stocks, came into effect on 1 January 2015.  The landing obligation was extended to certain demersal stocks (whitefish and prawns) from 1 January 2016 and will be fully phased in for all quota species by 1 January 2019.</p>  <p>  The phasing process is agreed by Member States in a particular area in consultation with the relevant Advisory Councils which consist of industry and NGO stakeholders.  For North Western Waters the Member States involved are Ireland, Belgium, France, the Netherlands, the UK and Spain.</p>  <p>  195 Irish vessels are currently obliged to land some species depending on where they fish and the type of gear they use. In order to assist skippers with the rollout, my Department and the marine agencies have actively engaged with industry including hosting information workshops. </p>  <p>  In Ireland, quotas are a public resource and are managed by the Minister to ensure that property rights are not granted to individual operators. In 2016 some individual operators exceeding their quota allocations; however I was able, in consultation with Industry representatives, to secure quota swaps with other Member States to keep most stocks within permitted limits.  </p>  <p>  In December 2016 I sought to introduce a voluntary quota balancing system for the RSW Pelagic Segment Mackerel Fishery, but to date full agreement has not been reached with relevant Producer Organisations.    </p>  <p>  My Department is also working to introduce a new quota balancing system.  This will initially involve consultation with Industry representatives prior to full public consultation. The proposed arrangements are intended to operate as a pilot scheme initially in relation to pelagic stocks with a view to further development and amendment as experience informs.</p></reply>

The objective of this EU funded scheme is to encourage growers to come together to strengthen their position in the market in the face of increased concentration of demand by the retail multiples. Under this scheme each PO implements an approved Operational Programme over 3-5 years. Eligible actions included in the Operational Programme can have the objective of improving product marketing and/or quality, aligning production with consumer demand or using environmentally beneficial production methods. </p>  <p>  Although there are two active fruit/vegetable PO&rsquo;s at present in Ireland no Irish strawberry grower is participating in a PO.  The EU legislation governing this scheme has recently been updated and simplified.  In line with FoodWise 2025 my Department is committed to facilitating the development of fruit or vegetable PO&rsquo;s.</p>  <p>  My Department is also responsible for enforcing the EU legislation relating to the quality and labeling of fresh fruit and vegetables.  These standards cover a number of technical quality parameters, however country of origin labeling is the most important aspect for most consumers and all Irish strawberry producers. My Department conducts inspections throughout the fruit and vegetable distribution chain, at import, wholesale and retail level to verify compliance with this legislation thereby ensuring that consumers can make informed decisions regarding their purchases of strawberries and other fruit/vegetables.  </p>  <p>The State also supports the strawberry sector through Teagasc&rsquo;s specialised advisory and education services.  In addition Bord Bia funds a number of promotional events for the sector.  This year was the 10th  year of National Strawberry Week which has now been re-branded as &ldquo;Celebrate Strawberry Week.&rdquo; Co-funded by Bord Bia and the Irish Strawberry industry this promotion campaign aims to highlight the health benefits of strawberries as well as increasing consumer demand though a range of communication channels. </p>  <p>  Strawberries have recorded phenomenal growth in sales in the last few years.  Based on Bord Bia figures retail strawberry sales have grown by 13.5% in the 12-month period to end of March 2017.  The Irish market consumed a total of 9,600 tonnes of strawberries in this period with a retail value of &euro;91 million. Over two thirds of these strawberries were Irish grown.</p></reply>

It also recognises that this must be achieved in a manner that does not threaten food production (Article 2). This reflects the need for a coherent approach to the twin challenges of climate change and food security. From the forestry perspective of land use, the Paris Agreement includes a strong recognition of the role of forests in mitigating climate change.</p>  <p>  This aligns with the Government&rsquo;s long-term ambition for the sector- an approach to carbon neutrality which does not compromise capacity for sustainable food production. In effect, carbon-neutral agriculture aspires to balancing agricultural emissions with carbon-sequestration, reducing emissions from land sector, increasing fossil fuel displacement and materials displacement.</p>  <p>  With this in mind, we are correct to seek to maintain one of Europe's most sustainable forms of food production - the Irish family farm.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, my Department and its agencies have been strongly focussed on improving the efficiency of Irish farming which is fundamental to reducing emissions.  We are focused on improving animal, grassland and nutrient management and have invested heavily in a number of schemes and measures such as the Origin Green initiative, the Beef Data and Genomics Programme and our Agri-Environment Scheme, GLAS.  Our knowledge transfer programmes are key to bringing the latest innovative sustainability research and practices direct to farmers. </p>  <p>  These strategies have led to a significant decoupling of production output and emissions, with current analysis suggesting that the emissions intensity per kcal of food output in 2013 had reduced by approximately 14% relative to 2005. </p>  <p>  FoodWise 2025 includes clear and comprehensive commitments to managing the projected growth in the Irish agri-food sector in a sustainable way.  The guiding principle underpinning this projected growth is that environmental protection and economic competitiveness will be considered as equal and complementary, one will not be achieved at the expense of the other.</p>  <p>  FoodWise provides a framework for the agri sector to engage with the National Mitigation Plan and for the development of a common vision of transition to a low carbon future. </p>  <p>  There is also a strong commitment to measuring and monitoring the sustainability credentials of the sector. As part of the implementation phase of FoodWise, an Environmental Sustainability Committee has been established. This implementation process will include evaluation and assessment of the delivery of sustainability and mitigation actions.</p>  <p>  All of these efforts are being implemented alongside an extensive afforestation scheme. Afforestation is the main cost effective land based climate mitigation tool available to Ireland, followed by the above mentioned technologies in agriculture itself. Climate change mitigation by forests, forest fuels and wood products is one of the principal drivers of the policy to expand forest cover out to mid century. Agriculture and afforestation are intrinsically linked in Ireland, with every new hectare of afforestation comes directly from agriculture.  </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to actively engage in the whole of government approach on climate policy to examine the best means of encouraging sustainable intensification of food production, while optimising the sectors contribution to greenhouse gas mitigation and sequestration including through afforestation and other forest sector activities.</p></reply>

From 2018 eligible areas must instead be designated using a set list of bio-physical criteria. In cases where a Member State does not introduce this new system for payment, the old scheme remains in place but payments must phase out on a digressive basis. </p><p>The biophysical criteria set out in the legislation to underpin the new system of designation are:</p><p>- Low temperature</p><p>- Dryness</p><p>- Excess soil moisture</p><p>- Limited soil drainage</p><p>- Unfavourable texture and stoniness</p><p>- Shallow rooting depth</p><p>- Poor chemical properties</p><p>- Steep slope.</p><p>My Department has commenced work on this project, and relevant technical experts are currently working on sourcing and analysing the data in relation to the new criteria.

They provide support to Irish farmers aimed at enhancing biodiversity, water quality and the mitigation of the future impacts of climate change while allowing Irish farmers to improve their agricultural practices.</p>  <p>  The GLAS scheme is the latest agri-environment scheme available to farmers and is part of Ireland&rsquo;s Rural Development Plan 2014-2020.  To date in excess of 50,000 farmers have had applications approved into the Scheme under three different tranches over a fourteen month period. The approval of this level of farmers into the Scheme has been achieved a year ahead of the original target set when the Scheme was launched. </p>  <p>  I firmly believe that this level of participation in GLAS demonstrates Irish farmers commitment to the sustainable growth of the Irish agri-food sector into the future. It clearly shows that Irish producers recognise that future growth must be based on the principle that economic benefits are complementary, compatible and equal to the environmental protection and enhancement of the resources needed to produce the high quality, safe and healthy produced by them. </p>  <p>  The commitment of Irish farmers to sustainable agriculture production and the protection of the environment is fully supported by the financial provisions in the RDP 2014-2020. So while the full annual expenditure for GLAS will only be known when 2017 payments for all three tranches of the scheme (GLAS 1, 2 and 3) have been processed together for the first time in the final quarter of this year, I am confident that all of the expenditure provided for in Ireland's RDP 2014-2020 for agri-environment measures will be used.</p></reply>

The sector is represented on the Department's Stakeholder Consultative Committee, which met most recently on 11 April, and, as I mentioned, was the focus of the latest of the five sectoral dialogues that I have hosted under the All-Island Civic Dialogue process, which took place in Portlaoise last week. This event provided myself and my Department with an invaluable further opportunity to tease out these issues in some detail, and to consider possible responses, and was made all the more worthwhile by the strong attendance of representatives from Northern Ireland, given the highly integrated nature of the industry on the island. </p>  <p>  These contacts have given the industry the opportunity to flag its concerns in relation to Brexit, including in relation to the operation of the Tripartite Agreement, which facilitates the free movement of horses between Ireland, the UK and France.

Greencore, the holder of the entire Irish sugar quota, availed of this voluntary scheme, dismantled its facilities and ceased production in 2006. Ireland secured &euro;353 million as part of the reform package of which &euro;220 million went to beet growers, &euro;127 million to Greencore and &euro;6 million to machinery contractors.</p>  <p>  In 2011 my Department officials met with two separate groups which had conducted feasibility studies into the possibility of establishing a new sugar and bioethanol production facility, using sugar beet, in this country. The figures published by the interested groups who are investigating the possibility of building a new facility, indicate that the overall capital costs involved could range from &euro;250 million to &euro;400 million, depending on what type of facility would be constructed. </p>  <p>  My Department officials informed both groups at the time, and many times since, that any venture to develop a combined sugar/bioethanol production facility in Ireland, would have to be a viable commercial proposition, and supported by a sufficiently robust business case in order to attract the funding from investors for the very substantial capital investment required. My Government colleague Minister Coveney informed both groups at the time that it was his job to look for agreement at EU level to allow for the growing of sugar beet for the manufacture of sugar, at the earliest possible date. </p>  <p>  In this connection, he secured agreement as part of the overall CAP reform package at the final EU Council of Agriculture Ministers, which he chaired in June 2013, to abolish all sugar quotas by 30 September 2017. This agreement removes, with effect from 1 October 2017, the current EU quota barrier for operators in Ireland or other Member State, wishing to re-establish a sugar industry. </p>  <p>  The current Programme for a Partnership Government makes clear that &ldquo;State enterprise bodies will be asked to examine any substantial business plans related to rebuilding the industry with a view to considering appropriate State supports&rdquo;. It is now up to those interested parties to move the project forward and to garner sufficient commercial and financial support to turn their plans into a viable reality.</p></reply>

Last month I welcomed the release of preliminary information from the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) regarding the uptake of the Agriculture Cashflow Support Loan Scheme. The Scheme, which was developed by my Department in co-operation with SBCI, makes &euro;150 million available to farmers at interest rates of 2.95%. Distributed and administered through AIB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank, the Scheme provides farmers with a low cost, flexible source of working capital, allowing them to pay down more expensive forms of short-term debt, ensuring the ongoing financial sustainability of viable farming enterprises.</p>  <p>  SBCI used the &euro;25 million of public funding provided by my Department to leverage the total amount of &euro;150 million and, along with the European Investment Fund&rsquo;s &lsquo;COSME&rsquo; (the EU programme for the Competitiveness of Enterprises and SMEs), is providing the guarantee required to underpin the loan&rsquo;s flexibility and lower the cost of the loans. My Department&rsquo;s contribution of &euro;25 million includes &euro;11 million from the EU&rsquo;s &lsquo;exceptional adjustment aid for milk and other livestock farmers&rsquo;. It was this exceptional aid package which facilitated the Scheme from an EU State Aid perspective and a second tranche is not possible under this particular arrangement. Other sectors, such as tillage and horticulture, were facilitated by national funding under the &lsquo;de minimis&rsquo; State Aid rules.</p>  <p>  The SBCI reported that &euro;60.2m has been drawn down by farmers to the end of April. The average loan size is &euro;32,000, with more than half the loans being advanced for terms of four years or more. </p>  <p>  I am pleased at the very positive reaction by farmers to the Scheme, which has proved that significant demand exists for low cost flexible finance. I have met with the Chief Executives of the participating banks to discuss this and other access to finance issues relating to the agri-food sector. I have asked the banks to respond positively to the demand that has been demonstrated by reducing interest rates and providing more flexible terms for cash flow loans in the future.</p>  <p>  The banks advise that all of the remaining &euro;150m is committed and is in the process of being drawn down. My Department is expecting another update on the progress of the Scheme from the SBCI shortly.</p></reply>

In Ireland we chose from the legal framework to go with a characteristics-based approach.  Therefore an applicant is free to choose the method which best suits their farming operation to ensure that the land is suitable for grazing or cultivation. Furthermore we also exercised the option to deem what is known as "Permanent Grassland Established Local Practices" (PGELP) land eligible and hence the definition of permanent pasture that is implemented in Ireland allows for the wide variety of grazing ground that exists in the State.</p>  <p>  The main guiding principles for determining land as eligible include:</p>  <p>  - The land is agricultural;</p>  <p>  - The land is not abandoned;</p>  <p>  - Ineligible features, e.g. buildings, areas of water bodies, scrub, rock, have been excluded from the area declared;</p>  <p>  - There must be evidence that the applicant is maintaining the agricultural area.</p>  <p>  With specific regard to Natura land, the &ldquo;Guide to Land Eligibility&rdquo; booklet details the provision set out in EU regulations where land that was eligible in the past and has now become ineligible, due to compliance with the requirements of the birds and habitats directives, can be considered for payment subject to specific criteria being met.  However this provision can only apply where the farmer is still farming the land and the land is fundamentally an agricultural area.</p>  <p>  In relation to a finding of land not being eligible (e.g. in the case of burnt land), the regulations clearly allow for penalties not to be imposed where the applicant can demonstrate that he or she is not at fault for the non-compliance.  </p>  <p>  However, my Department is constrained by EU regulations which require these exceptions to be interpreted narrowly. In the case of eligibility requirements it would be for the applicant to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Department that such exceptional circumstances arise. This may require, where appropriate, the applicant to demonstrate that all reasonable measures have been taken to prevent such damage. My Department will examine every such case on an individual basis to determine if these exceptions are applicable.</p>  <p>  My Department implements the relevant EU regulations in relation to land eligibility in a fair and balanced manner, having due regard to all other relevant EU legislation. I can assure the Deputy that there has been no change to the criteria used to establish land eligibility since the publication of the 2015 Guide to Land Eligibility.</p></reply>

The Government set up an inter-Departmental Task Force to examine the issues involved. </p>  <p>  The main recommendation of the report of the Task Force was the establishment of a sector-specific Atypical Worker Permission system which is an extension of the existing Atypical Worker Permission schemes administered by the Department of Justice and Equality (Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service &ndash; INIS). The purpose of this scheme is to provide a structured and transparent framework for the employment of non-EEA workers within defined segments of the Irish commercial sea-fishing fleet. This system was established and is operated through the co-operative efforts of the Department of Agriculture, Food &amp;amp; the Marine, the Department of Justice and Equality and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.</p>  <p>  The scheme has been in operation for just over a year and therefore further time is needed to allow the scheme to become established and to deliver on its objectives.</p>  <p>  In tandem with the development of this scheme, under the aegis of my colleague the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, 11 Departments and Agencies were brought together and developed a Memorandum of Understanding to underpin the monitoring and enforcement of the scheme. </p>  <p>  The role of my Department, in relation to this scheme, is solely in respect of maintaining the Central Depository of contracts and supporting documentation submitted under the Scheme, in order to ensure that the cap of 500 is not exceeded in any 12 month period.  The Department of Justice and Equality retains responsibility for immigration matters under the scheme while the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) put in place, which is led by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation with relevant State enforcement bodies, provides for a rigorous and effective inspection system.</p></reply>

This was due to a combination of factors including increased global supply, the effects of the Russian ban on the import of EU agri-food products and reduced global demand, notably for dairy products in China.</p>  <p>  During that phase of volatility, the EU Commission, both prompted and supported by Ireland, among other Member States, responded to these difficulties through the deployment of support measures, including intervention provided for under the CAP. </p>  <p>  Ireland welcomed some of the measures adopted by the Commission during this period. Key among these measures was the buying of skimmed milk powder (SMP) into intervention. Ireland's industry placed some 36,000 tonnes of product into intervention between September 2015 and the end of 2016. During this period, the EU Commission, supported by Ireland and other Member States, raised the volume thresholds for fixed-price intervention for SMP on a number of occasions. Currently there are over 350,000 tonnes of SMP in intervention across the EU. </p>  <p>  The increased volume thresholds for SMP of 350,000 tonnes and a commitment to avoid market disruption when releasing product have had a stabilising effect on the market in late 2016 and early 2017. </p>  <p>  The process of tendering for release of product back onto the market commenced in December 2016. There was a single tendering round in December 2016 and multiple tendering rounds throughout 2017 thus far. On each occasion the Commission has adopted a cautious approach. Only 40 tonnes in total has been released thus far, and  this was at the first tendering event in December 2016. The tendering events since December have seen all offers rejected on the basis of what were deemed insufficient offers, often significantly below the market price for the stock. This approach has been supported unanimously by Member States, including Ireland. </p>  <p>  It is critically important that the release of these stocks is managed in a way that does not de-stabilise the market, particularly through the peak phase of production in Ireland and the EU.  I am satisfied to date that the Commission has managed these stocks in a prudent and sensible manner.</p></reply>

From 2018 eligible areas must instead be designated using a set list of bio-physical criteria. In cases where a Member State does not introduce this new system for payment, the old scheme remains in place but payments must phase out on a digressive basis. </p><p>The biophysical criteria set out in the legislation to underpin the new system of designation are:</p><p>- Low temperature</p><p>- Dryness</p><p>- Excess soil moisture</p><p>- Limited soil drainage</p><p>- Unfavourable texture and stoniness</p><p>- Shallow rooting depth</p><p>- Poor chemical properties</p><p>- Steep slope.</p><p>My Department has commenced work on this project, and relevant technical experts are currently working on sourcing and analysing the data in relation to the new criteria.

This is an ongoing process, and will continue through extensive consultation with stakeholders via the Department's Stakeholder Consultative Committee and through the All-Island Civic Dialogue process, in respect of which I have already hosted five agri-food and fisheries sectoral dialogues.</p>  <p>  While the main impact to date of the Brexit vote has been the effect of sterling volatility on those businesses that have a significant trading relationship with the UK, the medium to long term threats include the possible introduction of tariffs on trade between the EU and UK, potential divergences in regulations and standards between the EU and UK post-Brexit, and the implications of border controls and certification requirements. Difficult challenges also arise in relation to potentially restricted access to fishing grounds and resources.</p>  <p>  In response to the challenges posed, I have undertaken a number of important steps within my own Department, which include the establishment of a dedicated Brexit Unit and a Brexit Response Committee to prepare for, monitor and respond to developments as required. As referred to earlier, I have also created a Stakeholder Consultative Committee, which is complemented by frequent contact with representative organisations and companies on an ongoing basis, and operates in parallel to the separate consultation structures under the All-Island Civic Dialogue. </p>  <p>  Last October, as part of Budget 2017, I announced a range of measures aimed at alleviating exchange rate volatility pressures. These included the &lsquo;Agri Cashflow Support' loan fund of &euro;150 million, enhanced taxation measures, and the allocation of additional funding to Bord Bia in order to ensure that it is in a position to provide Brexit-related supports to affected companies, including its new Brexit Barometer.  I also provided for increased funding under the Rural Development Programme and Seafood Development Programme.</p>  <p>  I have also held a series of bilateral meetings with my EU counterparts which are aimed at building alliances to ensure that agri-food and fisheries issues are at the top of the EU negotiation agenda.  I have been getting a sense of the importance of Brexit for other Member States, and of the degree to which they could support Ireland&rsquo;s efforts to have these issues specifically and adequately taken account of in the negotiations. </p>  <p>  In all of these engagements I am making clear our demand for continued unfettered access to the UK market, without tariffs and with minimal additional customs and administrative procedures, as well as keeping the UK market viable for Irish producers by minimising the risk from UK trade agreements with third countries. In relation to fisheries, Ireland wants to maintain current access to fishing grounds in the UK zone in the Irish Sea, Celtic Sea and north of Donegal, and to protect our quota share for joint fish stocks</p>  <p>  I wish to assure the House that the Government remains very focused on supporting the agri-food industry through the challenges ahead. I will continue to consult with the industry as the negotiations develop, and press Ireland's case for continued free access to the UK market, without tariffs and with minimal additional customs and administrative procedures.  </p>  <p>  In relation to the recent UK election, I think it is too early to make any definitive judgement on what impact the result may have on the UK&rsquo;s approach to Brexit. We have to work on the basis of the information available to us at any point in time, including that coming from the UK Government itself. We have prepared extensively and those preparations are ongoing, and I think we will be ready to respond as appropriate to developments as the negotiation process unfolds. </p></reply>

Addressing the most recent Forum, I took the opportunity to highlight that one of my priorities has been to address the impact of the change in the sterling exchange rate and lower commodity prices in some sectors, which have caused cash flow difficulties for farmers. </p><p>Therefore I was pleased to facilitate the &ldquo;Agriculture Cashflow Support Loan Scheme&rdquo;and last month I welcomed the release of preliminary information from the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) regarding its uptake. The Scheme, which was developed by my Department in co-operation with SBCI, makes &euro;150 million available to farmers at interest rates of 2.95%. Distributed and administered through AIB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank, the Scheme provides farmers with a low cost, flexible source of working capital and allows them to pay down more expensive forms of short-term debt, ensuring the ongoing financial sustainability of viable farming enterprises. The SBCI reported that &euro;60.2m has been drawn down by farmers to the end of April. The average loan size is &euro;32,000, with more than half the loans being advanced for terms of four years or more. SBCI report that some 8% of the loans to date have been drawn down by the tillage sector which is in line with borrowing levels for the sector as a proportion of total agricultural borrowings. The banks advise that all of the remaining &euro;150m is committed and is in the process of being drawn down. I am pleased at the very positive reaction by farmers to the Scheme, which has proved that significant demand exists for low cost flexible finance. I have met with the Chief Executives of the participating banks to discuss this and other access to finance issues relating to the agri-food sector. I have asked the banks to respond positively to the demand that has been demonstrated by reducing interest rates and providing more flexible terms for cash flow loans in the future. Implementation of this Scheme is subject to the provisions of Commission Regulation (EU) No 1408/2013 (de minimis aid in the agricultural production sector). Support provided under the de minimis regulation complies with State Aid rules in the agriculture sector and does not require prior approval by the EU Commission.</p><p>Under this regulation, I introduced the Tillage Investment Scheme under TAMS II which opened for online applications on the 8 March 2017. The specific areas of investment include Minimum Disturbance Tillage Equipment, Sprayers, Rain Water Harvesting, Grain Storage and Grain dryers. This Tillage Scheme is the latest of the Targeted Modernisation Schemes (TAMS II) to be launched under the Rural Development Programme 2014-2020. The Scheme is co-funded by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD). </p><p>All applications must be made on-line, either by the farmer or by an adviser authorised to act on his or her behalf.  The closing date for applications under the first tranche of the new scheme is Friday 30 June 2017.  A further Tranche will open immediately on the 1 July with a closing date of the 6 October 2017.</p><p>As an additional support to cash flow on farms, including Tillage farms, up to <b>&euro;1.186billion</b>has been paid out under the Basic Payment Scheme to 124,112 farmers with payments ongoing. Payments of <b>&euro;202.34million </b>have also been made to 94,552 applicants under the Areas of Natural Constraints Scheme.  </p><p>I can also confirm that a wide ranging discussion took place among all the stakeholders who attended the February meeting of the Tillage Forum, including on the issue of crop losses as a result of the poor harvest conditions of last autumn. My officials have since then had some additional meetings with stakeholders and I will consider further the outcome of those deliberations. </p></reply>

This rate of delivery and draw-down would not have been possible without the availability of high quality complex IT software systems to support the business units in operating these schemes. Since 2014 my Department has adopted a policy of implementing fully digital end-to-end support for all but the smallest of schemes.</p>  <p>  My Department has an excellent record in the delivery of high quality ICT systems.  In that respect my Department is ahead of the rest of our European partners and is also highly regarded across the Civil and Public Service.  We have been consistently among the first to make payments in the EU.</p>  <p>  You will be aware from previous discussions in relation to the GLAS scheme that a number of issues delayed payments including:</p>  <p>  - declaration by the applicants of an incompatible parcel usage for  the GLAS action chosen</p>  <p>  - changes in parcel boundaries on which a GLAS action is chosen including splitting or merging of parcels</p>  <p>  - an applicant is no longer claiming  the parcel on BPS 2016</p>  <p>  - incomplete documentation such as incorrect information on Low-Emission Slurry declaration</p>  <p>  - incomplete interim commonage management plans</p>  <p>  - incompatible data and parcel history on Department databases</p>  <p>  Separately a number of issues arose in relation to the GLAS IT system with additional functionality being required to deal with non standard cases. As advised previously I regret the difficulties that this may have caused to a number of farmers.  In direct response to the Deputy&rsquo;s query I am happy to advise that the IT aspect of the delivery of these schemes has been reviewed and a revised team structure has been put in place. This matter will continue to be monitored.  All but a very small amount of outstanding work has been addressed and plans are in place to address this over the coming period.  The delivery of payments in 2017 is on-going with GLAS I and II advance payments almost complete.  GLAS + Advance Payments in respect of 2016 have issued to the majority of eligible applicants in recent days. In addition, the GLAS I and GLAS II balancing payments are scheduled to issue in the coming weeks subject to the receipt of the applicant's Nutrient Management Plan. </p>  <p>  TAMS IT functionality is also available to pay the vast bulk of applicants. A relatively small number of TAMS II applications are subject to penalty and it is expected that payments for the majority of these cases will be issued over the coming weeks. </p>  <p>  In relation to the Knowledge Transfer (KT) schemes the Deputy will be aware that I have recently extended the KT deadline to 31st July, which will allow facilitators and vets further time to finalise actions for KT group participants. A recent difficulty with the operation of the new systems provided by my Department for KT Farm Improvement Plans and Animal Health Measures identified has been addressed. I anticipate that payments in this scheme will be made as scheduled for the autumn of this year.</p></reply>

The programme which represents almost &euro;0.5 billion in State funding, aims to establish almost 44,000 hectares of new forests during this period. In 2015 and 2016 the total area planted was 12,793 hectares which is slightly higher than the target set. Future planting targets along with the afforestation scheme as a whole are currently being examined as part of the midterm review of the programme. The national target is to increase total forest cover to 18% by 2050. </p>  <p>  My Department actively promotes afforestation as a land use that can work in support of the existing agricultural activity. For example it is an option for farmers who wish to diversify their income stream or increase profitability while maintaining their agricultural output.  Forestry does not necessarily mean a reduction in agricultural output nor does it mean converting the entire farm to forestry. Instead where land is underutilised, it signals a more efficient use of land bringing the entire farm closer to its productive potential. Most importantly this approach introduces a stable and additional income into the farm. This new income stream can be used to develop the farm business as part of the overall plan for the farm. It also of course has multiplier effects for the rural economy and currently supports over 12,000 jobs across the sector.</p>  <p>  The current forestry programme introduced changes to the afforestation scheme aimed at increasing planting levels. These changes included the creation of a single premium rate for farmers and non farmers to encourage non farmers to plant. New forest schemes such as agroforestry and forestry for fibre were introduced to allow farmers to plant trees while continuing to have animals graze the land that they had planted. Forestry for fibre also allows farmers to plant trees with much shorter rotations than traditional forestry. Both these schemes are being examined as part of the midterm review where options are being considered to improve their performance.</p></reply>

This was due to a combination of factors including increased global supply, the effects of the Russian ban on the import of EU agri-food products and reduced global demand, notably for dairy products in China.</p>  <p>  During that phase of volatility, the EU Commission, both prompted and supported by Ireland, among other Member States, responded to these difficulties through the deployment of support measures. Among the main elements of these packages have been the extension and broadening of more &lsquo;traditional&rsquo; support measures such as intervention and aids to private storage, as well as more flexible, targeted, direct aid allocated to Member States to spend in accordance with their national circumstances. </p>  <p>  Ireland welcomed and used many of the options provided in the various packages. These include the private storage of cheese, the buying of skimmed milk powder (SMP) into intervention, the payment of direct aid of &euro;26.4 million to dairy  producers. Also the advance payment of annual direct payments to all farmers was a welcome provision of cash flow for farmers at a difficult time. In addition, a Milk Production Reduction Scheme, allowed almost  44,000 farmers across the EU (circa 4,000 from Ireland) agreed voluntarily to reduce their milk production, represented significant market stabilising efforts.</p>  <p>  Global supply and demand dynamics evolved more favourably as 2016 progressed with a better  market environment emerging as a consequence. In spite of these signals of market recovery, the situation remains uncertain in particular product sectors, such as SMP. The long-term fundamentals of the global dairy market are strong. However it is necessary to be cognisant of the on-going challenge of price volatility, which will continue to be a feature of international markets. In this context  dairy processors have a significant role to play, with instruments such as fixed price and margin contracts a useful addition to the suite of measures that can be deployed to mitigate the impact of price volatility.  </p>  <p>  I will continue to work with industry, with other member states and with the EU Institutions to consider how we can refine and improve mechanisms to help farmers to cope with downward price cycles when they arise. In general the outlook for the sector must remain cautiously optimistic, with the resolve to engage in measures to mitigate volatility should it re-emerge.</p></reply>

This means that all applicants, apart from public bodies, are eligible for the same annual premium payment. Up to this point European Council Regulation 1698/2005 on support for rural development had set a higher rate for farmers than for non-farmers. This distinction did not appear in the replacement to this regulation which exists under the current Common Agriculture Policy. </p>  <p>  The single premium rate does not diminish in any way the financial benefits that farmers can enjoy if they decide to plant trees. In fact a recent Teagasc study showed that on marginal land switching from some cattle systems to forestry can yield a net gain as high as &euro;228 per hectare for each year of the forest rotation.   The net return from changing from a sheep system to forestry is largely similar. This analysis is based on current afforestation grant and premium rates and on Farm Family Income reported in Teagasc&rsquo;s 2015 National Farm Survey. </p>  <p>  The introduction of the single premium rate was designed to make the afforestation scheme more accessible to landowners who were not farming the land themselves; this would include sons and daughters of farmers or other relatives who might have inherited land but who have careers outside of farming. This approach also includes institutional investors such as pension funds, although in these cases having to purchase land first makes forestry a less attractive investment. My Department continues to view the single premium approach as an important strategy in increasing forest cover in Ireland. Our aim in this regard is to achieve forest cover of 18% by 2050. Consequently there are no plans to revert back to an afforestation scheme which offers higher premiums to farmers than to non-farmers and our focus now is working to achieve the targets set out in the Forestry Programme up to 2020. </p></reply>

These sectors are of critical importance to our economy given their regional spread and the fact that they underpin the socio-economic development of rural areas in particular.  I am determined to safeguard the interests of these vital sectors. </p>  <p>  While the main impact to date of the Brexit vote has been the effect of sterling volatility on businesses that have a significant trading relationship with the UK, the medium to long term threats include the possible introduction of tariffs on trade between the EU and UK, potential divergences in regulations and standards between the EU and UK post-Brexit, and the implications of border controls and certification requirements. Difficult challenges also arise in relation to potentially restricted access to fishing grounds and resources. Ultimately the objective is to avoid these outcomes. </p>  <p>  With a view to identifying common ground and building alliances for the negotiations ahead, I have held a series of bilateral meetings with EU counterparts. I also wish to ensure that agri-food and fisheries issues are at the top of the trade and economic agenda for the negotiation.  My Department and I are also in regular contact with UK counterparts, both in Great Britain and Northern Ireland. I have also had meetings with major UK retailers to assure them of the continued commitment of Irish suppliers to the UK market.  </p>  <p>  In all of these engagements I am making clear Ireland's demand for continued unfettered access to the UK market, without tariffs and with minimal additional customs and administrative procedures, as well as keeping the UK market viable for Irish producers by minimising the risk from UK trade agreements with third countries. In relation to fisheries, Ireland wants to maintain current access to fishing grounds in the UK zone in the Irish Sea, Celtic Sea and north of Donegal, and to protect our quota share for joint fish stocks</p>  <p>  In the meantime my Department and its agencies have conducted various analyses of the likely impact of Brexit on the agri-food sector.  This is an ongoing process, and will continue, including through extensive consultation with stakeholders via the Department's Stakeholder Consultative Committee and through the All-Island Civic Dialogue process, in respect of which I have already hosted five agri-food and fisheries sectoral dialogues.</p>  <p>  Within my own Department, I have established a dedicated Brexit Co-ordination Unit and a Brexit Response Committee,  to prepare for, monitor and respond to developments as required. These activites span almost all of my Department's administrative and control activities. As referred to earlier, I have also created a Stakeholder Consultative Committee, which is complemented by frequent contact with representative organisations and companies on an ongoing basis, and operates in parallel to the separate consultation structures under the All-Island Civic Dialogue.  </p>  <p>  Last October, as part of Budget 2017, I announced measures aimed at alleviating the exchange rate volatility pressures, which include the introduction of the &lsquo;Agri Cashflow Support' loan fund of &euro;150 million; enhanced taxation measures and the allocation of &euro;2m additional funding to Bord Bia, in order to ensure that it is in a position to provide Brexit-related supports to affected companies, including through its new Brexit Barometer. I have also asked Bord Bia to conduct a market profiling exercise to provide a tool to assist exporters in identifying market priorities and to assist policy makers in prioritising market access objectives. I also provided for increased funding under the Rural Development Programme and Seafood Development Programme.</p>  <p>  I wish to assure the House that the Government remains very focused on supporting the agri-food industry through the challenges ahead.

In the case of land eligibility inspections, the requirement is for 5% of beneficiaries to be inspected and such inspections involve examination of all land types declared by an applicant, including &ldquo;hill land&rdquo;. There has been no change to the inspection requirement as prescribed in the relevant EU legislation. </p>  <p>  In 2015 my Department published the "A Guide to Land Eligibility" booklet, which issued to all farmers, detailing all of the requirements that applicants must comply with to ensure that their land is and remains eligible for payment.  </p>  <p>  The land declared by an applicant under the various EU funded area-based schemes must be eligible agricultural land and must also have an agricultural activity carried out on the land.</p>  <p>  The governing EU regulations set out a range of actions to define agricultural activity and maintaining it in a state suitable for grazing and cultivation. In Ireland we chose from the legal framework to go with a characteristics-based approach.  Therefore an applicant is free to choose the method which best suits their farming operation to ensure that the land is suitable for grazing or cultivation. Furthermore we also exercised the option to deem what is known as "Permanent Grassland Established Local Practices" (PGELP) land eligible and hence the definition of permanent pasture that is implemented in Ireland allows for the wide variety of grazing ground that exists in the State.</p>  <p>  The main guiding principles for determining land as eligible include:The land is agricultural;</p>  <p>  -  The land is not abandoned;</p>  <p>  -  Ineligible features, e.g. buildings, areas of water bodies, scrub, rock, have been excluded from the area declared;</p>  <p>  -  There must be evidence that the applicant is maintaining the agricultural area.</p>  <p>  With specific regard to Natura land, the &ldquo;Guide to Land Eligibility&rdquo; booklet details the provision set out in EU regulations where land that was eligible in the past and has now become ineligible, due to compliance with the requirements of the birds and habitats directives, can be considered for payment subject to specific criteria being met.  However this provision can only apply where the farmer is still farming the land and the land is fundamentally an agricultural area.</p>  <p>  There has been no change to the criteria being used to establish land eligibility since the publication of the 2015 Guide to Land Eligibility.</p></reply>

This is an ongoing process, and employment continues to grow strongly.  In the year since Census 2016 was completed, almost 70,000 more people are at work. More than three out of every four new jobs created in this period were outside Dublin.  </p>  <p>  According to the CSO&rsquo; Quarterly National Household Survey, in Q2 2016 when the Census was undertaken, there were 14,600 people unemployed in the Mid-West region.  The unemployment rate was 8.5%. At Q1 2017, the most recent data available shows the unemployment rate in the Mid-West has dropped by 1.7 percentage points to 6.8%.

My priority is to ensure that the actions committed to in the 2017 Plan to secure employment and retain jobs in the face of global uncertainty are delivered.

I want to use our collective resources across Government to support enterprise and sustainable employment growth in all regions and ensure all of our people have the opportunity to enjoy rewarding work.  </p>  <p>  Action Plan for Jobs 2017 includes actions aimed at stimulating regional growth, including the progression, monitoring and support of the eight Regional Action Plans for Jobs, which through public and private sector collaboration seek to build on existing strengths and assets and identify opportunities within each region, and realise the national Action Plan&rsquo;s regional employment targets. </p>  <p>  To support the regional jobs agenda, additional funds will be made available through the enterprise development agencies out to 2020.

This is important as it ensures that Government is better placed to put appropriate policy responses in place. This particular publication from Ibec is a valuable contribution to our knowledge base and will help to inform the development of policy responses.</p><p>A number of other useful studies have already been published which set out the potential impacts of Brexit, including sectoral assessments (e.g. tourism, agri-food), and many of these are listed on merrionstreet.ie website.</p><p>From my Department&rsquo;s perspective: </p><p>- We recently published the findings of a survey of 1,045 SME business owners and have set out a number of actions being developed to support SMEs in responding to the challenges of Brexit.</p><p>- My Department funded a recently published research project by the ESRI undertaken in close cooperation with InterTrade Ireland to improve our understanding of the impact on cross border trade of different trade and tariff regimes which might be imposed following Brexit. </p><p>- My Department is also currently undertaking research to examine the implications for the most exposed enterprise sectors - in terms of trading and economic relationships - of the UK being outside of the European Single Market and Customs Union. This research will inform an assessment of the way in which Brexit will affect individual sectors of the economy.</p><p>- In addition we are profiling the composition of trade and investment for Ireland and a range of EU Member States with the UK - this will provide an evidence base to inform Ireland's policy positions as part of the wider negotiation on the UK's future relationship with the EU.</p><p>It remains important that Government consults widely and extensively as negotiations progress. </p><p>Since the Referendum, in my role as T&aacute;naiste I have engaged with stakeholders, listening to their views about challenges and opportunities particularly in the context of Brexit. I am aware of the range and depth of issues facing Irish business in light of the decision of our largest trading partner to leave the European Union.</p><p>As Minister for Enterprise and Innovation, I look forward to engaging with a wide range of representative organisations to ensure that the potential impact of Brexit at a sectoral and regional level is understood and used to inform Ireland&rsquo;s policy response. In the coming weeks, I will be meeting representatives from across the business community to hear first-hand the issues facing enterprise in this country. The impact of Brexit will be a key focus of these discussions. </p><p>More immediately, I will be participating in the National Economic Dialogue in the coming days and will take the opportunity to discuss with all participants the challenges, mitigation measures and opportunities that Brexit raises.</p><p>This will build on the work my officials have already undertaken to ensure the Government&rsquo;s Brexit preparations take account of the issues facing businesses, entrepreneurs and innovators.</p><p>Earlier this year, my Department held a large stakeholder engagement event in Carrick-on-Shannon on 30<sup>th</sup>January to hear the views of all stakeholders.  I look forward to co-hosting with Minister Bruton, a similar event which will focus on assessing and responding to the impact of Brexit on Skills on the 3<sup>rd</sup>July.</p><p>I am keen that the Department continues to engage in in-depth and frequent dialogue with our stakeholders on a range of policy areas which fall within our remit. </p><p>In this regard, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation Enterprise Forum on Brexit and Global Challenges is an effective tool for ensuring open, two-way communication between Government and the enterprise community, and provides a vehicle for discussion of enterprise, trade and investment policy implications arising from wider global challenges, with a specific focus on Brexit in the first instance. </p><p>In relation to supporting our enterprises, my department has been working with the Department of Finance, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Enterprise Ireland and the SBCI to build an understanding of the business needs of companies in adapting to the challenges posed by Brexit and to develop appropriate and targeted responses to support them. </p><p>Based on this work, we are progressing the development of a proposed Brexit Working Capital Guarantee Scheme and we are scoping out the need for a longer term Business Development Loan Scheme which would assist firms in investing for a post-Brexit environment. Development of these proposed responses is at an early stage, and is subject to resources being agreed as part of the annual budget process.</p><p>These measures are being considered in the context of existing State Aid rules leveraging support from EU sources such as the EIF.</p><p>As the situation evolves, and we get a better idea of impacts on enterprise in a post Brexit landscape, we will almost certainly need to have further discussions with the Commission in order to ensure that we take sufficient measures in good time to ensure that our most exposed and impacted companies and sectors do not suffer irreparable damage, resulting in significant job losses, as a result of the UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU.</p></reply>

This survey series, currently being conducted by Behaviour &amp;amp; Attitudes, is the most comprehensive survey of SME credit demand in Ireland, covering over 1,500 respondents and involving over 6,000 direct telephone calls to SMEs. SMEs of all sizes trading in all sectors, excluding property development and speculative activities, and in all regions are included.</p><p>The latest survey which can be found here  indicates that the majority of credit requests continue to be approved fully with 84% of credit applications (excluding 'still pending') approved or partially approved.  The current rate of decline stands at 15% of all applications.  </p><p>The Central Bank of Ireland's most recent SME Market Report for the second half of 2016 also shows that rejection rates for credit applications by SMEs and loan/overdraft rejection rates are in line with euro area averages.  This report can be found here: </p><p>In relation to borrowing costs, the most recent published Department of Finance SME Credit Demand Survey, reports only 1% of the SMEs that did not seek credit stated this was because it was too expensive to borrow. When asked for the reason SMEs did not borrow, 86% of firms reported they did not need to borrow.</p><p>Notwithstanding these results the Government is conscious that the SME credit market is highly concentrated. In order to help address this issue, the Government established the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI). Its purpose is to make sustainable, flexible and appropriately priced finance available to viable Irish SMEs and support investment in them that encourages growth and facilitates employment across the whole country.</p><p>The SBCI uses an on-lending model; this means it does not lend directly to SMEs, rather it lends through partner financial institutions known as on-lenders. The SBCI currently has eight on-lending partners, three bank and five non-bank. The SBCI is seeking to broaden its distribution capability and market coverage by adding new on-lenders and working to develop innovative products, thereby serving to drive competition in the SME finance market.</p><p>The Government remains committed to the SME sector.  I can assure the Deputy that my Department, working with other relevant Departments and Agencies such as the Credit Review Office, will continue to advance policies to support and monitor the availability of both bank and non-bank credit so as to ensure that viable Irish SMEs have sufficient access to finance.</p></reply>

However, it is not possible to say definitively at this stage what proportion of the claims this will amount to, but current indications are that this is unlikely to be sufficient to cover all of the 35% gap.</p>  <p>  In 2014, a preliminary assessment was carried out by Towers Watson who indicated that the Liquidator would not be in a position to meet more than 30% of claims out of the assets of the liquidation. The Liquidator has informed the Department that as the Supreme Court has now made its judgment, it will be necessary for a new report to be commissioned to provide updated figures. This is expected to commence shortly. </p>  <p>  The extent of the shortfall (i.e. the difference between the full amount due and the combined total of the ICF payment plus the Setanta distribution) is unlikely to become fully clear until the liquidator has determined the remaining monies in Setanta that he has to distribute to policyholders. </p>  <p>  Finally, in relation to when payments can be expected to commence, the Office of the Accountant of the Courts of Justice and the State Claims Agency are working with the Liquidator to progress the making of payments. The Liquidator for Setanta has informed me that there are currently 324 claims ready for settlement and listed for inclusion in the next application for payment from the ICF, which will be subject to validation by the State Claims Agency.  The State Claims Agency has assured the Department that it will act swiftly so that there will be no unnecessary delay caused by the validation process. </p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that the forthcoming legislation based on the recommendations of the Review of the Framework for Motor Insurance Compensation in Ireland will amend the relevant Insurance Acts to ensure 100% of third party motor claims will be covered in future.</p></reply>

Coastal erosion may threaten human life, infrastructure such as roads and may undermine and cause damage to properties.  However, it should also be recognised that coastal erosion also has beneficial effects to the local environment, such as providing natural nourishment and supply of sediment to adjacent beaches.</p><p>The primary objective of Government policy on coastal protection is to ensure that in areas identified as being at greatest risk of damage or loss to economic assets through coastal erosion or flooding,  appropriate and sustainable measures are identified by Local Authorities to protect those assets and, where such measures are economically justified on cost benefit grounds and compatible with all required environmental and other statutory requirements, they are implemented subject to the availability of resources.</p><p>The Office of Public Works (OPW) has undertaken a national assessment of coastal erosion (including erosion rates) under the Irish Coastal Protection Strategy Study (ICPSS) and the results of this study have been published on the OPW website. The relevant reports and associated predictive erosion hazard mapping (to 2050) may be viewed at </p><p>This Study has surveyed and assessed the coastal erosion risk along the entire national coastline and this information is available to all Local Authorities to enable them to develop appropriate plans and strategies for the sustainable management of the coastline in their counties including the identification, prioritisation and, subject to the availability of resources, the implementation of coastal protection works both of a structural and non-structural nature.</p><p>The Local Authorities may carry out coastal protection works using their own resources. If necessary, they may also put forward proposals to the relevant central Government Departments for funding of appropriate measures depending on the infrastructure or assets under threat.</p><p>Given an intervention within a coastal area may cause problems further along the coast, any proposed intervention measures are best developed in conjunction with a formal coastal erosion risk management study, which has carefully investigated the problem and explored the full range of management options. </p><p>The OPW operates the Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme, under which applications for funding from Local Authorities are considered for measures costing not more than &euro;750,000 in each instance. Funding for coastal erosion risk management studies may also be applied for under this scheme. Funding of up to 90% of the cost is available for projects, which meet the eligibility criteria including a requirement that the proposed measures are cost beneficial. </p><p>The OPW has published guidelines for coastal erosion risk management measures and funding applications under the Minor Works Scheme, available on the OPW website and </p><p>Following the severe storms of Winter 2013/2014 and on foot of submissions made by the Local Authority, total funding of &euro;126,792 was provided by the OPW to Meath County Council under the Government decision S180/20/10/1272 of 11th February 2014 to allocate funding for the repair of damaged coastal protection infrastructure. Funding was approved for works at Laytown to include the replacement of gabions/rock armour revetment sea defence systems.</p></reply>

Ireland has not directly provided any emergency funding to Sri Lanka at this time. However, 228,000 Swiss francs ( &euro;210,000 approx)  was allocated from the International Federation of the Red Cross&rsquo;s Disaster Emergency Relief Fund (DREF) on 28 May to support the Sri Lankan Red Cross Society in delivering assistance and support to 40,000 people affected by floods and landslides. Ireland has been a consistent donor to the DREF in recent years and donated a total of &euro;1.1m in funding to it in 2016. On 24   February, the Start Fund provided &euro;295,008 in funding to Handicap International, Oxfam, Save the Children and World Vision in response to drought in Sri Lanka. The Start Fund is an NGO-managed pooled fund which allocates small amounts of humanitarian funding to NGOs in the initial days of an emergency response and focusing on under-the-radar emergencies.  It is currently funded by the UK, Ireland, the Netherlands and ECHO.  Ireland contributed &euro;1 million to the Start Fund in 2016.  </p>  <p>  Ireland has also supported the UN&rsquo;s Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) since it was first established in 2005, and is among the top eight contributors. We have contributed just over &euro;12 million to CERF in 2017. To date this year, CERF has disbursed over US$7 million in funding to Sri Lanka. </p>  <p>  We will continue to monitor the situation in Sri Lanka, including through our Embassy in New Delhi, which is accredited there. Our Ambassador in New Delhi maintains regular contact with the Sri Lankan authorities and regularly visits Sri Lanka for discussions. </p></reply>

Agenda items at the FAC included the EU Global Strategy, EU-NATO cooperation, counter-terrorism, the external aspects of migration and Iraq. Over a working lunch Ministers discussed recent developments in the Gulf region.</p>  <p>  The Council took stock of progress in implementing the various strands of the EU Global Strategy ahead of a one year progress report by the High Representative to the European Council on 22-23 June. It is expected that discussion on the Global Strategy will continue at the FAC in the coming months, including identifying future priorities for implementation. The Council adopted conclusions on maritime security.  </p>  <p>  The FAC also took stock of progress on EU-NATO cooperation following the Joint EU-NATO declaration last year, and adopted Conclusions in this area.

These have included the relocation of migrants from Italy and Greece across the EU; generous humanitarian assistance to countries hosting large numbers of migrants; and Operation Sophia, the naval operation to address the evil trade of people- trafficking in the Mediterranean. Those measures have had a positive impact, but more needs to be done.In the past year the migration focus has shifted from Turkey and Greece to the Central Mediterranean Route, from Libya to Italy. In March, EU Heads of State and Government set out the EU&rsquo;s commitment to assist Libya in their Malta Declaration. That commitment is broad-ranging including capacity building, training, and the provision of equipment and support for the Libyan national coast guard and other agencies. It also seeks to ensure that there are adequate reception capacities in Libya for migrants, including through working with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Organisation for Migration.</p>  <p>  In April of this year the EU approved a &euro;90 million programme to step up protection of migrants and to reinforce migration management in Libya. A key objective is to provide multi-sectoral assistance and protection to migrants, refugees and host communities in different locations inside Libya, in particular inside detention centres, at disembarkation points and in urban settings. This programme is being implemented through a number of international agencies including the UN High Commission for Refugees and UNICEF. The &euro;90m is in addition to the &euro;120 million already announced by the EU for migration-related support for Libya. The EU will continue to closely monitor the migration situation in Libya to see what additional support is required.</p>  <p>  Migration was discussed at Monday&rsquo;s Foreign Affairs Council (FAC) and is also on the agenda for the European Council later this week. At the FAC, Ireland was among those expressing deep concern at conditions of migrants in detention camps in Libya.  We emphasised &ndash; as we have on many previous occasions - the importance of addressing the root causes and humanitarian aspects of the migration crisis if an enduring solution is to be found. </p>  <p>  It must be acknowledged too, that without an effective, internationally recognised government in Libya, addressing the migrant crisis in the Central Mediterranean region will continue to be very difficult. </p></reply>

The total number of applications include those received up to the end of May (being the latest figures available), while processing dates are current as of 21 June.</p><p>I am also advised that decisions regarding the grant or refusal of visas are made in a number of INIS Visa Offices overseas, the INIS Visa Office in Dublin, and at Embassies of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade which process certain visa applications under delegated sanction from my Department.  The waiting times for visa decisions are published on the Visa pages of each Visa Office and Embassy website.  However, it should be noted that target times for the processing of visas are established as a business target and do not constitute a legal obligation.  These business targets reflect the detailed and often complex assessment that is required to be carried out in relation to applications.</p><p>As the Deputy will know, there has been an exponential increase since the second quarter of 2015 in the number of applications under the terms of the Free Movement Directive (2004/38/EC). This has given rise to a current caseload in the region of 9,000 applications overall which have to be assessed very carefully to ensure that any fraudulent applications or potential abuses of the Directive are detected and dealt with appropriately.Legal proceedings in relation to a number of similar such applications are currently before the courts, and accordingly, the Deputy will appreciate that I am greatly limited in what I can say on the matter.</p><p>More generally, the processing time for visas in each location will vary based on a number of factors such as the number of applications, seasonal pressures, the complexity of the applications, whether further information or investigation is required, and the resources available.  While every effort is made to process such applications as quickly as possible, processing times inevitably vary during the year and from one location to another.  </p><p>The central concern, as with all visa services worldwide, in deciding on visa applications is to strike an appropriate balance between protecting the country's vital national interests by maintaining an effective immigration regime, while at the same time facilitating travel for those who meet the criteria.  Each visa application is therefore decided on its own merits taking all factors into account.<b><font color="#000080">  </font></b><table><tr><th>Purpose of visa applications</th><th>Number of applications received 1 Jan - 31 May 2017.</th><th>Current Processing Date</th></tr><tr><td>Visit</td><td>24,920</td><td>19 May</td></tr><tr><td>Business</td><td>8,196</td><td>30 May</td></tr><tr><td>Conference/Event</td><td>4,292</td><td>30 May</td></tr><tr><td>Join Family (under national legislation)</td><td>3,227</td><td>30 January</td></tr><tr><td>Join Family (EU Free Movement)</td><td>1,323</td><td>See above  </td></tr><tr><td>Study</td><td>3,542</td><td>15 May</td></tr><tr><td>Employment</td><td>1,791</td><td>30 May</td></tr><tr><td>Re-entry</td><td>19,700</td><td>12 June</td></tr><tr><td>Other*</td><td>4,052</td><td>30 May</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>71,043</td><td></td></tr></table>* Includes<b></b>training; exam; conference/event; performance//tournament and sundry applications.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-06-22a.271.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017062200058#WRE01800"><p>I can inform the Deputy that the Valuation Acts 2001 to 2015 provide for the valuation of all commercial and industrial property for rating purposes. The Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the performance of his functions under the Acts and the making of valuations for rating is his sole responsibility. I, as Minister for Justice and Equality, have no role in decisions in this regard. Under Irish law there is a distinct separation of function between valuation of rateable property and setting and collection of commercial rates. The amount of rates payable in any calendar year is a product of the valuation set by the Commissioner, multiplied by the Annual Rate on Valuation (ARV) decided annually by the elected members of each local authority. </p><p>  Specifically in relation to property used in the equine industry, I am advised by the Commissioner of Valuation that no re-classification of properties from rateable status to exempt status has occurred within the general equine industry since the Valuation Act 2001 came into force on 2 May 2002. The Valuation Act 2001 (Schedule 3, Sections 1(a) and (b)) provides that all buildings and lands used or developed for any purpose, are rateable. The basic premise under the Act is that all interests (including buildings) and all developed land are rateable unless expressly exempted under Schedule 4 to the Valuation Act. </p><p>The only element of the equine industry which satisfies the exemption provisions in Schedule 4 is the breeding of horses. Buildings used for breeding of horses are classified as &quot;farm buildings&quot; as defined in the Act and therefore exempt from the payment of rates under paragraph 5 of Schedule 4. On the other hand, buildings used for the training of racehorses, recreational equestrian purposes or livery premises are rateable under the Act. Such buildings would typically include stables for horses, covered riding arenas, tack rooms and ancillary buildings used to support the enterprise. </p><p>While acknowledging the important contribution which all elements of the equine industry make to the economy, there are no plans to reclassify these as exempt from rates. To do so would be at variance with the provisions in the Valuation Acts which maintains the long-standing position that all property occupied and used for commercial enterprises are liable for rates. Exceptions to this key principle would quickly be followed by demands for similar treatment from the providers of other equally important services and products, which would be difficult in equity to resist. This could thus substantially reduce local authority revenues, which would have to be made good by imposing corresponding increases on the remaining ratepayers.<b><font color="#000080"></font></b></p><p>Having a modern valuation base is very important for the levying of commercial rates on a fair and equitable basis across all economic sectors. This has been the policy of successive governments and is the express purpose of the National Revaluation Programme now being rolled out by the Valuation Office. The Valuation Acts provide for revaluation of all rateable property within a rating authority area so as to reflect changes in value due to economic factors such as business turnover, differential movements in property values or other external factors and changes in the local business environment. The national revaluation programme's immediate objective is to ensure that the first revaluation of all rating authority areas in over 150 years is conducted across the country, as soon as possible, on a phased basis. This is a welcome and positive development which is long overdue and on which considerable progress has been made. </p><p>  Where the Valuation Office proposes to enter a new valuation or amend an existing valuation on a Valuation List, there is an extensive process available to cater for ratepayers who may be dissatisfied with the proposed valuation. A dissatisfied person can make representations to the Valuation Office within 40 days of the date of issue of the proposed valuation certificate. The Valuation Office will consider any such representations and may or may not change the proposed valuation depending on the circumstances of each individual property. If any ratepayer is still dissatisfied with the final valuation to be placed on their property following consideration of the representations, they have a right to lodge a formal appeal with the Valuation Tribunal, which is an independent statutory body established for the purpose of hearing appeals against decisions of the Commissioner of Valuation.</p></reply>

The Government agreed that the Garda Commissioner's Modernisation and Renewal Programme (MRP) 2016-2021 would be the vehicle for implementation of the Inspectorate recommendations aimed at the Garda organisation. In support of this plan, Budget 2017 provided funding to continue to expand the number of Garda&iacute; towards 15,000, to double the Reserve to 2,000 and to double the number of civilians to 4,000 by 2021. In addition, the plan is supported by substantial capital investment of some &euro;310 million in critical ICT infrastructure, the fleet and other Garda facilities.</p>  <p>  Robust independent oversight is essential to ensuring that the pursuit of the reform programme is relentless over the next 5 years. To ensure that this is case, the 240 agreed recommendations of 'Changing Policing in Ireland' have been referred to the Policing Authority to monitor and assess their implementation by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and to report progress to me on a quarterly basis. The first two progress reports from the Authority, received in January and April, have been published on my Department's website.</p>  <p>  Priority areas include further civilianisation. This is crucial - we need to ensure that Garda&iacute; are engaged in the work that they are trained for - policing - and not carrying out administrative and technical roles that can be done by civilian professionals. The Government has set a medium term target of 20% civilians to be achieved by 2021 to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; to front line policing duties, and also to address critical capacity and skills gaps in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to HR, finance, ICT and corporate supports generally. </p>  <p>  Other priority areas include initiatives aimed at the more effective deployment of resources, more effective supervision of front-line personnel and cultural change including:</p>  <p>  -  the roll-out of the Divisional model of policing to support the more flexible and effective deployment of resources - four pilots are in train and will be evaluated later this year;</p>  <p>-  the roll-out of   Divisional Protected Services Bureaus on a phased basis starting in three Divisions;</p>  <p>  -  the commencement of the performance appraisal framework in the third quarter with training underway at present;</p>  <p>  -  the cultural audit to provide a baseline against which cultural change in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can be measured in the future will get underway shortly - An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has selected a company to carry out this work after a tender process. The results of the audit will be published.</p>  <p>  I believe the only way to deliver world class policing in Ireland is to ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the resources it needs and that those resources operate in an organisation whose culture is open and responsive and where the best management systems and practices are deployed.  I am confident that the reform plan that is being pursued by the Commissioner, supported by the Government and overseen by the Policing Authority, has the capacity to achieve this.  It will not be done overnight and it will not be done easily, but with the necessary support and oversight, it can be achieved over the next four years.</p></reply>

It is regrettable that there has been a substantial reduction in the strength of the Reserve in recent years from a peak of 1,164 in 2013. The fall-off arises from a range of factors, not least the lifting in 2014 of the moratorium on recruitment of trainee Garda&iacute; which has affected Reserve numbers in two ways - firstly some 200 serving Reserves have successfully applied to become trainee Garda&iacute;, and secondly, resources in both An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and in the Public Appointment Service have been focused on delivering an accelerated programme of recruitment of full time members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p>  <p>  I am sure that the Deputy will agree, notwithstanding the very valuable contribution of Reserve members throughout the country, that it was the right decision, with finite resources, to prioritise the running of recruitment campaigns to replenish the full-time ranks of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na over the last three years. With the plan to reach 15,000 Garda members well on track it was possible for the Commissioner and the Public Appointments Service to undertake a new recruitment campaign for Garda Reserves. That is now  in train and will, allowing for the selection process and necessary training of successful candidates, facilitate a start to be made on strengthening of the Reserve across every Garda Division, in the coming years.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware service in the Garda Reserve is voluntary and unpaid. However, an allowance is payable to Reserve members who complete a minimum of 208 hours duty annually as a contribution towards expenses incurred in performing their duties. The allowance is currently set at &euro;1,000 per annum. In addition, the uniform cost per Reserve member is in the region of &euro;1,300.  As such, should all recruits complete the minimum of 208 hours duty annually, the full year cost of increasing the strength of the Garda Reserve to 2,500 is approximately &euro;4.3m . The costs associated with the training of the reserve members is considered part of the Garda trainers&rsquo; normal duty and is therefore not identifiable.</p></reply>

The annual payroll costs for these extra members would increase to &euro;59.4m in year two as all members would be fully attested at that stage and paid at the appropriate Garda salary rate. Year one costs for new Garda recruits include a basic weekly allowance of &euro;184. After 32 weeks of training, Garda recruits are attested and move on to the first point of the Garda pay scale &euro;28,405, rising to a maximum of &euro;50,448 per annum after 19 years.  They may also qualify for other allowances depending on their assignments. </p><p>For the purposes of this calculation, the costs are based on basic salary plus employer PRSI but do not include any allowances that the members may be entitled to after being attested.</p><p>The cost of recruitment and training recruits are subsumed into the overall training costs of the Garda College and are not easily identifiable.</p></reply>

This very substantial investment in personnel is driven by our commitment to ensure all citizens have the reassurance of a visible, responsive and effective policing service. </p>  <p>  The most recent available figure for the number of civilians working in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is for 30 April 2017, at which point there were 2,098 civilian staff members working throughout the organisation carrying out senior management, administrative and technical roles. The projected number of 4,000 civilians will effectively double the current figure on an incremental basis and represents a medium-term target of a Garda organisation 20% comprised of civilians. That will bring An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, currently 14% comprised of civilians, more in line with international norms and ensure that trained Garda&iacute; are not engaging in administrative and technical duties which could be done by suitably qualified civilian staff. Funding for the recruitment of up to 500 civilians has been provided for this year to support the wider reform agenda. </p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda Authorities that the full year cost of recruiting an additional 2000 civilian staff to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is approximately &euro;86M.  I understand that this figure has been calculated based on an estimated cost per person of &euro;43,000.

After an incident, Garda&iacute; contact GISC on mobile phones instead of returning to their station to record the case details. They give the details to trained civilian call-takers who enter the details on the PULSE system. GISC was established on a pilot basis in September 2005 and rolled out nationally by October 2006. The objectives of GISC are to increase Garda visibility, reduce Garda administrative workload and improve the data quality on PULSE. GISC is located in Michael Davitt House, Castlebar, and operates on a 24/7 basis. In addition to taking calls from Garda&iacute;, GISC personnel also take Traffic Watch calls from the public and administer the on-line reporting of theft in order to enable its investigation by Garda&iacute;.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that as of 30 April 2017, the most recent date for which figures are available, the total staffing of GISC was 187.2 full-time equivalents. The office is fully civilianised. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that as part of its Five Year Reform and High-level Workforce Plan for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Government has agreed an overall vision for a Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 to include 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Garda Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. The projected number of 4,000 civilians will effectively double the current figure on an incremental basis and represents a medium-term target of a Garda organisation 20% comprised of civilians. That will bring An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, currently 14% comprised of civilians, more in line with international norms and ensure that trained Garda&iacute; are not engaging in administrative and technical duties which could be done by suitably qualified civilian staff. The 20% target will be achieved through a twin-track approach of, firstly, a &ldquo;civilian by default&rdquo; policy to be adopted in relation to the filling of all new posts other than operational policing posts and for non-operational policing posts that become vacant and, secondly, the redeployment of Garda&iacute; and backfilling by suitably qualified civilians where necessary.</p>  <p>  As a first step in this process, funding for the recruitment of up to 500 civilians has been provided in Budget 2017 to facilitate the Commissioner in addressing capacity and critical skills gaps across the organisation including in corporate supports, change management, human resources and financial management at the national, regional and Divisional level. To date, the Policing Authority (with the consent of the Department of Justice and Equality and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform) has approved 137 of these positions, of which 34 relate to GISC including 3 Assistant Principal Officers, 2 Higher Executive Officers, 12 Executive Officers and 17 Clerical Officers. The recruitment of these sanctioned posts is in train.</p>  <p>  The Assistant Principal roles were sought to fill vacancies in operationally critical roles. The remaining posts were sought in order to expand the capacity of the unit in order to roll out the recording and classification of all PULSE incidents centrally at GISC. This requirement arose from a recommendation in the Garda Inspectorate report 'Changing Policing in Ireland' in order to improve the consistency and quality of data collected, which contributes to the accuracy of crime statistics. This methodology has been piloted successfully at GISC. The implementation of this process across all areas of the country is an essential element to contribute to the improvement in the quality of the crime statistics. Clerical Officers working in GISC perform the call taking function, they work a 24/7/365 roster.</p></reply>

Section 31 of the 1964 Act sets out a wide range of factors that the court is required to take into account when determining the best interests of the child.  These factors include the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with each of his or her parents.  Section 25 of the 1964 Act also requires the court, as it thinks appropriate and practicable, to take into account the child's wishes in custody and access matters, having regard to the age and understanding of the child.  </p>  <p>  Section 12A of the 1964 Act (inserted by section 58 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015) provides that in making any order under the Act, the court may impose such conditions as it considers to be necessary in the best interests of the child.  The court may, where it considers it necessary and appropriate in order to protect the best interests of the child, including his or her right to the care and custody of both of his or her parents, impose conditions in relation to the holding of the passport of a child. </p>  <p>  It is a matter for the courts when making orders in relation to matters such as the guardianship, custody or upbringing of, or access to, a child to consider whether or not any conditions should be attached to such orders.

Long Term Residency is granted on the basis that a non-EEA national has completed five years legal residency  in the State on work permit / work authorisation / working visa conditions. Residency is calculated from the corresponding Stamp 1 or Stamp 4 endorsements in an applicant's passport and not by the dates of commencement and expiry of each work permit. Periods of time where a person has not had legal residency cannot be counted in any application for long term residency. </p>  <p>  My officials in INIS were in contact with the person concerned on 22 October 2012, seeking further information.  To date this information has not been received by INIS and the application has been deemed abandoned.  </p>  <p>  As the person concerned has not held permission to reside in the State since 23 June 2012, it would therefore seem that they have remained in the State without the permission of the Minister for Justice and Equality.  This is in breach of Section 5(1) of the Immigration Act 2004 which provides that no non-national may be in the State other than in accordance with the terms of any permission given to them by or on behalf of the Minister.  Furthermore, Section 5(2) of the Act provides that a non-national who is in the State in contravention of subsection (1) is for all purposes unlawfully present in the State.</p>  <p>  It would appear that the person referred to by the Deputy failed to meet the requirements of Section 9 of the Act of 2004 which sets out the obligations of non-nationals in respect of registration and, in particular, I would draw the Deputy's attention to the requirements of Section 9(2)(b) of the Act of 2004.  A person who is found to be in breach of the requirements of the Immigration Act 2004 may have committed an offence.  A person found guilty of such an offence is liable under section 13 of the Act of 2004 to a fine not exceeding &euro;3,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both.</p>  <p>  It is open to the person concerned to write to the Residence Unit 2 in INIS seeking a temporary permission (Stamp 1) in order for them to apply for a employment permit under the Reactivation Employment Permit scheme.  Please see www.inis.gov.ie for details. The Employment Permits (Amendment) Act 2014 introduced on a statutory footing  a new  Employment Permit type, the "Reactivation Employment Permit", which will address this situation  i.e where non-EEA nationals who entered the labour market legally on foot of an employment permit have now fallen out of the Employment Permits regime.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose. This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process.

The Directive seeks to ensure a clear and transparent framework for the provision of cross- border healthcare within the EU, for those occasions where the care patients seek is provided in another Member State rather than in their home country. S.I. 203 of 2014 provides the legal basis for the Health Service Executive to operate the EU Directive on Patients' Rights in Cross Border Healthcare in Ireland, including the reimbursement of the cost of treatment..  Under the provisions of the S.I. the HSE is charged with determining the cost of providing such healthcare in the State for the purposes of deciding on the correct reimbursement rate.</p>  <p>  Under the Directive, insured patients are entitled to have costs of cross-border healthcare service reimbursed if the healthcare service in question is among the benefits to which they are entitled in their Member State of affiliation. The HSE is pro-active in advising potential users of the Scheme that reimbursement will be at the cost of the treatment availed of abroad or the cost of providing the healthcare in Ireland whichever is the lesser. The patient is notified of this by the HSE in numerous ways: via the HSE website or in response to phone queries; on the Pro-forma invoice to be used for cases where an overnight in-patient stay is not required; and the letters issued in response to prior authorisation applications for cases involving an overnight in-patient stay will advise the actual amount to be reimbursed, based on the treatment code/s provided by the treating/referring consultant in the application form. The HSE also advises where a patient is in any doubt as to the need to seek prior authorization before availing of a consultation or treatment abroad to contact the National Contact Point. The NCP is able at that stage to advise patients of the indicative reimbursement rate that will apply to the assessment/treatment being accessed.</p>  <p>  As some of the issues raised, namely the rates set for, and the issue of a ready reckoner for, out patient diagnostic procedures are come and the numbers who have received treatment, are under the remit of the HSE, I have asked the HSE to examine these matters and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible. </p></reply>

Under the new Framework, if two practice units are providing general practitioner services in the same qualifying area, both practices may qualify for a modified allowance of &euro;10,000. GPs holding a permanent GMS contract who received the Rural Practice Allowance of &euro;16,216.07 immediately prior to the introduction of the new Regulations who do not meet the new qualifying criteria continue to receive the payment on a personal basis, provided they retain their contractual commitment to the remote rural area. </p>  <p>  As at 1 June 2017, there are 251 practice units in receipt of rural supports under the RPSF. 176 practices receive the financial allowance of &euro;20,000 and 19 practices receive the modified allowance of &euro;10,000. The full year cost of increasing the existing allowance to &euro;25,000 and the corresponding modified allowance to &euro;12,500 for these practices would amount to almost &euro;928,000. Any increase in the financial allowance under the new RPSF would only apply to those practices that qualify under the new criteria, therefore these calculations have excluded the 56 GPs who currently receive the old financial allowance of &euro;16,216.07.</p></reply>

The HSE Scoliosis Waiting List Update and Service Development Plan has been finalised and details of it are available on the HSE website.   The Plan aims to ensure that no patient who requires spinal fusion or other scoliosis procedures, including halo traction, will be waiting more than four months for surgery by the end of the year, where that is appropriate clinically. The HSE has advised the Department that every patient, including children under the age of 14, who needs to be treated in 2017, has been considered and is included in the overall plan for scoliosis services.</p>  <p>  The Plan includes measures to increase capacity in the children's hospitals as well as proposals to outsource some spinal procedures to other hospitals nationally and internationally. The Children's Hospital Group is monitoring progress made and is reporting to the Department on a weekly basis.</p>  <p>  While the Plan endeavours to deliver on short to medium term reduction in the waiting lists, in tandem the HSE is working to develop a long-term sustainable solution for scoliosis and paediatric orthopaedic cases. The numbers of patients on each of the waiting list categories is being taken into account in planning the future service requirements.</p></reply>

I have met with the Chair and CEO/Master of both hospitals and reaffirmed my commitment to the project.  In addition, there has been extensive engagement between the St Vincent's Healthcare Group and my officials.</p>  <p>  Discussions are continuing with the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group on the terms of the State's investment in the new hospital and, in particular, arrangements for the protection of this investment.  The Mulvey agreement envisaged that further consideration was required in relation to the legal mechanisms necessary to protect the State's considerable investment.

Addressing the most recent Forum, I took the opportunity to highlight that one of my priorities has been to address the impact of the change in the sterling exchange rate and lower commodity prices in some sectors, which have caused cash flow difficulties for farmers. </p><p>Therefore I was pleased to facilitate the &ldquo;Agriculture Cashflow Support Loan Scheme&rdquo;and last month I welcomed the release of preliminary information from the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) regarding its uptake. The Scheme, which was developed by my Department in co-operation with SBCI, makes &euro;150 million available to farmers at interest rates of 2.95%. Distributed and administered through AIB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank, the Scheme provides farmers with a low cost, flexible source of working capital and allows them to pay down more expensive forms of short-term debt, ensuring the ongoing financial sustainability of viable farming enterprises. The SBCI reported that &euro;60.2m has been drawn down by farmers to the end of April. The average loan size is &euro;32,000, with more than half the loans being advanced for terms of four years or more. SBCI report that some 8% of the loans to date have been drawn down by the tillage sector which is in line with borrowing levels for the sector as a proportion of total agricultural borrowings. The banks advise that all of the remaining &euro;150m is committed and is in the process of being drawn down. I am pleased at the very positive reaction by farmers to the Scheme, which has proved that significant demand exists for low cost flexible finance. I have met with the Chief Executives of the participating banks to discuss this and other access to finance issues relating to the agri-food sector. I have asked the banks to respond positively to the demand that has been demonstrated by reducing interest rates and providing more flexible terms for cash flow loans in the future. Implementation of this Scheme is subject to the provisions of Commission Regulation (EU) No 1408/2013 (de minimis aid in the agricultural production sector). Support provided under the de minimis regulation complies with State Aid rules in the agriculture sector and does not require prior approval by the EU Commission.</p><p>Under this regulation, I introduced the Tillage Investment Scheme under TAMS II which opened for online applications on the 8 March 2017. The specific areas of investment include Minimum Disturbance Tillage Equipment, Sprayers, Rain Water Harvesting, Grain Storage and Grain dryers. This Tillage Scheme is the latest of the Targeted Modernisation Schemes (TAMS II) to be launched under the Rural Development Programme 2014-2020. The Scheme is co-funded by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD). </p><p>All applications must be made on-line, either by the farmer or by an adviser authorised to act on his or her behalf.  The closing date for applications under the first tranche of the new scheme is Friday 30 June 2017.  A further Tranche will open immediately on the 1 July with a closing date of the 6 October 2017.</p><p>As an additional support to cash flow on farms, including Tillage farms, up to <b>&euro;1.186billion</b>has been paid out under the Basic Payment Scheme to 124,112 farmers with payments ongoing. Payments of <b>&euro;202.34million </b>have also been made to 94,552 applicants under the Areas of Natural Constraints Scheme.  </p><p>I can also confirm that a wide ranging discussion took place among all the stakeholders who attended the Tillage Forum, including on the issue of crop losses as a result of the poor harvest conditions of last autumn. My officials have since then had some additional meetings with stakeholders and I will consider further the outcome of those deliberations. </p></reply>

Such an approach is clearly recognised in the EU Council Conclusions of October 2014 and in the Paris Agreement which outlines that efforts to limit global temperature increases to less than 2 degrees and to pursue 1.5 degrees must do so in a manner that does not threaten food production. From the forestry perspective of land use, the Paris Agreement includes a strong recognition of the role of forests in mitigating climate change and the need to account for both emissions and removals.  </p>  <p>  These objectives are in line also with the Government&rsquo;s stated long-term ambition for the sector - an approach to carbon neutrality which does not compromise capacity for sustainable food production.</p>  <p>  Therefore, maintaining the current Commission proposal, which allows Ireland the potential to use up to a cap equivalent to 5.6% of 2005 emissions (2.7 Mt CO2eq per annum) from Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) from the 280mt EU flexibility in order to meet its emission reduction requirements, is of major importance to Ireland.  This flexibility is based on a combined contribution of net afforestation and cropland and grassland management activities. </p>  <p>  We continue to emphasise that the flexibility from the land use sector should not be seen as an offsetting proposal but rather as an effort to broaden the &ldquo;toolbox&rdquo; of abatement options available to achieve targets. This is particularly the case for Member States where existing abatement measures are costly and action in the LULUCF sector, that encourages removals and limits emissions, may present a more cost effective option.</p>  <p>  Likewise, the starting point is critical to the achievement of a cost efficient burden which reflects the reality of our end-point in 2020 and not the assumption that we have reached our -20% target.</p>  <p>  With specific regard to the proposals made by the ENVI Committee of the European Parliament, a range of actions are being and have been taken in respect of appropriate briefings with MEPs and on a bilateral basis with our fellow Member States on those elements of most importance to the agri-food sector. </p>  <p>  I can assure you of my commitment and that of my officials to ensuring these negotiations result in the best possible outcome for Ireland. We will continue to work closely with the lead Department in this area, the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, to ensure a whole of government approach to the negotiations.</p></reply>

Known as "WIFI4EU", the proposal announced by the European Commission in September 2016, is designed to provide a limited number of public Wi-Fi hotspots in public spaces such as parks, squares, libraries, and some public buildings.</p>  <p>  Importantly, it is proposed that hotspots will rest on existing backhaul provided by public entities defined as municipalities, grouping of municipalities, and other local public authorities and institutions, libraries and hospitals. While these hotspots will provide additional connectivity, they are not designed to fill in broadband coverage gaps, or replace mobile phone services. They will, however, offer additional flexibility for internet connectivity in certain public areas for citizens. By stimulating integration with existing public services, the initiative will assist in promoting public interest in high capacity internet services and will contribute to the take-up of broadband services and also to the development of public infrastructure and digital inclusion. </p>  <p>  The total amount available for the project across all EU Member States will amount to &euro;120 million under the EU&rsquo;s Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) funding mechanism, which will be administered in a series of tranches over a period of three years. The total amount should result in approximately 6,000 &ndash; 8,000 local communities across the EU receiving hotspots at an approximate cost of &euro;20,000 per hotspot. The first call for proposals amounting to &euro;20 million is likely to be launched in late 2017, although no date is yet confirmed.</p>  <p>  Details of the exact administrative process for applicants, are yet to be decided at technical level, and details of arrangements will be announced in due course by the European Commission.  It is known, however, that the hotspots will be paid for through a voucher scheme. The European Commission is working closely with EU Member States including Ireland to determine the logistics of the eventual process. It is not known how many hotspots Ireland will receive overall. However, the principle of geographical balance across Member States will apply so that Ireland should receive a proportionate share. </p>  <p>  The potential applicants in Ireland&rsquo;s case will likely include local authorities, with any local authority eligible to apply as long as their application fulfils the conditions set by the European Commission.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-06-22a.536.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1234" speakername="Denis Naughten" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017062200062#WRJ05000"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 189 and 192 together.</p><p>The National Broadband Plan (NBP) aims to deliver high speed broadband services to every city, town, village and individual premises in Ireland. The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.  This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment by the telecommunications sector and a State intervention in those areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.  </p><p>A key principle of the NBP is to support and stimulate commercial investment through policy and regulatory measures. Commercial investment since the publication of the NBP has considerably exceeded expectations. As a result, the NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector so that to date, the commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2.5bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services and today, approximately 1.4m or 61% of premises in Ireland can get high speed broadband of a minimum of 30 Megabits per second. This footprint is continuing to expand.  </p><p>In April, eir signed an agreement with me committing them to follow through on their commercial plans to provide broadband to 300,000 premises in rural areas.  Eir has committed to doing this work over a 90 week period, with an average of 500 premises passed per day.  My Department will be monitoring this rollout to ensure that eir meets its obligations under the Agreement.  A copy of the Commitment Agreement is available on my website <i>.</i></p><p>Quarterly updates on progress of the eir 300k rollout will be published on the Departments website.  The Q1 figures have been verified by my Department and I am pleased to announce that the eir rollout is in line with the Commitment Agreement.  My Department has informed me that in the period from 1 January to end March 2017 over 30,000 premises have been passed. This brings to over 40,000  the total subset of the 300k premises that eir has passed since they commenced work in late 2016.</p><p>The decision by eir to invest in infrastructure to deploy high speed broadband services to an additional 300,000 premises in rural Ireland was taken by eir on commercial grounds. Neither I nor the Department have a statutory authority to direct eir in this regard. </p><p>In April I published an updated High Speed Broadband Map which is available at .  This map finalises the State Intervention Area for the procurement process and is an important milestone in the procurement process. The Map shows the extent of  the State Intervention area and also the areas targeted for commercial services.</p><p>The BLUE areas represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or have indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services,  </p><p>- The AMBER areas on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the areas that will require State Intervention and are the subject of the current procurement process. </p><p>The following table details percentage of  premises  to be covered by the State Intervention and through commercial investment in the areas identified by the  Deputies.<table><tr><th>County Name </th><th>Location</th><th>Townland</th><th>% Premises within the NBP Intervention Area </th><th>% Premises within Commercial Operator&rsquo;s Area </th></tr><tr><td>CORK</td><td>Elmgrove, Sallybrook</td><td>Riverstown</td><td>9%</td><td>91%</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>DONEGAL</td><td>Meenacharvy</td><td>M&iacute;n an Chearrbhaigh</td><td>100%</td><td></td></tr></table></p><p>There are approximately 2.3m premises covering Ireland&rsquo;s 26 counties, of which approximately 542,000 (23%) premises are located in the AMBER area on the Map.  These premises will require State intervention and are the focus for the State Intervention procurement process. The remaining 1.8m  premises are located in the BLUE areas and will be/are served by commercial operators. Of the 1.8m premises, 1.4m are already within a high speed broadband area and a further 300,000 premises fall within eir&rsquo;s plans to deliver rural high speed broadband between now and end 2018 (Light BLUE on map).  Information on eir's planned rural deployment is available at <font color="#1F497D"> </font><font color="#1F497D">.</font></p><p>My Departments High Speed Broadband map . provides information on a county by county basis with a breakdown of coverage across the townlands in every county.  Individuals can themselves check whether their premises is in a BLUE or an AMBER area by accessing the High Speed Broadband Map and entering their Eircode.</p><p>In relation to the State Intervention; this is intended to ensure high speed broadband is made available to premises and businesses in the areas where commercial investment has not materialised. My Department is running a formal procurement process to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area. The State Intervention network will be a wholesale network and retail service providers will be able to use the network to provide enhanced broadband services to their customers. </p><p>The procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years. The  three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution. A fibre-to-the-home solution means that householders and businesses may get speeds not just of 30 Megabits per second but much higher, potentially up to 1000 Megabits per second.</p><p>With the finalisation of the map and following extensive dialogue with bidders, the procurement is progressing to the next stage. This week, the Department wrote to the three bidders in the NBP procurement process inviting them to submit their &ldquo;Detailed Solutions&rdquo; by 26 September 2017. This is a significant milestone as the NBP procurement process moves to the next stage. </p><p>The timeframe for the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders, during the procurement process. During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated a 3-5 year timeline to rollout a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP, once contracts are in place. </p><p>The Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and/or high demand.</p><p>The rate of demand for data services has increased exponentially in the last four years and this presents a continuing challenge for telecommunication operators, regulators and policy makers both in Ireland and internationally. Recognising this challenge, I specifically included in the Programme for Government a commitment to a Mobile Phone and Broadband Task force. In July 2016, I established the Task Force together with Minister Humphreys to identify immediate solutions to broadband and mobile phone coverage deficits and investigate how better services could be provided to consumers, prior to the full build and roll-out of the network planned under the National Broadband Plan State intervention. The report of the Task Force was published in December and is available on both Departments' websites</p><p>In producing this report, the Task Force worked with Departments, local authorities, ComReg, State agencies, the telecoms industry and other key stakeholders. The report contains 40 actions that will alleviate some of the telecommunications deficits across Ireland and the implementation programme on mobile phone and broadband access identifies 19 of these actions as areas where immediate and direct action by Departments and State agencies can ensure accelerated benefits to consumers.</p><p>In order to maintain momentum created by the Task Force, I, together with Minister Humphreys, established an Implementation Group. This group is driving and monitoring the implementation of the actions, bringing together all key stakeholders identified in the Task Force report with responsibility for delivery. This group will be formally reporting every 90 days on progress made on all actions.  I published the first such quarterly progress report on 13th June 2017, which is available on my Department's website  at and which shows that considerable progress has been made, particularly in relation to the implementation of actions identified for Q1 2017. </p><p>The work of the Task Force will also assist local authorities in preparing for the roll-out of the new NBP network once contracts are in place.</p><p>In addition, following regulations which I signed last year, ComReg recently announced the results of its auction for the 3.6GHz radio spectrum band, which means an 86% increase in spectrum capacity to meet the growing demand for mobile and wireless broadband services across rural and urban areas. The Regulator has awarded 15 year licences for the rights of use in this band which will provide a degree of stability and create future investment certainty. Spectrum was also awarded in lots covering 9 urban and rural regions across the country.</p><p>In my Department's Estimates for 2017, I have secured an &euro;8 million provision for RTE to allow it to free up the 700 MHz spectrum band. ComReg in turn will make plans to allocate this spectrum to provide for significantly enhanced mobile coverage. The 700 MHz band is particularly suited to rural environments where the signal can travel long distances.</p><p>These initiatives should assist in enhancing the quality of mobile phone and data services across Ireland and particularly in rural Ireland.</p></reply>

The decision concluded a lengthy planning process which included an Oral Hearing completed over eleven weeks from March to May last year. The planning decision is currently the subject of Judicial Review proceedings. The planning process for the section of the project in Northern Ireland is ongoing with an oral hearing concluding on 27 February 2017.</p>  <p>  In light of the motions passed by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and Seanad &Eacute;ireann, I had proposals prepared for an updated independent study. In preparing the terms of reference for this study, my officials held meetings with representatives of the North East Pylon Pressure Campaign on 28 March and the Monaghan Anti-Pylon Committee on 3 April. This engagement was important in facilitating local representative groups input into the terms of reference drafting process.</p>  <p>  I approved the Terms of Reference for the study and published them on my Department's website on Monday 8 May. This study will bring further clarity to the relative cost and technical merits of overhead and underground solutions for the North South Interconnector.</p>  <p>  Following the publication of the Terms of Reference, I met with the Deputy and a number of other Oireachtas members from Cavan, Monaghan and Meath on Tuesday 16 May. This meeting provided me the opportunity to update the members on progress in relation to the proposed study and for the members to provide feedback. </p>  <p>  As discussed at that meeting, it is not proposed to include external factors (such as local tourism, health, landscape, agriculture and heritage). These were examined as part of the statutory planning process which is the appropriate method by which such impacts are assessed and evaluated and therefore there are no plans to re-draft the terms of reference. Apart from these external factors, the terms of reference is in keeping with all other factors contained in the motions passed. </p>  <p>  The impact on land and property values and the level of compensation paid in lieu of such impacts was also discussed at the meeting with Oireachtas members and at the meetings with the community groups. Whilst it would not be appropriate for me to intrude on settled processes for addressing these issues between developers and affected landowners, in light of the concerns that have been voiced, I am commissioning research on international comparative practice on the approach to and levels of compensation provided to land and property owners in proximity to high-voltage power lines.</p></reply>

It was introduced in June 2016 and is administered by Pobal on behalf of my Department.  AIM supports children with disabilities to attend mainstream pre-school where they can learn and socialise with their peers. It includes 7 levels of progressive support, moving from the universal to the targeted. The degree of support provided depends on the needs of the child in the context of the pre-school setting they are attending.</p>  <p>  A pre-school provider, in partnership with a parent, can apply for AIM Level 7 - additional capitation.  Where the AIM Early Years Specialist considers that a Level 7 support is critical to a child's participation in the pre-school setting, they will further consider the degree of Level 7 support required having regard to whether the child has complex or highly complex needs.  Where a child is deemed to have complex needs, payment of Level 7 capitation at the lower rate will enable the setting to supplement their staffing by 10 additional staff hours per week.  Where a child is deemed to have highly complex needs, payment of Level 7 capitation at the higher rate will enable the setting to supplement their staffing by 15 additional staff hours per week.  This can be used to reduce the adult to child ratio in the pre-school room or can be used to buy in additional assistance.</p>  <p>  In relation to this particular child, Pobal has advised that an application was received on 23rd May 2017 for support under AIM Level 7 . The Early Years Specialist (EYS) conducted an observation visit on 14th June and met with the pre-school provider and the child's parents. The EYS is currently finalising the relevant information on the application and it will then be sent to the AIM Pobal team for appraisal. The decision will be formally communicated to the pre-school provider and the child's parents as soon as possible.    </p></reply>

These include weekly-paid widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s (contributory and non-contributory) pensions, which are based on contributions or a means test, and a once-off widowed or surviving civil partner grant of &euro;6,000 where there is a dependent child.  A number of social welfare payments, including State pension, continue in payment for six weeks following a death.  In Budget 2016, the Government increased the payment after death period to 12 weeks for carer&rsquo;s allowance.  Guardian payments are available where someone cares for an orphaned child.  A special funeral grant of &euro;850 is paid where a person dies because of an accident at work or occupational disease.</p>  <p>  Additionally, the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme provides assistance to eligible people in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs and those of their dependants.  Under the SWA scheme, the Department of Social Protection may make a single exceptional needs payment (ENP) to help meet essential, once-off and unforeseen expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet from their weekly income, which may include help with funeral and burial expenses.  The Government has provided &euro;31.5 million for exceptional and urgent needs payments in 2017. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

It is not feasible to carry out a financial analysis given the variability of schemes, employers and market conditions.  All defined benefit (DB) schemes are different, with their own trust deeds and scheme rules, setting out contribution rates for employers and employees.  The circumstances of each scheme may change over time depending on investment strategies and market conditions and it is not possible to estimate the number of schemes that will not satisfy the funding standard in the future and by how much.  In addition it is not possible to ascertain the likelihood of sponsoring employers changing their support for their schemes as this is likely to be driven by a combination of financial issues, investment decisions and industrial relations matters.  </p>  <p>  Notice periods for the termination of employer contributions are normally set out in trust deeds and rules vary from scheme to scheme.  Head 12 of the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill obliges employers sponsoring DB schemes to give 12 months&rsquo; notice of their intention to cease contributions, irrespective of those scheme rules.  </p>  <p>  It should be emphasised that these provision do not result in an increase in the rate of contributions payable by an employer but merely stipulates that the employer contributions must continue for a period of 12 months from the date of notice.</p>  <p>  Where an employer proposes to cease making contributions to a DB scheme an alternative pension arrangement is usually put in place, such as a DC scheme.  Any alternative pension arrangements will also result in employer costs.  Accordingly, any contributions arising in respect of the 12 month notice period, in excess of the notice period already set out in the scheme rules, must take account of the costs of any alternative pension arrangements that would have been put in place.</p>  <p>  The serving of notice to cease contributions is, in the ordinary course, a precursor to winding up the scheme.  Given that any such action will have a fundamental impact on the members&rsquo; benefits the purpose of the introduction of a notice period is to give employees and trustees sufficient notification of this event.  </p>  <p>  Head 13 of the Bill enables the Pensions Authority to determine a funding obligation that will restore DB pension schemes, which do not satisfy the funding standard or funding standard reserve, to an adequate funding position, in circumstances where a funding proposal has not been agreed.</p>  <p>  The funding standard defines the basis on which the liabilities of DB schemes must be calculated.  The funding standard provides a benchmark against which the &lsquo;health&rsquo; of a scheme can be tested.  Where a scheme fails the funding standard it means that unless some action is taken the scheme will not be in position to pay the benefits promised.  A funding proposal, which must be approved by the Pensions Authority, should be designed to ensure that the scheme will have sufficient assets to meet its liabilities within an acceptable period.  </p>  <p>  It should be noted that Head 13 does not fundamentally change the current voluntary system underpinning DB schemes to a mandatory one where the obligation to fund all, or most, of a deficit arising in a scheme would rest solely with the employer.  The existing mechanisms/processes provided for in the Pensions Act such as the development of a funding proposal, remain in place.  It is only where this process is not successful in supporting a scheme that the new provisions will apply.  The provisions are designed to encourage engagement between employers and trustees in a defined timeline to put in place measures to address a funding deficit.  </p>  <p>  According to the latest available returns made to the Pensions Authority, approximately 70% of the 677 DB schemes operating as of 31st December 2016 are satisfying the funding standard.  Of the schemes that do not meet the funding standard, almost all have funding proposals in place to address funding shortfalls.  Of the 677 schemes 22 are currently in wind-up. </p>  <p>  Head 13 will not result in any additional costs on employers who remain committed to fulfilling their obligation to their DB scheme.  Accordingly, the provision will not result in any additional costs to the sponsoring employers of the 70% of schemes currently meeting the standard or to employers of those schemes which do not meet the funding standard but where a funding proposal is in place.</p>  <p>  The provisions seek a middle road between the current position where employers can abandon DB schemes and full and immediate debt on employer provisions. They are to ensure the sustainability of DB schemes for scheme members and continued trust in the pensions system as a whole.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

I am anxious to do this as soon as possible given the benefits of the PSC-FT to both the customers and travel operators.  I will not withdraw the use of the old type pass, however, until I am satisfied that all those customers, having regard to their particular circumstances, have had reasonable opportunities and accommodations made available to them to enable them to register for the PSC-FT and to continue to avail of their free travel entitlement. </p>  <p>  To date some 2.63 million Public Services Cards (PSC) have been issued and over 80% of customers with a free travel entitlement have been issued with the PSC-FT.  Customers not yet registered for the PSC-FT can continue to use the old form of paper free travel pass as it continues to be valid for use with transport operators who are participating in the free travel scheme.  </p>  <p>  Registration for the PSC usually involves in-person attendance at an office of the Department.  PSC registration stations are in place at over 100 locations nationally.  Appointments for registration can be made online, by phone or by simply dropping in.  The registration process takes about 15 minutes once all relevant documents are presented.  </p>  <p>  Where customers are unable to attend in person, other options for registration are available. Selected cohorts have been invited to avail of postal registration including utilisation, with consent, of information already provided to other Government agencies, for example, a photograph supplied in connection with an application for a passport or driving licence. To date, 323,000 people offered this opportunity have been registered via this postal registration process. </p>  <p>  In addition, a further 56,000 free travel customers responded recently to a targeted communication from my Department about their particular requirements to complete registration for the PSC-FT.  Registration of these customers is now being progressed.  Additionally, a mobile registration facility is being rolled out to register customers who face substantial challenges in presenting at a Department location.  Group registration at community venues is the preferred mode of utilising these mobile registration facilities but in very exceptional circumstances, single individuals may be registered at their place of residence. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

In response to this request, the NDFEM Board has confirmed to me that the recent report of the Directorate&rsquo;s External Validation group found that the public are well served by the developed arrangements in place for fire services in Ireland, and concluded that the available evidence provides for confidence regarding the capability of fire services to respond to emergencies.</p>  <p>  Each local authority has been requested, as a matter of urgency, to review their multi-storey social housing units to ensure that all early warning systems, including alarm and detection systems and means of escape including corridors, stairways and emergency exits are fully functional and in place.

Volume 1 is being prepared for public consultation. </p>  <p>  TGD B provides guidance on external wall construction in relation to internal and external fire spread, and also refers to other publications for further advice. </p>  <p>  Under Part D of the building regulations, Materials and Workmanship, there is an overarching requirement that all works should be carried out using &ldquo;proper materials&hellip;which are fit for the use for which they are intended and for the conditions in which they are to be used&rdquo; to ensure compliance with the regulatory requirements as prescribed.</p>  <p>  Where innovative products are used, third party certification, such as Agr&eacute;ment Certification is a means of demonstrating how products or systems can meet the requirements of the building regulations, including Part B.  Care should be taken to read the terms and conditions of such certification and ensure that the content of the certification is strictly adhered to during construction, in conjunction with the Fire Safety Certificate where relevant.</p>  <p>  While it has yet to be definitively confirmed what type of cladding was used in the renovation of Grenfell Tower, the United Kingdom Department of Communities and Local Government has confirmed that Cladding using a composite aluminium panel with a polyethylene core would be non-compliant with current Building Regulations guidance as this material should not be used as cladding on buildings over 18m in height.  I can confirm that the same restrictions apply under Irish Building Regulations. </p>  <p>  Currently, the Building Regulations do not require provision of sprinklers in all residential and commercial buildings.  Provision of sprinklers may arise as a requirement where certain design features are included in buildings, such as phased evacuation in some high rise buildings with floors over 30m above ground level, or as an optional additional feature to facilitate certain building configurations.  It is important to note that the building regulations place particular emphasis on adequate means of escape in the case of fire.</p>  <p>  The purpose of the Building Control Management System (BCMS) is to facilitate building control authorities, building owners, builders and construction professionals in discharging their separate responsibilities under the Building Control Act 1990.  The system provides a common platform for clear and consistent administration of building control matters across the local authority sector through facilitating the receipt and lodgement of commencement notices, statutory certificates and compliance documentation in line with the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations.</p></reply>

A landlord is only allowed to enter the property with the tenant&rsquo;s permission or in an emergency. The tenant should agree with the landlord a mutually convenient time to facilitate these viewings so as to minimise disruption.  The Residential Tenancies Board provides a telephone-based mediation service which might be useful, if agreement on such matters between landlord and tenant proves difficult.</p></reply>

Proposals for individual solar farm developments are subject to the statutory requirements of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, in the same manner as other proposed developments. Planning applications are made to the relevant local planning authority with a right of appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</p>  <p>  Under the Planning and Development Act, each planning authority's development plan must set out an overall strategy for the proper planning and sustainable development of the area concerned. Section 10 of the Act requires a development plan to include, inter alia, objectives for the provision or facilitation of the provision of infrastructure, including energy facilities, and many local authorities have developed renewable energy strategies for their areas in this context.</p>  <p>  In making decisions on planning applications, planning authorities and the Board must consider the proper planning and sustainable development of the area, having regard to the provisions of the local development plan, any submissions or observations received and relevant Ministerial or Government policies, including any relevant guidelines issued by my Department. Planning authorities must then make their own decisions based on the specific merits or otherwise of individual planning applications.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the planning code is sufficiently robust to facilitate the assessment of individual planning permission applications for solar farm developments. However, the matter will be kept under review, in consultation with my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and the Environment, and his Department - which leads on renewable energy policy - in the context of the Government's White Paper on Energy Policy, published in December 2015, the development of a Renewable Electricity Policy and Development Framework, as well as the finalisation of a new support scheme for renewable electricity by that Department, expected in late 2017.</p></reply>
