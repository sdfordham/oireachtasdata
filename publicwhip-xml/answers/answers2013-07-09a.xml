    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-07-09a.10.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013070900058#WRA00700"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 64 and 96 together.</p><p> Child benefit is a universal payment that assists parents with the cost of raising children and contributes towards alleviating child poverty.  The estimated expenditure on child benefit in 2013 is around &euro;1.9 billion and it is currently paid to around 613,000 families in respect of some 1.17 million children.  The Government is conscious that child benefit, as a universal payment, is an important source of income for all families.  Since becoming Minister for Social Protection, I have strongly defended the universality of child benefit because the State values every child and supports families.  The fact that every family receives child benefit, regardless of their employment status, also ensures that there is not a disincentive to work.  Any changes to the child benefit payment rate will be a matter for Government, to be considered as part of the annual budget and estimates process and I am not in a position to comment further at this time.</p><p>  In addition to child benefit, the social protection system also provides assistance to low income families with children through the payment of qualified child increases on primary social welfare payments and through the family income supplement payment.  Both of these provide a level of assistance which is directly or indirectly linked with a household&rsquo;s income situation.  In the interest of achieving a better design of the overall system of child income supports, I established an Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare, which has been tasked with recommending cost-effective solutions as to how employment disincentives can be improved and better poverty outcomes achieved, particularly child poverty outcomes.</p><p>  The Advisory Group prioritised the area of family and child income supports and its report on this issue was published in February.  It is the Government&rsquo;s intention that the report will now contribute to the policy debate.  Given the range of complex issues involved, including fiscal, operational and legal considerations, as well as the implications for reforms in terms of child poverty and employment incentive outcomes, the Government has made no decision at this time on the core recommendations of the report.  In considering the proposals to reform the structure of child and family income support payments, Government will also take into account further work by the Advisory Group on the issue of social protection and taxation supports for working age persons and more general developments in the budgetary and fiscal situation.</p></reply>

It also outlines the numbers referred to An Garda Sioch&aacute;na for consideration of prosecution under criminal justice legislation.</p><p><table><tr><th>Cases referred for Legal Proceedings</th><th>2008</th><th>2009</th><th>2010</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th></tr><tr><td>Criminal Cases</td><td>354</td><td>301</td><td>209</td><td>207</td><td>158</td></tr><tr><td>Cases referred to Garda&iacute;</td><td>26</td><td>42</td><td>132</td><td>174</td><td>84</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>380</td><td>343</td><td>341</td><td>381</td><td>242</td></tr></table></p><p>Criminal prosecutions are taken against persons who defraud the social welfare system and employers who fail to carry out their statutory obligations.  They are taken either by summary proceedings in the District Court or indictment proceedings in the Circuit Court.  In addition, in cases where serious cases of identity fraud or multiple claiming occur, these are generally referred to the Garda&iacute; for prosecution under criminal justice legislation.  The legal costs are not borne by this Department and, therefore, that information is not readily available.</p><p>The Department ensures that cases that merit prosecution are forwarded for consideration of legal proceedings and that all necessary evidential proofs are available.  In considering cases of social welfare fraud for legal proceedings, the Department applies defined and recognised best practice standards.  While criminal prosecutions are taken with a view to securing a conviction for the offences, the recovery of the overpayment in these cases is a separate issue.  However, the monies that are recovered in cases prosecuted are not tracked individually.  A social welfare overpayment will remain on a person&rsquo;s record until fully recovered. This will result in a reduction of all future entitlements up to and including pension. Following the death of a customer owing a debt to the Department, the Department will have a claim on any estate remaining.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-07-09a.22.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013070900058#WRA01500"><p>Under the Unfair Dismissals Acts 1977 to 2007 a person may take a case to the Rights Commissioner Service or to the Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT) if they feel they have been unfairly dismissed from employment. Where the case is upheld an award may be made against the employer in accordance with the penalties set out in that legislation.  The unfair dismissals legislation falls under the remit of my colleague the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation. However, I understand it provides for social welfare payments received after their dismissal to be disregarded in calculating the person&rsquo;s financial loss.  Therefore, the person is not penalised for having been in receipt of a social welfare payment following their dismissal.  The purpose of the insolvency payments scheme is to protect certain outstanding pay-related entitlements due to employees where their employer is insolvent in line with the legislation governing the scheme. These include wages, holiday pay, and various statutory awards made by the EAT and the Rights Commissioners, including awards under the unfair dismissals legislation. The Minister becomes a preferential creditor with regard to payments made under the scheme.   </p><p>  Generally, where the employer is continuing to trade, the Department would not be aware, and would have no reason to be aware, that a person had received an award under the Unfair Dismissals Acts. Therefore, it would not be possible for the Department to recoup social welfare payments from the employer. In addition, to do so could be inequitable, it would likely be administratively complex and it may have implications for the unfair dismissals process as a whole. Consideration of such issues would be a matter for my colleague the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation in the first instance.</p></reply>

Sustainable public finances are a prerequisite for future economic stability and growth, as well as being a prerequisite for maintaining and developing our social protection system. The Government&rsquo;s priority is to secure economic recovery, promote growth and employment.  To this end, the State must pursue a determined deficit reduction strategy.  Accordingly, there will be an on-going requirement to curtail expenditure in 2013 and in later years.</p><p>  There are, therefore, considerable challenges ahead including the need to protect, as far as possible, the key income supports and services operated by my Department.  These services and supports impact in some way on the lives of almost every single person in the State.  The scope and scale of this expenditure plays a key role in the wider economy and helps to partially offset the effect of the downturn.</p><p>  In relation to the forthcoming Budget, the Deputy will be aware that the Expenditure Report 2013 published by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform last December provides for additional new expenditure reduction measures of &euro;440 million to be achieved in 2014 in the Department of Social Protection budget.  The Government have not made any decisions in relation to measures to be introduced in Budget 2014.  The Government will finalise its consideration of the Budget in the coming months having regard to all of its commitments, including the commitment in the Programme for Government to maintain welfare rates.  The outcome of this process will be announced on Budget Day.  Any plans to change State pension will be a matter to be decided in a budgetary context and announced on Budget day.</p></reply>

The Government will finalise its consideration of the Budget in the coming months having regard to all of its commitments, including the commitment in the Programme for Government to maintain core welfare rates.  The outcome of this process will be announced on Budget Day.</p><p>  Youth unemployment continues to present a major challenge for Ireland as it does for most Member States. Recognising the urgency required in tackling the challenge of youth joblessness, the EPSCO Council quickly agreed on the Recommendation on a Youth Guarantee in February.  The Government and the Department were at the forefront of securing agreement on the adoption of the EU Council Recommendation on the Youth Guarantee.  The Recommendation is that Member States should: <i>Ensure that all young people under the age of 25 years receive a good-quality offer of employment, continued education, an apprenticeship or a traineeship within a period of four months of becoming unemployed or leaving formal education</i>  .</p><p>  As part of the European Council agreement on the 2014 - 2020 EU Budget in February, it was decided, in association with the agreement on the Youth Guarantee, to provide &euro;6 billion for a new Youth Employment Initiative (YEI) for regions with particularly high levels of youth unemployment. This funding will consist of &euro;3 billion from the European Social Fund and an additional &euro;3 billion from a new Youth Employment budget line.  Proposals supported by the Irish Presidency that payments of the Youth Employment Initiative be front-loaded and all monies provided for this purpose be used in 2014 and 2015 were approved by the European Council last month. In addition, the European Council President, Herman Van Rompuy intimated in the final days of the Irish Presidency that a further &euro;2 billion may be available, arising from proposed changes to the  EU's Multiannual Finance Framework. </p><p>  It is recognised, both in the Youth Guarantee Recommendation itself and more generally, that the pace of implementation must take account of the scale of the youth unemployment and inactivity challenge and consider the fiscal capacity of each Member State. At the same time, Member States should take all possible measures to ensure that the Recommendation is swiftly implemented.  For our own part, the Government will now review the current range of youth employment policies in Ireland to assess what measures will need to be taken to commence the implementation of the Guarantee.  It is intended to produce a concrete plan for the implementation of the Guarantee before the end of 2013. The Government intends to work with all relevant stakeholders to maximise the impact of a Youth Guarantee in Ireland.</p><p>  The scale and nature of any additional measures required for the implementation of a Guarantee at national level will depend on the trend in youth unemployment, and in particular the number of young people likely to experience periods of unemployment of more than four months under current policies.  While recent trends have been positive in this regard, the implementation of a Guarantee will, almost certainly, require an expansion in the range of opportunities currently on offer to young people in the form of further education and training, internships, subsidised private-sector recruitment, and supports for self-employment.  In terms of a starting point to implementation, we sought funding from the European Commission (&euro;250,000) for a proposed pilot Youth Guarantee project in the Ballymun area. I am pleased to say that our submission was one of those approved by the commission for funding and I expect that the Ballymun project will commence later this year.</p></reply>

It was introduced in 1999 to replace &lsquo;Smallholders Unemployment Assistance&rsquo; for low income farmers, without the requirement to be available for and genuinely seeking work.  Farm assist recipients retain all the advantages of the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance scheme such as retention of secondary benefits and access to activation programmes.  Farm assist is a flexible payment and any farmer experiencing lower levels of income or cash-flow issues can ask his/her local social welfare/Intreo office to examine the level of means applying to his/her claim.</p><p>  The assessment of means for the purpose of qualifying for farm assist is designed to reflect the actual net income and looks at gross income, less any expenses necessarily incurred, from farming.  Income and expenditure figures for the preceding year are generally used as an indicator of the expected position in the following year.  However, account is taken of any exceptional circumstances so as to ensure that the assessment accurately reflects the current situation.  In the case of new entrants or persons changing from one type of farming to another the assessment looks at all expected annual income and is based on normal output and costs appropriate to normal stock levels, capacity, and market trends.</p><p>  I met with a delegation from the Irish Farmers Association in May 2013 to discuss a range of issues, including difficulties arising as a result of fodder shortages and the operation of the farm assist scheme generally.  Subsequent to that meeting my officials have held further discussions with the Irish Farmers Association and the operation of the scheme is under on-going consideration.  Any changes to the scheme would be a matter for Government to consider in a budgetary context.</p></reply>

This funding will consist of &euro;3 billion from the European Social Fund and an additional &euro;3 billion from a new Youth Employment budget line. Proposals supported by the Irish Presidency that payments of the Youth Employment Initiative be front-loaded and all monies provided for this purpose be used in 2014 and 2015 were approved by the European Council last month. In addition, the European Council President, Herman Van Rompuy intimated in the final days of the Irish Presidency that a further &euro;2 billion may be available, arising from proposed changes to the EU&rsquo;s Multiannual Finance Framework.</p><p>  It is recognised, both in the Youth Guarantee Recommendation itself and more generally, that the pace of implementation must take account of the scale of the youth unemployment and inactivity challenge and consider the fiscal capacity of each Member State. At the same time, Member States should take all possible measures to ensure that the Recommendation is swiftly implemented.  For our own part, the Government will now review the current range of youth employment policies in Ireland to assess what measures will need to be taken to commence the implementation of the Guarantee.  It is intended to produce a concrete plan for the implementation of the Guarantee before the end of 2013. The Government intends to work with all relevant stakeholders to maximise the impact of a Youth Guarantee in Ireland.</p><p>  The scale and nature of any additional measures required for the implementation of a Guarantee at national level will depend on the trend in youth unemployment, and in particular the number of young people likely to experience periods of unemployment of more than four months under current policies.  While recent trends have been positive in this regard, the implementation of a Guarantee will, almost certainly, require an expansion in the range of opportunities currently on offer to young people in the form of further education and training, internships, subsidised private-sector recruitment, and supports for self-employment.</p><p>  Development of an implementation plan will include identification of the costs of implementation, and how it is envisaged that these will be met, how much can be provided from domestic sources, and what is the likely requirement from EU funds, e.g. ESF and YEI.  The amount that would be required for Ireland will only become clear when the implementation plans are drawn up. The precise amount that will be available to Ireland from the EU funds is also as yet unclear.  Hence, it is not currently possible to comment on the adequacy or otherwise of the funding that will be available.  In terms of a starting point to implementation, we sought funding from the European Commission (&euro;250,000) for a proposed pilot Youth Guarantee project in the Ballymun area. I am pleased to say that our submission was one of those approved by the commission for funding and I expect that the Ballymun project will commence later this year.</p></reply>

The Funding Standard had been in abeyance following the financial downturn in 2008, until June 2012.  Many administrative and legislative measures were introduced during that period to assist the sustainability of defined benefit pension schemes.</p><p>  The majority of  schemes either already have a current actuarial funding certificate with the Pensions Board, in which case they do not have to submit a funding proposal, or they have submitted funding proposals.  Of those have not met the deadline of 30 June, a number have been in contact with the Pensions Board with a view to submitting proposals very shortly.  The Board will, in the coming days, be formally contacting schemes that have not submitted plans to ascertain their particular circumstances. The Board will decide what steps to take, scheme by scheme, on a measured basis and taking account of the individual scheme circumstances.  However, it must be emphasised that trustees must meet their legal obligations, and ultimately the Pensions Board will use its regulatory powers where benefit underfunding is not properly addressed.</p></reply>

All primary application forms are designed to facilitate the use of scanning and automated processing.  This ensures that the application is processed as efficiently as possible and that customers receive their entitlement in a timely manner.  Primary application forms are regularly reviewed, including those parts of forms that relate to the provision of medical evidence, to ensure they request only the information required to establish the customer&rsquo;s entitlement, in a clear and easy to understand manner.  A key aspect of this review is customer feedback and a number of channels are used for this including consultative fora, customer panels and a formal complaints process.</p><p>  In support of their application for medical based schemes, customers are advised to submit all medical evidence they have in support of their claim.  The disability and illness related schemes require that all available medical evidence is assessed by the Department&rsquo;s Medical Assessors (MAs) and this, together with other qualifying criteria such as means testing, qualifying contributions, etc. are taken into account in assessing claims. In addition to application forms which are completed by trained medical professionals (GPs), all applicants are encouraged to provide as much additional information in support of their case as they wish, in the form of additional papers, medical reports, test results, scans, X-rays, etc.  All medical evidence submitted is considered by the Department&rsquo;s MAs as part of their assessment.</p><p>  I am satisfied that the initiatives underway in the Department, the improvements in processes and procedures supported by the redesign of application forms, and the Department&rsquo;s use of modern technology will continue to deliver an improved and efficient service to customers.  Any specific suggestions to improve forms would be welcomed and considered in future subsequent design reviews.</p></reply>

Preparations are underway in Ballyfermot and Bishop's Square and it is expected that these offices will be completed by the end 2013 and during 2014 respectively.</p><p>  The Department expects to relinquish the lease of the Thomas Street premises and earlier this year the Office of Public Works sought expressions of interest from landlords and their agents for a new premises to service the customers of that office.  A number of options have been explored and negotiations have commenced.  Given that this is new accommodation and given the scale of the project it is expected to be delivered in 2014.   With regard to the rollout of Intreo offices I can advise the Deputy that the first twelve Intreo offices are now live and it is intended to convert a further 31 offices to full Intreo working by the end of this year and to complete the full roll-out to all 63 offices of the Department in 2014.  It is to be noted that key elements of the Intreo model are being rolled-out in advance of the physical modification of offices. Personal profiling is already in place in all offices while individual progression planning and the accelerated integrated decision process will be operational in all offices by the end of this year. </p><p>  The Intreo roll-out is being supported by a training and development plan for all offices to equip staff and management to deliver this new service.  The Department's centralised training section, Staff Development Unit, works in partnership with a dedicated Intreo Project Team and local management to address identified training needs for each Office in preparation for the provision of the new service to customers. All of the training is being developed and delivered by in-house training resources and, to date, there has been no expenditure on external providers for Intreo-related training.  Where additional training is required following the introduction of the new service, this is provided on an on-going basis.</p><p>  Management and staff are receiving training in a range of areas including decision-making, the habitual residence condition, community welfare service awareness, customer service, change management, non-violent crisis intervention, presentation skills and internal IT systems training.  These training programmes range from one half-day session to two weeks in duration.  Former F&Aacute;S employment service officers, who joined the Department in January 2012, undertook Adult Guidance and Education training at NUI Maynooth as part of their role-specific development. They continue to use these skills in their daily interaction with customers regarding activation into employment or education. </p><p>  The Department is currently developing a training course for newly-appointed case officers to equip them with the skills necessary to operate in this new role and this may include an external training element.  In addition, the Department is beginning a process to review and redesign its functional training programmes, focusing on the business skills required for key frontline roles in the organisation, with a view to preparing these programmes for future accreditation. A Request For Tender will issue in this regard later this year.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-07-09a.60.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013070900058#WRA04200"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 80, 100 and 108 together.</p><p>There are currently 83,210 people who receive the one-parent family payment (OFP).  The cost of the OFP scheme was &euro;1.06 billion in 2012 and is estimated to be &euro;935 million in 2013.  In 2013, on foot of the OFP reforms which came into effect on 4 July, it is expected that up to 9,300 recipients will leave the OFP scheme. Up to 8,000 of these will lose entitlement this month.  These numbers reflect the maximum number of cases who may lose entitlement in 2013.  This reform is expected to yield estimated savings of &euro;3.94m in 2013.</p><p>The reforms to the OFP scheme are predicated on activation and on getting customers who may have experienced recurring poverty and social exclusion traps back into the workforce once their children have reached an appropriate age.  The Survey on Income and Living Conditions (SILC) figures published by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) in February, 2013, show that, in 2011, 16.4% of lone parents in Ireland were experiencing &lsquo;consistent poverty&rsquo; &ndash; compared to 6.9% of the population as a whole.  In order to address these issues, I am introducing reforms to the OFP scheme that aim to ensure better long-term outcomes for lone parents and their families.</p><p>It is expected that the majority of those who will lose their entitlement to the OFP payment will apply for the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance (JA) scheme.  Lone parents who apply for JA and whose youngest child is under 14 years of age can avail of the new JA transition arrangement.  The JA transition arrangement is provided for in the Social Welfare and Pensions (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2013 and is a specific measure for lone parents transitioning from OFP to JA, whose youngest child is under 14 years of age. Customers who avail of this arrangement will be exempt from the JA conditionality that requires them to be available for, and genuinely seeking, full-time work.  They will also be exempt from having to prove unemployment and be able to work part-time without restrictions and still receive the JA payment &ndash; subject to a means test.</p><p>The JA transition arrangement recognises the difficulty of parenting alone and will ease the transition of former OFP recipients with children of primary school age onto the JA scheme.  Without it, it is likely that many former OFP recipients would not have qualified for the JA payment as their caring responsibilities may have prevented them from being available for, and genuinely seeking, full-time work.  Significantly, the JA transition arrangement will still require that this group of customers fully engage with my Department&rsquo;s full activation process. This is the same requirement that applies to all other jobseekers.</p><p>The OFP reforms are designed to provide the necessary supports to enable lone parents improve their skills and enhance their prospects of progressing into employment. As part of this process lone parents who transition to the jobseeker schemes will have access to the full range of supports and services provided under my Department&rsquo;s activation service.</p><p>The following table outlines the savings, as announced, for budget measures that affected OFP recipients only in Budgets 2011, 2012 and 2013.</p><p><table><tr><th>Year</th><th><div>Measures</div></th><th><div>Savings</div></th></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td><div>Reduction in the weekly rates of payment on OFP of &euro;8 to &euro;188 per week</div></td><td><div>&euro;38.56m</div></td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td><div>Reduction in the age of the youngest child for payment of OFP, reduction in the earnings dis-regard and cessation of the 6 month transitional payment on OFP</div></td><td><div>&euro;15.3m</div></td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td><div>Continued implementation of the 2012 reforms.</div></td><td><div>&euro;36.97m</div></td></tr></table></p><p>OFP recipients may have been affected by other budget measures in the last three years that also affected other social welfare recipients such as changes to the child benefit scheme, fuel allowance etc.  These savings are not included in the above table.</p></reply>

It is recognised, both in the Youth Guarantee Recommendation itself and more generally, that the pace of implementation must take account of the scale of the youth unemployment and inactivity challenge and consider the fiscal capacity of each Member State.  At the same time, Member States should take all possible measures to ensure that the Recommendation is swiftly implemented. For our own part, the Government will now review the current range of youth employment policies in Ireland to assess what measures will need to be taken to commence the implementation of the Guarantee.  It is intended to produce a concrete plan for the implementation of the Guarantee before the end of 2013.</p><p>  The Government intends to work with all relevant stakeholders to maximise the impact of a Youth Guarantee in Ireland.   The scale and nature of any additional measures required for the implementation of a Guarantee at national level will depend on the trend in youth unemployment, and in particular the number of young people likely to experience periods of unemployment of more than four months under current policies.  Development of an implementation plan will include identification of the costs of implementation, and how it is envisaged that these will be met - how much can be provided from domestic sources, and what is the likely requirement from EU funds, e.g. ESF and YEI.  The amount that would be required for Ireland will only become clear when the implementation plans are drawn up. </p><p>  As part of the European Council agreement on the 2014 &ndash; 2020 EU Budget in February, it was decided, in association with the agreement on the Youth Guarantee, to provide &euro;6 billion for a new Youth Employment Initiative (YEI) for regions with particularly high levels of youth unemployment.  This funding will consist of &euro;3 billion from the European Social Fund and an additional &euro;3 billion from a new Youth Employment budget line. </p><p>  Proposals supported by the Irish Presidency that payments of the Youth Employment Initiative be front-loaded and all monies provided for this purpose be used in 2014 and 2015 were approved by the European Council last month.  In addition, the European Council President, Herman Van Rompuy intimated in the final days of the Irish Presidency that a further &euro;2 billion may be available, arising from proposed changes to the EU&rsquo;s Multiannual Finance Framework.  The precise amount that will be available to Ireland from the EU funds is also as yet unclear.  Until clarity is provided on this issue, the finalisation of any implementation plan will not be possible.</p><p>  In terms of a starting point to implementation, we sought funding from the European Commission (&euro;250,000) for a proposed pilot Youth Guarantee project in the Ballymun area.  I am pleased to say that our submission was one of those approved by the commission for funding and I expect that the Ballymun project will commence later this year.</p></reply>

An Attachment of Earnings Order can be sought if the person is in employment, on social welfare or in receipt of a private pension, resulting in the maintenance being deducted at source.  Under the Family Law Act 1995, it is possible to apply for this attachment at the initial maintenance hearing, if the person applying to court fears that there will be a default of maintenance.

Arising from this evaluation, the Cabinet Committee on Pathways to Work approved in principle a proposal to tender for the provision of employment services and agreed to the issue Prior Information Notice (PIN),  which was published on 28 June.  This notice formally notifies the market that the State intends to procure employment services.  A PIN is a discretionary and exploratory first step in a procurement process.  The publication of a PIN will enable the State to engage with potential vendors and other interested parties to gauge the level of market interest and will assist in finalising tender/contract design.  A final decision on whether or not to proceed to full tender, and if so in what form, will be made once this engagement process is completed.   It is important to note that our intention in exploring this option is not to displace existing resources within the Department and the LES but to contract with other parties so as to complement and work alongside these resources and thereby increase our capacity to serve unemployed people.</p></reply>

Up to 2009, the average number of appeals received was 15,000 per annum whereas in 2012, the office received 35,484 appeals.  </p><p>  In order to manage this increasing workload, significant resources and efforts have been put into reducing backlogs and improving appeals processing times for appellants, including the assignment of 15 additional Appeals Officers, in addition to 10 former Community Welfare Service Appeals Officers who joined the appeals office in 2011, bringing the total number of serving Appeals Officers to 41; reviewing and improving business processes; and implementing a new operating model within the appeals office. </p><p>  In addition, a major programme of process redesign and modernisation is currently underway in the Department in relation to many of its scheme areas, aimed at reducing backlogs and reducing the time taken by the Department to respond to requests from the appeals office for submissions in relation to appeals.</p><p>  These measures have led to improvements in processing times and a significant increase in the number of appeals finalised from 17,787 in 2009 to 32,558 in 2012.  The Chief Appeals Officer expects to finalise 6,000 more cases in 2013 than in 2012.  Good progress is also now being made in reducing the number of appeals on hand from 20,414 at 1 January 2013 to 16,542 at 1 July 2013.  </p><p>  The average waiting time for appeals peaked in 2011 when the average time for an oral hearing was 52.5 weeks and for a summary decision was 25.1 weeks.  In 2012 these times improved by 10.3 weeks when the average time for an oral hearing dropped to 39.5 weeks while the time for a summary decision increased slightly to 27.8 weeks.  This improvement has continued with the average processing time up to June 2013 reducing to 36.2 weeks for an oral hearing and 27.6 weeks for a summary decision.</p><p>  These processing times are calculated from the registration date of the appeal to the date of its finalisation.  They include all activities during this period including time spent awaiting any clarification from the appellant, time in the Department for comments by the Deciding Officer on the grounds of appeal put forward by the appellant, and any further investigation, examination or assessment by the Department&rsquo;s Inspectors and Medical Assessors that is deemed necessary.  For example in cases of schemes which include medical criteria such as disability allowance or invalidity pension, the time taken by the Department may include a review by a different medical assessor to the one who initially examined the case, and there may even be a third review by a medical assessor where additional medical evidence is submitted.  A considerable period of time is also added when an oral hearing is required because of the logistics involved in this process.  While this process carries an inherent delay in terms of finalising an appeal, it also crystallises the flexibility and accessibility of the appeals system.</p><p>  By its nature and because it is a quasi-judicial function, the processing of appeals takes time and reflects the fact that, by definition, the appeal process cannot be a quick one.  However, if  an appellant&rsquo;s means are insufficient to meet their needs, it is open to them to contact their local Community Welfare Services concerning their eligibility for Supplementary Welfare Allowance while their appeal is pending.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-07-09a.87.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013070900059#WRB01500"><p>The definition of unemployment used in the above-mentioned survey is self-defined unemployment as opposed to the stricter definition used by the ILO.  This can mean that people who are not working but who are also unavailable for work such as students and carers may be classified as unemployed in such a survey.  The methods used in the survey can also be questioned (e.g. door-to-door surveys can capture less employed people as they are more likely to be out at work). While recent Live Register figures show that there has been a 4.8% decrease in the numbers signing on in Ballyfermot in the past twelve months (and a fall of 11.3% in the number of young people signing on), the Government recognises that unemployment black spots exist in specific areas across the country and need to be addressed.</p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s approach to tackling the unemployment problem is to focus resources on those individuals most at risk of long-term unemployment.  Up to the recent past, this has been based on identifying all persons who remain on the Live Register for three months after first signing on, and referring them for more intensive job-search assistance and guidance.  Increasingly, referral is now based on profiling people at the beginning of a spell of unemployment, so as to focus resources on those most in need at an even earlier stage.  By definition, such an approach focuses resources on those areas where unemployment is highest and of longest duration.  The roll-out of the profiling system at my Department&rsquo;s &lsquo;one-stop-shop&rsquo; Intreo offices will further enhance this effect as one of the main variables in the profiling system is geographical location.  In other words, if someone comes from an area of high unemployment, s/he will, all other things being equal, receive more targeted assistance.</p><p>  In addition, the geographical distribution of places on employment programmes such as CE and T&uacute;s &amp;amp; training programmes has been highly correlated with unemployment rates for each region.  Within the T&uacute;s programme there is a specific area-based approach to the allocation of places.  The 5,000 places on the scheme are allocated to community and voluntary organisations involved in the delivery of local services in urban and rural areas.  The allocation is based on the numbers of eligible unemployed people in each local development company or &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta area.  </p><p>  Other than through administrative mechanisms like those described, it is difficult to identify and target specific unemployment black spots at a very local level.  The most frequent unemployment data come from the Quarterly National Household Survey (QNHS); as a sample survey, the QNHS provides reliable data at a regional, but not at a local level.  Small-area statistics are collected in the Census, but these are available only at five-year intervals, and the unemployment concept underlying them does not correspond exactly with that used in the QNHS.  </p><p>  However, the Government&rsquo;s policy of targeting resources at those most at risk of long-term unemployment overcomes this statistical deficit and ensures those areas that are most in need of assistance are prioritised.  The Department works primarily at a local level and is acutely aware of the differentiated impact of unemployment across local areas.  The Department has 59 Intreo/local offices, 63 branch offices and newly incorporated employment offices.  The Live Register figures by office are closely monitored and are an important consideration for the provision of our activation services.</p></reply>

In order to ensure adequate controls of the scheme expenditure, the continuing eligibility of persons in receipt of IP is reviewed periodically in accordance with their assessed risk of a change in circumstances. During 2012, there was a backlog of new invalidity pension claims which meant that there was an unacceptable delay in processing of new claims.  Following a major service delivery modernisation project and business process improvement in the scheme area, the backlog of claims was cleared and new invalidity pension claims are now actioned upon receipt.</p><p>  Following a review of an initial decision to disallow on medical grounds, the person concerned was awarded invalidity pension on the 14th March 2013 and the award was backdated to the 29th April 2011 - the date of her initial application and any arrears due for that period were paid.  On 4 June 2013, a review of the continuing medical eligibility of the person concerned was initiated based upon the effective start date of her claim i.e. April 2011. This did not take account of the fact that the award date in the case had been so recent.  In the particular circumstances of this case, the continuing eligibility review will be deferred for a reasonable period.  We appreciate that reviews may cause worry or concern to individual customers and apologise if any such concern was caused in this case.  Customers are given a reasonable length of time to provide the information necessary for the review and, if there is any particular difficulty with meeting the time limit, they may request additional time.</p></reply>

I am satisfied that any legislation providing for the recognition of the acquired gender of transgender persons will have to be more comprehensive and detailed than that Bill.   As I have indicated on a number of occasions, I want the legislation that the Department is preparing to be introduced as quickly as possible.  However, the issues involved are complex and have implications for other areas of government.</p><p>  I realise also that this is a very sensitive area for those involved and people are naturally keen that the legislation be brought forward quickly.  I understand that but I also have to have regard to the legal complexities involved in relation to some of the recommendations of the Gender Recognition Advisory Group (GRAG) relating to the marital and civil partnership status of individuals.  The Department has been taking advice on this matter including talking to the various stakeholders involved. I have requested the Oireachtas Committee on Education and Social Protection to consider the provisional draft Heads of Bill and, in that regard, officials from the Department will appear before the Committee in the Autumn.  I feel that the Committee can make a very positive contribution to the preparation of the legislation and I believe that this approach should greatly assist the drafting of the legislation and its progress through the Oireachtas. When the Oireachtas Committee has discussed the provisional draft Heads of Bill, I will be in a better position to give a timeframe for the introduction of the legislation.</p></reply>

The additional placements on community employment, T&uacute;s and JobBridge have already been rolled-out and are in the process of being filled by the sponsoring organisations and implementing bodies.

Local authorities have been asked to complete consultations with staff representative bodies and other key stakeholders to enable the scheme to commence on a staged basis over the coming months.  In addition to the above local authorities six to eight city and county councils intend to commence operations with a view to adding 500-800 placements by end October 2013.

The term 'habitually resident' conveys a degree of permanence and implies a close association between the applicant and the country from which payment is claimed, which relies heavily on fact.  The habitual residence guidelines were comprehensively revised in 2011 to take account of developments in case-law, both national and international, and to reflect the Department's interpretation of the legal provisions that impact on the habitual residence condition (HRC). </p><p>  The guidelines are reviewed and revised on an ongoing basis to reflect changes in the conditions and processes as they occur, for example, the removal of the work permit condition for Romanian and Bulgarian nationals and very recently the accession of Croatia to the EU.   The guidelines are published and available to customers on the Department's website to reflect the most up to date requirements.</p><p>  In addition to the HRC guidelines there is further information for customers including:</p><p> - HRC information leaflet SW108 available on the website</p><p> - A HRC supplement with example cases published on the website.</p><p>  Internally within DSP the Decisions Advisory Office unit provides guidance and support in complex cases and the staff development unit of DSP provides on-going HRC training.</p><p>  There is comprehensive information on the HRC guidelines relating to material to be provided by returning Irish emigrants.  Before a decision can be made regarding a person's habitual residence, it must be established whether the person has a legal right to reside in the State and all Irish nationals have a right of residence in Ireland.  At that stage the five factors are examined to determine whether a person satisfies the HRC i.e. a) the length and continuity of living in Ireland, b) length and reasons for any absence, c) nature and pattern of the person's employment, d) person's main centre of interest and e) future intentions of the person applying for the social welfare scheme.</p><p>  Each case is dealt with in its own right and a decision is based on the application of the legislation and guidelines to the particular circumstances of the case.  Examples of documentation required is outlined on the HRC guideline, on the HRC information leaflet and on the Citizens Information website, including:</p><p>-   Proof to show applicant has given up accommodation abroad </p><p>-   Proof applicant has cancelled or applied to cancel any non-transferable benefits </p><p>-   Proof to show measures put in place to open a bank account here </p><p>-   Proof to show applicant has a tenancy in Ireland </p><p>-   Proof of travel documents and evidence of transportation of personal possessions etc. </p><p>  Any information that customers provide to establish their claim will be considered and it may be necessary in some cases to submit further documentary evidence in support of a claim.  The average time frame for the verification of habitual residency for applicants for social welfare is not captured as the HRC is examined as part of the overall claim process.  It is important to point out that if claimants are not satisfied with a decision they have the right to have the decision reviewed internally in DSP and/or appeal the decision to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.</p></reply>

It was for that reason that the Government last year adopted the National Carers&rsquo; Strategy with a view to giving greater public recognition to carers and their work.  Carers receive significant income supports from the Department of Social Protection so that people can continue living at home as long as possible.  Expenditure on carers has increased significantly in recent years.  In 2013 it is estimated to be &euro;776 million compared with an estimated outturn of &euro;771 million in 2012.  The expenditure on carers in 2012 included: &euro;509 million on carer&rsquo;s allowance; &euro;24 million on carer&rsquo;s benefit; &euro;135 million on the respite care grant; and &euro;103 million on domiciliary care allowance.  Carers also receive a free travel pass at an annual cost of &euro;6 million and carers who reside with the care recipient are eligible for the household benefits package at an annual cost of approximately &euro;30 million. </p><p>  The respite care grant is available to all full-time carers regardless of their means while the income disregard and means test for carers allowance is the most generous in the social welfare system.  Carers are entitled to an extra half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance if they care for more than one person and a respite care grant for each care recipient.  A person in receipt of certain qualifying payments and also providing full-time care and attention to another person may qualify for a half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance while retaining their main social welfare payment.  Regrettably, I am not in a position to reverse last year&rsquo;s cut in the respite care grant.  It should be noted that the supports available to carers in Ireland are among the highest rates of income support in Europe.</p></reply>

The EU Survey on Income and Living Conditions, which is carried out by the Central Statistics Office each year, does however, measure the percentage of the population that said they were unable to afford to keep the home adequately warm, over the previous year.  The most recent figures available from this survey indicate that in 2011, some 6.8% of households in Ireland were unable to afford to keep the home adequately warm, the same level as in 2010 but an increase on the 2009 figure which was 4.1%. The Government has an energy poverty strategy; &lsquo;Warmer Homes &ndash; A Strategy for Affordable Energy in Ireland&rsquo; which was published by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources towards the end of 2011.  The Strategy identified the extent and impact of energy poverty, the existing measures in place and the actions required looking forward.  My Department has been working with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and other stakeholders on the implementation of this Strategy.  Energy poverty is a factor of income, energy prices and the thermal efficiency of the home.  In 2013, my Department will spend an estimated &euro;284 million on the household benefits scheme, providing some 410,000 customers with a package worth almost &euro;700 per year.  In addition, some 410,000 customers will receive the fuel allowance of &euro;20 per week paid for 26 weeks, at a cost of &euro;211 million.</p><p>  Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, exceptional needs payments may be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost which customers are unable to meet out of their own resources; this may include exceptional heating costs.  In addition, more than 3,000 customers are currently in receipt of a special heating supplement, paid to assist people with special heating needs because of ill health or infirmity.  The provision for exceptional needs payments in 2013 is &euro;47.6 million, with an additional &euro;11.4 million for supplements.  The most cost-effective means of protecting households from energy poverty is to improve the thermal efficiency of the home.  The Better Energy Warmer Homes scheme (BEWH), administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI), funds energy efficiency improvements in the homes of the elderly and vulnerable, making the homes more comfortable, healthier and more cost effective to run.</p></reply>

The review was focused primarily on assessing the contribution certain programmes can make to the Department's activation policy stance. Consultation with stakeholders was identified as a key aspect of the Department's review process and consequently a stakeholders' forum was convened in February 2013.  The forum brought relevant experts, practitioners, policy makers and representative bodies together to consider the review and offer suggestions and input to how future policy in this area should evolve.  A report of this forum is also published on the Department's website.</p><p>  The Department now moves to the implementation phase.  All review recommendations and feedback from the stakeholders' forum is being considered.  The review does not include specific recommendations regarding postgraduate courses, including expansion of BTEA to cover additional postgraduate courses in the future.

Payments are based on a range of entitlement conditions and are aimed at serving various social welfare policy requirements.  These payments are of various types: universal payments, means assessed payments, payments based on social insurance contributory history and grants.  Payments can be once-off, based on short term need or of long term duration.  Because of the sheer scale, variety and nature of payments made by the Department, 'deduction at source' arrangements require substantial development of IT systems and business processes and impose a significant additional administrative burden on the Department and on the requesting agency.  Short-term schemes, by their nature, would incur even more administrative overhead on all sides.</p><p>  The Department has undertaken, as a service to a significant number of its clients, to invest the resources needed to provide the facility on the schemes agreed with the Revenue Commissioners.  Any other arrangements required to pay the tax are a matter for the Revenue Commissioners.  The Department is currently engaged in major transformation programmes to meet Government objectives, for example in relation to activation and supporting the provision of integrated income support and activation services through Intreo to clients of working age.  The Department has embarked on a major programme of business and system change to support these objectives and is focussing its development efforts in this regard.</p><p>  The jobseeker's allowance payment is not included in the schemes specified for deduction at source of local property tax, and there is currently no plan to extend the list of schemes from which local property tax can be paid.  However, it is intended to review this position based on the experience of operating the facility over a period of time, and the situation with regard to deduction at source from jobseeker payments will be an aspect of the review.</p></reply>

An Appeals Officer must decide, taking account of all of the evidence presented, including medical evidence, on the impact of a person's illness/disability; on his/her capability for work; on whether a person is substantially restricted within the meaning of the Social Welfare Acts from taking up full time employment; on whether a person requires full time care and attention; or, in the case of Domiciliary Care Allowance, on whether the child being cared for requires significantly more care than other children of the same age.</p><p>  Training is provided on an on-going basis to Appeals Officers on a broad range of issues of relevance to their role.  In this context, case conferences are held regularly, which allow the salient features of particular cases to be presented and discussed by Appeals Officers.  In addition, Appeals Officer conferences, which are convened twice yearly, provide an opportunity to consider broader issues with a view to ensuring consistency in the manner in which appeals are determined.</p></reply>

The main purpose of the scheme is to provide immediate and flexible assistance to persons in need who do not qualify for welfare payments under any other social welfare scheme.  The Government has provided almost &euro;720 million for the various schemes under SWA in 2013.  There are a number of schemes under the SWA heading including basic income support and/or a supplement in respect of certain living expenses a person may not currently be able to meet.  The supplements available include payments to assist with rent, mortgage interest, heating, special dietary requirements, exceptional or urgent needs, and back to school expenses.</p><p>  A total of 453,833 claims for supplementary welfare allowance were registered in 2012.  Statistics are not maintained where the claim was subsequently refused.  During 2012, a total of 4,264 supplementary welfare allowance appeals were decided by the Social Welfare Appeals Office (SWAO).  Of these, 1,017 appeals were allowed, a further 142 were partially allowed and the remaining 3,105 appeals were disallowed in full by the SWAO.  There is no right of appeal to the SWAO in respect of a decision made under the exceptional needs payment.  These cases are reviewed by review officers within the community welfare service.  Statistics are not maintained regarding the number of reviews undertaken or their outcome.</p></reply>

The matter is a complex one.  EU citizens and their families have the right to move and reside freely within the territories of the Member States.  These rights also apply to non-EU national spouses of EU nationals following the ruling of the European Court of Justice in the Metock case on 25th July 2008.</p><p>   My Department has been considering this issue and has met with a number of stakeholders with a view to introducing measures to combat marriages of convenience.  In this regard, I intend to introduce legislation shortly that will make such marriages far more difficult to contract in the future.  The provisions will be part of legislation currently being drafted to amend the Civil Registration Act, 2004. I would hope to publish this legislation later this year.  It should also be noted there are, at present, guidelines for registrars for marriage notifications containing requirements concerning notification procedures, including the verification of identity and marital status which can assist in the prevention of marriages of convenience. </p></reply>

The Youth Guarantee is a major priority of the Department.  Securing EU Council agreement for an EU Recommendation on a Youth Guarantee was one of the priorities of the Irish Presidency and this was secured during my chairing of the Council of European Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs (EPSCO).  While Member States are encouraged to implement the Recommendation as soon as possible, it is recognised that implementation will need to be more gradual in countries with higher levels of youth unemployment and particularly severe budgetary problems. </p><p>  The implementation of a guarantee will, almost certainly, require an expansion in the range of opportunities currently on offer to young people in the form of further education and training, internships, subsidised private-sector recruitment, and supports for self-employment.  The intention is that an implementation plan for the national rollout of the Youth Guarantee will be finalised by the end of the year, and this will set out a timescale for implementation.  By this time, it is hoped that there will also be greater visibility with regard to accessing funding from the EU Youth Employment Initiative.</p><p>  Among the issues that can be addressed in the review and plan will be the role of the various actors involved in delivering employment, education, training and other relevant services to young people.  While there is no explicit reference to the role of youth work in the Youth Guarantee recommendation, I am aware of the need to leverage all resources available.  Indeed, the proposed pilot Youth Guarantee Scheme in Ballymun will involve amongst others, the NYCI.  The Ballymun Pilot, which I am pleased to say has been selected by the European Commission as one of the pilot programmes to receive EU funding, is expected to start by the year-end.  A significant proportion of the target group for the pilot will be young people who have low levels of educational attainment.  It is hoped that there will be early lessons from the Ballymun Project that will guide the nationwide rollout of the YGS, including the possible contribution of the youth sector in supporting long-term unemployed young people with limited qualification.</p></reply>

The Statistics Act, 1993 repealed the 1926 and 1946 Statistics Acts, and provided for the release of census forms from these censuses 100 years after the date of the relevant Census. A such, data from the 1926 Census will be made available in 2026.  A further reduction of the guarantee could be incorrectly interpreted by some as a relaxation by the CSO in its approach to confidentiality and the protection of data supplied to it under the Statistics Act, 1993. </p><p>  Independence, objectivity and the guarantee of confidentiality are the core values of official statistics which have helped create a positive image of, and ensure public trust in, official statistics in Ireland. Statistical confidentiality is the cornerstone of all CSO work.  This is the reason for the legal guarantees contained in the Statistics Act 1993. Any action that could lead to a weakening of that public trust would be detrimental not just to the Census of Population but also to the broader activities of the CSO covering areas such as economic, business and social statistics. </p><p>  In conclusion I am satisfied that the 100 year period provided for in the Statistics Act strikes the right balance between facilitating legitimate historical and genealogical research on the one hand, while protecting the confidentiality of census data and maintaining the integrity of CSO guarantees procedures.</p></reply>

The Government has already introduced a wide range of D&aacute;il reform measures, including:</p><p> -  An increased number of D&aacute;il sitting days</p><p> -  An additional Leaders Questions session on Thursdays;</p><p> -  The introduction of Topical Issues Debates; </p><p> -  Friday sittings to give TDs the opportunity to introduce their own Bills enhancing the TDs legislative role, and</p><p> -  A restructured Oireachtas Committee System.</p><p>  Oireachtas reform has been discussed at the weekly Whips meetings, the D&aacute;il Committee on Procedure &amp;amp; Privileges chaired by the Ceann Comhairle and the D&aacute;il Reform Sub-Committee chaired by the Government Chief Whip. </p><p>  The Whip of the Technical Group attends the Whips meetings on behalf of her colleagues and is a member of both the D&aacute;il Committee on Procedure &amp;amp; Privileges and the D&aacute;il Reform Sub- Committee. The D&aacute;il Reform Sub-Committee has on a number of occasions since March 2011 discussed in detail D&aacute;il Reform proposals submitted by members of the House.  The Government Chief Whip has also met individual Members of the House who have contacted him with D&aacute;il Reform proposals of their own. </p><p>  In 2011 the Government introduced a new Committee system structure along with a package of D&aacute;il reforms designed as the first phase in the process of reforming D&aacute;il procedure. In June 2012 the Oireachtas Committee system was further restructured. In June 2013, with the publication of the Bill to hold a referendum on the abolition of the Seanad, the Government set out a number of D&aacute;il Reforms necessary for the move to a unicameral parliamentary system.</p><p>  The Government Chief Whip, along with D&aacute;il Whips from all the political parties and the Technical Group, the Ceann Comhairle, the Chair of the Working Group of Committee Chairs and officials in Leinster House have been involved in developing the next phase of D&aacute;il and Oireachtas Committee reforms.  The Government Chief Whip proposes to bring forward this phase of D&aacute;il Reforms in the coming months with the new procedures in place later this year.</p><p>  The process of Oireachtas Reform is an ongoing one. Following the introduction of this current phase of D&aacute;il reforms, consultation on further Oireachtas Reforms will take place involving, among others, all the D&aacute;il Whips, including the Technical Group Whip.  Any Member of the House who has D&aacute;il reform proposals can contact the Government Chief Whip directly to discuss those proposals in detail and they will be considered as part of the ongoing process of D&aacute;il reform.</p></reply>

While none of these are any longer truly nomadic, they suffer from the difficulties common to non-settled communities in many developed countries, including in Europe, and other Bedouin living in many Arab countries in the region. These include lack of title to traditionally used lands and resources, pressure from a growing settled community, traditional distrust and disengagement from external official authority, difficulty in operating within a legal system developed for settled communities, lack of understanding and intermittent attention from public authorities, and lack of political weight in decisions which affect them.  These are issues in many countries, not just Israel. It is an exageration to describe these as a policy of ethnic cleansing.</p><p>  We have discussed more general issues relating to Arab citizens of Israel here in the D&aacute;il in recent weeks. In relation to the Bedouin specifically, the most difficult problems relate to some 60,000 who live in as yet unrecognised villages, mostly in the area of and in some cased clustered around the rapidly growing city of Beersheva, one of Israel&rsquo;s major cities and the principal centre for the southern half of the country. </p><p>  While there are genuine planning and development needs in the vicinity of Beersheva, we clearly would expect that these must be addressed as much as possible through consultation, compromise and agreement, using the same standards applied for Israeli citizens generally. There have been a number of official inquiries and plans in recent years to address these issues, usually involving the recognition of some further Bedouin villages, and consolidation of existing unrecognised villages into these. </p><p>  The implementation of these plans has sometimes been piecemeal and non-transparent, and it remains the case that a number of villages have seen repeated demolitions of homes and schools, in a way that I do not think would be considered acceptable in relation to the majority community in Israel. Indeed I cannot help contrasting this with the extreme reluctance of the Israeli Government to act against illegal Israeli settlements even where these have been ordered to be removed by Israeli courts.  Both the EU and Ireland nationally have already raised these concerns with the Israeli authorities, and it will continue to feature in our dialogue about human rights issues in Israel.</p></reply>

The comparatively small amount of settlement products available on the EU market are insignificant in terms of EU trade with Israel, and are not even critical for the viability of the settlements themselves.</p><p>  In relation to settlement products, I have kept the House informed of work under way at EU level to establish EU-wide guidelines on the labelling of settlement products. I have made very clear publicly my negative view of settlements and of the misappropriation of resources which enable the production of some settlement goods. My Department&rsquo;s website already contains advice warning that the purchase of property in Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian Territory or the occupied Golan Heights is subject to risk and that potential purchasers should seek independent legal advice before undertaking such purchases. I have also stated that I believe consumers wish to be able to distinguish settlement goods, and that labelling should not be able to mislead them in this regard. It is my expectation, and my preference, that action on labelling will take place at EU level.  Until that EU discussion is complete, I do not wish to speculate on what further national actions may be desirable or necessary. It is again important to state that the Government does not support, and will not move to achieve, boycotts against goods from Israel.</p><p>  It could also be necessary to take legal advice on any proposal to discriminate officially against goods which, in practical terms, would be bought not directly from settlements but from suppliers established in other EU member States, and goods legally present on the EU market.</p></reply>

I support them in urging the Government of Myanmar/Burma to review and revoke all orders which violate international human rights standards.</p><p>  Myanmar/Burma is currently undergoing a political, economic and social transition in which positive steps are being taken to transform the country and establish the country as a respected member of the international community.  However, together with our international partners, Ireland recognises that complex challenges remain, particularly in regards to the Rohingya minority and other ethnic groups.In January 2013, the Irish Ambassador in Hanoi presented his credentials to become the first Ambassador of Ireland accredited to Myanmar/Burma.  Following accreditation, the Ambassador met with both the President and Foreign Minister of Myanmar/Burma and discussed a range of issues, including the human rights situation in Rakhine State.</p><p>  In March 2013, during a visit to Brussels by the President of Myanmar/Burma U Thein Sein, the EU and Myanmar/Burma agreed, among other things, to work in partnership to promote human rights and the rule of law for all people living in Myanmar/Burma, including the Rohingya community.  At the 23rd session of the UN Human Rights Council (HRC) in May/June of this year, Ireland and our fellow council members adopted a Presidential Statement regarding the Situation of Human Rights for Muslims in Myanmar/Burma.  HRC members, expressed deep concern at the gross violations of human rights against Muslims in Myanmar/Burma, including the Rohingya community, and urged the government there to grant full citizenship rights, to the Rohingya in Rakhine and review the 1982 Citizenship Law.</p><p>  In regards to trade restrictions, on 22  April 2013 Ireland together with our EU partners decided to lift all restrictive measures on Myanmar/Burma, with the exception of the arms embargo and the embargo on equipment which might be used for internal repression.  This decision was taken in light of the political and economic reforms that have been taking place in Myanmar/Burma since 2011.  Also, in June 2013 during Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the EU, the reinstatement of Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) for Myanmar/Burma was secured, and will help promote economic development in the country.  Any move to re-impose sanctions would in my view be counterproductive.</p><p>  Finally, officials from my Department have just returned from a scoping mission to Myanmar/Burma.  They held meetings with a wide range of government, opposition, business and civil society figures, with a view to making recommendations on how Ireland can assist with the humanitarian situation, promote economic development, and increase linkages with Ireland.  I expect to receive recommendations in this regard shortly.</p></reply>

This amounted to an overall figure in excess of 40% less than the cost of the 2004 Presidency.  With some costs still to be determined, it is now clear at this stage that projected Presidency spending will come under the original Presidency budget of &euro;60m. The revised projected Presidency spend is now &euro;51m, a saving of at least &euro;9m.

These comprise &lsquo;traditional own resources&rsquo; - principally customs duties collected on behalf of the EU, a VAT related payment under which an agreed percentage is levied on a harmonised VAT base for each member State and finally a balancing component paid according to each member States share of EU Gross National Income (GNI)*.  </p><p>  The 2013 EU budget is larger than the 2012 EU budget and this partly accounts for higher year-on-year payments made during the first six months of 2013. However, the primary reason for this increase is that the Commission, for cash flow reasons, has adjusted the monthly pattern according to which it seeks funds from member States, compared to previous years.  This change to the monthly profile of contributions also explains why Ireland&rsquo;s EU budget contribution to end June 2013 is &euro;67 million higher than the forecast in the monthly profiles of expenditure and revenue published in February. These adjustments to the monthly profile of a member States contribution do not affect the annual payment total.</p><p>  *GNI is equal to GNP adjusted for EU subsidies and taxes.</p></reply>

SEPA is an EU initiative that will change the way that these payments are processed across Europe. SEPA will allow payment systems users to make euro-denominated retail electronic payments to payees located in any of the participating countries, using a single payment account and a single set of payment instruments (the participating countries are the EU member states, together with Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Switzerland and Monaco).  SEPA comes into full effect on 1 February 2014 and businesses will need to ensure that payroll, direct debit and accounting systems are SEPA-ready. SEPA will introduce new business rules in relation to retail electronic payments and implement common standards in all participating countries for issuing and executing the underlying payment instructions. SEPA will deliver tangible benefits to businesses, for example by allowing faster settlement and simplified processing will improve cash flow and reduce costs.</p><p>  The implementation of SEPA within Ireland is overseen by the National Payments Plan (NPP) Steering Committee, which was established in 2012 to modernise the way payments are made in Ireland. In this regard, an NPP-SEPA sub-group has been formed, consisting of representatives of consumers, businesses, Government and banks. This sub group provides an avenue for the discussion of any issues that arise in the process of migrating to SEPA.</p><p>  The SEPA Direct Debit Scheme exists in two forms &ndash; the &lsquo;core&rsquo; scheme and the &lsquo;B2B&rsquo; (Business to Business) scheme. Both scheme forms allow creditors to collect funds directly from a debtor&rsquo;s bank account, provided that a valid mandate has been given by the debtor to the creditor. The key difference is that in the B2B Scheme the payer is not entitled to obtain a refund in respect of an authorised transaction (in contrast with the rights afforded to the payer in the in the core SDD scheme).  Adherence to the core scheme by banks is mandatory, but provision of the B2B scheme is optional; thus far only two Irish banks are in a position to offer the SDD &lsquo;B2B&rsquo; service. The remaining banks are currently focussed on the migration of their business customers to the SEPA &lsquo;core&rsquo; scheme in advance of the 1 February 2014 end-date. Once this objective has been achieved, the possibility of offering the &lsquo;B2B&rsquo; scheme will be examined by these banks; this issue is currently the subject of ongoing discussion between the banks concerned and the Central Bank of Ireland.</p><p>The information sought by the Deputy in relation to members of the Board of the Central Bank is set out in the schedule below.</p><p><table><tr><th><b>Surname</b></th><th><b>First Name</b></th><th><div><b>Appointed</b></div></th><th><div><b>Term expired (incl. reappointments)</b></div></th></tr><tr><td>McAleese</td><td>Dermot</td><td><div>30-Jul-79</div></td><td><div>31-Jan-96</div></td></tr><tr><td>Ferguson</td><td>Vincent A</td><td><div>17-Jun-83</div></td><td><div>16-Jun-93</div></td></tr><tr><td>O'Connor</td><td>Stephen</td><td><div>17-Jun-83</div></td><td><div>31-Jan-96</div></td></tr><tr><td>Cromien</td><td>Sean P</td><td><div>01-May-87</div></td><td><div>30-Apr-08</div></td></tr><tr><td>Walsh</td><td>Mary</td><td><div>01-Jul-88</div></td><td><div>30-Jun-98</div></td></tr><tr><td>Donovan</td><td>Roy</td><td><div>01-Dec-89</div></td><td><div>30-Apr-08</div></td></tr><tr><td>Moriarty</td><td>Patrick J</td><td><div>01-Dec-89</div></td><td><div>30-Nov-98</div></td></tr><tr><td>Murphy</td><td>Michael</td><td><div>15-Jan-90</div></td><td><div>14-Jan-95</div></td></tr><tr><td>Ryan</td><td>Eoin</td><td><div>14-Sep-92</div></td><td><div>Deceased 14-Dec-01</div></td></tr><tr><td>McCann</td><td>Billy</td><td><div>29-Jul-93</div></td><td><div>28-Jul-98</div></td></tr><tr><td>O'Connell</td><td>Maurice</td><td><div>01-May-94</div></td><td><div>30-Apr-02</div></td></tr><tr><td>Mullarkey</td><td>Patrick</td><td><div>13-Jun-94</div></td><td><div>09-Mar-00</div></td></tr><tr><td>Byrne</td><td>Donal</td><td><div>28-Jun-94</div></td><td><div>30-Apr-03</div></td></tr><tr><td>Begg</td><td>David</td><td><div>12-May-95</div></td><td><div>30-Apr-03</div></td></tr><tr><td>Danz</td><td>Friedhelm</td><td><div>01-Feb-96</div></td><td><div>Resigned 31-Oct-06</div></td></tr><tr><td>Nugent</td><td>Jim</td><td><div>12-Feb-98</div></td><td><div>11-Feb-03</div></td></tr><tr><td>O'Donoghue</td><td>Martin</td><td><div>01-Jul-98</div></td><td><div>30-Apr-08</div></td></tr><tr><td>Danaher</td><td>Gerard</td><td><div>15-Oct-98</div></td><td><div>30-Sep-10</div></td></tr><tr><td>Hurley</td><td>John</td><td><div>10-Mar-00</div></td><td><div>25-Sep-09</div></td></tr><tr><td>McBennett</td><td>Michael</td><td><div>22-Feb-02</div></td><td><div>01-May-03</div></td></tr><tr><td>Considine</td><td>Tom</td><td><div>11-Mar-02</div></td><td><div>30-Jun-06</div></td></tr><tr><td>Dunne</td><td>John</td><td><div>01-May-03</div></td><td><div>30-Sep-10</div></td></tr><tr><td>Farrell</td><td>Jim</td><td><div>01-May-03</div></td><td><div>30-Sep-10</div></td></tr><tr><td>O'Reilly</td><td>Liam</td><td><div>01-May-03</div></td><td><div>30-Apr-06</div></td></tr><tr><td>Patterson</td><td>Brian</td><td><div>01-May-03</div></td><td><div>30-Apr-08</div></td></tr><tr><td>Purcell</td><td>Deirdre</td><td><div>01-May-03</div></td><td><div>30-Sep-10</div></td></tr><tr><td>Barron</td><td>Liam</td><td><div>01-May-03</div></td><td><div>17-Aug-07</div></td></tr><tr><td>Neary</td><td>Patrick</td><td><div>01-Feb-06</div></td><td><div>31-Jan-09</div></td></tr><tr><td>Doyle</td><td>David</td><td><div>01-Jul-06</div></td><td><div>31-Jan-10</div></td></tr><tr><td>Gray</td><td>Alan W</td><td><div>21-Dec-06</div></td><td><div>30-Sep-10</div></td></tr><tr><td>Grimes</td><td>Tony</td><td><div>18-Aug-07</div></td><td><div>28-Jul-11</div></td></tr><tr><td>Hillery</td><td>Brian</td><td><div>01-May-08</div></td><td><div>30-Sep-10</div></td></tr><tr><td>O'Brien</td><td>Dermot</td><td><div>01-May-08</div></td><td><div>30-Sep-10</div></td></tr><tr><td>O'Dea </td><td>Mary</td><td><div>01-May-08</div></td><td><div>04-Jan-10</div></td></tr><tr><td>Honohan</td><td>Patrick</td><td><div>26-Sep-09</div></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Elderfield</td><td>Matthew</td><td><div>04-Jan-10</div></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Cardiff</td><td>Kevin</td><td><div>01-Feb-10</div></td><td><div>03-Feb-12</div></td></tr><tr><td>Clarke</td><td>Blanaid</td><td><div>01-Oct-10</div></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>FitzGerald</td><td>John</td><td><div>01-Oct-10</div></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Geraghty</td><td>Des</td><td><div>01-Oct-10</div></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Soden</td><td>Michael</td><td><div>01-Oct-10</div></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Watson</td><td>Max</td><td><div>01-Oct-10</div></td><td><div>Resigned 31-Dec-11</div></td></tr><tr><td>Ahearne</td><td>Alan W</td><td><div>08-Mar-11</div></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Moran</td><td>John</td><td><div>06-Mar-12</div></td><td></td></tr></table></p></reply>

The Irish taxpayer has grimly endured the austere cost of the bank recapitalisation and the bank guarantee. They are understandably outraged by these revelations. Irish citizens have suffered greatly as a direct result of the banking crisis and the events which have led to the bank guarantee.  The recent revelations will only serve to reinforce the Government&rsquo;s resolve to move this country back in the right direction by tightening up regulation and enforcing it. </p><p>  The tapes raise serious issues and this Government is committed to ensuring that the public is fully informed about what happened in Irish Banks in the lead up to and during the financial crisis. The Government has published the Houses of the Oireachtas (Inquiries, Privileges and Procedures) Bill 2013 which, if enacted, will provide the legal framework for a banking inquiry to be held within the current constitutional parameters. I expect that once that legislation is on the statute books the Houses of the Oireachtas will move quickly to progress that inquiry. It is important that all relevant parties participate fully with any resulting inquiry.</p><p>  In addition there are ongoing investigations by the Garda&iacute; that must be let run their course.  The Central Bank is also carefully studying the various transcripts emerging and they will be liaising with the Garda&iacute; in this regard. The Central Bank is also examining whether or not any breaches of regulatory requirements may have occurred arising from the information contained in the transcripts.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-07-09a.250.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013070900063#WRF00700"><p>The Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012, as amended, provides for the charging of interest on overdue taxes at a daily rate of 0.0219 per cent per day, just under 8% per annum, the same as the rate chargeable in relation to other taxes under the care and management of the Revenue Commissioners.  The legislation provides for the possibility of full or partial deferral in certain defined circumstances to qualified liable persons, and in such circumstances, the daily interest rate is 0.011 per cent, just under 4% per annum.  This is half the interest rate that applies to cases of non-compliance.  The deferred amount, including interest, will attach to the property and will have to be paid before the property is sold or transferred.  </p><p>  Certain events such as the receipt of money by way of winnings, gifts, inheritances or capital sums of any kind will cause the tax deferred up to that point, including interest, to become immediately payable.  Deferred LPT and interest will have to be discharged on the sale/transfer of the property.  However, a deferral may be allowed to continue where the property passes to another person by way of a gift or inheritance and the new liable person is also eligible for a deferral.  Deferrals are voluntary and the tax payer may choose to pay any deferred LPT though not required to do so.</p><p>  Therefore, the length of time that LPT may be deferred and any amounts deferred will vary depending on individual circumstances.  These are some of the factors which make direct comparisons between the rates of interest charged on deferred LPT and bank loans difficult.</p><p>  Per Central Bank figures (Retail Interest Rate Statistics: April 2013), the weighted average interest rate on outstanding loans to households for consumption and other purposes stands at 6.19 per cent at end-April 2013. The interest rate on short-term loans for consumption and other purposes with an agreed maturity up to one year stood at 9.74 per cent at end-April 2013.  The corresponding short-term rate reported by all credit institutions in the euro area was lower at 7.73 per cent at end-April 2013.  Short-term loans for consumption and other purposes with an agreed maturity of up to one year include both overdrafts and credit card debt. In terms of longer-term loans, the interest rate reported by Irish resident credit institutions on loans with an original maturity over five years was 3.95 per cent at end-April 2013.  This rate fluctuates with the reported rate at 4.17 per cent as of April 2012.  In the euro area, the equivalent long-term interest rate reported by all credit institutions stood at 4.88 per cent at end-April 2013.</p><p>  While a variable rate linked to Central Bank interest rates was considered, a fixed rate was favoured on grounds of certainty to taxpayers over how much they may owe and ease of administration for the Revenue Commissioners in calculating any interest due.  I am satisfied that the rate of interest on deferred LPT is proportionate in the context of the higher rate of interest for cases of non-payment of LPT and current interest rates on loans from financial institutions.</p></reply>

However, the following information may be relevant. </p><p>  The Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 provides for the possibility of deferring all or part (50%) of the LPT charge in cases where certain specified conditions are met.  While the deferral arrangements are not specifically linked to the Health Service Executive Fair Deal Scheme, an individual who is availing of that Scheme may be entitled to defer the charge.  In order to answer the question fully however, I am advised that the Deputy would have to provide more specific details.</p><p>  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the general position is that under section 5 of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended), an exemption may be obtained where a property that was previously occupied by a person as his or her sole or main residence has been vacated by the person for 12 months or more due to long term mental or physical infirmity.  An exemption may also apply where the period is less than 12 months, if a doctor is satisfied that the person is unlikely at any stage to return to the property.  In both cases, the exemption applies only where the property is not occupied by any other person or is not jointly owned with another person.  </p><p>  The Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) provides that a liability for Local Property Tax (LPT) will arise where a person is a liable person in relation to a residential property on the liability date, which was 1 May 2013 for the year 2013.  This includes a person who inherited a residential property and owned it on that date.</p><p>  An unemployed person who is an owner-occupier of a residential property may be entitled to a full or partial deferral if their annual income is within the limits set out in the LPT legislation.  Full details of all deferral options are outlined in the Guidelines on Deferral or Part Deferral of Local Property Tax, which are available on Revenue's website, <i><font color="#0000FF">www.revenue.ie</font></i>  . </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-07-09a.257.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013070900063#WRF01200"><p>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that as the Local Property Tax (LPT) is a self-assessed tax it is a matter for the property owner to calculate the tax due based on his or her assessment of the market value of the property.  For the purposes of LPT, values for properties under &euro;1 million are organised into valuation bands, with an initial band from &euro;0 to &euro;100,000 and 18 bands between &euro;100,001 and &euro;1,000,000 with a range of &euro;50,000 in each band.  As property owners were not required to provide a precise value for their property as at 1 May 2013, it is anticipated that for the most part overpayments of LPT should not happen.   That initial valuation of a property on 1 May 2013, assuming it was made in good faith, is valid up to and including 2016 and will not be affected by any increase or decrease in property prices or other changes during this period.  This will ensure a measure of certainty for all property owners.  Accordingly, where an owner assessed that the value of a residential property on 1 May 2013 places it in a particular valuation band but, due to a general decrease in property prices after that date, the reduction in the value of the property would place it in a lower valuation band, the owner will not be entitled to a refund of tax.  By the same token, if the property increases in value in that period, no additional charges will apply. The owner will, however, have the opportunity to re-assess the value of the property on the next valuation date, which is 1 November 2016.</p><p>  Revenue is most concerned that people meet their obligations voluntarily and pay the correct amount of tax.  However, if someone has genuinely overpaid their LPT, Section 26 of the 2012 Act (as amended) provides that a claim for a refund of the tax overpaid may be made to Revenue, where the overpayment of LPT was made due to an error or mistake on a return or a statement made by the liable person, subject to certain conditions being satisfied.  In this regard, I am advised that Revenue will issue detailed guidelines later in the year setting out the procedures to be followed by those who consider that they have either over or under valued their property for LPT purposes or inadvertently paid on foot of the Revenue estimate.  However, in the meantime, if a person has such concerns regarding their property, they can write to LPT Branch, Government Buildings, Kilrush Road, Ennis, Co. Clare setting out their case and the matter will be considered.</p><p>  I am advised by Revenue that any valuation amendments to Local Property Tax Returns must be in writing and must be supported by the appropriate evidence to explain or prove the need to decrease the value.  Evidence can be in the form of recent sales or advertised house prices in the area, professional valuations or house price surveys for the area.</p></reply>

All of these staff have been recruited on the basis of specified purpose contracts.</p><p>  The issue of a transfer of staff from IBRC to NAMA does not arise. Prior to the appointment of the Special Liquidators to IBRC on 7 February 2013, IBRC provided primary servicing (loan administration services) on NAMA loans with nominal balances of &euro;41 billion and provided special servicing (debtor engagement) on &euro;5.1 billion of this portfolio. These services are now being moved to Capita Asset Services which was appointed by NAMA in March as back-up servicer to the existing IBRC portfolio. Capita is currently recruiting staff, both within IBRC and elsewhere. As part of the new arrangements, NAMA has decided to assume certain oversight functions in relation to this portfolio and, arising from this, positions have been advertised and applications have been received from IBRC staff.  I am advised that this process is still ongoing and that of 27 offers made to IBRC staff to date 10 have been accepted and 17 have been declined.  </p><p>  In addition, as part of the Government&rsquo;s decision in February to appoint the Special Liquidators, it was decided that NAMA would acquire any loans which were unsold after the Special Liquidators had completed a loan valuation and sales process.  The loan valuation process is currently underway and I am advised that additional positions are likely to become available in NAMA and in its service providers after the loan sales process has concluded and NAMA has acquired any unsold loans.  </p><p>  It is a matter for the NTMA, as employer, to satisfy itself as to the suitability of the staff it recruits, including staff assigned to NAMA.  Section 42 of the NAMA Act requires the NTMA to ascertain to its satisfaction that the staff it proposes to assign to NAMA are of good character and have not been convicted of any offence likely to render them unfit or unsuitable, have not been disqualified or restricted from acting as a director under the Companies Acts and have no material conflicts of interest, whether actual or potential.  In addition, under section 42(3), a member of staff of the NTMA is required to provide a statement of his or her interests, assets and liabilities before being assigned to NAMA.</p></reply>

The pilot will operate for a period of three months, after which the results will be assessed to establish the effectiveness of the framework and to determine the appropriate next steps.  It should be emphasised that participation in the pilot is voluntary for both the lender and borrower.</p><p>  The Central Bank pilot scheme will offer the opportunity for distressed borrowers - including credit union members - to resolve their debts without the need to enter into a formal statutory process.  In this respect, it is important that credit union members are not left with a more limited range of options than are available to customers of other financial institutions.  It is in this spirit that the Central Bank has written to all credit unions to make them aware of the pilot so that the credit unions can decide whether their participation is in the interests of their members, including members with distressed debts across multiple lenders.  </p><p>  Credit unions have been invited by the Central Bank to nationwide information seminars on the pilot scheme to discuss its objectives and approach.  The Irish League of Credit Unions has also been invited to attend at these sessions and provide input into the content of them.  </p><p>  The Central Bank initiatives in the mortgage arrears area, including the pilot framework and the mortgage arrears targets initiative announced last March, is consistent with the overall Government approach to the mortgage arrears problem.  In particular, the Government, while significantly modernising Ireland&rsquo;s bankruptcy and insolvency law and procedures, has also advocated and encouraged borrowers and lenders to address situations of debt difficulty, where possible, on a bilateral and informal basis, and the recent Central Bank initiatives should underpin that process.  Taken together, the framework is in place to enable lenders to work with distressed borrowers to reach sustainable solutions for dealing with their personal indebted situations.</p><p>  The correspondence referred to in the Question also raises an issue regarding the repayment of direct debits. I can clarify in terms of the refund rights available to payers under SEPA, these are laid down in the Payment Services Directive 2009 (the PSD) as transposed by S.I. 383 of 2009, and in the SEPA Direct Debit (SDD) scheme rulebook published by the European Payments Council (the owner of the SDD scheme). </p><p>  The PSD grants consumers refund rights in three situations - for overcharging, unauthorised debits and incorrect processing. For unauthorised debits and incorrect processing, the payer has a right to an immediate refund as long as they notify their bank as soon as possible, and no later than 13 months after the debit date.</p></reply>

IBRC, the merged entity, comprising both Irish Nationwide Building Society and Anglo Irish Bank, remained solvent and in compliance with capital requirements up until liquidation on the 7th February 2013.  Anglo Irish Bank was regarded as a systemically important credit institution and was managed and dealt with on that basis by all the Irish regulatory authorities.  Failure of such an important institution would have had serious and immediate financial an economic implications.  Having consulted with the Central Bank capital was provided to the bank to ensure that they continued to meet all regulatory capital requirements.</p><p>  In the case of Anglo the Department knew, prior to nationalisation, that capital would be required, that funding at the bank was problematic and that certain risks, including governance issues, could, if not mitigated, materially impact on the bank.  However, the bank was not adjudged insolvent at that time.  The audited accounts for the period, and assessments by the Financial Regulator, PriceWaterHouse Coopers (PWC) and Merrill Lynch all indicated that the bank was solvent.  Anglo was nationalised because of governance issues, and funding problems in particular which would very quickly have placed the bank in a position of inability to repay maturing debt including deposits, with a major and immediate knock-on impact on other banks and on the State.  Further, there was strong negative market sentiment towards the bank which was impacting on the banking sector generally.</p><p>  With the benefit of hindsight, however, it is now clear that the full extent of the evolving  problems in global financial crisis or the property market  were not envisaged in any assessment of the bank at that time.  In the course of 2009/2010 the extent of the problems became clear and the level of impairments on assets increased substantially necessitating further injections of capital to sustain the capital position of the bank.</p></reply>

Their &quot;Strategy on Combating the Illicit Tobacco Trade (2011-2013)&quot;, which is published on the Revenue website (<i>www.revenue.ie</i>), includes a range of measures designed to complement each other in targeting the supply and demand sides of the market for illicit tobacco products.  This multi-faceted strategy includes ongoing analysis of the nature and extent of the problem, developing and sharing intelligence on a national, EU and international basis, ongoing review of operational policies, development of analytics and detection technologies, and optimum deployment of resources at both point of importation and inland to intercept and seize illegal products and to prosecute those involved.  Interception of illicit tobacco products is achieved through a combination of risk analysis, profiling and intelligence and the screening of cargo, vehicles, baggage and postal packages.  Revenue officers also target the illicit trade at the post-importation level by carrying out intelligence-based operations and random checks at retail outlets, markets and private and commercial premises.</p><p>In carrying out this important work Revenue works in close cooperation with other relevant agencies, both nationally and internationally.  There is extensive cooperation between Revenue and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and the agencies concerned in the State and in Northern Ireland work closely together, through a cross-border group on tobacco enforcement, to target the organised crime groups that are responsible for a large proportion of the illegal tobacco market.  In addition, cooperation takes place with other Revenue administrations and with the European Anti-Fraud Office, OLAF, in the ongoing efforts to tackle the illicit trade at international level.

In order to ensure that proposals in relation to such mortgages are consistent with the Central Bank's consumer protection and prudential policy objectives, the proposed criteria for any such facility need to be agreed in advance between mortgage lenders and the Central Bank.  While the provision of negative equity mortgages will facilitate people moving homes and generate transactions in the housing market, the Central Bank has informed me that it is not expected that there will be a large take up of this product, as all sales must be sustainable and comply with the affordability and suitability provisions set out in the Consumer Protection Code.  It is worth noting that a decision to introduce a negative equity type product is a matter for each mortgage lender and is based on commercial and policy considerations.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Central Bank in its quarterly publication on Mortgage Arrears and Repossession statistics, publishes data on the number of mortgages restructured by quarter but it does not publish data in the format requested by the Deputy.  The latest Central Bank data can be accessed at <i><font color="#0000FF"></font></i>.  With regard to assisting borrowers in arrears the Central Bank published the revised Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (&#8220;CCMA&#8221;) recently, setting out requirements for mortgage lenders dealing with borrowers facing or in mortgage arrears on their principal primary residence (whether in positive or negative equity).  The CCMA provides a strong consumer protection framework to ensure that borrowers struggling to keep up mortgage repayments are treated in a fair and transparent manner by their lender, and that long term resolution is sought by lenders with each of their borrowers.  The revised CCMA came into effect from 1 July 2013 and can be accessed on the Central Bank's website at <i><font color="#0000FF">www.centralbank.ie</font></i>.</p></reply>

I am advised that, since 1 July 2012, publicly available telephone services in Hungary are subject to a tax which is levied on telecommunications service providers and which applies on the initiation of phone calls and the sending of SMS and MMS messages.  The tax is levied at the rate of 2 Hungarian Forint (HUF) per minute for initiated phone calls and HUF 2 per message (SMS/MMS) sent, which converts to approximately EUR0.0068, or c. two-thirds of 1 cent.  Calls and messages to emergency services and those making charitable donations are exempt from the levy, as well as the first 10 minutes of calling in each month.  The amount of tax payable is capped at HUF 700 (EUR &euro;2.37) per month per phone number for private individuals and HUF 2,500 (EUR&euro;8.47) for non-private individuals.</p><p>  The levy is set to increase in Hungary from August 1.  It is proposed that the telecom tax paid by businesses only will rise by HUF1 per minute or per text message, and the upper limit payable will rise from HUF2,500 to HUF5,000 (EUR &euro;17 approximately).  As previously advised, I understand the levy is the subject of European Commission challenge, claiming an infringement of Directive 2002/20/EC on the authorisation of electronic communications networks and services (Authorisation Directive).  The action is currently at notification stage and has been responded to by the Hungarian authorities.  No information has been made available as yet to my officials regarding behavioural impact of the tax.</p><p>  As previously advised, the wider social and economic considerations which may militate against the introduction of a further tax on text messages would have to be taken into account, including the fact that that mobile phone calls and text messages are already subject to VAT at 23%, that a levy on such calls and messages could significantly increase the overall rate of taxation on mobile phone accounts, which would have implications for all sectors of society, and, finally, the fact the Exchequer has already received substantial benefit from the industry, particularly in the context of the recent spectrum auction.</p><p>  In this regard, I am advised by ComReg that the winning bidders of its Multi-band Spectrum Auction for the 800, 900 and 1800 MHz bands will pay &euro;854.64 million for these spectrum rights, comprising firstly of Upfront Fees amounting to &euro;481.7 million (adjusted as necessary by transitional arrangements) and secondly, Annual Spectrum Usage Fees in the amount of &euro;372.95 million which will be adjusted for inflation and paid in instalments until July 2030.  Details of Upfront Fees and Spectrum Usage Fees for the duration of licences can be found in Section 2.2.5 of ComReg's Information Memorandum 12/52, which is available on the ComReg website, <i><font color="#0000FF">www.comreg.ie</font></i>.</p></reply>

The anti-money-laundering obligations applicable in Ireland derive from the Third EU Money-Laundering Directive.  The Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010 was enacted in July 2010 to transpose the Third Money Laundering Directive (2005/60/EC) and its Implementing Directive (2006/70/EC) into Irish Law.  Part 4 of the Criminal Justice Act 2010 sets out the obligations of &#8220;designated persons&#8221; in relation to customer identification.  One such obligation set out in the Act is the obligation to conduct customer due diligence, prior to the establishment of a business relationship.  Customer due diligence refers to the identification of customers and that of any beneficial owners of financial products associated with the customer.</p><p>  An Post and the Prize Bond Company are deemed to be a &#8220;<i>designated person</i>&#8221; under the Criminal Justice Act 2010 as they fall within the definition of a &#8220;<i>financial institution</i>&#8221;.  In light of this, An Post and the Prize Bond Company are required to comply with the relevant provisions of the Act in relation to the sale of Prize Bonds to customers.  This means, in practical terms, that customer due diligence must be conducted on all purchases of prize bonds, irrespective of value.  The extent to which any particular person or product may be exempted from the customer due diligence requirements of the Act is determined by reference to the Act having regard to the underlying Directives.  The Central Bank of Ireland has no discretion to exempt certain firms from the requirement to comply with the Act.</p><p>  In light of the above, I am exploring with the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) and my colleague the Minister for Justice whether or not exemptions available under the Directives may be applied to small value purchases of prize bonds facilitated on behalf of the State by An Post and the Prize Bond Company.</p></reply>

This is a restricted measure which enables rather than incentivises individuals to access part of their pension savings beyond their regular or compulsory pension contributions. I do not wish to damage future pension provision and it is important that individuals continue to provide for their retirement.

Limiting the exemptions available allows the rate to be kept low for those liable persons who do not qualify for an exemption.  A requirement to pay management fees is not relevant in determining liability to the LPT. Accordingly, whilst those who are liable for management fees to property management companies may be exempt from LPT for another reason, or may be entitled to avail of a deferral arrangement under the provisions contained in the legislation, there is no specific reduction in LPT for the payment of management fees.  </p><p>  Generally, properties in managed estates, to which such fees apply, would have been purchased by their owners in the knowledge that they would be taking on commitments to partake in and to fund the management of the estate, and that it was the intention that many such estates would not be taken in charge by local authorities, nor would it be appropriate for local authorities to do so.  Management fees in these estates may, in some instances, include services such as refuse collection, maintenance of common areas and a sinking fund for certain repairs to the buildings.  These are costs which homeowners in many other developments would have to fund themselves for their own properties.  </p><p>  Revenue from the LPT will accrue to local authorities, and will support the provision of local services.  Local authorities provide a broad range of services in the public realm which benefit the wider community and the proper functioning of which are important for the wellbeing of every community and household.  These include fire and emergency services; road maintenance and cleaning; street lighting; spatial and development planning and other similar services; regulatory and inspection functions and business support services, as well as libraries, parks, and other recreation and cultural public amenities. </p></reply>

It operates in a clear and transparent manner and treats all similar types of schools equally irrespective of location.  The configuration of classes and the deployment of classroom teachers are done at local school level.   My Department publishes annual statistics on class size data for each school.  The most recent statistics are for the 2011/12 school year.  The national average class size is 24.4 pupils. However, with over 20,700 classes in over 3,100 primary schools throughout the country there will always be variations in class sizes at individual school level.  My Department's guidance to local school management is that such variations should be kept to the minimum.</p><p>  Classroom teachers are allocated under the staffing schedule based on the pupil enrolments for the previous 30th September. However, the staffing schedule also includes provision for schools that have significant increases in their enrolment in rapidly developing areas to be allocated classroom teachers based on their projected enrolments for September 2013. The criteria for this are set out in the staffing schedule which is available on the Department website.  Given the constraints on teacher numbers my Department has no capacity to put any other ameliorating measures in place.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Government has protected frontline services in schools to the greatest extent possible in the recent budget and there will no reduction in teacher numbers in primary schools and in free second level schools for the 2013/14 school year as a result of the budget.  The DEIS scheme for disadvantaged schools is also fully protected with no overall changes to staffing levels or funding as a result of the budget. </p></reply>

The independent Board makes awards in accordance with the framework set out in Towards Redress and Recovery, the report of the independent compensation advisory committee which advised on the appropriate levels of compensation.  By the end of 2012, the Board had made 14,378 awards with an average award value of &euro;62,860 and the largest being &euro;300,500, resulting in an overall cost of the Redress Scheme of &euro;1.1 billion.  These arrangements have provided survivors of institutional child abuse with a mechanism by which they could obtain fair and reasonable financial compensation for abuses suffered, without the necessity to pursue long and often traumatic cases via the court system.  In addition survivors can avail of the national counselling service and the Origins family tracing service.  Conscious that many survivors continue to suffer the effects of the abuse they suffered as innocent children and in keeping with the unanimous D&aacute;il motion, the Government agreed to establish the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund to utilise the &euro;110 million cash contributions, pledged by the congregations, to support the needs of survivors.  Supports across a range of services, including mental health services, health and personal social services, education and housing services will be available.  The Board of the  Fund held its inaugural meeting on 27th March and has commenced work on the arrangements to be put in place for the operation of the Fund.  I believe that these measures provide a comprehensive response to institutional child abuse and I have no plans to introduce any additional measures.</p></reply>

Pupils with Down Syndrome may be allocated resources under the category of mild general learning disability, or under the categories of moderate general learning difficulty or Assessed Syndrome, in conjunction with another Low Incidence disability. </p><p>  I wish to explain to the Deputies also that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has a formal role under the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act, 2004 in advising me in relation to any matter relating to the education of children and others with disabilities.  My Department requested that the NCSE consider the issue of whether Down Syndrome should be reclassified as a low incidence disability in all instances, regardless of assessed cognitive ability, in the context of its preparation of comprehensive advice on how the educational system supports children with special educational needs in schools. </p><p>  The NCSE report on Supporting Children with Special Educational Needs in Schools has now been published and is available on the NCSE website www.ncse.ie. The report recommends that under the new resource allocation model proposed by the NCSE in its report, children should be allocated additional resources in line with their level of need, rather than by disability category.  The NCSE has recommended that in the short-term, pupils with Down Syndrome who are in the Mild General Learning Disability (Mild GLD) category should continue to be supported by schools' Learning Support allocation in the same way as other pupils with a Mild GLD.  The NCSE policy advice did not recommend that an exception should be made for children with Down Syndrome who are in the Mild GLD range, over other children who are in the mild range and who also may have other co-morbid conditions.</p><p>  However, the NCSE report states that it is confident that the introduction of a new allocation model will overcome the difficulty posed by all children with mild general learning disabilities, including children with Down Syndrome, who have additional difficulties and who can be supported according to their level of need and in line with their learning plan process. In the meantime, schools are reminded that they can differentiate the level of learning support granted to ensure that available resources are used to support children in line with their needs. </p><p>  I have requested the NCSE to immediately proceed to establish a Working Group in order to develop a proposal for consideration for a new Allocation Model, which is set out as one of the principal recommendations of the report.</p></reply>

While it is acknowledged that there were significant difficulties in the operation of the assessment processes last year, I am informed by Student Universal Support Ireland (SUSI) that, in preparation for the 2013/2014 academic year, both the on-line application system and the application assessment process are being further developed to enhance their effectiveness and efficiency and respond to experiences from year one. </p><p>  For applicants applying through SUSI for the 2013/14 academic year, a number of new initiatives will make their application more efficient this year. The initiatives include direct information sharing between SUSI and Government bodies and agencies including the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Social Protection, the General Register Office (GRO) and the Central Applications Office (CAO). These links should reduce significantly the number of documents required from applicants themselves.  In addition the staff resources recommended by the review have already been sanctioned. The resources include three additional management posts and some 23 (whole time equivalent) additional processing staff. This will help to ensure that qualifying students have their applications assessed as quickly as possible. SUSI has also significantly developed its training programme to meet the training needs of new and existing staff.</p></reply>

This is borne out by the fact that in 2012, 85% of the capital expenditure in the school sector was in respect of large scale projects, additional accommodation and prefab replacement. The balance was expended on site acquisition, emergency works, furniture and equipment provision and commitments arising from earlier years.  The capital allocation that is available for the school sector in 2013 is expected to have a similar spend pattern as was the case in 2012 and at this time there are no plans to reinstate the Minor Works Grant.</p></reply>

This reality means that restoring this country's economic fortunes and adhering to agreed targets for levels of general Government debt will require further consolidation in the years immediately ahead. My Department has a requirement to identify net savings of &euro;44 million to meet the 2014 expenditure ceiling set for the Education Vote. In addition, it will be necessary to manage upward pressures on expenditure from within the set allocations.

This includes provision for 10,575 Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) and nearly 10,000 Learning Support and Resource Teachers. These resources have been protected despite the ongoing severe financial position and a requirement to make expenditure savings across a range of areas. </p><p>  I wish to clarify that there has been no reduction to the overall number of SNA posts being provided for schools for the coming school year. This provision remains at 10,575 posts, which will ensure that all children who qualify for access to SNA support for the coming school year will receive access to such support.  It is important to note that the level of SNAs required to support children with special educational needs changes from year to year in line with the enrolment of different children with different care needs. The care needs of individual children can also change from year to year. The NCSE takes these factors into account when allocating SNAs to schools.  Therefore, even if the number of students receiving SNA support rises, this does not necessarily mean that the required number of SNAs to support their care needs should rise by a similar percentage. </p><p>  In June 2012 the NCSE reported that the number of children requiring support for the 2012/2013 school year was in the order of 20,000 and the most up-to-date current figures is that for December 2012 of 21,972.  The initial allocation of SNAs for the coming school year will support about 22,000 pupils. This is at about the same level supported in December 2012, despite the passing of 6 months.  To date the NCSE has allocated over 10,490 SNA posts to schools which leaves over 80 posts available for allocation during the school year. The NCSE has advised that they have processed all applications for SNA support this year and have allocated the level of SNA support to schools that it considers will meet the care needs of all qualifying pupils.   These allocations have been made in line with DES policy and there has been no change in the policy or its application this year.</p><p>  Details of the SNA allocations which have been made to schools by the NCSE for the 2013/2014 school year are now available on the NCSE website www.ncse.ie, which provides details of the SNA allocations for each school on a school by school and per county basis.</p></reply>

I wish to advise the Deputy that differing pupil teacher ratios are applied under the GAM in relation to boys, girls and mixed schools in order to account for differentials of prevalence of learning difficulty between boys and girls. The objective of this differentiation is to ensure that resources provided to schools to support children who have additional learning needs are targetted to ensure that those children most in need benefit from these resources.</p><p>  The rationale for the differing ratios is based on international literature on the incidence of disability as well as international and national surveys of literacy and numeracy which indicate that there is a greater incidence of disability/learning difficulty in boys than girls.  The NCSE Report on the Implementation of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act, of 2006, also examined a range of sources to establish prevalence rates, including national databases, local and international studies and expert estimates, which indicated significantly higher rates of Mild General Learning Difficulty and Specific Learning Disability prevailing in boys, in comparison to girls.  The criteria for the allocation of GAM hours is outlined in circular 13/2013 which is available on my Department's website www.education.ie.</p></reply>

The NCSE operates within my Department's established criteria for the allocation of Special Education supports and the staffing resources available to my Department.  All schools were advised to apply to the NCSE for resource teaching and SNA support for the 2013/14 school year by 15th March 2013.  The NCSE has now published details of all of their allocations for resource teaching and SNA support for the 2013/2014 school year.  These details are now available on the NCSE website, www.ncse.ie, and detail the allocations made for each school on a per county basis.</p><p>  In relation to SNA support, schools should contact the NCSE if they have enrolled children who were not considered at the time that these allocations were made, or where they are seeking a revision to the quantum of SNA support which has been allocated to them for the coming school year.  In general a revision to SNA allocations will only be made in circumstances where schools have enrolled new pupils, or where schools can demonstrate that they do not have sufficient SNA posts to cater for the care needs of all of the qualifying children in their school.  In relation to resource teaching support, I am committed to ensuring that the resources which will be required to ensure that the allocations can be made to schools at existing levels will be provided, including resources required to meet any late demand expected to arise between now and the start of the school year. I have requested the NCSE to advise me by the end of September on the level of additional demand arising from late or emergency applications for the remainder of the school year.  All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO.  Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.</p></reply>

One aspect of this Agreement relates to supplementary assignment arrangements for Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) and as both Unions that represent SNAs namely, SIPTU and IMPACT, have signed up to the Haddington Road Agreement, the Department has now implemented supplementary assignment arrangements for SNAs for the 2013/2014 school year.  The detailed arrangements are set out in Departmental Circular 0037/2013 which issued on 1 July 2013 (<a href="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/Debates%20Authoring//WebAttachments.nsf/($vLookupByConstructedKey)/dail~20130709/$File/ATT1K6EH.pdf">copy attached</a>).</p><p>  The first part of the LRC proposals for supplementary assignment arrangements for SNAs outlines that the supplementary assignment arrangements only apply to current SNAs who are notified that they are to be made redundant.  Accordingly, with effect from 1 May 2013 once an SNA with a minimum of one year's service is notified by his/her employer that he/she is to be made redundant then he/she shall be deemed to be a member of a Supplementary Assignment Panel for SNAs.  I can inform the Deputy that the 1st of May date was set in Circular 0037/2013 in order to ensure that the overwhelming majority of SNAs who worked in schools during the past year would be eligible for the supplementary assignment arrangements, as agreed to in the LRC proposals.  As the LRC proposals are part of a wider public-sector pay agreement that represent compromises by both employers and unions, I do not have the ability to alter the terms of that agreement.</p><p><i>  Copies of the attachments are available as Q229circular.pdf and Haddington Road agreement.pdf at the top of the web page.</i></p></reply>

Otherwise he/she would continue to be assessed on the basis of his/her parents' income.  In recognition of the fact that a student under 23 yeas of age can be estranged from his/her parents, it is possible under the student grant scheme, as an exceptional measure, for such a student to be assessed without reference to his/her parents/guardians income.  However, compelling independent evidence of estrangement must be provided to the grant awarding authority to enable this.  The type of independent evidence includes a letter from a social worker or other appropriate officer of the Health Service Executive explaining the circumstances of the estrangement.

The main conditions of the scheme are that students must be first-time undergraduates, hold inter alia EU/EEA/Swiss nationality in their own right, and have been ordinarily resident in an EU/EEA/Swiss state for at least three of the five years preceding their entry to an approved third level course.</p><p>  Higher education institutions are autonomous bodies and the criteria governing the level of tuition fees to be charged (EU or Non EU rate), in cases where undergraduate students do not qualify for free fees is a matter for the institutions to determine in accordance with their own criteria.  Tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education.

The then Minister for Finance announced in Budget 2011 that a 10% reduction would apply to the pay rates of new entrant public servants with effect from 1 January 2011 and at the same time that new entrants must start at the first point of the relevant pay scale.</p><p>  I have agreed to address the position regarding the new entrant salary scales as part of the discussions which lead to the Haddington Road Agreement. The Agreement provides at Section 2.31 that revised incremental salary scales shall be prepared for same grade entrants to bring their position into line with earlier appointments over time.</p></reply>

In drawing up the HRA, the Labour Relations Commission expressly recognised that Government plans for certain public service pension reductions did not form part of the proposals which comprise the HRA. The relevant paragraph in the HRA, headed &ldquo;Public Service Pensions&rdquo;, reads as follows: &ldquo;Separately to this Agreement, the Parties note that the Government intends to align the reductions in public service pensions in payment with the reductions applied to serving staff. The Parties note that this measure will apply to pensions in payment greater than &euro;32,500 only.&rdquo;</p><p>  Reductions in those public service pensions valued in excess of &euro;32,500 duly took effect on 1 July 2013, on foot of provisions in the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2013, and accomplished by recourse to the &ldquo;Public Service Pension Reduction&rdquo; (PSPR), which was originally introduced in 2011.  It is important to emphasize that these July 2013 pension reductions only apply to higher-value public service pensions. The relevant legislation does not contain any provision for the reimbursement of those pension reductions.  However these latest pension reductions, representing as they do one of a series of legislated financial emergency measures affecting public service pay and pensions, fall to be reviewed annually by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, as provided for in section 12 of the 2013 Act.  The next such review, with written report to be provided to the Houses of the Oireachtas, is due to take place no later than 30 June 2014.</p></reply>

It provides for the first time comprehensive whistleblower protection across all sectors of the economy addressing what has been identified - both nationally and internationally - as a significant gap in Ireland's legal framework for combating corruption.</p><p>  The key measures outlined in the Bill are as follows:</p><p>- Compensation of up to a maximum of five years remuneration can be awarded in the case of an unfair dismissal for having made a protected disclosure.</p><p>- A wide definition of wrongdoings is included in the Bill and the safeguards provided in the legislation are extended in line with international best practice recommendations.</p><p>- The Bill contains a wide definition of 'workers' which, in addition to employees, includes contractors, agency staff and trainees.</p><p>- Whistleblowers will benefit from civil immunity from actions for damages and a qualified privilege under defamation law.</p><p>- Making a protected disclosure or reasonably believing a disclosure is protected is a defence to any offence prohibiting or restricting the disclosure of information.</p><p>- Where a whistleblower or, for example, a member of his family experiences coercion, intimidation harassment, discrimination at the hands of a third-party the legislation provides for a right of action in tort against that person.</p><p>- The legislation seeks to protect the identity of a whistleblower - the matter disclosed rather than the whistleblower should be the focus of attention.</p><p>- The Bill provides in any proceedings that a disclosure is assumed to be a protected disclosure unless the contrary can be proved.</p><p>- The legislation provides a number of distinct disclosure channels for potential whistleblowers.</p><p>- The protections remain available if the information disclosed on examination does not reveal wrongdoing.  Deliberate false reporting will not meet the reasonable belief test and is not protected.</p><p>- Special arrangements are put in place for disclosures relating to law enforcement matters and to disclosures that could adversely affect Ireland's security, defence or international relations.</p></reply>

The responsibility for the care and conservation of National Monuments in State care is defined in the various National Monuments Acts 1930 &ndash; 1994 and in this specific regard, it is noted that Doe Castle is in good physical condition, a significant conservation project having been carried out there in recent years.  The National Monuments Service cares for both the building and grounds on an ongoing basis and my information is that this site has been visited recently for grasscutting and weed removal and the grounds are well maintained currently.   I am not aware therefore that the site is in poor state as alleged and if the Deputy is aware of any issues currently in relation to the presentation of the building or the grounds, he might let me have details and I will have this addressed.</p><p>  The National Monuments Service is anxious to promote visitors to its sites and, with this in mind, and having regard to the current difficult position in relation to resources, the Office of Public Works has since 2012 engaged in an initiative called "Friends of Irish Heritage" which is designed to facilitate the development of formal partnerships with local community-based groups who are interested in supporting opening of these facilities on a volunteer basis.   I understand that contact has been established with interested individuals in the north Donegal area in relation to the potential tourism of Doe Castle and I would be hopeful that a viable project can be devised that the National Monuments Service can support.</p><p>  In regard to marketing of this site, my officials have recently engaged with F&aacute;&iacute;lte Ireland in relation to Doe Castle and it will be prominently included in the context of the "Wild Atlantic Way" project being developed to promote and facilitate tourism in that region.  It is expected that the National Monuments Service will engage in further awareness initiatives to support this in time.</p></reply>

For example, out of the 12,850 planned workplace inspections and investigations for 2013, 3,000 will be carried out in the high risk agriculture sector.  </p><p>  To emphasise the importance of workplace health and safety in the agriculture sector, in April this year, the Authority carried out a two-week farm safety campaign with a focus on joint involvement with farmer representative organisations.  The campaign included actions such as farm walks and talks, with a particular emphasis on farmers in the 60+ age group.  This age-group received particular attention as over half the 182 people killed over the last decade in agriculture were in this age-group.  In an effort to focus attention on age as a risk factor, the Authority and the IFA have jointly produced a DVD entitled 'Older, Wiser, Safer - A Practical Guide to Safety for Older Farmers.' </p><p>  Partnership remains central to the Authority's approach to improving farm safety.  This approach involves the major stakeholders in the agriculture sector in the task of improving farm safety through the Farm Safety Partnership Advisory Committee - a sub-committee of the Board of the Authority.  This approach is designed to better support the identification and development of broad based actions by the primary stakeholders to assist in developing and sustaining a safety and health culture within the sector.  It seeks to emulate the approach that has worked well in the construction sector.</p><p>  An important element of achieving improved farm safety outcomes will be the soon-to-be-published three-year (2013-15) Action Plan for the Farm Safety Partnership.  This plan will aim to deliver coordinated initiatives on awareness raising, safety promotion, research and special projects. The Plan's key goals are: </p><p>  - To establish and implement appropriate Safety and Health Training and Educational programmes for farmers and persons who are employed in the agriculture sector.</p><p>  - To develop programmes to prevent accidents and injuries to vulnerable persons (children and older persons) in agriculture.</p><p>  - To achieve cultural and behavioural changes related to risk taking in agriculture.</p><p>  - To influence farmers to manage high risk work activities and to improve standards in the use and maintenance of Tractors, Machinery and Farm Vehicles.</p><p>  - To implement programmes to assist in protecting the occupational health of persons working in agriculture. </p><p>  The Farm Safety Committee's previous 2009-2012 Action Plan set ambitious targets in health and safety and identified specific activities to achieve these targets and much was achieved during the course of this plan. In response to the serious challenges faced in agriculture, the Authority responded comprehensively with a number of initiatives including: </p><p>  - On-line farm risk assessment tool   .</p><p>  - A Code of Practice for Agriculture which includes a Risk Assessment Document and a Safe System of Work  Plan (SWWP). The Code provides practical user-friendly guidance with respect to farmers, family members,  employees, service providers, advisers, trainers and persons with a role related to safety and health. It sets out  clearly the major risks in farming and provides a simple approach through the risk assessment document to  managing safety at farm level.</p><p>  - An extensive media campaign on national TV, national &amp;amp; local radio and in the print media.</p><p>  In 2012 the Authority pursued an integrated farm safety media campaign, which included graphic TV advertisements, and hard-hitting radio and print ads, all with a strong focus on the shocking consequences of farm accidents for real farmers.  The aim of this element of the Authority's campaign was to drive home the terrible consequences that result from accidents in the agriculture sector.</p><p>  The Authority has 20 Inspectors who carry out proactive inspection work in the agriculture sector including 5 full time specialists in the Agriculture Inspection Group.   The level of awareness among farmers in relation to their duty to ensure a safe farm - based on inspection - is now estimated at 80%.  It continues to be the experience of the Health and Safety Authority Inspectors that while the standard of the individual Safety Statement/Code of Practice is, in general, adequate to control the risks on the farm, the implementation of the identified controls and allocation of resources required is lower. </p><p>  The Authority has, this week, commenced a 'Farm Safety Survey' of 3,000 randomly selected, farm households. The overall aim of the proposed research is to identify the factors most likely to influence farmers in Ireland to make long-term behavioural changes with regard to their daily farm work, to improve knowledge of methods of farm accident prevention, to inform future Authority preventive activity and to make recommendations concerning how best to make farms safer places to work and live. </p><p>  Ultimately, day-to-day responsibility for workplace safety rests with those in the workplace in the first instance.  In that context, it is important that we all maintain a strong focus on workplace safety as safe workplaces can ultimately only be delivered by those who control and work in them.  Agriculture, by its very nature, is one of the more hazardous occupations, especially as the workplace and family home are so often one-and-the-same.  In such circumstances, I would urge all involved in the agriculture sector to re-double their efforts to improve health and safety standards in their sector.</p></reply>

IDA Ireland is charged with the attraction of foreign direct investment (FDI) to Ireland and its regions while Enterprise Ireland has responsibility for the development and promotion of Ireland's indigenous business sector.  The role of the Longford County Enterprise Board is to provide a source of support for micro-enterprise in the start-up and expansion phases, to promote and develop indigenous micro enterprise potential and to stimulate economic activity and entrepreneurship at local level.  </p><p>  As Ireland competes for high quality investments, the concept of scale is crucial. Leading global corporations require a significant population, a pool of qualified talent, world standard physical and digital infrastructure coupled with the availability of sophisticated professional and business support services. Against this backdrop, IDA Ireland has informed me that it prioritises the marketing of Gateway locations within each Region as the areas of critical mass.  Longford is marketed as part of the Midland Region together with Laois, Offaly, Westmeath and Roscommon.  In this region, IDA concentrates on the linked gateway of Athlone/Tullamore/ Mullingar.  The Agency also promotes the towns of Longford, Portlaoise and Roscommon as part of its wider marketing efforts and in response to specific client requirements.  </p><p>  At present, there are 6 IDA Ireland client companies in Longford employing 632 people.  IDA Ireland has strong relationships with these companies and works closely with them in order to ensure their long term sustainability and to encourage their growth, development, a broadening of their mandates and continuing re-investment in their sites. </p><p>  In 2012, just over 1,557 people were employed on a full time basis in Enterprise Ireland client companies in County Longford. The Agency has informed me that, in 2012, five Innovation Vouchers were awarded to companies in Longford. This initiative, which links start-up companies with knowledge providers such as the local Institutes of Technology, continues to play an important role in supporting the development of new and existing limited smaller companies as well as strengthening ties and collaborations with the research community. There has been one call for Innovation Vouchers so far in 2013 under which two Longford companies have been awarded funding.  The Innovation Voucher initiative is just one of several initiatives that the Agency is implementing to further develop and support the creation of jobs and growth in the Midlands Region, of which Longford is part.</p><p>  Subject to certain eligibility criteria, Longford County Enterprise Board (CEB) supports individuals, firms and community groups provided that the proposed projects have the capacity to achieve commercial viability.  This support can be in the form of financial and non-financial assistance to a project promoter.  In 2012, Longford CEB provided over &euro;250,000 in grant assistance to 31 projects and 585 people participated in Longford CEB assisted training courses. To date in 2013 Longford CEB has facilitated the establishment of a business forum group where local business persons meet to discuss proposals on how to further enhance County Longford's business profile and promote the county as an investment location. </p><p>  IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and Longford CEB will continue to support enterprise development in Co Longford with a view to contributing to the achievement of the Government's job creation targets outlined in the 2013 Action Plan for Jobs.</p></reply>

With Council, the European Parliament has a co-decision role on the Directive so that, until the final text of the Directive is adopted, which will occur following completion of the legislative procedure in both EU institutions, it is difficult to pin down the impact of the measure. </p><p>  The main objectives of the Directive are to improve the standards of governance and transparency of collective management societies (CMO&rsquo;s) thereby ensuring improvements in their management efficiency for the benefit of Right holders whom they represent.  The Directive also seeks to facilitate multi-territorial licensing by collecting societies of authors' rights in musical works when transmitted online.</p><p>  In terms of governance, the Directive proposes to set down rules in relation to the conduct of CMO&rsquo;s in terms of structured management arrangements such as the need to provide for a general assembly of members with certain areas of responsibility and decision making ability, the establishment of fair criteria for membership eligibility, the imposition of obligations and duties on persons who manage the business of the CMO, the need to provide for a supervisory function in CMO&rsquo;s etc.  Requirements are also set out in relation to the timeframe for distribution to Right holders of revenue received from the use of copyrights or related rights, the deductions that can be made therefrom and, the investment and distribution of such monies.  Rules on disclosure of information to Right holders, members and the general public together with the need for the preparation of annual transparency reports are also proposed. </p><p>  My Department carried out an initial general consultation on the directive at the time of publication and, submissions were received from a number of Irish CMO&rsquo;s.  I should say that, while certain technical issues were raised by them in relation to some Articles of the Directive, overall the proposal was well received.  It was pointed out that it is the case that some CMO&rsquo;s already have in place similar rules to some of those proposed under the Directive and that in some instances these are, in fact, more stringent than what is proposed under the Directive.</p><p>  I am pleased to say that during the Irish Presidency, huge progress was made in terms of advancing this proposal through first reading examination in Council to the point of reaching agreement at political level to commence Trilogue discussions with the European Parliament on the dossier.  It is expected that Trilogues with the Parliament will commence on the Directive under the Lithuanian Presidency in the Autumn of this year paving the way for adoption of the Directive.</p></reply>

To this effect, there is on-going dialogue between relevant Ministers and officials, North and South, to promote economic development, job creation and innovation on a cross-border basis.  From my own perspective, I attend meetings in the Trade and Business development sectoral format of the North South Ministerial Council and, also, of the North South Plenary, which are hosted by either the Taoiseach or the First and Deputy First Ministers. At these meetings there is full engagement with Northern Ministers, and particularly at the sectoral meetings, where I have direct discussions with my N.I. counterpart, Ms Arlene Foster MLA, Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Investment, on a wide range of business issues of mutual interest.</p><p>  In fact, I met with Minister Foster on 26 June last at a Trade and Business development meeting where we had a good exchange of views and information.  We also had presentations from <i>InterTradeIreland</i>, the North/South Trade and Business Development Body, which were very informative, and an update on the EU Interreg Programme under which funding has been jointly provided to 28 micro enterprise projects in the border counties, North and South over the last number of years.  In addition, I attended the North South Ministerial Council Plenary meeting held on 5 July last where a wide range of North/South co-operative measures were discussed between Irish Government Ministers and their N.I. counterparts.</p><p>  My officials also engage in on-going dialogue with their counterparts in the Northern Ireland Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment (D'ETI). A key area of such regular engagement is on the operation of <i>InterTradeIreland</i>, which is co-funded by my Department and D'ETI.  <i>InterTradeIreland's</i> suite of programmes is designed to encourage trade and business growth across the island and create an environment where it is easier to do cross-border business.  My Department, along with our enterprise development agencies, will continue to work diligently with our counterpart Department and relevant Northern Ireland Agencies to increase the economic benefits, especially on job creation, research and innovation, which can accrue from practical cross-border co-operation.</p></reply>

While it is far too early to anticipate the eventual negotiated outcome<b></b>of the Agreement, the scope of the Council's negotiating directives to the EU Commission<b></b>is sufficiently<b></b>wide to maximise the potential benefits of an Agreement for the EU and its Member States.</p><p>  Studies by the EU Commission and other European bodies indicate that a comprehensive Trade and Investment Partnership could over time boost EU GDP by 0.5% per annum and help create approximately 400,000 jobs in the EU. Given the current very low level of economic growth in the EU and in Ireland, this will be a significant injection of economic activity and consequently of new job opportunities. Based on those assessments, if Ireland simply benefited in proportion to the size of our economy within the EU, a comprehensive trade and investment partnership could over time provide gains to Ireland in the order of &euro;800million per annum in increased GDP, and 4,000 new jobs.</p><p>  As formal negotiations have yet to begin, it is not possible to estimate in detail the impact on Ireland until there is greater clarity about any exchange of offers, the scale of the possible long term gains will have a positive impact on Ireland given our close trading and investment relationship with the U.S. In addition, many Irish exporters are part of European supply chains where their exports to the UK, Germany or elsewhere to the EU, feed into Europe's exports to the U.S.  While tariffs are already low on trade across the Atlantic, the objective of abolishing even these will bring benefits to business in the short term. Tariffs that average about 3% on EU/U.S. trade may appear insignificant but even at this low level they constitute an unnecessary tax on trade with the U.S. by both foreign and indigenous companies.   </p><p>  The major benefits of course will arise from reform of regulatory restrictions applied by both economies. Many of these, such as the cost of having to meet two sets of technical specifications for consumer and other products, add extensive costs to exporters. In the longer term, if the TTIP brings about a regime whereby exporters would only need to meet one set of product compliance rules, it would save significant costs for exporters of medical devices, pharmaceuticals and chemicals among others. Ireland's agribusiness sector would benefit if rules are changed that currently hold back our food exporters from being able to freely sell into the U.S. market, in the same way as they can into the EU. </p></reply>

The position in respect of these targets is  as follows.</p><p><b>Research and Development:</b></p><p>  Ireland's Headline Target for R&amp;amp;D under the Europe 2020 Strategy is to improve the conditions for research and development, in particular with the aim of raising combined public and private investment levels in this sector to 2.5% of GNP (approximately equivalent to 2.0% of GDP) by 2020.  The research intensity ratio relates to Gross Expenditure on R&amp;amp;D (GERD) as a percentage of GNP. GERD is an internationally recognised metric which measures the total amount of expenditure on R&amp;amp;D in an economy. It includes all expenditure by Government and private enterprise and it measures the total amount of expenditure on all research performed in the enterprise, higher education and government sectors.  </p><p>  The latest available data show that the research intensity rate for 2012 is estimated at 2.11% of GNP (1.71% of GDP). The estimated research intensity rate for 2013 is 2.16% of GNP (1.73% of GDP).  At this point we are on track to achieve the research intensity target by 2020.</p><p><b>Employment:</b></p><p>  Ireland's Europe 2020 Headline Target is to raise to 69%-71% the employment rate for women and men aged 20-64, including through the greater participation of young people, older workers and low-skilled workers, and the better integration of legal migrants. </p><p>  The employment rate for women and men aged 20-64 was 64% in 2012, unchanged from 2011 suggesting a stabilisation in the labour market after a fall from 74% in 2007 to 71% in 2008 and 66% in 2009.  Ireland has committed to review the target in 2014 in the context of a proposed mid-term review of the Europe 2020 Strategy.</p><p>  Ireland's National Reform Programme (NRP) for 2013 submitted by the Government to the European Commission in April indicates that the Europe 2020 medium term goals may be attained.  Assuming the current 20-64 year old population cohort holds constant, attaining the targets set in the <i>Action Plan for Jobs </i>should have a significant positive impact for Ireland's 2020 employment rate target, reaching 67.6% by 2016 and 70.1% by 2020, almost exactly the mid-point of Ireland's employment rate target range of 69%-71% for 2020.</p></reply>

Regarding the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) both the European Union and the United States have a strong interest in successfully concluding this historic agreement that will contribute significantly to encouraging greater trade and investment across the Atlantic while stimulating economic growth and employment opportunities among exporters. As the TTIP opens a huge potential for both sides these negotiations will remain a top priority on our trade policy agenda.  In parallel, it is important to address concerns that have been clearly expressed on the European side on some intelligence gathering activities and also on the implication for privacy and data protection at European level.</p><p>  The President of the European Commission stated on 3 July that the Commission is committed to the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, but that in parallel, work will be undertaken in EU-US working groups that will analyse a range of intelligence matters that are of concern to the EU and its citizens, including the question of privacy and data protection. At the Trade Council that I chaired on 14 June, the European Commission received a unanimous mandate from Member States to start these negotiations. The Commission has confirmed that the talks will start on 8 July in Washington. I believe the talks have enormous significance and potential for our economy, but to be successful they have to take place in an atmosphere of confidence between the negotiating parties. This can be achieved if there is clarification on recent issues of serious concern at EU level.</p></reply>

This compares to an overall OECD youth unemployment rate of 16.4%, with 8% unemployment in the OECD labour force.  In both instances, the rate of youth unemployment is slightly double the rate of unemployment in the overall economy.  Young people, typically, suffer disproportionately from job losses in recessions as they tend to have entered employment more recently, are more likely to hold temporary contracts and to be employed in cyclically sensitive industries than older workers. The youth unemployment rate in Ireland is higher than the OECD average as the overall level of unemployment is higher in Ireland than in the OECD.</p></reply>

To qualify for a payment a farmer must be aged between 18 and 66 years, be engaged in farming, and satisfy a means test.  The objective of the means assessment is to arrive at a figure which represents the normal net profit or loss from farming and includes an assessment of income from any other self-employment.  This includes all income derived from farming (and other self-employment) less legitimate business-related expenses incurred in connection with the running of the farm. These costs may include rent, the cost of inputs like animal feed and fertiliser, veterinary expenses, hire of machinery, interest paid on business-related borrowings, depreciation of farm equipment and business-related utility bills. Labour costs are taken into account, with the exception of the labour of the farmer and spouse, civil partner or cohabitant.</p><p>  Information on the qualifying conditions for farm assist is available to the applicant and is also available on the department's website, .  However, each application for farm assist is determined on the individual circumstances of that case and it is not, therefore, possible to supply an exhaustive list of allowed expenses.  If any customer wishes to discuss the nature of expenses allowable in their case, they should contact their Social Welfare Local Office.</p></reply>

These entitlements include wages, holiday pay, sick pay, payment in lieu of minimum notice due under the Minimum Notice &amp;amp; Terms of Employment Acts, 1973-2001, and certain pension contributions.  Various other statutory awards made by the Employment Appeals Tribunal, Rights Commissioners, etc., are also covered by the Scheme.  </p><p>  Payments under the scheme are made from the Social Insurance Fund and the Minister becomes a preferential creditor against the assets of an employer in respect of most amounts paid under the scheme.  Where a person&rsquo;s former employer was a limited company, the company should be in liquidation or receivership in order for the person to be eligible to claim under the insolvency payments scheme.

Recognising the urgency required in tackling the challenge of youth joblessness, the EPSCO Council quickly agreed on the EU Council Recommendation on a Youth Guarantee in February.  The Irish Presidency was at the forefront of securing agreement on the adoption of the Recommendation.  The Recommendation is that Member States should:<i>Ensure that all young people under the age of 25 years receive a good-quality offer of employment, continued education, an apprenticeship or a traineeship within a period of four months of becoming unemployed or leaving formal education</i>.</p><p>  As part of the European Council agreement on the 2014 - 2020 EU Budget earlier this year, it was decided, in association with the agreement on the Youth Guarantee, to provide &euro;6 billion for a new Youth Employment Initiative (YEI) for regions with particularly high levels of youth unemployment. This funding will consist of &euro;3 billion from the European Social Fund and an additional &euro;3 billion from a new Youth Employment budget line.</p><p>  Proposals supported by the Irish Presidency that payments of the Youth Employment Initiative be front-loaded and all monies provided for this purpose be used in 2014 and 2015 were approved last month. In addition, The European Council agreed last week that margins left available below the Multi-annual Financial Framework (MFF) budgetary ceilings for the years 2014-2017 will be used to constitute a &quot;global margin for commitments&quot; to fund in particular measures to fight youth unemployment. The flexibility means, in effect, that beyond the &euro;6 billion that we reserved in February<b>, </b>there will be substantially more available for the Youth Employment Initiative - according to projections, at least &euro;8 billion in total.  </p><p>  It is recognised, both in the Recommendation itself and more generally, that the pace of implementation must take account of the scale of the youth unemployment and inactivity challenge and consider the fiscal capacity of each Member State. At the same time, Member States should take all possible measures to ensure that the Recommendation is swiftly implemented.  For our own part, the Government will now review the current range of youth employment policies in Ireland to assess what measures will need to be taken to commence the implementation of the Guarantee.  It is intended to produce a concrete plan for the implementation of the Guarantee before the end of 2013. The Government intends to work with all relevant stakeholders to maximise the impact of a Youth Guarantee in Ireland.</p><p>  The scale and nature of any additional measures required for the implementation of a Guarantee at national level will depend on the trend in youth unemployment, and in particular the number of young people likely to experience periods of unemployment of more than four months under current policies.  Recent trends have been positive in this regard. The seasonally-adjusted unemployment rate for young people is now just over 26%, down from an average of over 30% last year. The seasonally-adjusted number of young people on the Live Register, at 67,000, is substantially down from the peak of 89,000 reached in late 2009. Even so, the implementation of a Guarantee will, almost certainly, require an expansion in the range of opportunities currently on offer to young people in the form of further education and training, internships, subsidised private-sector recruitment, and supports for self-employment.</p><p>  To summarise, significant political progress was made on the issue of youth unemployment during the Irish Presidency. It now remains for the recommendation on the Youth Guarantee to be implemented by individual Member States.</p></reply>

This is because persons who have gained work in excess of 30 days are considered not to be as far removed from the workforce as persons who have worked less than 30 days in the qualifying period and are therefore better suited to other interventions instead of CE. Provided the accumulated worked days do not exceed 30 at the time of application, the person will be eligible for CE.

The delivery of the Intreo service comprises a number of elements. The main elements being:</p><p>  i. The integration of the various welfare decision making processes to speed up decision making and minimise recourse to supplementary welfare payments.</p><p>  ii. The introduction of a profiling process to capture the unique characteristics and service requirements of each jobseeker.</p><p>  iii. The implementation of a systematic group activation engagement and one to one process based on clients&rsquo; profiles.</p><p>  iii. The delivery of a &lsquo;one-stop-shop&rsquo; service from an integrated office location.</p><p>  Elements (i) to (iii) are being rolled out, are already in place in most offices and will be in place in all offices by the end of the year.</p><p>  The delivery of over 60 One-Stop-Shop Intreo Offices is a major logistical property project for the Department and the Office of Public Works which is responsible for the provision of the Department&rsquo;s property requirements, including refurbishment and fit out works.  The Intreo Project requires the acquisition and development of some new properties and the re-modelling and refurbishment of others. All of this also entails the re-accomodation of staff including the transfer and set-up of IT, furniture and other utilities across multiple locations.</p><p>  Notwithstanding the complexity of such a large property programme, twelve offices are now providing the full Intreo service. Preparations are underway in other offices and it is expected that a total of 43 offices will be delivering the full Intreo service by the end of 2013.  A joint OPW/DSP Intreo Implementation Team meets every two weeks to drive the programme forward.  Progress is reported to and monitored by the Cabinet Sub-Committee on Pathways to Work, chaired by the Taoiseach, every month.  While I would like to see roll-out completed more quickly, I am satisfied that the project is being managed effectively and that the roll-out will be completed on target by the end of next year.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-07-09a.669.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013070900072#WRP00600"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 292 and 293 together. </p><p>  The Department&rsquo;s website www.welfare.ie has been redesigned to more properly reflect the full range of services the Department now delivers.  The new website represents the first phase of a multiple programme of planned activity in the website and online services area of the Department. It incorporates the major expansion of the Department in recent times and it aligns the site with the Department&rsquo;s priorities, including the activation of jobseekers and information and services for employers. It will also facilitate the delivery of more online services for customers.</p><p>  The design of the new site includes improved navigation features for all users, as well as a dedicated Intreo area (www.intreo.ie), through which employers and jobseekers can access all existing information and services in relation to supports, training and entitlements. This includes links to existing content and services held on other sites such as JobBridge, F&Aacute;S and JobsIreland; providing jobseekers and employers with one central location for their information needs.</p><p>  The new website includes a number of new online services for jobseekers including an Office Locator which provides users with immediate access to contact details for their local Intreo Centre or Social Welfare Office, as well as a Find a Job service, integrated with the Jobs Ireland website, which allows users search for jobs directly from the Department's website.  Other online services for jobseekers include online claiming and &ldquo;signing&rdquo; for Jobseeker&rsquo;s payments and a &ldquo;Close my claim&rdquo; service through which jobseekers can notify the Department when they get a job.  From July, jobseekers can also use the site to check their eligibility under the new JobsPlus incentive, which replaces the Revenue Job Assist and the Employer Job (PRSI) Incentive schemes.</p><p>  Employers can access information on the range of recruitment services, financial supports and workplace supports available to them to help generate employment and retain employees.  They can also now register online for the JobsPlus incentive, which provides a grant to employers who employ jobseekers who have spent twelve months or more on the Live Register.</p><p>  Extensive information on all of the other schemes and services provided by my Department is carried on the website, as well as a range of online services, presented in a user-friendly format. These online services allow users to claim online for a number of payments, including Child Benefit and State Pension; request statements of payments they have received; request copies of their social insurance record; submit queries and comments, and also report suspected social welfare fraud.</p><p>  1,010,780 people visited the new website from February to June 2013.  As many people would visit the site more than once and look at more than one page per visit, this translates into over 1.78 million visits and almost 7 million page views.  After the home page, the most popular pages on the website are those related to jobseekers and online services.  The new online services developed as part of the website redesign project are proving popular with users; almost 104,000 people have used the new Office Locator and over 75,000 have used the Find a Job service.</p><p>  The new technical infrastructure delivered under this project gives the Department greater flexibility in the way in which it can provide information and services to its online customers and will also facilitate the development and delivery of enhanced online services.  In particular, the new infrastructure has delivered the online JobsPlus service for employers and jobseekers, launched earlier this week.</p><p>  Following an open procurement process, Hewlett Packard (HP) Ireland Ltd were appointed as consultants on the website redesign project. The overall cost of the new website, including VAT, is &euro;569,958.  This figure includes the development of the desktop version of the site, a mobile version of the site, the first year&rsquo;s maintenance fee and 21 days additional support in the event that specific development work is required to implement new online services.</p><p>  The previous version of the website, in existence from September 2008 to January 2013, cost &euro;485,451; this figure included the development of the desktop site (but not a mobile site), three year&rsquo;s maintenance fee and 30 days additional support.  A strategic review of the Department&rsquo;s then website was undertaken in 2007 at a cost of &euro;58,000 and recommended that a full redesign of the website be initiated. All the recommendations of this review were implemented in the 2008 website redesign project.</p><p>  Given the extended range of information and services provided through the new welfare.ie site, and the greater flexibility and opportunities afforded by the site&rsquo;s new technical infrastructure, I believe the new website will prove more cost-effective than its predecessor and that the Department&rsquo;s investment in this area was justified.</p></reply>

ENPs are payable at the discretion of the officers administering the scheme taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case in order to ensure that the payments target those most in need of assistance.  Persons who consider that they have an entitlement to an ENP under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme should contact the local officials administering the scheme.</p></reply>

Expenditure for the free travel scheme in 2013 is set at &euro;77 million.</p><p>  Given the increasing number of recipients and the funding pressures, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and I established a working group with representatives from the two Departments, as well as the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the National Transport Authority to review the free travel scheme.

Mr Hinz undertook a number of trips to Ireland to Chair the meetings at no travel cost to the Exchequer with the exception of one flight for a consultation forum in September 2012 at a cost &euro;1,445.78.  Accommodation costs for all meetings were paid for my department at a total cost of &euro;1,674.00. </p><p>  The work undertaken for all of the above reports would have been supported by officials of the Department of Social Protection as part of their wider day to day duties and indeed by a range of other Departments and organisations (e.g. the Pensions Board, Central Bank, Pensions Ombudsman) and wider sectoral interests.  In general meetings in relation to the various reports were held in Departmental accommodation or in the premises of the organisation undertaking the work and did not result in further costs arising.</p><p>  A significant Consultation Forum was held in Farmleigh September 2012 with a catering cost of &euro;1,980.97.  To maximise cost efficiency, this was a joint consultation forum for both the OECD review and the Critical Reviews of the Pensions Board and the Office of the Pensions Ombudsman and involved representatives from over 50 sectoral interests. </p><p>  Actions following Review &amp;amp; Report Recommendations in 2013</p><p>  (i) In relation to the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund, the review covers a 55 year period from 2011-2066 and builds on the findings of the 2000 and 2005 actuarial reviews.  The findings in the Review inform both short to medium and long term policy development in relation to the social insurance system generally.  Projections contained with the report indicate that in the absence of any action to tackle the shortfall, the excess of expenditure over income of the Fund will increase significantly over the medium to long term.</p><p>  (ii) Regarding the OECD Review of Irish Pensions System (completed in April 2013), the review examines all aspects of pensions in Ireland covering both State pension, private, occupational and public sector pensions.  It is an extremely comprehensive report amounting to some 150 pages of analysis and commentary.  The report provides for consideration, key findings and a wide choice of suggested measures for reform which would involve a number of Government departments.   The report is now being examined in detail with a view to bringing proposals to Government setting out the roadmap for pension reform.</p><p>   (iii) The Public Service Reform Programme provided for a critical review of the integration of the regulatory functions of the Pensions Board with the Financial Regulator and the merging of the Pensions Ombudsman with the Financial Services Ombudsman. The recommendations of the review group were accepted by Government in April last.  The key recommendation from the critical review in relation to the Pensions Board is that an amalgamation of the regulatory function of the Pensions Board with the Central Bank is not recommended at this time, but that the governance structure of the Pensions Board should be restructured with two distinct arms; oversight of the Pensions Board will be undertaken by a three man body called the Pensions Authority, and a separate unpaid Pensions Council, with a majority of members representing consumer interests, will advise the Minister on pensions policy.  The relevant legislative measures to implement these changes have been provided for in the Social Welfare and Pension Bill, 2013.   The new structure is expected to be operational by year end. </p><p>  In relation to the Pensions Ombudsman, the key recommendation is to amalgamate the office with the Financial Services Ombudsman and arrangements will be put in place to provide for the implementation of this recommendation in the near future.</p><p>  (iv) The Report on Pension Charges 2012 was undertaken by my Department with the Central Bank and Pensions Board, and with support from PWC.  The primary objective of the report was to gather information on the level of pension charges levied, to assess whether these charges are reasonable and transparent, to report on the findings and to make recommendations.  The report highlights a wide range of issues in relation to pension charges and identifies that there are major challenges to be addressed in the two main areas of reasonableness and transparency of charges.  The launch of the Report on Pension Charges report was followed by a three month consultation with stakeholders.  Following the consultation period, it was agreed by Government in April 2013 that the recommendations contained in the report will be implemented, and this work has commenced.  The first task I will be giving the new Pensions Council is to monitor the implementation of the recommendations in the Report on Pension Charges and advise me if further actions are needed.</p></reply>

Notwithstanding the position of the Department (who now has responsibility for CE) in rejecting that liability for these costs to be met from public funds, this matter has been the subject of discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the unions representing CE supervisors. In the event that funding was required from the Department of Social Protection, the implementation of the claim is not considered sustainable in light of the current and ongoing fiscal environment and the requirement to contain and reduce public expenditure. The costs of the introduction of any scheme are likely to be of the order of &euro;3m per annum with retrospective costs of the order of at least &euro;30m.</p><p>  It should also note that the Department of Social Protection is not the employer of CE supervisors and such employees are not public servants. Neither was F&Aacute;S or the Department of Social Protection a party to the Labour Court dispute on this matter. The responsibilities of the sponsoring organisations and the individuals concerned must also be recognised when considering pension provision arrangements.</p></reply>

In 2011 I established the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare to meet the commitment made in the Programme for Government.  The Advisory Group is charged with, inter alia, examining and reporting on issues involved in providing social insurance cover for self-employed persons in order to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable.</p><p>  The Advisory Group&rsquo;s overall method of working is based on producing modular reports on the priority areas identified in the Terms of Reference.  Where possible, the aim is to provide recommendations that can be acted upon in time for the annual budget, estimates and legislative cycle and to allow the Government to best address its commitments under the EU-IMF Programme of Financial Support.  The Groups report on the issues involved in providing social insurance cover for self-employed persons so as to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable was submitted to me in May 2013.  The report will be published in due course.</p><p>  Any proposal to change the treatment of self-employed persons in relation to the PRSI contributions to be paid and benefit entitlements could only be considered in a Budgetary context.</p><p>  Self-employed persons whose businesses fail or suffer from reduced demand may, however, access social welfare support by establishing entitlement to assistance-based payments such as jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.  They can apply for the means-tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.  In general, their means will take account of the level of earnings in the last twelve months in determining their expected income for the following year and, in the current climate, account is taken of the downward trend in the economy.  As in the case of a non-self-employed claimant for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, the means of husband/wife, civil partner or co-habitant will be taken into account in deciding on entitlement to a payment.</p></reply>

This service provides comprehensive information and advice to mortgage holders in arrears or pre-arrears in assessing their options. The service has three elements:</p><p>- Website:  is the key online access portal for general mortgage arrears information and advice.</p><p>- Mortgage Arrears Information Helpline (phone 0761 074050): The Helpline provides general mortgage arrears information and signposting in relation to the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears,  and other supports available for those in mortgage arrears or pre-arrears. The Helpline operates Monday to Friday from 9am to 5 pm.</p><p>- Independent Financial Advice: The third element of the service is the provision of independent financial advice to mortgage holders who are being presented with long term mortgage resolution proposals by their lenders. The advice is provided by a panel of accountants drawn from members of the main accountancy institutes in Ireland. To date, over 2,000 accountants have confirmed to their accounting body that they wish to be part of the panel and their details are available on . The lender will pay &euro;250 to an accountant of the borrowers choice for the provision of this advice.</p><p>  A protocol for the provision of independent financial advice has been agreed between the main accountancy bodies and the Irish Banking Federation. The protocol was agreed following discussions which were facilitated by the Department of Finance and involved the Department of Social Protection and the Central Bank. The protocol details the scope of financial advice and the operating procedures.</p><p>  When a lender is proposing long term mortgage resolutions, the lender will advise the borrower to obtain independent financial advice on the proposed arrangement and that, if the borrower wishes to avail of this advice, that the lender will pay the consultation fee.  The independent financial advice will be available to all mortgage holders in respect of a mortgage secured on a primary residence who are being offered long term forbearance options by their lenders. The borrower may select an accountant of their choice from a panel of practising accountants whose details are available on the website .</p><p>  In addition to these supports, the Department also administers a mortgage interest supplement scheme which provides short term support to eligible people who are unable to meet their mortgage interest repayments. There are currently some 12,000 people in receipt of mortgage interest supplement for which almost &euro;42 million has been provided by the Government in 2013.</p><p>  The Central Bank has recently introduced a revised Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) which came into effect on 1 July 2013. Within this framework, mortgage interest supplement continues to provide suitable support with eligible persons having to engage with alternative payment options for a cumulative twelve month period under the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) prior to the supplement being granted. This process acknowledges that it is in the interest of both the lender and the borrower to address financial difficulties as speedily and effectively as circumstances allow.</p><p>  Where a person has been assessed as having a housing need, the person concerned can apply for rent supplement administered by this Department which is available to provide short-term support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source. There are currently approximately 84,000 customers in receipt of rent supplement for which the Government has provided over &euro;403 million for the scheme in 2013.</p><p>  I am satisfied that the Department has the appropriate services and supports in place to assist people experiencing financial difficulties.  The development of housing solution responses for those who are required to vacate their homes is a matter for the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.</p></reply>

These processing times are calculated from the registration date of the appeal to the date of its finalisation.  They include all activities during this period including time spent awaiting any clarification from the appellant, time in the Department for comments by the Deciding Officer on the grounds of appeal put forward by the appellant, and any further investigation, examination or assessment by the Department&rsquo;s Inspectors and Medical Assessors that is deemed necessary.

In order to manage this increasing workload, significant resources and efforts have been put into reducing backlogs and improving appeals processing times for appellants, including the assignment of 15 additional Appeals Officers, in addition to 10 former Community Welfare Service Appeals Officers who joined the appeals office in 2011, bringing the total number of serving Appeals Officers to 41; reviewing and improving business processes; and implementing a new operating model within the appeals office.</p><p>  In addition, a major programme of process redesign and modernisation is currently underway in the Department in relation to many of its scheme areas, aimed at reducing backlogs and reducing the time taken by the Department to respond to requests from the appeals office for submissions in relation to appeals.</p><p>  These measures have led to improvements in processing times and a significant increase in the number of appeals finalised from 17,787 in 2009 to 32,558 in 2012.  The Chief Appeals Officer expects to finalise 6,000 more cases in 2013 than in 2012.  Good progress is also now being made in reducing the number of appeals on hand from 20,414 at 1 January 2013 to 16,542 at 1 July 2013.</p><p>  The average waiting time for appeals peaked in 2011 when the average time for an oral hearing was 52.5 weeks and for a summary decision was 25.1 weeks.  In 2012 these times improved by 10.3 weeks when the average time for an oral hearing dropped to 39.5 weeks while the time for a summary decision increased slightly to 27.8 weeks.  This improvement has continued with the average processing time up to June 2013 reducing to 36.2 weeks for an oral hearing and 27.6 weeks for a summary decision.  By its nature and because it is a quasi-judicial function, the processing of appeals takes time and reflects the fact that, by definition, the appeal process cannot be a quick one.</p></reply>

In 2013, the Citizens Information Board has been allocated some &euro;47.4 million from the exchequer of which some &euro;19 million has been assigned to MABS and &euro;14.6 million has been assigned to the Citizens Information Services.  The corresponding allocation to the Citizens Information Board in 2012 was &euro;46.8 million of which some &euro;18.3 million was allocated to MABS and &euro;14.6 million for the Citizens Information Services.</p><p>The Citizens Information Board is responsible for ensuring that all appropriate governance arrangements are in place in relation to the expenditure of these public funds.  It is essential that this significant amount of public monies is carefully monitored and properly accounted for, in terms of financial accountability, effective performance and excellent delivery of quality services to the customer and taxpayer, who ultimately funds these services.  The Board is responsible for ensuring that all appropriate governance arrangements are in place in relation to the expenditure of these public funds.</p><p>An important element of assessing accountability is through the formal arrangement of Service Level Agreements.  These contracts are agreed by the governing board of the Citizens Information Board and cover standard items such as service delivery, governance, financial controls, HR practices, reporting, evaluation, monitoring etc.  This enables the Board to ensure that excellent service and best value is achieved across the wide range of services it provides.</p><p>With regard to the 2013 Agreement 42 CIS companies, the Citizens Information Phone Service, the Sign Language Interpreting Service and 28 MABS companies have to date signed a Service Agreement with the Citizens Information Board.  The Citizens Information Board is engaging with the remaining companies to resolve outstanding matters and following consultation with the MABS and CIS network is bringing forward a longer term contract to govern the period to end 2016.  I am confident this will secure the agreement of all and would like to assure the Deputy that there is no risk to service delivery and all parties are fully engaged in ensuring that the excellent service to those most in need continues as required.</p><p>There are 205.29 whole time equivalent (WTE) staff in the local Money Advice and Budgeting Service with an additional 12 WTE temporary Resource Money Advisors assigned to MABS early 2012 for a 2 year contract.

In 2013, the Citizens Information Board has been allocated a budget of approximately &euro;47.5 million of which some &euro;19 million has been assigned to MABS.  In 2012 the corresponding allocation was &euro;46.8 million and &euro;18.3 million respectively. </p><p>  The Money Advice and Budgeting Service is made up of a network of 53 companies, which includes 51 local companies and 2 national companies MABS National Development Limited and National Traveller MABS.  There are some 277 money advice staff employed across the MABS network. </p><p>  The Personal Insolvency Act 2012 provides for a Debt Relief Notice for persons with no assets or income with unsecured debts of up to &euro;20,000.  With the assistance of an approved intermediary, a person may apply for a Debt Relief Notice which will allow for the full write-off of qualifying unsecured debt after a three year supervision period.  The Citizens Information Board (CIB), which has the statutory responsibility for the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) has agreed to my request that MABS be an approved intermediary for the purpose of processing applications for Debt Relief Notices.  Those who can avail of Debt Relief Notices are typically part of the MABS core client cohort of people on low incomes in debt or in danger of falling into debt. </p><p>  I am very pleased that sanction has been given for 16 temporary staff to be assigned to MABS for up to 2 years, to establish an Approved Intermediary Service as part of the new Insolvency Service.  The CIB and MABS National Development Limited are working closely to ensure that the appropriate structures are in place within MABS to implement this new and important statutory role.  Over 100 Money Advisers have been trained and accredited by the University of Ulster, and all MABS staff have been trained on the core elements of the Personal Insolvency legislation.  An Approved intermediary Service Transition Unit has been established to provide a flexible national resource across services.  CIB and MABS are also engaging proactively with the Insolvency Service to ensure that the Approved Intermediary Service is fully operational in time for the commencement of service.</p><p>  I am satisfied that MABS will play an important role in the new arrangements for dealing with debt and will continue to provide a high quality personal service to assist people in overcoming their indebtedness and managing their finances.</p></reply>

This will begin in 2014 with the abolition of the State pension (transition) thereby standardising State pension age for all at 66 years.  The State pension age will be further increased to 67 years in 2021 and to 68 years in 2028.  These changes apply to all fully insured employees.  For anyone who is age 66 in January 2015 and provided they meet the qualifying conditions for State pension, the State pension will be available to them. </p><p>  There will be no gap year, as described by the Deputy, for anyone who is aged 66 in 2015 provided they meet the qualifying criteria for the State pension.  Social welfare payments are made up to the age of 66.  The main social welfare payment available to those who leave employment before pension age is jobseekers benefit.  Persons who qualify for a job seekers payment who are aged between 65 and 66 years are generally entitled to receive payment up to the date on which they reach pensionable age (66 years).</p><p>  Raising State pension age and the abolition of the State pension (transition) is a necessary step in ensuring the sustainability of pensions into the future.  The recently published OECD report on the Review of the Irish Pension System confirms that reforms are necessary if we are to continue to put pension provision on a sustainable footing given the changes in demographics, the deficit in the Social Insurance Fund, and the difficult fiscal situation.</p></reply>

The habitual residence condition (HRC), as provided for in section 246 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 2005 (as amended), applies to claims for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, non-contributory State pension, blind pension, non-contributory widow&rsquo;s and widower&rsquo;s pensions and guardian&rsquo;s payment, one-parent family payment, carer&rsquo;s allowance, disability allowance, supplementary welfare allowance including rent supplement, and child benefit.  A person who does not have a right to reside in the State shall not be regarded as being habitually resident in the State.  HRC does not apply to exceptional needs or urgent needs payments under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.</p><p>  Each case received for a determination on HRC is dealt with in its own right and a decision is based on application of the legislation and guidelines to the particular individual circumstances of each case.

The scheme has made very significant progress since it came into operation in July 2011.  As at 27 June 2013, some 18,587 internship placements have commenced to date with 5,934 participants currently undertaking internships and 1,936 internship posts available on the JobBridge website.  The independent evaluation conducted by Indecon Economic Consultants, which I published recently, found that 61% of interns who finish placements secure employment within five months.

There are approximately 84,000 rent supplement recipients, of which over 53,000 have been in receipt of the payment for over 18 months.

It is noted that the areas experiencing most referrals to appeal are those areas experiencing the highest volumes of claim applications.  There has been a rapid and sustained increase in the number of appeals received in the Social Welfare Appeals Office since 2009 which has placed extraordinary pressure on the office.  Up to 2009, the average number of appeals received was 15,000 per annum whereas in 2012, the office received 35,484 appeals.  To manage this increasing workload, significant resources and efforts have been put into reducing backlogs and improving appeals processing times for appellants, including the assignment of 15 additional Appeals Officers, in addition to 10 former Community Welfare Service Appeals Officers who joined the appeals office in 2011, bringing the total number of serving Appeals Officers to 41; reviewing and improving business processes; and implementing a new operating model within the appeals office.</p><p>In addition, a major programme of process redesign and modernisation is under way in the Department in relation to many of its scheme areas, aimed at reducing backlogs and reducing the time taken by the Department to respond to requests from the appeals office for submissions in relation to appeals.  These measures have led to improvements in processing times and a significant increase in the number of appeals finalised from 17,787 in 2009 to 32,558 in 2012.  The Chief Appeals Officer expects to finalise 6,000 more cases in 2013 than in 2012.  Good progress is also now being made in reducing the number of appeals on hand from 20,414 at 1 January 2013 to 16,542 at 1 July 2013.  The average waiting time for appeals peaked in 2011 when the average time for an oral hearing was 52.5 weeks and for a summary decision was 25.1 weeks.  In 2012, these times improved by 10.3 weeks when the average time for an oral hearing dropped to 39.5 weeks while the time for a summary decision increased slightly to 27.8 weeks.  This improvement has continued with the average processing time up to June 2013 reducing to 36.2 weeks for an oral hearing and 27.6 weeks for a summary decision.</p><p>These processing times are calculated from the registration date of the appeal to the date of its finalisation.  They include all activities during this period including time spent awaiting any clarification from the appellant, time in the Department for comments by the Deciding Officer on the grounds of appeal put forward by the appellant, and any further investigation, examination or assessment by the Department&rsquo;s Inspectors and Medical Assessors that is deemed necessary.  For example, in cases of schemes which include medical criteria such as disability allowance or invalidity pension, the time taken by the Department may include a review by a different medical assessor to the one who initially examined the case, and there may even be a third review by a medical assessor if additional medical evidence is submitted.  A considerable period of time is added when an oral hearing is required because of the logistics involved in this process.  While this process carries an inherent delay in terms of finalising an appeal, it also crystallises the flexibility and accessibility of the appeals system.  By its nature and because it is a quasi-judicial function, the processing of appeals takes time and reflects the fact that, by definition, the appeal process cannot be a quick one.  However, if an appellant&rsquo;s means are insufficient to meet their needs, it is open to them to contact their local Community Welfare Services concerning their eligibility for Supplementary Welfare Allowance while their appeal is pending.</p><p><b>Appeals Receipts 01/01/2013 &ndash; 30/06/2013</b></p><p><table><tr><th>-</th><th>2009</th><th>2010</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th> 2013 (to 30/6/2013)</th></tr><tr><td>Adoptive Benefit</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>6</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Blind Pension</td><td>21</td><td>14</td><td>21</td><td>27</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><td>Carers Allowance</td><td>1,977</td><td>3,025</td><td>2,199</td><td>2,676</td><td>2,171</td></tr><tr><td>Carers Benefit</td><td>121</td><td>182</td><td>160</td><td>183</td><td>56</td></tr><tr><td>Child Benefit</td><td>1,361</td><td>1,051</td><td>824</td><td>675</td><td>329</td></tr><tr><td>Disability Allowance</td><td>4,696</td><td>4,840</td><td>5,472</td><td>6,223</td><td>3,006</td></tr><tr><td>Illness Benefit</td><td>4,945</td><td>5,471</td><td>3,657</td><td>2,647</td><td>887</td></tr><tr><td>Invalidity Pension</td><td>642</td><td>1,024</td><td>2,285</td><td>4,765</td><td>2,344</td></tr><tr><td>Domiciliary Care</td><td>836</td><td>1,858</td><td>2,401</td><td>2,186</td><td>688</td></tr><tr><td>Deserted Wives Allowance</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>4</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Deserted Wives Benefit</td><td>5</td><td>14</td><td>20</td><td>8</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Farm Assist</td><td>137</td><td>244</td><td>220</td><td>271</td><td>157</td></tr><tr><td>Bereavement Grant</td><td>46</td><td>58</td><td>66</td><td>71</td><td>34</td></tr><tr><td>Family Income Supplement</td><td>170</td><td>227</td><td>258</td><td>301</td><td>187</td></tr><tr><td>Liable Relatives</td><td>25</td><td>16</td><td>26</td><td>39</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>One Parent Family Payment</td><td>805</td><td>1,109</td><td>1,055</td><td>938</td><td>294</td></tr><tr><td>Maternity Benefit</td><td>11</td><td>29</td><td>42</td><td>29</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>Homemakers</td><td>-</td><td>1</td><td>-</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Partial Capacity Benefit</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>67</td><td>41</td></tr><tr><td>State Pension (Contributory)</td><td>88</td><td>256</td><td>106</td><td>128</td><td>73</td></tr><tr><td>State Pension (Non-Contributory)</td><td>319</td><td>356</td><td>317</td><td>231</td><td>114</td></tr><tr><td>State Pension (Transition)</td><td>22</td><td>7</td><td>29</td><td>43</td><td>19</td></tr><tr><td>Occupational Injury Benefit</td><td>37</td><td>23</td><td>16</td><td>13</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Occupational Injury (Medical)</td><td>42</td><td>21</td><td>5</td><td>6</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Disablement Pension</td><td>263</td><td>342</td><td>263</td><td>409</td><td>172</td></tr><tr><td>Incapacity Supplement</td><td>8</td><td>15</td><td>6</td><td>21</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Guardian's Payment (Contributory)</td><td>23</td><td>28</td><td>31</td><td>46</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>Guardian's Payment (Non-Contributory)</td><td>11</td><td>6</td><td>13</td><td>14</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Pre-Retirement Allowance</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Jobseeker's Allowance (Means)</td><td>3,615</td><td>4,050</td><td>3,465</td><td>3,240</td><td>1,496</td></tr><tr><td>Jobseeker's Allowance</td><td>3,179</td><td>5,503</td><td>3,399</td><td>3,049</td><td>1,344</td></tr><tr><td>Jobseeker's Benefit</td><td>1,354</td><td>1,307</td><td>1,286</td><td>1,289</td><td>457</td></tr><tr><td>Jobseeker's Fraud Control</td><td>-</td><td>3</td><td>5</td><td>1</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Respite Care Grant</td><td>262</td><td>162</td><td>303</td><td>278</td><td>84</td></tr><tr><td>Insurability of Employment</td><td>102</td><td>123</td><td>99</td><td>79</td><td>40</td></tr><tr><td>Supplementary Welfare  Allowance</td><td>789</td><td>1,020</td><td>3,129</td><td>5,445</td><td>2,270</td></tr><tr><td>Treatment Benefits</td><td>10</td><td>8</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Survivor's Pension (Contributory)</td><td>15</td><td>20</td><td>17</td><td>30</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><td>Survivor's Pension (Non-Contributory)</td><td>19</td><td>12</td><td>29</td><td>39</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>Widows Parent Grant</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>7</td><td>6</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Death Benefit</td><td>1</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>All Appeals</td><td>25,963</td><td>32,432</td><td>31,241</td><td>35,484</td><td>16,379</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The simplification and reduction of application forms complements the introduction of more streamlined processes.  </p><p>  The key principles underpinning the design of the Department's application forms are the use of clear and simple language, with consistent layout and presentation across both online and paper forms.  All primary application forms are designed to facilitate the use of scanning and automated processing.  This ensures that the application is processed as efficiently as possible and that customers receive their entitlement in a timely manner.  Primary application forms are regularly reviewed to ensure they request only the information required to establish the customer's entitlement, in a clear and easy to understand manner.</p><p>  Staff in the Department's local and branch offices and Intreo centres provide information and guidance to customers on the completion of application forms when required.  In addition, the Citizens Information Board, through its network of offices around the State provides information, advice and advocacy services to members of the public on a wide range of public and social services, including assistance in completing application forms. </p><p>All primary application forms are also available on the Department's website,   .  Applications for a number of schemes, including the new JobsPlus incentive, child benefit, State pension (contributory), widow(er)'s or surviving civil partner's contributory pension, household benefits and, in certain cases, jobseeker's payments, can be completed and submitted online.  </p><p>  The use of online application forms reduces the administrative burden for the customer and facilitates efficient processing of claims by the Department.  I am satisfied that the ongoing initiatives underway in the Department,  the improvements to processes and procedures supported by the redesign of application forms, and the Department's use of modern technology will continue to deliver an improved and efficient service to customers.</p></reply>

It is the Department&rsquo;s policy that every effort is made to prevent overpayments but, where they occur, they should be regarded as a debt to the Exchequer and every effort must be made to recover the amounts through all available means. </p><p>  Those clients who are aware that they are being - or have been - overpaid by my Department should contact their local social welfare office immediately.  An overpayment recovery plan, acceptable both to the customer and to the Department, will then be agreed.  The general approach is that the recovery amount proposed will be the maximum repayment that the debtor can afford in order to recover the overpayment as quickly as possible.</p><p>  My Department is fully committed to recovering 100% of overpayments.  Debt holders should be aware that a departmental debt will remain on their records until fully recovered and will result in a reduction of all future entitlements up to and including state pension.  Following the death of a customer who owes a debt, the Department will have a claim on any estate remaining. </p><p>  In the context of the Fraud Initiative 2011 &ndash; 2013, the Department is reviewing its overall approach to debt recovery.  Effective debt recovery is seen as an integral part of the deterrent to fraudulent claiming.  </p><p>  In this regard, section 13 of the Social Welfare Act, 2012, allows for a deduction of up to 15% from a person&rsquo;s weekly personal rate to be deducted for the purposes of recovering an overpayment.  It is not the Department&rsquo;s intention to make deductions that are likely to visit hardship on beneficiaries.  The new provisions preserve a minimum entitlement of up to 85% of a beneficiary&rsquo;s personal payment in all cases of overpayment, leaving increases for dependants intact.  </p><p>  It is envisaged that this measure, along with a range of other options that are currently being considered by the Department, will serve to minimise overpayments in the future, as well as increasing the rate of recoveries where overpayments arise.</p></reply>

The market has since developed into a well-regulated market, supporting a multiplicity of commercial operators, providing services over a diverse range of technology platforms.  Details of broadband services available in each county, including Counties Wicklow and Carlow, can be found on ComReg&rsquo;s website at <i>www.callcosts.ie</i>.</p><p>The State can only intervene to ensure access to broadband services in areas where the competitive market has failed to deliver such services, as in the case of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS) and the Rural Broadband Scheme.  Broadband services under the NBS are available since October 2010 from the NBS service provider, &ldquo;3&rdquo;, to persons with a fixed residence or fixed business in all of the designated NBS Electoral Divisions.  In County Carlow, 6 of the 54 EDs are covered under the NBS while in County Wicklow, 37 of the 82 EDs are included in the NBS, details of which are shown in the tables below.  The combination of private investment and State interventions means that Ireland has met the EU Commission&rsquo;s Digital Agenda for Europe target of having a basic broadband service available to all areas by 2013.</p><p>With basic broadband services widely available across Ireland, the focus is now on accelerating the roll out of high speed services.  The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August last, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed services of 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses, in advance of the EU&rsquo;s target date of 2020, and that significantly higher speeds are available to as many homes and businesses as possible.</p><p>During the preparation of Ireland&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, the commercial market operators indicated that they expect to provide 70Mbps to 100Mbps services to 50% of the population by 2015.  Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway in both fixed line and mobile high speed broadband services, particularly in urban and semi-urban areas.</p><p>In tandem with these commercial developments, intensive work is underway in my Department to progress a State-led investment to secure the countrywide introduction of next generation broadband access.</p><p>In order to progress the State-led investment, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained.  My officials have just commenced a comprehensive mapping exercise of the current and anticipated investment by the commercial sector to identify where the market is expected to succeed and fail in the delivery of high speed broadband services over the coming years.</p><p>The results of this mapping exercise will inform the level of Government interaction that may be required and the areas that need to be targeted in the State-led investment so as to deliver on the targets for high speed broadband contained in the National Broadband Plan.</p><p>Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations including stakeholder engagement will be ongoing throughout 2013 with a view to the launch of a procurement process in 2014.</p><p>Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, we are committed to increasing the availability of next generation speeds significantly, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in a digitally enabled society.</p><p><table><tr><th>National Broadband Scheme (NBS)</th></tr><tr><td>Electoral Divisions (ED) covered by the NBS in County Carlow</td></tr></table></p><p><table><tr><th>ED Name ED Reference No.</th><th>ED Reference No.</th></tr><tr><td>CLONMORE ED</td><td>17014</td></tr><tr><td>COONOGUE ED</td><td>17015</td></tr><tr><td>HACKETSTOWN ED</td><td>17022</td></tr><tr><td>HAROLDSTOWN ED</td><td>17023</td></tr><tr><td>RIDGE ED</td><td>17043</td></tr><tr><td>TIKNOCK ED</td><td>17048</td></tr></table></p><p><table><tr><th>National Broadband Scheme (NBS)</th></tr><tr><td>Electoral Divisions (ED) covered by the NBS in County Wicklow</td></tr></table></p><p><table><tr><th>ED Name ED Reference No.</th><th>ED Reference No.</th></tr><tr><td>ARKLOW RURAL ED</td><td>257003</td></tr><tr><td>BALLINACOR ED</td><td>257007</td></tr><tr><td>BALLINDERRY ED</td><td>257008</td></tr><tr><td>BALLINGLEN ED</td><td>257010</td></tr><tr><td>BALLINGUILE ED</td><td>257011</td></tr><tr><td>BALLYARTHUR ED</td><td>257012</td></tr><tr><td>BALLYBEG ED</td><td>257013</td></tr><tr><td>COOLBALLINTAGGART ED</td><td>257023</td></tr><tr><td>COOLBOY ED</td><td>257024</td></tr><tr><td>CRONELEA ED</td><td>257026</td></tr><tr><td>DONAGHMORE ED</td><td>257028</td></tr><tr><td>DUNGANSTOWN EAST ED</td><td>257030</td></tr><tr><td>DUNGANSTOWN SOUTH ED</td><td>257031</td></tr><tr><td>DUNGANSTOWN WEST ED</td><td>257032</td></tr><tr><td>EADESTOWN ED</td><td>257034</td></tr><tr><td>ENNEREILLY ED</td><td>257035</td></tr><tr><td>GLENDALOUGH ED</td><td>257037</td></tr><tr><td>GLENEALY ED</td><td>257038</td></tr><tr><td>HARTSTOWN ED</td><td>257040</td></tr><tr><td>HOLLYWOOD ED</td><td>257041</td></tr><tr><td>HUMEWOOD ED</td><td>257042</td></tr><tr><td>IMAEL NORTH ED</td><td>257043</td></tr><tr><td>IMAEL SOUTH ED</td><td>257044</td></tr><tr><td>KILBALLYOWEN ED</td><td>257045</td></tr><tr><td>KILBRIDE ED</td><td>257046</td></tr><tr><td>KILLINURE ED</td><td>257049</td></tr><tr><td>KILPIPE ED</td><td>257052</td></tr><tr><td>KNOCKRATH ED</td><td>257053</td></tr><tr><td>LUGGLASS ED</td><td>257055</td></tr><tr><td>MONEYSTOWN ED</td><td>257057</td></tr><tr><td>OLDTOWN ED</td><td>257060</td></tr><tr><td>RATH ED</td><td>257063</td></tr><tr><td>RATHDANGAN ED</td><td>257064</td></tr><tr><td>TALBOTSTOWN ED</td><td>257069</td></tr><tr><td>THE GRANGE ED</td><td>257070</td></tr><tr><td>TOGHER ED</td><td>257073</td></tr><tr><td>TROOPERSTOWN ED</td><td>257075</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Following completion of the exercise a separate map based on electoral divisions (EDs), which are the smallest administrative areas used for statistical purposes in the country, was developed.  Where an ED was completely or substantially served by existing service providers it was excluded from the NBS.  Broadband services under the NBS are available since October 2010 from the NBS service provider, &ldquo;3&rdquo;, to persons with a fixed residence or fixed business in all of the designated NBS Electoral Divisions.  In County Monaghan 29 out of the 70 EDs were identified as eligible for inclusion in the NBS, which are shown in the table below.</p><p>In May 2011, the Government launched a separate broadband initiative, namely the Rural Broadband Scheme (RBS).  The RBS was established to enable a basic broadband service to be provided to individual rural premises, which were not capable of obtaining a broadband service from existing Internet service providers.  119 applicants from County Monaghan received offers from service providers participating in this Scheme of which 25 accepted an offer of service.</p><p>With basic broadband services widely available across Ireland, the focus is now on accelerating the roll out of high speed services.  The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August last, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed services of 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses, in advance of the EU&rsquo;s target date of 2020, and that significantly higher speeds are available to as many homes and businesses as possible.</p><p>During the preparation of Ireland&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, the commercial market operators indicated that they expect to provide 70Mbps to 100Mbps services to 50% of the population by 2015.  Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway in both fixed line and mobile high speed broadband services, particularly in urban and semi-urban areas.</p><p>In tandem with these commercial developments, intensive work is underway in my Department to progress a State-led investment to secure the countrywide introduction of next generation broadband access.</p><p>In order to progress the State-led investment, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained.  My officials have just commenced a comprehensive mapping exercise of the current and anticipated investment by the commercial sector to identify where the market is expected to succeed and fail in the delivery of high speed broadband services over the coming years.</p><p>The results of this mapping exercise will inform the level of Government interaction that may be required and the areas that need to be targeted in the State-led investment so as to deliver on the targets for high speed broadband contained in the National Broadband Plan.</p><p>Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations including stakeholder engagement will be ongoing throughout 2013 with a view to the launch of a procurement process in 2014.</p><p>Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, we are committed to increasing the availability of next generation speeds significantly, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in a digitally enabled society.</p><p><table><tr><th>National Broadband Scheme (NBS)</th></tr><tr><td>Electoral Divisions (ED) covered by the NBS in County Monaghan</td></tr></table></p><p><table><tr><th><div>ED Name ED Reference No.</div></th><th><div>ED Reference No.</div></th></tr><tr><td>AGHABOG </td><td><div>ED 177001</div></td></tr><tr><td>ANNAYALLA </td><td><div>ED 177003</div></td></tr><tr><td>BELLATRAIN </td><td><div>ED 177009</div></td></tr><tr><td>BOCKS </td><td><div>ED 177010</div></td></tr><tr><td>BROOMFIELD </td><td><div>ED 177012</div></td></tr><tr><td>CARRICKASLANE </td><td><div>ED 177014</div></td></tr><tr><td>CARRICKATEE </td><td><div>ED 177015</div></td></tr><tr><td>CHURCH HILL </td><td><div>ED 177021</div></td></tr><tr><td>CORMEEN </td><td><div>ED 177026</div></td></tr><tr><td>CREEVE </td><td><div>ED 177028</div></td></tr><tr><td>CREMARTIN </td><td><div>ED 177029</div></td></tr><tr><td>CROSSALARE </td><td><div>ED 177030</div></td></tr><tr><td>CURRIN </td><td><div>ED 177031</div></td></tr><tr><td>DERRYGORRY </td><td><div>ED 177033</div></td></tr><tr><td>DRUM </td><td><div>ED 177035</div></td></tr><tr><td>DRUMCARROW </td><td><div>ED 177037</div></td></tr><tr><td>DRUMGURRA </td><td><div>ED 177038</div></td></tr><tr><td>DRUMMULLY </td><td><div>ED 177040</div></td></tr><tr><td>GLASLOUGH </td><td><div>ED 177046</div></td></tr><tr><td>GREAGH </td><td><div>ED 177047</div></td></tr><tr><td>KILLEEVAN </td><td><div>ED 177049</div></td></tr><tr><td>KILLYNENAGH </td><td><div>ED 177051</div></td></tr><tr><td>KILMURRY </td><td><div>ED 177053</div></td></tr><tr><td>LARAGH </td><td><div>ED 177055</div></td></tr><tr><td>MULLYASH </td><td><div>ED 177060</div></td></tr><tr><td>NEWBLISS </td><td><div>ED 177061</div></td></tr><tr><td>SHANMULLAGH </td><td><div>ED 177065</div></td></tr><tr><td>SHESKIN </td><td><div>ED 177066</div></td></tr><tr><td>TEHALLEN </td><td><div>ED 177069</div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

Where a person ceases to be a member before age 50, whether voluntarily or as a result of failure to be re-elected, the gratuity will be paid when the person reaches age 50 and will be based on the representational payment applicable at that point. The Local Authority Members (Gratuity) (Amendment) Regulations, 2006 allows the gratuity to be paid before age 50 where retirement is due to permanent infirmity or where the member dies in office. </p><p>  The amount of the gratuity is calculated on the basis of 4/20ths of a Councillor's Representational Payment for each year of service from 4 May 2000, subject to a maximum twenty years' service (i.e. four times the amount of the Representational Payment at the time of retirement). </p><p>  An additional <i>ex-gratia</i> payment may be made to Councillors serving on or after the date of the making of the 2006 Regulations in respect of service before 4 May 2000. The rates to be applied are dependent on the number of years' service and the category of local authority in which the Councillor served. Circular Letter S.3/2007 of 22 January 2007, issued by my Department, set the rate of payment of the ex-gratia payment at &euro;714.23 for each year of service up to 20 years' service with a County Council or what was at the time a County Borough Corporation, at &frac12; this rate for service with what was at the time a Borough Corporation or an Urban District Council, and at &frac14; this rate for service as a Town Commissioner. For service in excess of 20 years prior to 4 May 2000, the foregoing rates are reduced by 1/3rd for each additional year of service up to 20 years.  There is an overall limit of 40 years' service for the gratuity and ex-gratia payment combined, with the service reckoned for the purposes of a gratuity calculated first and the residual number of years being used to calculate any ex-gratia payment.   </p><p>  Having regard to the democratic process, it is not possible for local authorities to forecast the number of current elected members who will retire or fail to retain their seats following the forthcoming local elections.  In this context, local authorities are expected to be prudent in making a provision for potential gratuity payments in their annual budgets as part of the normal budgetary process.</p></reply>

This year I allocated local authorities the full amount of their contractual commitments, and the balance of the available funding was allocated on the basis of each authority&rsquo;s share of the new applications on hand in January 2013.  A small capital reserve was set aside to deal with any acute or particular difficulty which might arise in the operation of the schemes over the course of the year. Following requests from 13 local authorities for supplementary funding, I subsequently approved additional allocations totalling &euro;1.2 million.  I am continuing to keep the position in regard to funding under active review.   </p><p>  My Department is currently reviewing the operation of the grant schemes in consultation with the local authorities and groups representing older people and people with disabilities. I acknowledge the supports provided by other public bodies and agencies in facilitating older people and people with disabilities to continue living independently in their own homes. My Department will continue to explore all opportunities to stretch the available resources, including through co-operation with the Health Service Executive, in order to extend the benefits of the grant schemes to as many households as possible.</p></reply>

Domestic waste water treatment systems are defined in the Act and include all drains associated with the discharge of domestic waste water, whether or not they discharge to a septic tank or waste water tank.  Irrespective of the age or type of system in place, if there is no evidence of risk to human health or the environment, no action will be necessary.   </p><p>  The Act also assigns responsibility to the Environmental Protection Agency to make a National Inspection Plan for domestic wastewater treatment systems.  The National Inspection Plan 2013: Domestic Waste Water Treatment Systems was published by the EPA in February 2013.  Details of the minimum number of inspections for each county are included in the Plan. It is the responsibility of the water services authorities to implement the Inspection Plan in their functional areas.  There will be no charge for inspections.     </p><p>  The Local Authority Services National Training Group, in consultation with my Department, the EPA and the water services authorities, has overseen the development and delivery of a training course for the local authority officials who will carry out inspections under the 2012 Act. The EPA is responsible for appointing as inspectors the officials who have satisfactorily completed the training course and meet other qualification criteria regarding professional or technical qualifications and indemnity insurance cover. </p><p>  Inspections will be objective, evidence-based and aimed at identifying systems which are a risk to public health or the environment.  There is no question of applying new standards, for example those of the EPA&rsquo;s 2009 Code of Practice, to older on-site systems, nor is there any question of a householder being directed to acquire additional land to facilitate remediation works.  Where an inspection reveals a problem with a domestic waste water treatment system, issues such as existing site size, hydrological and geological conditions etc. will be considered so as to identify the most appropriate, pragmatic and cost-effective remediation works required. With regard to the grants scheme for remediation of domestic waste water treatment systems, I refer to the reply to Questions 175 and 176 of 3 July 2013 which sets out the position.</p></reply>

The Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) was established as an independent statutory body under the Act to operate a national tenancy registration system and to resolve disputes between landlords and tenants in the sector. </p><p>  The PRTB replaces the Courts for the vast majority of landlord and tenant disputes. For a fee of &euro;25, parties to a dispute can apply to the PRTB for adjudication or mediation services. If either of the parties to the dispute is unhappy with the decision of an adjudicator, they can appeal that decision to the tenancy Tribunal within 21 days of the date of receiving the decision. Tribunals are heard by a panel of three members of the Dispute Resolution Committee of the PRTB. An adjudication decision that is not appealed to the Tribunal within 21 days will become a binding Determination Order of the PRTB. In instances of non-compliance parties can request enforcement of this Order through the Courts. </p><p>  Section 123 of the Residential Tenancies Act provides that a determination of the Tribunal may be appealed to the High Court on a point of law and that the decision of the High Court on that appeal is final and conclusive.</p></reply>

This scheme was extended nationally in June 2012, targeting those low income families whose mortgage situation is unsustainable and where there is little or no prospect of a significant change in circumstances in the foreseeable future. The scheme ensures that the family remains in their home, while ownership is transferred to an approved housing body who in turn rent it to the original owners. Eligibility requirements are in line with other forms of social housing support.  To date, over 1,217 cases have been submitted by lenders.  Of these, 415 borrowers have been engaged with or are in the process of being engaged with by the lender.  A total of 47 sales have now been completed. </p><p>  A pilot mortgage to rent scheme for the most acute cases of local authority mortgage arrears is currently being operated by Westmeath County and Dublin City Councils.

The Charge is set at &euro;200 and liability for it falls, in the main, on owners of rental, holiday and vacant properties.  Section 6 of the 2009 Act, as amended, provides that the owner of a liable property who fails to pay the Charge is, in addition to his or her being liable to pay the Charge, liable to pay to the relevant local authority a &euro;20 late payment fee in respect of each month or part of a month in which the Charge, any late payment fee, or any part of such Charge or fee, remains unpaid.</p><p>  Under the Act, it is a function of a local authority to collect Non-principal Private Residence Charges and late payment fees due to it and all Charges and late payment fees imposed and payable to a local authority are under the care and management of the local authority concerned.  In this regard, application of the legislation in particular circumstances is a matter for the relevant local authority. Interpretation of the legislation is a matter for legal advice in individual cases and ultimately a matter for the Courts.  I have issued guidelines to local authorities in relation to the operation of the &ldquo;care and management&rdquo; provisions of the legislation in instances in which genuine hardship in having to discharge a liability in a single payment can be demonstrated. In such cases, local authorities may enter into payment arrangements for the discharge of outstanding liabilities in instalments over a specified period.</p></reply>

In relation to estates which have been completed to the satisfaction of the planning authority in accordance with the permission, section 180 provides that the planning authority must if requested to do so by the developer or by the majority of the qualified electors who are owners of the houses involved, initiate the procedures in section 11 of the Roads Act 1993 for declaring the road(s) to be public roads, for whose maintenance the local authority will then be responsible.</p><p>  Section 11 of the Roads Act empowers a local authority, by order, to declare any road over which a public right of way exists to be a public road. Before making an order the local authority must be satisfied the road is of general public utility, consider the financial implications of taking the road in charge and consult with the public/consider any objections received. The consideration of the objections and the making of the order declaring the road to be a public road is a reserved function, so that the decision whether to take the road in charge is ultimately one for the discretion of the elected members.</p><p>  In relation to estates which have not been completed to the satisfaction of the planning authority, and enforcement proceedings have not been commenced within the relevant period, section 180 also provides that the planning authority must, if requested to do so by the majority of the owners, initiate the procedures in section 11 of the Roads Act. However, in this case the section provides that the provision in section 11 of the Roads Act requiring the authority to consider the financial implications of taking the road in charge is to be disregarded.  Section 180 also provides that where a planning authority, in complying with section 180, makes an order under section 11 of the Roads Act, it must also take in charge any open spaces, car parks, sewers, watermains, or drains within the attendant grounds of the development.</p><p>  Section 180 was amended in the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2010 to provide that a planning authority may take in charge an unfinished estate, at the request of the owners of the housing units, at any time after the expiration of the planning permission, in situations where enforcement actions have commenced or where the planning authority consider that enforcement action will not result in the satisfactory completion of the estate by the developer. Planning authorities have also been empowered to take in charge part of an estate or some, but not all, of the facilities in an estate.</p></reply>

Projects funded under the Conservation and Upgrading measure of the RDP are also subject to the EU State Aid framework and in accordance with the State Aid rules/&lsquo;de minimis&rsquo; (Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1998/2006) the overall limit of &lsquo;de minimis&rsquo; aid cannot exceed &euro;200,000 over any three year period under the Conservation and Upgrading of the Rural Heritage measure of the RDP. This applies to any promoter/organisation that applies for funding under the conservation measure of the RDP including the Irish Landmark Trust. </p><p>  It is possible to seek derogation in relation to the Conservation and Upgrading of the Rural Heritage measure. However, the Programme amendment process, as stipulated in the regulatory framework, is quite complex and can take some time to complete with no guarantee that the amendment submitted would be approved by the European Commission. As funding commitments under the current Programme are closing at the end of the 2013 there would not be enough time remaining to facilitate the programme change process for the current programming period. My Department will consider this issue when developing the framework for the Rural Development Programme for the 2014-2020 programming period. </p></reply>

These requirements flow directly from the requirement for Government finances as a whole to be managed in accordance with the Stability and Growth Pact, established under the Maastricht Treaty, and the associated limitation on budget deficits.  The local government sector must not impact negatively on the General Government Balance (GGB) in any one year. The downturn in the economy and substantial pressures on Government funding generally require a sharp focus in all sectors, including local government, to ensure effective control and management of public finances. </p><p>  In order to stay within the overall GGB limit, it is necessary for local authorities to maintain both their current and capital accounts broadly in balance.  The only restriction on local authorities is that, in aggregate, capital income equals capital expenditure in the year. Balance is only required at an overall level and this allows considerable scope for authorities to draw on their existing capital reserves as an element of their overall investment programme. The precise manner in which capital and current accounts are managed in order to achieve the overall balance necessary is a matter for individual local authorities.  It is a matter for every local authority to determine its own spending priorities in the context of the annual budgetary process, having regard to both locally identified needs and available resources within the GGB limits as set out.   </p><p>  The Action Programme for Effective Local Government - Putting People First sets out Government decisions for a range of local government reform measures, including the decision to replace town councils with a new comprehensive model of municipal governance to strengthen local government within counties and address weaknesses and anomalies in the current system. Definitive details, arrangements and procedures in relation to the financial relations hips between district and county levels, will be developed in the context of the new local government funding arrangements generally, implementation of the new sub-county system and preparation of the legislation in relation to the reform programme.</p></reply>

The plan contains a list of 58 actions arising from the review, some of which are a matter for my Department and others which are the responsibility of the EPA and others. </p><p>  In the plan, I prioritised a number of actions for implementation in 2012, with others to be considered over a longer period as they will require detailed consultation and possibly primary legislation. Details of the expected timeframes for the implementation of individual recommendations were set out in the implementation plan. Implementation of the majority of recommendations is progressing in a satisfactory manner. However, delays have arisen in some areas, particularly those requiring legal advice and/or legislative change. My Department and the Agency have continued to liaise on implementation and I expect to publish a review of progress made in the near future.</p><p>  The review recommended that immunity from prosecution, as applicable to the EPA in carrying out its functions, be reconsidered. As set out in the implementation plan, I propose to consider this issue, which is likely to require primary legislation if it is decided to progress it, in the latter half of 2013. I note that the EPA is not the only Agency that currently has statutory immunity and it will be particularly important to examine the potential impact of any change in this provision on the ability of the EPA effectively to discharge its statutory functions.  Specifically in regard to health impacts, the review recommended the establishment of an additional specialist Advisory Committee to address the interface between the environment and human health. I understand that the Agency has since established an EPA Health Advisory Committee including representation from the Health Service Executive, Health and Safety Authority and the Department of Health, among others.</p></reply>

Inevitably, through this process, certain projects that had been proposed had to give way to others that were more strategically important at that time. </p><p>  In May 2013, Clare County Council submitted an application to my Department to have the Doolin Sewerage Scheme included in the Programme. My Department is currently assessing this application against the relevant selection criteria under the Programme and a decision will issue to the Council as soon as possible.</p></reply>

In line with the recommendation of the Inspector of Prisons and in order to effect the changes necessary in regime and culture and to ensure the safe and secure custody, I am satisfied that the complete closure of St. Patrick&rsquo;s and the dispersal of all prisoners and staff is now required.   Pending the development of new facilities in Oberstown in mid 2014, for which the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs has responsibility, this will in the interim involve the transfer of all 17 year olds currently serving a sentence in St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution to a dedicated Unit in Wheatfield Prison and the transfer of the 18 to 20 year old population to Wheatfield also. </p><p>  With the full co-operation and support of everyone involved, it is anticipated that this can be achieved within six months.  A dedicated Project Board has been established by the Irish Prison Service to oversee this transition.  It is proposed that prisoners will continue to be committed for a period of detention to St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution. They will be accommodated in a dedicated committal and assessment unit for up to 24 hours (B Wing). From here, prisoners will be dispersed to Wheatfield Prison where 150 young offender spaces will be provided.  Staff assigned to this unit will receive specific training on working with young-adult prisoners.</p></reply>

In this regard I am advised that speed enforcement zones are continually reviewed in light of survey data, collision history and local feedback to ensure that enforcement activity is properly targeted.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na recently announced that a review of the existing zones has been undertaken using collision data from 2006 to 2012 and speed surveys.

Ghana is not a signatory to this Convention nor is there any administrative arrangement between the Adoption Authority of Ireland and the Ghanaian authorities.</p><p>  A visa will only be granted in respect of a child adopted in another State where that adoption will be legally recognised in this State. That was not the case in relation to this application. Therefore, there was no possibility of this application succeeding. The person in question was contacted by an official in my Department and advised of this fact and invited to withdraw the application, which she subsequently did, thus preventing the creation of a visa refusal record which could have negatively impacted on any future visa applications made or sponsored by her.</p><p>  At all times, the protection of children is paramount to INIS. I am extremely mindful of the potential risks associated with the irregular cross-border movement of children, and therefore my officials must always abide by the law in relation to inter-country adoptions and err on the side of caution in cases such as this.</p></reply>

These concerns mainly centre on data privacy rights not being adequately respected.  I raised these concerns with the US Attorney General Eric Holder at my recent meetings with him in Dublin.  At these meetings, the US Attorney General provided clarity on a number of issues, in particular with regard to the nature of the information collected and processed, i.e. phone numbers, duration of calls etc - but not the content of calls.  He also advised that the data was collected under judicial authority and only where there was a reasonable suspicion of serious crime, such as terrorism or cybersecurity/cybercrime.</p><p>  We cannot ignore the very important fact that there is a recognised need to protect our citizens from terrorist threats and dealing with that does require access to certain data.  In doing so, however, it is necessary to ensure that the information used is properly obtained and subject to appropriate safeguards.  The importance of protecting individual rights to privacy and ensuring respect for individual human rights contained in the European Convention on Human Rights was emphasised to the US side, as was the crucial need to ensure that any security surveillance undertaken is balanced and proportionate. The US authorities have indicated that their practices are proportionate to the threat they are trying to deal with.</p><p>  In this country we have data protection legislation to protect individuals against unwarranted invasion into their privacy.  Access to telephone call content is governed by the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation) Act 1993 and may only take place under Ministerial warrant.  Access to retained telecommunications data in this jurisdiction is governed by the Communications (Retention of Data) Act 2011. Under the Act access may only be granted following a request to the particular mobile phone company or internet provider in connection with the prevention, detection, investigation or prosecution of a serious offence, the safeguarding of the security of the State or the saving of human life.</p><p>  The operation of both Acts this is subject to judicial oversight and there is also a complaints procedure which individuals can avail of if there is a concern that the Acts have been breached in relation to their calls or their data.  There are also procedures in place under Mutual Assistance legislation to cover requests to and from other countries for this type of information.  I am not aware of any instances of the kind referred to by the Deputy.  My Department has no function in relation to the Boston College oral history archive.</p></reply>

While I have no role in relation to the management of the investigations and cannot comment on any specific challenges faced, shortly after taking up office I moved to introduce additional powers contained in the Criminal Justice Act 2011, to assist the Garda&iacute; in obtaining information in complex investigations such as these.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that a number of Garda investigation files have been submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions as have several files from the parallel investigation taking place under the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.

The key anti-discrimination measures, the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act 1989, the Unfair Dismissals Acts 1977, the Employment Equality Acts and the Equal Status Acts specifically identify Travellers by name as a group protected.  The Equality Act 2004, which transposed the EU Racial Equality Directive, applied all the protections of that Directive across all of the nine grounds contained in the legislation, including the Traveller community ground.</p><p>  All the protections afforded to ethnic minorities in EU directives and international conventions apply to Travellers because the Irish legislation giving effect to those international instruments explicitly protects Travellers.</p></reply>

That decision was informed by the fact that, had we decided to opt in to the measure, we could have faced the very real possibility of being bound by an outcome which would have been contrary to our fundamental interests in relation to the national asylum system.  Several elements of the recast Asylum Procedures Directive were identified as being particularly problematic aspects for the national asylum system at the time.</p><p>  Article 20 of the 2005 Asylum Procedures Directive, which Ireland participates in, provides for the procedure in the case of implicit withdrawal or abandonment of the application.  At present, the Article provides that such an application be subject to a decision to discontinue the examination or to reject the application on the basis that the applicant has not established an entitlement to protection.  It is the latter option which is applied under the Irish system, with a recommendation that the Minister refuse to give the applicant a declaration that he or she is a refugee and with no appeal to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  In the proposal to recast the Procedures Directive, the Commission proposed that the option to refuse the application could only be taken on the basis of an adequate examination of its substance and further to a personal interview.  The amended proposal did provide for the possibility of a time limit of at least one year after which the case can no longer be reopened or a new application may be treated as a subsequent application.  However, the opinion at the time was that this amended Article would be unacceptable from an asylum policy perspective as it could result in a carousel of applications.</p><p>  Additionally, Article 23 of the 2005 Asylum Procedures Directive obliges Member States to ensure that the examination procedure is concluded as soon as possible.  In its proposed recast, the Commission proposed that Member States would ensure that the examination procedure was concluded within 6 months after the date the application is lodged, with a possible extension of a further 6 months in certain circumstances.  The opinion at the time was that these time limits could impose additional burdens on the national asylum system if there was a large increase in the number of applications to be examined in the State, especially considering previous increases in the period 2001 to 2003.</p><p>  It should be noted that the provisions of the Protocol on the position of Ireland and the United Kingdom in respect of the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice, annexed to the TEU and the TFEU apply.  In accordance with Article 1, 2 and Article 4a(1) of the Protocol, Ireland did not participate in the adoption of the recast Asylum Procedures Directive and is not subject to its application.  However, this is without prejudice to Article 4 of the Protocol under which Ireland may at any time after the adoption of a measure by the Council notify its intention to the Council and the Commission that it wishes to opt-in to the measure.</p><p>  As the instruments comprising the second phase of the Common European Asylum System have recently been adopted by the European Parliament and the Council, the question of opting-in to the recast Procedures Directive and the other measures that comprise the CEAS can be kept under ongoing review having regard to the possibilities I refer to under the Protocol on the position of Ireland and the United Kingdom.  I might add that any decision in this regard would have to take into consideration the operation of the Common Travel Area which we share with the United Kingdom.</p></reply>

As the Deputy may be aware, Ireland does not become party to treaties until it is first in a position to comply with the obligations imposed by the treaty in question, including by amending domestic law as necessary.</p><p>  The ongoing implementation of our National Disability Strategy in many respects comprehends many of the provisions of the Convention.  In addition, the Inter-Departmental Committee on the Convention monitors the remaining legislative and administrative actions required to enable ratification.  The Committee has identified as part of its work programme, issues to be considered by various Government Departments.  It is a matter for those Departments to determine whether any actions are required in relation to these issues in advance of ratification and report back to the Committee.  This work is ongoing in all Departments.  At the Committee's request, the National Disability Authority, the lead statutory agency for the sector, is in the process of assisting it to assess the remaining requirements for ratification so as to ensure conclusively that all such issues will be addressed.</p><p>  As regards my Department one of the key requirements is the enactment of capacity legislation.  The Programme for Government contains a commitment to introduce a Bill that is in line with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  The Assisted Decision - Making (Capacity) Bill will provide a series of options to support people with impaired capacity to make decisions and to exercise their basic rights, in line with the principles of the UN Convention.  It will undertake a comprehensive reform of existing legislation governing legal capacity.  Subject to approval of Government, the Assisted Decision - Making (Capacity) Bill is expected to be published in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

Applications for asylum are examined by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner (ORAC).  In some cases, following ORAC's examination it transpires that individuals have previously made asylum applications or have been granted visas in the United Kingdom.  Therefore, in accordance with the provisions of the Dublin II Regulation the individuals concerned should be transferred to the United Kingdom to have their asylum applications fully examined in that country.  Consequently, a Transfer Order is made in respect of those individuals and this places an obligation on them to 'present' him/her self at the Offices of the Garda National Immigration Bureau where arrangements are made for their formal transfer to the  United Kingdom.</p><p>  Persons from over forty nationalities are represented in the overall figures.  In 2011 a total of 125 Transfer Orders were made with the top nationalities being Pakistan, Nigeria, DR Congo, Iraq, Iran and Afghanistan.  In 2012, a total of 60 persons were transferred with Pakistan, Afghanistan, Zimbabwe, Nigeria, Ghana, Somalia and Sudan representing the highest number of persons by nationality.  Up to 30 June this year, a total of 40 persons were transferred to the UK with Nigeria, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Somalia, Kenya and Libya comprising the top nationalities.</p><p>  The Dublin II Regulation, (Council Regulation (EC) No. 343/2003), is intended to prevent the phenomenon of 'asylum shopping' across Europe and sets out criteria for determining which Regulation State is responsible for examining an asylum application where applications have been lodged in more than one Regulation State or whereby an asylum seeker has been granted a visa to enter another Regulation State and has entered that other State before entering Ireland and making an asylum application here.

In this regard I am informed by the Garda authorities that it is the policy of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deploy personnel to establish a highly visible and accessible service to communities to tackle crime, the fear of crime and anti-social behaviour.</p><p>  In the absence of specific details as to the nature of the intimidation referred to, it is not possible to provide a specific response from the Garda authorities on this matter.  However, if a person feels that a crime has been committed they should contact their local Garda station.  All crimes that are reported to Garda&iacute; are fully and thoroughly investigated and offenders brought to justice wherever possible. As well as contacting the Garda&iacute; directly, information can be provided to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by way of the Garda confidential line, 1800 666 111, which is a monitored freephone line that allows members of the public to contact An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with information of a confidential nature.  </p><p> Insofar as the use of intimidation in local communities as a result of drug-related debt is concerned, under the  National Drugs Strategy 2009-2016 a framework for tackling this problem has been put in place by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Under this framework a &lsquo;Drug-Related Intimidation Programme&rsquo; has been established by the Garda National Drugs Unit in conjunction with the community based National Family Support Network (FSN) with the support of the HSE Social Inclusion Unit. The purpose of this programme is to respond to the needs of drug users, their family members and/or friends who experience drug-related intimidation to repay drug debts.</p><p>  Under the programme, nominated Garda Inspectors have been selected by the Garda Commissioner across the country to deal to the issue of drug related intimidation. These Inspectors act as a point of contact for any individuals (or for representatives of the FSN acting on individuals' behalf) in responding to any issues of  drug related intimidation being experienced.</p></reply>

This policy has no impact on the definition of a breeding establishment nor on the obligation to hold a Meat Feeder Licence (MFL) as such a licence is required where a dog owner uses raw ABP under regulatory derogation as a source of feed, irrespective of the type of dog involved.</p><p>  The EU ABP Regulation allows the possibility of feeding raw ABP to dogs under a number of headings.  In particular the derogation under Article 18(1)(f) allows specified categories (Category 2 and Category 3) of ABP to be fed to &ldquo;dogs from recognised kennels and packs of hounds&rdquo;; and the derogation under Article 18(1)(g) allows the same for dogs in shelters.  Raw ABP is potentially a valuable source of feed for dogs in kennels, shelters and for packs of hounds. However, it can also represent a potential risk to both public and animal health, particularly the Category 2 material which is derived from fallen animals. In light of the foregoing, it is proposed to introduce measures to facilitate an extension of the supply chain for the lower risk Category 3 material and over time to confine the availability of the higher risk Category 2 material. It is proposed that the restriction of supply of Category 2 material will be introduced on a gradual basis, as current MFLs expire over a three year period. The proposal will be the subject of a consultation process before being finalised.</p></reply>

In 2012, the total value of exports was in the region of &euro;4.3 million, representing significant growth from 2011, with some exporters more than doubling their exports during this period.  Bord Bia is working on a range of initiatives to increase the penetration of Irish seafood in this market.  It organised a market study visit to Boston in March of this year which gave Irish companies an opportunity for one to one meetings with 3 of the largest foodservice distributors in the US market.</p><p>  Following on from this initiative, Bord Bia coordinated the showcasing of seafood product samples from Irish suppliers in Phoenix on 25 June.  Bord Bia will coordinate an Irish Pavilion at the Boston Seafood Show to be held in March 2014.  This show is North America&rsquo;s largest seafood trade exposition featuring the leading buyers and decision makers from the retail, wholesale and foodservice channels.  On 26 September, Bord Bia will be hosting a select group of some 300 international visitors, including from the US, for a one day International Conference entitled &ldquo;Our Food, Our Future. Sustainability: The Bottom Line&rdquo;.  During the course of this event, a dedicated seafood itinerary will be organised for US buyers, with visits to seafood processing sites and fish farms.</p><p>  Bord Bia supports export development into the US market through its Fellowship Programme which runs annually and provides seafood clients with access to a dedicated sales and marketing resource for a 10 month period based in the market.  A range of seafood processors have benefitted from this particular programme over the last 4 years.  Bord Bia, through its New York office, also works on a one to one basis with seafood clients asissting them with identifying potential importers and brokers, coordinating market itineraries and undertaking store audits.</p></reply>

Local authorities have extensive powers under the Act and my Department makes grants available to them towards expenses incurred by them in implementing the provisions of the Act.  In view of the fact that some local authorities operate their own Pounds and others engage private contractors to carry out operations under the Act, it is not possible to determine an exact cost incurred per seized horse as seizure, livery and disposal costs vary between local authority areas.  However based on funding paid in recent years to local authorities, my Department&rsquo;s contribution towards the removal of horses under the Act has been reducing with average cost per horse seized/disposed for first quarter of 2013 amounting to &euro;685 whereas the average costs for the previous three years was &euro;890.  My Department agreed a protocol with local authorities in 2012 with a view to them achieving savings and efficiencies in implementation of the Act and this has resulted in a number of local authorities making significant efforts towards controlling their costs.

Applications submitted for afforestation in areas described as being potentially acid sensitive must be accompanied by the results of water sampling taken from the receiving watercourse in the months of February, March, April and May.  These results present a measure of alkalinity, reflecting the capacity of the surface water to buffer against acidification that may be connected to afforestation, and which may otherwise affect fish and other forms of aquatic life.  Under the protocol, afforestation is not permitted if any one of the four samples falls below a threshold level of alkalinity, which indicates that the sampled watercourse is sensitive to acidification. As a result of this protocol, afforestation has been generally restricted within these Acid Sensitive Areas.</p><p>  Up to recently, the agreed acid sensitivity protocol applied to all afforestation projects under the various support schemes available from my Department, including the planting of hardwoods (or broadleaves) under the general Afforestation Scheme.  However, in February of this year, my Department secured the agreement of the EPA to amend the protocol to allow applications under the Native Woodland Establishment Scheme, without the requirement for water sampling.  This amendment, supported by Inland Fisheries Ireland, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the Heritage Council and the Woodlands of Ireland, was based on the ecological focus and the unique approach to establishment and management underpinning the Native Woodland Scheme, and the wide range of eco-system services new native woodlands can deliver, including the protection of water quality and aquatic life.</p><p>  It is important to highlight that quality hardwood production is strongly encouraged under the Native Woodland Establishment Scheme, where ecologically compatible and where realized using various &lsquo;close-to-nature&rsquo; forest management systems.  Wood production is a stated objective of many of the new native woodland projects funded under the scheme to date, and specific guidelines on establishing and management native woodlands for timber are available.  The Native Woodland Establishment Scheme offers farmers and other landowners located within Acid Sensitive Areas &ndash; and within other ecologically sensitive locations &ndash; an opportunity to avail of an afforestation scheme and associated grants and premiums, and to create a woodland resource compatible with various environmental sensitivities and capable of providing future revenue through the realization of quality hardwood.  In partnership with Woodlands of Ireland, the Forest Service will be holding training days for professional foresters over the coming weeks and months, aimed at promoting this use of the scheme as an option for farmers and other landowners within Acid Sensitive Areas and other sensitive locations.</p></reply>

Funding of some &euro;53.498 million is available in 2013 to support the provision of youth services and programmes to young people throughout the country including those from disadvantaged communities.  Targeted supports for disadvantaged, marginalised and at risk young people are provided through the Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund Rounds 1 and 2 and Local Drugs Task Force Projects.  In 2013, funding amounting to &euro;5,930,009 was allocated to For&oacute;ige to support the wide range of activities including educational projects, leadership programmes and other support services for some 56,000 young people throughout the country.  The funding includes an amount of some &euro;300,000 in respect of For&oacute;ige&rsquo;s Big Brother Big Sister youth mentoring programme which is also funded by For&oacute;ige&rsquo;s philanthropic partners.</p><p>  The savings required under the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure in respect of 2013 amounted to &euro;5.393 million on 2012 funding available for the provision of youth services and  in 2014 a further savings of &euro;2.97 million is required in the youth budget.  My Department has tried to be as equitable as possible in achieving these savings and to ensure that, in the determination process for the allocations, the front line youth services, particularly those for the most vulnerable young people are protected as far as is possible from the impact of any  necessary reductions in funding.  In considering how best to manage within the reduced budgets available, organisations are being asked to consider the scope for reducing administration costs and overheads, if this is at all possible, in order to maintain the front line youth services for young people.</p><p>  I have met, and continue to meet with, many youth organisations and groups to try and see how we can work together to minimise the impact of these necessary savings in order to ensure that the provision of quality youth services to young people is sustained in these challenging times.  Officials from my Department have recently met with For&oacute;ige about the organisations plans  for the future of the Big Brother, Big Sister programme having regard to the challenging funding situation that the programme faces from 2014 onwards on account of the cessation of philanthropic funding.  My Department is committed to continue working with For&oacute;ige to assist in devising our expenditure and funding strategy that can secure the long term sustainability of this worthwhile programme which has been proven to improve outcomes for vulnerable young people.</p><p>  My Department is developing a new youth policy framework for publication later this year.  The new youth policy framework will aim to enhance the provision of youth services and activities and it will, inter alia, promote co-ordination between government departments and youth sector organisations with a view to maximising the effectiveness of the State funding available to support services for young people in future years.</p></reply>

Under the programme, the pre-school leader must currently hold a qualification in childcare/early education at a minimum of Level 5 on the National Framework of Qualifications of Ireland (NFQ), or a nationally-recognised qualification equivalent to FETAC Level 5 or a higher award in the childcare/early education field.  A higher capitation rate is payable under the ECCE programme to services where all of the pre-school leaders hold a bachelor degree in childhood/early education (minimum of Level 7 on the NFQ) and have three years experience working in the sector, and where all of the pre-school assistants hold a relevant major award in childcare/early education at Level 5 on the NFQ.</p><p>  I have indicated my intention to increase the qualification requirements for all staff working in pre-school services.  The minimum requirement of Level 5 or equivalent for pre-school leaders delivering the pre-school year will be increased to Level 6 or equivalent.  In addition, all pre-school assistants, and all other staff caring for children in a pre-school service, will be subject to a minimum requirement of Level 5.  This requirement will be effective from September 2014 for new services, and from September 2015 for existing services.  While I recognise the valuable experience which many childcare staff may have accrued, it is now essential that all staff have qualifications on a formal recognised basis.  My Department is currently examining measures to support training for childcare staff in line with the increased qualification requirements.</p></reply>

Community childcare services qualify for grant aid on the basis of the level of service they provide and the profile of the parents benefiting from their service.  Parental declaration forms are submitted in the Autumn of each year to my Department and the PPS numbers of those parents are transmitted to the Department of Social Protection (DPS) and the HSE for verification.  Information supplied by the DSP and HSE is used to determine the level of subvention which applies to each individual parent.  Following verification, letters issue to participating services confirming the total annual CCS subvention amount approved for that service together with a list of  qualifying parents and confirmation of the subvention level applied to each parent.  Services are also advised that if any parent disagrees with the level of subvention applied to them, they have a right of appeal.  The deadline for the submission of appeals was 1st February last.  In the region of 5,000 appeals were received and were examined by officials in my Department.  I understand that the appeal against the initial determination of subvention submitted by this person has been successful.  The service has been advised of this outcome.</p></reply>

Pre-school inspections, which are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive (HSE), are necessary to ensure compliance with the Regulations and the delivery of quality childcare services.

New National Quality Standards for full daycare services have been prepared.

To further strengthen the regulatory system, my Department is undertaking a review of the penalties currently in place for breach of the Child Care (Pre-School) Regulations, as provided for under the Child Care Act 1991.  The review will look at increasing the range and severity of the existing penalties including the actions which can be taken by Inspectors without recourse to court prosecution, as is currently the case.  In addition, my Department is working with the Pre-School Inspectorate to develop new protocols on regulatory compliance so that there is greater clarity and consistency of approach as to how inspection reports deal with findings of serious non-compliance vis a vis minor breaches and full compliance.

The draft Bill provides for changing the criteria, under section 54 of the 2010 Act, where the High Court may authorise the making of an adoption order without parental consent, in the case of a child who is in the care of prospective adopters and where that child&rsquo;s parents have failed in their parental duty to the child.  The draft Bill will also provide for the voluntary placement for adoption of any child irrespective of the marital status of his or her parents.  In the case of a child of married parents, both parents must place the child for adoption, and before doing so will be counselled and given information in accordance with the provisions of section 14 of the Adoption Act 2010. It is my intention to bring the Adoption (Amendment) Bill 2013 before the Houses of the Oireachtas as soon as possible, following conclusion of all proceedings and processes relevant to the Referendum.</p><p>  Work is also continuing in relation to the preparation of the Heads of Bill of the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill.  My view is that persons affected by adoption should be provided with a statutory right to as much information as possible within permissible Constitutional boundaries.  It is intended that the Bill will provide for the Adoption Authority to be responsible for providing access to adoption records, in accordance with the provisions of the Bill.  The Bill will provide for the Adoption Authority to establish and maintain a National Index of Adoption Records, the purpose of which is to help an applicant for adoption information to identify the location of his or her adoption records.  The intention is that the Bill is to provide that the Adoption Authority, the HSE or an accredited body may hold adoption records, with the Authority having overall charge of those records.</p><p>  It is also intended that the Bill will provide for placing the National Contact Preference Register on a statutory basis.  The purpose of the Register is to allow a person affected by adoption to enter his or her name on the Register with a view to receiving information about another person from whom he or she has been separated as a result of adoption and also to indicate a preference as to whether or not contact is being sought with that person.  A National Tracing Service will be established under the provisions of the Bill.  It is intended that the Tracing Service is to be made available to an adopted person, a birth parent and a relative of either an adopted person or a birth parent, and that the Adoption Authority is to have overall responsibility for providing the tracing service.  It is also intended that prior to the release of adoption information, counselling will be offered by the Adoption Authority, the HSE or by an accredited body to an adopted person, a birth parent or to an adoptive parent.</p><p>  Complex legal and Constitutional issues have arisen during the course of  preparation of the Heads of Bill, including the setting of criteria for balancing an adopted person's right to information about his or her identity as against a birth parent's right to privacy.  These issues are currently receiving careful examination within my Department and in the Office of the Attorney General.  I am anxious to bring the Heads of Bill before Government at the earliest possible date.  However, there are undoubtedly challenges remaining in developing a workable framework which respects the Constitutional rights of all parties.</p></reply>

It is also my understanding that the particular case is currently the subject of ongoing legal proceedings.  The employment of a teacher is primarily a matter for the management of the school concerned. Under the provisions of the Education Act 1998, the board of management is the body charged with the direct governance of a school. In the event that a school is made aware of a child protection concern it is a matter for the Board of Management to decide if there is a child protection risk that warrants the taking of action, such as placing an employee on administrative leave. The HSE will also have a role in assisting the Board of Management to come to a determination in such matters.</p><p>  Schools are required to take all reasonable precautions to ensure the safety of pupils and welfare of their pupils.  From a child protection perspective, all schools are required to adhere to the &quot;Child Protection Procedures for Primary and Post-Primary Schools&#8221; which are based on the &quot;Children First - National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children 2011&quot;. The HSE and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also have roles in such matters as the statutory bodies responsible for the welfare and protection of vulnerable children in Ireland. The principles underlying this responsibility are outlined in <i>Children First: National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children</i>.  While I cannot comment on a specific case which is before the Courts it would be prudent for Boards of Management to seek independent legal advice on all such matters and to maintain lines of communication with the statutory authorities.</p></reply>

Significant resources have been invested by the health sector in recent years in services for children with disabilities.  In particular, there is now an increased awareness of the importance of early intervention for these children in terms of ensuring they get the best start in life and are supported as much as possible to reach their full potential. </p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Health Service Executive has operational responsibility for the provision of health and personal social services, including disability services for children.  Within this context, it has a responsibility to ensure that the health-related needs of children with special needs are addressed and that these children are appropriately supported in preschool and school settings.  This is done in a number of ways such as by providing grant-aid to support preschool provision in community preschools and by funding special preschools that cater specifically for children with disabilities.  It also facilitates children with special needs to attend mainstream preschool by providing the necessary assistant supports.  The HSE's role in supporting children with special needs involves it working in close co-operation with the disability service providers that it funds, with the education sector and with the parents and families of the children in question.</p><p>  All service developments have to be addressed in the light of the current economic and budgetary pressures, and Government policy to reduce the numbers employed in the public sector.  This policy requires that by the end of 2013, the health service achieves a workforce of 98,955 whole-time equivalents.  Staff appointments may be made only where an inescapable service need has been identified and which cannot be addressed by other means, such as the redeployment of staff or reorganisation of services. The recently concluded Haddington Road Agreement has increased the working week of staff employed in the public sector.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-07-09a.1189.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013070900084#WRBB02600"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 472 to 476, inclusive, 493, 512, 521, 522, 525, 529, 531, 532 and 557 together.</p><p>  I am aware that the Irish Cancer Society (ICS) has recently launched a campaign to highlight the need to protect young people from cancer-causing sunbeds. This campaign is focussed on the cancer risk associated with sunbed use and builds on earlier work undertaken by the ICS in this regard. On a broader front, the Irish public has also, over recent years, benefitted from the Society's &quot;SunSmart Code&quot; highlighting the danger of overexposure to the sun and measures the public can take to minimise such exposure. There is now a much greater public awareness and understanding of the health risks associated with both exposure to the sun and the use of tanning devices.</p><p>  The apparent contradiction between the increase in skin cancers over the period from 1994 to 2010 on the one hand and the reduction in sunbed use indicated by the ICS research on the other hand can most probably be explained by the long latency period often associated with skin cancers - which can take many years to develop and present. The Chief Medical Officer in the Department of Health has advised me that cohorts of the adult population who are at increased risk from UV radiation can best be dealt with by way of regulation rather than a prohibition. My Department has also been advised that prohibition on certain skin types would, in all likelihood, be incompatible with equality legislation.</p><p>  I can confirm that the forthcoming Public Health (Sunbeds) Bill will make it an offence to sell or hire a sunbed to a person under 18 years of age or allow such a person to use a sunbed on a sunbed premises. A test purchasing provision will also be set out in the Bill to support enforcement of the prohibition on the sale or hire of a sunbed to a person under 18 years of age or to allow such a person to use a sunbed on a sunbed premises. Breaches of this core provision will result in prosecution and very significant penalties will be available to the courts in cases of non-compliance.</p><p>  In addition to this prohibition on sunbed businesses from permitting persons under 18 years of age from using or hiring a sunbed, the legislation will also set out a comprehensive range of measures to promote a greater public awareness across all age groups of the dangers of developing skin cancer, premature aging and eye damage from exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR).  Key provisions in the Bill will include:-</p><p>  (i) a prohibition on anyone under 18 years of age using a sunbed on a sunbed premises;</p><p>  (ii) a prohibition on the sale to or hire of sunbeds to anyone under 18 years of age;</p><p>  (iii) a prohibition on the unsupervised  use of sunbeds in a sunbed premises;</p><p>  (iv) an exemption for medical purposes;</p><p>  (v) control on the remote sale or hire of sunbeds (internet  transactions); </p><p>  (vi) sunbed operators, sellers and hirers will be required to notify the HSE;</p><p>  (vii) a requirement that sunbed operators provide training for staff; </p><p>  (viii) an enforcement regime and the imposition of penalties for non-compliance; </p><p>  (ix) an obligation on all sunbed operators to provide protective eye wear to users;</p><p>  (x) a requirement that warning signs be displayed in all sunbed premises;</p><p>  (xi) a prohibition on certain promotional marketing practices;</p><p>  (xii) a requirement on operators to ensure that sunbed users are made fully aware of the potential dangers of sunbed use; and a related provision whereby sunbed users are required to sign to confirm that they have been made so aware. </p><p>  On the matter of the research commissioned by the ICS, this survey indicated that, at most, 7 people in a sample of 1,000 aged between 15 and 24 had used a sunbed in 2010. From this, a estimated national figure of 28,000 was indicated for sunbed use in the 15-24 age category. While it is difficult to conclusively estimate a national usage figure from such a sample, it is important to point out that the 4% of respondents who used a sunbed  in 2010 represents a reduction from 9% in 2003 (a 55% reduction on the 2003 figure). The percentage of the 15-24 age category who use sunbeds is 5% and this has reduced from 10% in 2007 (a 50% decrease on the 2007 figure). </p><p>  In summary, the research indicates that significant reductions in the use of sunbeds have been recorded over the past number of years. Greater public awareness of the risks of sunbed use has been an important factor in this regard and the ICS is to be complimented for their work in promoting public awareness of the dangers associated with over-exposure to the sun and from sunbed use. The forthcoming sunbed legislation will build on this process and I am delighted to be in a position to confirm that my Department expects to complete the drafting of this legislation within the next 6-8 weeks. The legislation has been accorded priority drafting status and officials of my Department are working closely with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to complete the necessary drafting work. Once the drafting is completed, the legislation must be notified to the EU Commission under the EU Transparency Directive prior to its publication and initiation of the Bill in the Oireachtas. This EU notification requirement will necessitate a minimum of three months to complete.</p></reply>

The HSE is currently finalising sites and assessing GP engagement at each location to determine their interest in participating in the primary care centre development.  While it is not possible, at this time, to give start and completion dates for any of the individual 20 potential locations, the best estimate is that these primary care centres will be completed by late 2016.</p></reply>

The Government is very conscious of the needs of people with a disability who have relied on individual payments of Mobility Allowance to support their independence and will take all of this into consideration when making a decision on future arrangements.</p><p>  Following detailed consideration of the Interim Report of the Review Group, which was established to seek an alternative method to provide for the priority transport needs of people in a manner that does not run counter to the Equal Status Acts, the Government has decided that new statutory provisions will be established to provide individual payments to people with severe disabilities who require additional income to address the costs of their mobility needs. The Government has agreed that an inter-departmental group, chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach, will now be asked to develop detailed proposals for the operation of the new scheme or schemes, including eligibility criteria and administrative arrangements, and should report back to Government by October.  The Final Report of the Review Group, which will include consideration of the wider issue of general transport for people with disabilities, will be submitted to Government in the coming weeks.</p><p>  The Government has agreed that payments should temporarily continue to be made by the HSE to those persons currently in receipt of the Mobility Allowance for a further number of months, pending the commencement of new statutory provisions, on the basis that this would prevent hardship, and, on an interim basis, alleviate stress, anxiety and uncertainty among a vulnerable group in society.  The existing position regarding the Motorised Transport Grant remains as before, i.e. the scheme remains closed.  The inter-departmental group will examine this issue as part of its considerations of how future statutory arrangements should operate.</p></reply>

Data relating to 2011 will be available later this year.</p><p>  The supply of prescription medicines, including benzodiazepines, is controlled in a number of ways.  Under the Medicinal Products (Prescription and Control of Supply) Regulations, it is prohibited for a person to supply a prescription medicine except in accordance with a prescription, and the supply must be made from a registered pharmacy by or under the personal supervision of a registered pharmacist.  A person who contravenes these Regulations is guilty of an offence.  In addition, medicines which have a high potential to be misused are controlled under the Misuse of Drugs Acts.  A person who has in his possession a prescription medicine containing a controlled drug under the Misuse of Drugs legislation for the purpose of selling or supplying it, is guilty of an offence under that legislation. </p><p>  As a result of consultations with key stakeholders, draft Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Regulations are currently being prepared to introduce stricter prescribing and dispensing controls on benzodiazepines.  It is planned to finalise the draft Statutory Instruments shortly and publish these on the Department&rsquo;s website as part of a written consultation process.  This will be followed by a 3 month EU notification period required under the Technical Standards Directive because of the implications of the proposed regulatory changes on trade in pharmaceutical products. Government approval will then be sought to amend the legislation.</p></reply>

In total there are nine timed age-related visits offered to children under the Child Health Surveillance Programme (CHSS).  There are three associated KPIs regarding this service. The percentage of newborn babies visited by a PHN within 48 and 72 hours of birth and the percentage of children who have received their first developmental screening visit prior to their reaching ten months of age. The first two indicators are reported quarterly in arrears and the third is reported monthly in arrears. Latest national data indicate that 84% of newborns are visited by a Public Health Nurse within 48 hours of birth which rises to 96% for visits within 72 hours of birth.</p><p>  Regarding developmental screening, although many individual areas have exceeded the 95% performance level, latest data available from the HSE indicates that the national performance level is 86.9%.

In recent years the delivery of services in the community has been reconfigured to meet population health needs.  This has involved the development of Primary Care Teams (PCTs) to ensure the delivery of services by multidisciplinary teams.  Furthermore, the numbers of Registered General Nurses (RGNs) working in the community has increased.</p><p>  There are currently 418 PCTs in place across the country and it is planned that 484 PCTs will be developed nationally by the end of 2013.  At the end of May 2013, the average number of PHNs per PCT in place is 2.94 and the average number of RGNs is 0.87.  There are a further 450 wholetime equivalent RGNs working in primary care services who are not attached to PCTs.  The ratio of PHNs and RGNs combined in the community is 4.3 per 10,000 population.</p><p>  In 2012, the HSE completed a detailed analysis of the numbers and distribution of public health nurses, registered general nurses, occupational therapists, physiotherapists and speech and language therapists.  The analysis revealed considerable variation across the HSE's 17 Integrated Service Areas in ratios of health care professionals to population, and to population numbers in areas of high deprivation.  Based on this exercise, in 2013, Primary Care funding of &euro;20 million, nationally, will be invested to support the recruitment of prioritised front-line primary care team posts and enhance the capacity of the primary care sector.</p><p>  I issued approval to the HSE on the 27th March 2013 to commence recruitment to Primary Care Teams with immediate effect of the following additional 251 Primary Care posts:</p><p>  - 70 Public Health Nurses;</p><p>  - 37 Registered General Nurses;</p><p>  - 51 Occupational Therapists;</p><p>  - 46 Physiotherapists; and </p><p>  - 47 Speech &amp;amp; Language Therapists.</p><p>  The allocation and distribution of the above posts is based on bringing each Integrated Service Area, where staffing is below the national average, towards the national average.</p></reply>

Under the Scheme, nursing home residents contribute towards the cost of their nursing home care based on their means, and the HSE pays the balance. The Scheme applies to public, private and voluntary nursing homes.</p><p>  The person's contribution towards the cost of their care is calculated based on 80% of their income  and 5% of their assets per annum. If the person is a member of a couple, the assessment is based on half of the couple's combined income and assets. It should be noted that it was announced in Budget 2013 that the asset contribution would be increased from 5% to 7.5% per annum.  The legislation underpinning the Scheme must be amended before this change can take effect. This is being progressed in the Health (Amendment) Bill 2013.</p><p>  The Scheme contains several important safeguards which ensure that both the person in the nursing home and their spouse/partner, if applicable, are adequately provided for:</p><p> 1. Nobody will pay more than the actual cost of care.</p><p> 2. The first &euro;36,000 for a person's assets, or &euro;72,000 for a couple, is not taken into account during the financial assessment.</p><p> 3. The principal residence is only included in the financial assessment for the first three years of a person's time in care. This three year cap can also apply to family farms/businesses in certain circumstances.</p><p> 4. Where an individual's assets include land and property in the State, the contribution based on such assets may be deferred and collected from their estate. This is the optional Nursing Home Loan element of the scheme.</p><p> 5. Individuals keep a personal allowance of 20% of their income, or 20% of the maximum rate of the State Pension (Non-Contributory), whichever is the greater.</p><p> 6. If there is a spouse/partner remaining at home, s/he will retain 50% of the couples income, or the maximum rate of the State Pension (Non-Contributory), whichever is the greater.</p><p> 7. Certain items of expenditure, called allowable deductions, can be taken into account during the financial assessment. These allowable deductions include health expenses.</p><p> 8. There is a financial review mechanism which takes account of the fluctuating value of assets and the fact that cash assets will naturally deplete over time as payments are made to the nursing home etc. </p><p>  At end-May there were 21,979 people in receipt of financial support towards the cost of long-term residential care. This figure includes both people in receipt of support under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme, and people who have been in nursing home care since before the Scheme commenced and are in receipt of support under systems that pre-date the Scheme. An additional 727 people had been approved for funding, but were not yet in payment. This would be for a variety of reasons, e.g. the nursing home had not yet invoiced the HSE for payment or the individual waiting for a bed to become available in their nursing home of choice. A further 777 people were on the national placement list awaiting funding, with a waiting time of about 6 weeks.</p></reply>

Under the Act, the Irish Medicines Board (IMB) is responsible for the assessment for interchangeability of medicines. The IMB will review an initial 20 active substances, which equates to approximately 1,500 individual medicines. They include statins, proton pump inhibitors, angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers. </p><p>  It is expected that the first List of Interchangeable Medicines, containing groups of atorvastatin products, will be published in mid-August. The IMB will publish subsequent lists for other groups of medicines on an ongoing basis. It is worth noting that there are no Anti-Epilepsy Drugs (AEDs) in the initial 20 active substances to be assessed for interchangeability by the IMB.  Under the legislation, generic substitution is not permitted until the products have been assessed for interchangeability in accordance with the criteria set out in the legislation and the IMB has decided to add the products to the List of Interchangeable Medicines.  At present, therefore, pharmacists are not permitted to substitute AEDs and must dispense the products as prescribed.</p></reply>

It sets out the duties and obligations of the contracted registered medical practitioner in broad terms. While the contract would not have envisaged the deployment of 24 hour blood pressure (BP) monitoring technology as a standard feature of the range of services available in the primary care setting, it did become more commonly available in the years subsequent to the introduction of the capitation contract. Some GPs did not charge for supplying a 24 hour BP monitor to medical card patients whilst others charged a fee of &euro;40-&euro;50.  In comparison, the charge for BP monitoring in one of Dublin's private hospitals is &euro;165.</p><p>  Consultation fees charged by general practitioners outside the terms of the GMS contract are a matter of private contract between the clinicians and the patients.  While I have no role in relation to such fees, I would expect clinicians to have regard to the overall economic situation in setting their fees. </p></reply>

GP engagement and agreement to deliver services from primary care centres is central to the delivery of the necessary infrastructure.  The location in question in Dublin's inner city is one of the 35 potential locations for primary care centres for development by way of PPP as announced in the July 2012 Infrastructure Stimulus Package.  The HSE is currently finalising suitable sites including agreements to purchase where necessary and assessing GP engagement at each location to determine their interest in participating in the primary care centre development.  While it is not possible, at this time, to give start and completion dates for any of the individual 20 potential locations, the best estimate is that these primary care centres will be completed by late 2016.  </p></reply>

Today, there are 61 Community based (CAMH) teams and 39 Acute In-Patient beds nationally. A further 8 beds will be commissioned in Cork and a further 5 beds will re-open in Galway by year end. The second phase of the Child and Adolescent Unit at St. Vincent's Hospital, Fairview will increase capacity from 12 to 18 beds in Dublin by the end of 2013. Increased bed capacity reflects an almost 60% decrease in admissions of children to adult units since 2008.</p><p>  Mental health service delivery for children or adolescents is based on Community Mental Health Teams.  In this regard, 150 additional posts were allocated to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Teams in 2012, and a further 80 posts were allocated for this specific service area in 2013.  Such initiatives are underpinned by the special allocation of &euro;70 million to develop mental health over this, and last, year and do not therefore reflect, in reality, a wind down of mental health provision overall. I understand that 109 of these posts have either been filled, or have a start date shortly, and that recruitment of the balance of the new posts remains a priority within the HSE.  The Deputy will appreciate that the Executive has responsibility for the delivery of services at local level, including the need to address evolving services pressures in the context of overall resources. I will, obviously, continue to closely monitor implementation of this important initiative over the remainder of this year.</p></reply>

The 12 professions to be regulated under the Act are clinical biochemists, dietitians, medical scientists, occupational therapists, orthoptists, physiotherapists, podiatrists, psychologists, radiographers, social care workers, social workers and speech and language therapists.  Five registration boards have been established to date and a sixth will be established shortly. The registration boards and their registers for the remaining designated professions should be established by 2015.</p><p>  Whilst the immediate priority is to proceed with the establishment of the registration boards for the twelve professions currently designated under the Act, as I indicated back in November 2012, I am committed to bringing counsellors and psychotherapists within the ambit of the Act as soon as possible.</p><p>  In relation to advertising, I feel that, given the timing and legal complexity of the issues involved, we should be focussing on achieving the regulation of counsellors and psychotherapists rather than bringing forward primary legislation to require them to include a notification that they are not yet subject to statutory regulation.  Notwithstanding that a number of counsellor and psychotherapist national groups have come together as the Psychological Therapies Forum to advise as a single voice for the professions in so far as is possible,  a number of issues are still being clarified.  </p><p>  These include decisions on whether one or two professions are to be regulated, on the title or titles of the profession or professions, and on the minimum qualifications to be required of counsellors and psychotherapists.  In relation to the latter, Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI), the successor to HETAC, has established a Standards Development Group for Counselling and Psychotherapy which aims to establish standards of knowledge, skills and competence to be acquired by candidates for educational qualifications that will be required for careers in counselling and/or psychotherapy.  This is an essential prerequisite to regulation of the profession.  The QQI Report is expected to be completed later this year or early in 2014.  In addition, the standards of proficiency to be required of existing practitioners for registration will need to be established and the necessary qualifications prescribed.</p><p>  The Department will be engaging with the Psychological Therapies Forum and other relevant stakeholders as soon as the QQI report is available and will work through the outstanding issues with a view to achieving regulation of counsellors and psychotherapists as soon as possible in the best interests of the protection of the public.</p></reply>

In fact, the new legislation in this area is largely a set of technical changes which aim to continue existing contribution levels within an updated statutory framework.</p><p>  It should be noted that this is a very technical piece of legislation and contains provisions that affect many parts of the health service.  However it is important that people in residential settings know that:</p><p>  -  The Bill essentially continues existing arrangements for people in a range of residential settings who contribute towards the cost of their maintenance.  The Bill is putting this arrangement into a modernised and simplified legal framework which is not designed to generate any additional revenue.</p><p>  -  These contributions will apply to all those provided with residential care by or on behalf of the HSE, other than those covered by the Nursing Homes Support Scheme and those in acute hospital care.</p><p>  -  A Fair Deal type arrangement is not planned for extension to the Disability or Mental Health Sectors at present, but is being considered within the context of the current review of the Fair Deal Scheme.  There would be full consultation before any such move is contemplated.</p><p>  -  There will be a continuing requirement to pay an appropriate and affordable contribution, which will be in line with current long-stay charges, towards the maintenance and accommodation costs to the State of providing such services.</p><p>  -  The maximum level of the current long stay charge is just below 80% of the non-contributory State pension.  The maximum contribution will remain at this level.</p><p>  -  The actual contribution will depend, as now, on the individual's income level.</p><p>  -  The exemptions which currently apply to long-stay charges will continue to apply to residential support services maintenance and accommodation contributions.</p><p>  -  The HSE will continue to have discretion to reduce the level of contribution required to avoid undue financial hardship, depending on individuals' circumstances, the extent to which they provide for their own maintenance and their assessed needs.</p></reply>

NIAC is a committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland comprising of experts in a number of specialties including infectious diseases, paediatrics and public health. The committee's recommendations are informed by public health advice, international best practice and by the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE).  A Health Technology Assessment which includes a cost benefit analysis is carried out prior to any new vaccine being considered. This has a vital role in ensuring that care technologies, including vaccines, are used in a manner appropriate to their ability to maximise health gain and achieve value for money.  Should NIAC advice recommend the inclusion of a new vaccine into the primary childhood immunisation programme in Ireland, my Department, in association with the Health Service Executive's National Immunisation Office will examine the issue.</p></reply>

This represents approximately 19% of all deaths. Tobacco is the leading cause of preventable mortality in Ireland . Smokers lose on average 10 to 15 years of quality life. Smokers have higher levels of life long morbidity than non-smokers. Smoking is the main cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).  An analysis of the results of the consultation process is being actively worked on at present and it is expected to be completed in the coming weeks.  I am delighted by the progress made to date in the negotiations on the new Tobacco Products Directive at a European level. The main objective of this proposal is to reduce the attractiveness of tobacco products, particularly to children and young people. This Directive will have a very positive impact on the health of Europeans. </p></reply>

There are currently two categories of eligibility for all persons ordinarily resident in Ireland i.e. full eligibility (medical card) and limited eligibility (all others).  Full eligibility is determined mainly by reference to income limits and is granted to persons who, in the opinion of the Health Service Executive, are unable to provide general practitioner, medical and surgical services to themselves and their dependents without undue hardship.  There is no automatic entitlement to a medical card for persons with any specific illness.</p><p>  The Long Term Illness Scheme provides those persons, suffering from prescribed conditions, who are not already medical card holders, with free drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances for the treatment of that condition.  Medical card holders are required to pay prescription charges. Prescription charges are not payable in respect of items supplied under the Long Term Illness Scheme.  The Government has no plans to provide an automatic entitlement to a medical card to patients with specific long term illnesses.</p><p>  However, the Government is committed to introducing, on a phased basis, a universal GP service without fees within its first term of office, as set out in the Programme for Government and the Future Health strategy framework. This policy constitutes a fundamental element in the Government&rsquo;s health reform programme. The current Government is the first in the history of this State to have committed itself to implementing a universal GP service for the entire population. </p></reply>

A comprehensive symptomatic breast service is available for women in the eight designated cancer centres. Most cases of breast cancer arise in women with no apparent close family history. The majority of people with a family history of breast cancer will not be at substantially increased risk. </p><p>  Women at increased risk of breast cancer due to their family history have a specific range of strategies currently available to reduce their risk. For those for whom risk-reducing surgery is unsuitable or unacceptable, chemoprevention using drugs such as tamoxifen and raloxifene may represent a more acceptable means of risk reduction. </p><p>  Tamoxifen and raloxifene reduce the risk of breast cancer for women without a personal history but who have an increased risk of the disease. As they are not currently licensed for chemoprevention in well women with a family history of breast cancer in Ireland, they can only be prescribed by a doctor following professional guidance, taking full responsibility for the decision and documenting informed consent from the patient. It is not appropriate to offer them to all women aged over 35 years with a family history of breast and related cancers. Drug licensing in Ireland is the responsibility of the Irish Medicines Board. </p><p>  All drugs have side effects and risks which are particularly important when they are being used to prevent other diseases. Discussion and information should include the side effects of drugs, the extent of risk reduction, and the risks and benefits of alternative approaches, such as risk-reducing surgery and surveillance. Discussions in relation to risk of cancer of the lining of the womb, or blood clotting and in relation to bone health are of particular importance for tamoxifen and raloxifene.</p><p>  The communication of information on cancer risk and carrier probability is complex. There is a degree of uncertainty with respect to the probability of inheriting a predisposing genetic mutation, of gene penetrance and hence of developing cancer.  People who are concerned about a family history of breast cancer may require information to help them deal with the complex medical and social choices linked with different levels of breast cancer risk management options, and support to cope with the associated uncertainty and anxiety. </p><p>  The National Cancer Control Programme will be examining the most recent guidance, published this month, on Familial Breast Cancer from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in the UK in relation to the management of chemoprevention and other aspects of the care of patients with a family history of breast cancer.</p></reply>

The agreement provides the legal framework for scheduled air services between the two countries. However, the establishment of such a service is a commercial decision for the airlines.  Enhanced air access to key tourism and business markets such as China has always been a key element of Ireland&rsquo;s aviation policy. I would very much welcome the prospect of direct services to China and have no doubt that such a service would be of benefit to trade relations between both countries. The Irish airports and Tourism Ireland have attractive incentive and marketing programmes available to help support new services and I am aware the DAA have had discussions with Chinese airlines about the possibility of a service.</p><p>  In the meantime, Ireland does have extensive one-stop connectivity with many Chinese cities through the established European hubs such as Heathrow, Amsterdam, Paris and Frankfurt. In addition connectively with China has improved considerably since the commencement of Etihad&rsquo;s services to/from Abu Dhabi in 2007 and more recently Emirates services to/from Dubai in 2012.</p></reply>

It is also important to reiterate that the role of Exchequer grants for regional and local roads is to supplement Councils like Galway County Council in their spending in this area and the Council may fund traffic calming works from its own resources.</p></reply>
