A Traffic Forum has also been established, comprising representatives of the RPA, An Garda Siochana, Dublin City Council, Dublin Bus and the NTA.  This forum will play the key role developing the transport arrangements that will be put in place during the construction of the Luas Broombridge.  Minister Varadkar has established a high level project group, to be chaired by himself, to include RPA, NTA and Dublin City Council, Dublin Bus, An Garda Siochana, as well as representatives of traders and businesses and which will  enable him to liaise directly with key stakeholders particularly in relation to traffic management issues. The inaugural meeting of this group has recently taken place. </p><p>  Funding has been included in my Department's capital allocation to 2016 to cover the cost of commencing the main construction works in 2015 and for pre-construction enabling works in 2013 and 2014.  Construction is expected to take 4 years. The estimated cost of the project is &euro;368m of which approximately &euro;16m has been spent to date.   </p></reply>

Currently, I understand that the National Transport Authority is working with Dublin City Council  to enable the first phase of this expansion to progress.  I am informed that this phase is focussed on expanding the scheme eastwards into the Docklands and westwards to Heuston Station.  Discussions are on-going at present with the operator of the current scheme in relation to this phase of expansion and I understand that it is hoped that a suitable arrangement can be concluded early next year, following which the expansion works would then be undertaken.  Regarding specific funding being made available by the NTA I have referred the Deputy's question to the NTA for direct reply.

Specifically, the improvement and maintenance of individual national roads is a matter for the National Roads Authority (NRA) under sections 17 and 19 of the Roads Acts 1993 (as amended) in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.</p><p>  The maintenance and improvement of regional and local roads is a statutory function of each road authority in accordance with the provisions of section 13 of the Roads Act 1993 (as amended). The carrying out of works on these roads is a matter for the relevant local authority to be funded from its own resources supplemented by State road grants. The initial selection and prioritisation of projects to be funded is also a matter for the local authority<b>.</b> </p><p>  The NRA will be working within a very restricted budget for the next number of years. These funding constraints mean that it will not be possible to progress a range of worthwhile projects for now. Given these constraints the main priorities will be to maintain the existing road network and prioritise safety projects, followed by road improvements, and finally by new projects.  In this regard, the NRA have been provided with over &#8364;647 million in 2012 for maintenance and improvement works on national roads. This figure will reduce to &#8364;319.6 million in 2013 and these monies will be mainly focused on maintenance and repairs and safety works.</p><p>  This year, local authorities have been provided with over &#8364;377 million in regional and local road grants while the proposed grant in 2013 will be &#8364;346.3 million (a reduction of 8%).  The priority is to maintain the road network with the main focus again being the Restoration Improvement and Maintenance programmes . Local authorities were also provided with flexibility to change their programmes if necessary to ensure resources are targeted at the areas which need it most.</p></reply>

The allocation of funding to specific tourism capital investment projects is the responsibility of F&aacute;ilte Ireland, which operates the Tourism Capital Investment Programme, and final decisions in this regard are made by the F&aacute;ilte Ireland Authority.  Since the Government took office in 2011, funding of over &euro;28 million has been approved by F&aacute;ilte Ireland under the Tourism Capital Investment Programme.  Significant projects already announced include Derrynane House, Killarney House, Trinity College Book of Kells, the Dublin Heritage Mile, the Kilkenny Medieval Mile, and the first phase of the Wild Atlantic Way in Connemara, as well as a range of other investments. Much of the funding available in the period 2013-2016 will be used to meet these and other prior existing commitments.</p><p>  Given the level of existing commitments, there is limited scope for additional project approvals between 2013 and 2016.  Any such projects will be assessed by the F&aacute;ilte Ireland executive and by the Capital Investment Appraisal Group before being referred to the F&aacute;ilte Ireland Authority for final approval. </p></reply>

I have referred the matter to F&aacute;ilte Ireland for further information to be provided to the Deputy. Please contact Minister Varadkar's private office if a reply is not received within ten working days.</p><p>  As the 1st January draws closer, I am confident that the Gathering will be very successful in inspiring overseas visitors to come to Ireland next year.

The aim of the Strategy, like all previous, will be to save lives and prevent injuries by reducing the number and severity of collisions on our roads.</p><p>  The Strategy will contain key, definable actions that will seek to achieve this overall aim and to close the gap between Ireland and the best performing countries in the EU.  Some of these actions will need to be underpinned by provisions in law and I expect that the Strategy will reflect measures that Minister Varadkar has recently approved for inclusion in the next Road Traffic Bill.</p><p>  In general, the new Strategy, while not deflecting attention from road fatalities, will concentrate to a significant extent on serious injuries caused by road collisions.</p><p>  It is the responsibility of the RSA, in the first instance, to draft the new Strategy and submit it to the Minister for consideration.  I understand that consultation with all relevant stakeholders is currently taking place and it is expected that a draft will be received early in the New Year.</p><p>  In relation to road side drug testing the new Road Traffic Bill, which was recently approved by Government, includes provision for road side impairment testing which will allow Garda&iacute; to test for drugs.</p></reply>

This &euro;7 million is included in F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s overall current Grant-in-Aid provision of &euro;63.3 million,although their core allocation in 2013 had been originally set at &euro;56.4million under the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure.</p><p>  Taking into account the difficult choices which the Government has had to make in regard to public expenditure, this provision reflects the recognition by the Government of the contribution that the tourism industry is making to economic recovery, employment and tax receipts and will, I believe, enable F&aacute;ilte Ireland to deliver on its remit in 2013.</p><p>  There is provision in 2013 for total expenditure of just under &euro;140 million on tourism services across a diverse range of activities. This includes a provision for the Tourism Marketing Fund of over &euro;37m in 2013 which will enable Tourism Ireland to fully implement their 2013 Marketing Plans.</p><p>  F&aacute;ilte Ireland also has an allocation of capital funding of &euro;20 million in 2013, of which &euro;19 million is available to support investment in tourism product and &euro;1 million to meet F&aacute;ilte Ireland's own internal capital requirements.</p><p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Government has made available a range of other supports for the tourism industry through the 2011 Jobs Initiative, not least the VAT cut to 9% which will be sustained throughout next year.  In addition, the new higher cash VAT threshold of &euro;1.25 million announced in the recent Budget should assist the cash flow of many tourism SMEs.</p></reply>

The implementation of individual national road schemes, including Public Private Partnership (PPP) projects which provide for tolling, are matters for the National Roads Authority (NRA) under the Roads Acts 1993-2007. Moreover, the statutory power to levy tolls on national roads, to make toll bye-laws and to enter into toll agreements with private investors in respect of national roads is very specifically vested in the NRA under Part V of the Roads Act, 1993 (as amended). The contracts for the privately-operated toll schemes are, therefore, commercial agreements between the NRA and the PPP concessionaires concerned.</p><p>   Bearing in mind the circumstances I have outlined, I am not in a position to provide information in relation to tolling income from these agreements or the dispersal of that income. However, the income from tolling activity on PPP routes is published in the NRA's annual accounts in global format. This would include income from all tolled roads including the M50 and Dublin Port Tunnel. Copies of the NRA's annual accounts for the years up to 2011 are available in the Dail Library.</p><p>  In order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I am refering his Question to the NRA for further reply. Please advise Minister Varadkar's private office if you do not receive a reply within 10 working days.</p></reply>

However, both I and officials of my Department have met with the Chairman and senior management of Knock airport on a number of occasions over the past six months regarding their future plans for developing the airport.</p><p>  I have rationalised the system of State support for the privately-owned regional airports and the Government now has a settled policy in relation to those airports.  In line with the recommendations of the Value for Money Review on the Regional Airports Programme published in 2011, funding under that Programme for the period 2012-2014 has been consolidated on four regional airports including Knock. The focus now is on airports working towards sustainability over the coming years without an on-going need for Government financial support.</p><p>  In his recent Budget speech, the Minister for Finance announced that he will be putting in place measures to facilitate the construction of hangars and ancillary facilities that will be key to attracting additional aviation sector organisations and jobs to the country. These measures will be available on a national basis to all Irish airports who wish to avail of them, including Knock Airport.</p><p>  With regard to existing supports for Knock Airport, it should be noted that the Airport, along with the other regional airports which are not owned by the State, has been supported over the years under the Regional Airports Programme which is aimed at ensuring balanced regional development.  Under that programme, Knock Airport has received around &euro;40m since 1993.  This includes funding for the PSO air services, which although paid directly to the airlines, also supports the airport.  Over &euro;1m is being provided this year to the Airport, despite the difficult economic circumstances of the country.</p><p>  In a wider context, I should point out that the development of a new civil aviation policy was initiated at a conference earlier this month and will be pursued through 2012, leading to the adoption of a new policy in 2014.  In that context, I expect the role of both State and regional airports to be fully explored with submissions being made by the airports, including Knock.</p></reply>

While they are often described as military flights, they are in fact civilian flights as they are civilian charter aircraft. Because they carry military personnel and equipment, the flights are subject to the provisions of the Air Navigation (Carriage of Munitions of War, Weapons and Dangerous Goods) Order 1973, as amended, which is administered by my Department. </p><p>  Where opportunities are presented that would create the conditions for an expansion of such flights, the Government will in principle support such developments.</p><p>  With regard to the use of Irish airspace by foreign military aircraft, this is a matter for my colleague the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, and it is governed by the provisions of the Air Navigation (Foreign Military Aircraft) Order 1952.

The recommendations include strengthening business processes and the introduction of appropriate integrated IT systems to underpin more efficient service delivery. The need to address specific gaps in services, in particular in relation to oil pollution preparedness, prevention and response, Coast Guard volunteer training and oversight and the enduring backlogs in the transposition of international legislation, are highlighted, as is the need for more accountability based on greater transparency and better management information and the need to enhance risk assessment and mitigation in a number of respects.</p><p>  My Department is finalising the action plan to respond to the VfM recommendations and it is expected that this will be completed early in the new year and will be submitted to Government then.  The Department's analysis of the recommendations entails very detailed consideration of the options available for action, including obtaining additional external consultancy advice on the operation of the three Coast Guard co-ordination centres in Dublin, Malin and Valentia. It is however important to recognise that resources available to the maritime services are very limited and they have to be deployed on a prioritised basis and as effectively and efficiently as possible to address the most urgent needs.</p><p>  On foot of this analysis Minister Varadkar advised the House that after careful consideration of the various options available it is his intention to propose that the three Coast Guard co-ordination centres will remain open and that none will be closed. Rather, through the utilisation of the most modern communications and IT infrastructure across a single national Coast Guard network, Minister Varadkar will be proposing that the three centres will be more closely aligned and integrated. The three centres will continue to deliver services but will be required to deliver new efficiencies in how these services are provided.</p><p>  As part of the action plan Minister Varadkar will propose to address a number of related matters affecting or associated with the delivery of maritime safety and emergency response services highlighted in other reports, such as the recent review of Ireland's emergency towing services as part of the Programme for Government and audits undertaken internally, by the EU and the International Maritime Organisation.</p></reply>

The analysis found that a fall in demand for SPSV services over a 3-4 year period had not been matched by a corresponding level of exit from the industry, leading to a clear problem of oversupply. The Indecon analysis suggests that the impact of non-compliant operators and low levels of exit from the industry are significant impacting factors on oversupply. </p><p>  The future approach of the Review Group recommended in the Review Report is towards improvements in the regulation of qualitative standards in the industry and to encourage exit from the industry of those who operate in breach of the required standards and regulations, through better enforcement.  Ensuring standards in the taxi industry commences at the point of entry on application for an SPSV licence.</p><p>  The skills development test for the SPSV drivers licence was introduced in 2009 and then extended to all licensed drivers by 2012. The purpose of the test is to ensure that the recipient of an SPSV driver licence has a sufficient level of knowledge of their area of operation, and of the regulations governing the industry, to provide the appropriate standard of service to passengers.  The test is quite onerous with a low pass rate. Discontinuation of the test would not be an appropriate or proportionate response to the issue of oversupply in the industry and would not solve any of the immediate problems the taxi sector faces.</p></reply>

Within this, the Tourism Marketing Fund has a provision of over &euro;37 million. While this represents a reduction of 5% on the 2012 allocation, it will enable Tourism Ireland to fully implement their 2013 Marketing Plans which were launched by Minister Varadkar on the 29th November. Most of the Tourism Marketing fund is allocated to Tourism Ireland, the agency with responsibility for the overseas promotion of Ireland as a tourist destination. As the Deputy will be aware, all north/south bodies are required to achieve 3% efficiency savings year on year, with the balance of the reduction in 2013 being implemented through a consolidation in the areas of overseas product, niche and regional marketing led by F&aacute;ilte Ireland.</p><p>  While the Tourism Marketing Fund itself has been reduced slightly, it should be noted that the major focus of overseas promotion next year will be on The Gathering Ireland 2013, the biggest ever tourism  initiative held in Ireland.

The programme prioritises the fight against global poverty and hunger and is consistently rated internationally as one of the most effective in the world.  It is strongly focused on the poorest countries and communities in sub-Saharan Africa, prioritising investments in the areas of education, health, good governance, food security and nutrition.</p><p>  The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) - the framework for international development policy up to 2015 - are central to Ireland&rsquo;s overseas development programme, and to the Government's development policy.  Globally, the incidence of poverty is reducing, and it is likely that the first Millennium Development Goal &ndash; to halve world poverty by 2015 &ndash; will be met. International aid has played a hugely important part in contributing to this progress.</p><p>  For 2012, the Government provided some &euro;639 million in total Official Development Assistance (ODA). In 2013, it is anticipated that ODA will amount to &euro;623 million, a modest reduction on the 2012 level. Stabilising the ODA budget has been an important and very significant achievement for this Government, particularly in light of the extraordinarily difficult economic conditions facing the country. Progress towards achieving the UN target of 0.7% of GNP for development assistance can only be made through restoring sustainable growth in our economy.</p></reply>

A resolution of the situation for undocumented Irish will continue to be pursued by the Government in our ongoing contacts with the US Administration and Congress.  The advice of Ireland&rsquo;s friends and contacts within the US Administration and Congress has long been that comprehensive reform of the US immigration system is likely to be the only manner by which such a resolution can be achieved.  The prospects for such reform would appear to have advanced in the wake of President Obama's re-election.  Through our Embassy in Washington and in close liaison with Irish-American community representatives, our contacts with the US Administration and Congress will intensify over the coming weeks with a view to ensuring that the interests and concerns of undocumented Irish immigrants are captured in any future legislative deal in this area that emerges.  In this regard, I raised the issue with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton during our bilateral meeting on 6 December last and recalled our strong support for comprehensive immigration legislation and the passage of E3 visas for Irish citizens.  It is likely that any E3 visa arrangement would encompass an element of reciprocity for US citizens wishing to work in Ireland.</p><p>  Much further debate and discussion is likely to be required within the US political system as to what any future legislative deal might comprise. It is therefore not possible at this stage to specify its contents or identify an exact timescale in which these may become clear but the area will continue to receive the Government&rsquo;s close attention over the period ahead.</p></reply>

These priorities will drive work across all Council formations.   Restoring stability and confidence through effective economic governance for Europe is necessary for creating the conditions necessary for employment and growth. The Presidency will work to restore stability by managing the implementation of the EU&rsquo;s economic governance measures, and in particular the European Semester process, the new system of economic and budgetary policy coordination between Member States.</p><p>  During our Presidency, Ireland will support the EU&rsquo;s efforts to address the weaknesses in our Economic and Monetary Union exposed by the financial crisis. Much has already been achieved and we will build on the foundations laid by successive European Councils, in particular through working to advance proposals on Banking Union. </p><p>  In preparing for the Presidency, the Government has identified in every sector proposals that they believe can best deliver stability, jobs and growth. These cover a wide area. There are measures to combat unemployment, particularly among our young people, through providing new skills and training and making it easier to work in other countries.  There are a series of proposals to free up and develop the Single Market, from which Ireland as an export-led economy has benefitted so much.  We will seek agreement on a new framework for research and innovation and progress on a number of proposals for boosting the digital economy, covering the areas of intellectual property, cyber security, e-signatures, data protection and high-speed broadband rollout. This work will be vital for creating the right environment for the jobs of the future.</p><p>  Ireland will also make the case for improving Europe&rsquo;s global trade relations, particularly with the United States, opening up markets across the world. Small and medium Enterprises are the backbone of the European economy and of the Irish economy; we will seek agreement on a programme to improve the competitiveness of the sector. We will also insist that the policies adopted by the European Union, whether in the field of agriculture, energy or the environment, are sustainable in the long-term.</p><p>  Work on preparing for the Presidency is in the final stages and we will launch our detailed programme for the Presidency in early January. We take on the Presidency at a time of crisis and change but we are looking forward to making our contribution to resolving Europe&rsquo;s difficulties and to meeting the needs of citizens in Ireland and across the European Union.</p></reply>

Since the uprising in Syria began in March 2011 an estimated 40,000 people have been killed in the violence. Over 2.5 million people inside Syria are in need of immediate humanitarian assistance, with 1.2 million people displaced inside the country. The number of registered refugees from Syria in the region has now passed half a million. Syrians&rsquo; access to the most basic medical care has been seriously undermined. Stocks of essential drugs are low, storage facilities for medicines have been destroyed and local production of medicines has been severely disrupted.  Health workers find themselves increasingly under threat and medical facilities have been indiscriminately targeted.</p><p>  Ireland has responded swiftly to the humanitarian crisis in Syria and in neighbouring countries. As early as March 2012 we provided &euro;500,000 in emergency funding for the ICRC, UNHCR and the World Food Programme. In August I visited Jordan and witnessed firsthand the huge strain that the refugee population is placing on the host countries and partners underlined to me the critical health needs within Syria itself. Since then Ireland has provided additional support of &euro;1,950,000 which brings Ireland&rsquo;s total response to the crisis to &euro;2,450,000. Part of this funding supported WHO (&euro;300,000) and ICRC (&euro;400,000) to respond specifically to the medical needs of Syria&rsquo;s population, focusing on increasing the number of mobile health clinics and expanding their outreach to areas most affected by the conflict. A key partner of Irish Aid, Medecins Sans Fronti&egrave;res (MSF) is providing emergency health care in Syria.  MSF has a policy in place which does not allow them to accept Governmental support for their activities in Syria. However, we are in regular contact with them regarding the health crisis in the country and the needs on the ground.</p><p>  Ireland understands that while this is a humanitarian crisis, it is driven by politics and will only be solved with a political solution. We continue to strongly support the efforts of the UN/Arab League Joint Special Representative, Lakhdar Brahimi, to promote a political settlement. An T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Eamon Gilmore, T.D was very pleased to meet with Mr. Brahimi during the recent OSCE Ministerial Meeting in Dublin where he also met with Secretary of State Clinton and Foreign Minister Lavrov. Ireland has also participated actively within the framework of the Friends of Syria Group, which includes my own attendance at the most recent meeting of the group last week in Marrakesh.  </p><p>  Ireland has provided significant support to those in need as a result of this crisis. Into the future we will continue to monitor the situation so that we can assess when we may be able to further contribute, within our means, to the humanitarian needs within the region. </p></reply>

The reason for making a personal representative a liable person is to prevent the avoidance of the payment of local property tax by means of unnecessarily delaying the distribution of the estate and the transfer of a property to the person who would become the liable person in respect of the property.  This might happen, for example, where the person who inherits the property is already living in the property and there are no other beneficiaries involved.  The tax will be part of the expenses of the estate, along with other regular expenses, including other taxes, where applicable.</p><p>  However, I appreciate that it might not always be possible for the personal representatives to fund the payment of local property tax, whether the tax was owed by the deceased person or by the personal representatives in respect of the period following death.

As a data set of the values of all of Ireland&rsquo;s property does not exist, a methodology for estimation must be formulated.   In order to build conservatism into the yield forecast from the new local property tax, no single methodology was exclusively used for estimating a distribution of property values.  Instead the yield was based on a blend of three approaches.</p><p>The first approach was based on the data used in the Thornhill Report updated to include regional variation in property prices.  At the time of the Thornhill report a national register of prices of property transactions did not exist.  As an alternative, the Central Statistics Office (CSO) provided the number of properties sold across a range of value bands of &euro;50,000 increments for each of the years 2005 to 2009. The data was based on mortgage transactions and is an input into the CSO&rsquo;s residential property price index (RPPI).  Using the national change in values in the CSO RPPI from the year of the transaction to April 2012, a national distribution of property values in 2012 prices was constructed.  This is the distribution published in the Thornhill Report (see Table 1 below).  Regional variation was added to the Thornhill distribution using county level housing stock from census 2011 data (see Table 2), and regional variation in prices from the CSO RPPI.  Three property price distributions were constructed; Dublin, national, and national excluding Dublin.  This compares with one distribution in the Thornhill Report.</p><p>A weighted average property charge for each of the three regional distributions was constructed, weighted by the share of properties in each band.  A county level yield was then calculated based on the number of properties in each county according to data from Census 2011 and the estimated weighted average charge.  By summing over all counties a national yield was estimated.  This approach results in a larger indicative yield than does the Thornhill approach due to a higher weighting of higher value properties in counties with larger volumes of properties (e.g. Dublin).</p><p>Counties were assigned one of the three constructed distributions. The four Dublin local authority areas were assumed to have a distribution in line with the Dublin price distribution, counties with large urban areas and counties adjacent to Dublin were assumed a have a price distribution in line with the national distribution and the remaining counties were assumed to be in line with the national distribution that excludes Dublin (see Table 3).</p><p>A weighted average property charge for each of the three regional distributions was constructed, weighted by the share of properties in each band.  A county level yield was then calculated based on the number of properties in each county according to data from Census 2011 and the estimated weighted average charge.  By summing over all counties a national yield was estimated.  This approach results in a larger indicative yield to the Thornhill approach due to a higher weighting of higher value properties in counties with larger volumes of properties (e.g. Dublin).</p><p>The second approach used was similar but was based on data from the property price register.  In autumn 2012, the Property Services Regulatory Authority published a national register of property prices (www.propertypriceregister.ie).  The register includes the date of sale, price and address of all residential properties purchased in Ireland since 1 January 2010, as declared to the Revenue Commissioners for Stamp Duty purposes.  The register is updated on an on-going basis. Data from the register were used to produce county level distributions as well as distributions in line with the three regional price indices published by the CSO, namely Dublin, national, and national excluding Dublin.  These distributions are set out in Table 4.</p><p>The distribution from the register results in a higher incidence of higher value properties and a less peaked distribution to that in the Thornhill Report at values around &euro;100,000 to &euro;200,000 and an analysis based entirely on the register would result in a higher yield compared with the first approach described above.  However, caution should be applied to solely relying on the register given the low number of transactions, the high percentage of non-mortgage (i.e. cash transactions) and the possible bias in recent transactions towards transactions of higher quality housing stock which may not represent the generality of housing valuations in the State.</p><p>The final method of estimation is based on the ESRI tax-benefit model SWITCH.  In the SWITCH model, data on house prices come from the self-assessed value provided by the respondents to the Survey on Income and Living Conditions (SILC) in 2010 with these values indexed to adjust to 2012 prices.  The SILC data are based on a sample of all private households, giving it the potential to provide a broader picture than one based on transactions or mortgages.</p><p>For each of the approaches described above an assumed deferral rate of 16% was applied.  This is based on work by the Economic and Social Research Institute on behalf of the Thornhill Group.</p><p><b>Table 1: Thornhill Report and Property Price Register

The information requested by the Deputy is set out in Page 52 of the Expenditure Report 2013. The Estimate cost for implementation of Property Tax in 2013 is &euro;25.9 million.

The cost of administering and collecting the Household Charge in 2012 and arrears up to end June 2013 are a matter for the Local Government Management Agency (LGMA) and my colleague the Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government.</p></reply>

With revenues going directly to the LGF, this meant that the Exchequer was no longer required to make a subvention to the fund. As a result, the impact of the charge was reflected as a reduction in Exchequer subventions to the LGF in Budget 2012 calculations, and not as a tax revenue. This reduction in Exchequer subventions to the LGF has been maintained for 2013, and is captured as such in the budgetary projections. </p><p>  As a matter of budgetary consistency, the impact of the cessation of the Household Charge as a revenue raising measure will be reflected in the Revised Estimates for Public Services 2013, scheduled for publication next February.  With regard to revenues from the Non-Principal Private Residence Charge, Budget 2013 outlines that the charge will cease with effect from 1 January 2014.

The strategies for loan recovery vary depending on the particular circumstances of the borrower.    All credit related decisions are overseen by a multi-faceted governance structure established by the new Board of the Bank. Formal approvals for all credit decisions, including restructuring, extension of facilities, forbearance and disposal of assets are required from one or more of the Bank&rsquo;s Asset Quality Forums, Group Credit Committee, Transaction Review Committee, Investment Committee, the Board Risk and Compliance Committee, the Board of Directors and in certain instances the Department of Finance.

The existing SFT regime is designed to cater for relatively small numbers of individuals. The current structure and operation of the regime, which applies across all pension arrangements in the private and public sectors, would not effectively or efficiently cope with an expected minimum ten-fold increase in the numbers of individuals who would be affected by the Budget decision. A number of significant and fundamental changes to the current SFT regime may be required in order to deliver on the decision announced in the Budget. Alternatives to the use of the SFT regime to deliver on the Government&rsquo;s commitment will also be explored and consultations will be required with, among others, various Departments and this will take time.

For these reasons, Revenue focuses on deterring shadow/hidden economy activity and non-compliance through its audit and investigation programmes based on risk analysis, use of Revenue powers and their intelligence and information systems.    I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that its compliance programmes are under constant review to ensure that they are focussed on the areas of greatest risk, including risks from the shadow economy, and that this approach contributes to optimising the effectiveness of their audit resources. The results of its audit and compliance programmes are published each year in the Revenue Annual Report and in 2011, Revenue carried out over 11,000 audits that resulted in additional yield of &#8364;440.5m to the Exchequer, with a further &#8364;81.3m collected from other compliance interventions and assurance checks,</p><p>  The type of initiatives aimed specifically at shadow economy activity include:</p><p>- Joint Investigation activities with the Department of Social Protection aimed at uncovering either non-declaration<b></b>or under declaration of income and/or fraudulent DSP claims; </p><p>- Strengthening tax legislation to provide for a robust framework within which the Revenue Commissioners may tackle tax and duty evasion, including recent provisions relating to the making of returns of transactions by merchant acquirers and the more effective investigation of white-collar crime; </p><p>- A comprehensive package of measures in relation to Excise (Oils) including, a requirement for separate licences for auto-fuel traders and marked fuel traders, a requirement to have a separate licence for every premises or place at which the fuel concerned is dealt in, and a requirement that a licence must be clearly displayed at the premises or place; </p><p>- Revenue&#8217;s tobacco strategy, &#8220;Strategy On Combating the Illicit Tobacco Trade (2011- 2013)&#8221; was published on the Revenue website in June 2011. This three-year strategy is underpinned by annual action plans;</p><p>- Regulations introduced in 2011 requiring Government Departments and State Bodies to supply details of payments made to the Revenue Commissioners;</p><p>- Revenue has a prioritised focus on those sectors that traditionally have been susceptible to shadow activity such as cash businesses. All possible sources of information, including following up on services advertised on TV, Radio, Local newspapers, Internet, special interest publications are used by Revenue;</p><p>- Holding meetings with trade and representative bodies through The Hidden Economy Monitoring Group where mutual interest issues are discussed;</p><p>- Focusing Revenue investigations on the use of computer programmes or electronic devices to alter or conceal sales records;</p><p>- Streetscape programmes, in which every cash business in an area is visited, without prior announcement, have been carried out to detect unregistered businesses and non-recording of cash sales. </p><p>  The Deputy will appreciate that the scale and range of activities carried out by the Revenue Commissioners to tackle the shadow economy are extensive. In addition, the nature of these activities is highly resource intensive however, as is the case with all public service organisations, the Revenue Commissioners must play its part in meeting Government policy on reducing public service staffing numbers. I am satisfied that Revenue is optimising the outputs from its existing audit and compliance resource, and is affording as much priority as possible to shadow economy activities.  I can further confirm that the question of resources for Revenue is kept under review by my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in the context of competing demands for resources across the public service.</p></reply>

In framing that Budget, I considered a range of complex issues and proposals relating to pensions policy including the draft legislative proposals furnished by the Deputy.     As the Deputy will appreciate, the pensions sector is a very important part of the financial services industry in Ireland and provides a service to enable people to make provision for their retirement and for their old age. As it is in everyone&rsquo;s best interest the Government wishes to encourage as many citizens as possible to continue to invest in pension schemes.</p><p>  It is the case that some people have been allowed by previous Governments to benefit from hugely generous pension arrangements subsidised by the taxpayer. While this Government wants to encourage those on lower and middle incomes to save for pensions, it will not allow pensions of the scale previously allowed to be accumulated at the expense of taxpayers whose actual earnings are, in many cases, a fraction of those large pensions.</p><p>  In Budget 2013, I set out this Government&rsquo;s policy on a number of important issues:</p><p>Tax relief on pension contributions will only serve to subsidise pension schemes that deliver income of up to &euro;60,000 per annum. This will take effect from 1st January, 2014.</p><p>Tax relief on pension contributions will continue at the marginal rate of tax.</p><p>The Pension Levy announced as part of the Jobs Initiative will not be renewed after 2014. </p><p>  Constitutional and legal constraints severely limit what steps the Government can take in relation to pensions already in payment. However, in order to ensure equity between all citizens based on their level of income, the reduced rate of USC for those over seventy with an income in excess of &euro;60,000 will be discontinued from the 1st of January 2013 and the standard rates of USC will apply.</p><p>  In addition, in the interest of fairness, Top Slicing relief will no longer be available from the 1st of January 2013 on ex-gratia lump sums in respect of termination and severance payments where the non-statutory payment is &euro;200,000 or over. At present the individual&rsquo;s average tax rate for the previous three years applies to such lump sums rather than the marginal rate of 41 per cent.</p><p>  I have been advised in numerous submissions of the value of allowing limited early withdrawal from AVCs. Therefore, in the forthcoming Finance Bill, I will make provision for persons with AVCs to withdraw up to 30 per cent of their value. Any amounts withdrawn will be subject to tax at the individual&rsquo;s marginal rate since marginal rate relief was provided on the contributions on the way in. The option will be available for a 3 year period from the passing of Finance Bill 2013.  As the Deputy will be aware, the Bills Office is available to assist Deputies in developing and preparing any legislative proposals they may have. The Deputy may wish to consult with that office in relation to his legislative proposals on this matter.</p></reply>

These individuals are already liable to a USC rate of 10% on income in excess of &euro;100,000 per annum, being 3% higher from the USC rate applying to employees.   I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, assuming the enactment of changes announced in the 2013 Budget, the full year yield, estimated by reference to 2013 incomes, from increasing the existing rate of universal social charge by 3 percentage points to 13% on self-employed income earned in excess of &euro;100,000 per annum would be of the order of &euro;130 million.</p><p>  The Universal Social Charge is an individualised charge and as such, the estimate of yield is based on individual incomes of more than &euro;100,000. The estimated yield is based on confining the extension of the 3 percentage point rate increase to the portion of income which is in excess of &euro;100,000, that is, the increase is not applied to the portion of total income earned up to &euro;100,000.  The figure is an estimate from the Revenue tax-forecasting model using actual data for the year 2010 adjusted as necessary for income and employment trends in the interim. It is, therefore, provisional and likely to be revised.</p></reply>

The estimated percentages of residential properties valued at less than &euro;100,000 based on (a) the property price register and (b) data used in the Report of the Inter-Departmental Group on the Design of a Local Property Tax, chaired by Dr Don Thornhill (the &ldquo;Thornhill Report&rdquo;) are as follows:</p><p><table><tr><th><div>Band</div></th><th><div>Property Price Register</div></th><th><div>Thornhill Report</div></th></tr><tr><td><div>0-100000</div></td><td><div>27.4%</div></td><td><div>7.20%</div></td></tr></table></p><p>In the absence of a property price register at the time of the Thornhill group, the group used unpublished Central Statistics Office (CSO) data based on mortgage transactions and the CSO&rsquo;s property price index to estimate a distribution of property values.</p><p>In Autumn 2012, a national register of property values was published for the first time based on actual transactions in the years 2010 to 2012.  The register is published by the Property Services Regulatory Authority (PRSA) based on Stamp Duty data from the Revenue Commissioners and is updated on an on-going basis.  The distribution from the register results in a higher incidence of higher value properties.  However, caution should be applied to this approach given the low number of transactions, the high percentage of non-mortgage transactions (i.e., cash transactions) and the possible bias in recent transactions towards transactions of higher quality housing stock which may not represent the generality of housing valuations in the State.</p></reply>

This would suggest a yield of c. &euro;126 million from a 1 cent levy on such messages.  However, the projected yield from such a levy cannot be directly inferred from the total number of messages sent, as the levy&rsquo;s imposition could result in considerable behavioural impact among consumers, and could have significant implications for the charging arrangements of providers.

From 1 April 2011, the regional rate, expressed in terms of pence per pound, for domestic properties, was 0.3698 pence (in 2010/11 it was 0.3608).

Under EU and domestic VAT rules traders who are registered for VAT collect VAT on the goods and services that they sell.  In turn such traders are entitled to recover the VAT they incur on their business inputs used in the purchase or production of goods or delivery of services.  Consequently, if there is a decrease in value at any stage in the process the trader is entitled to a refund of the excess of VAT incurred over that collected.</p><p>  In this case, where a retailer is in a situation of net VAT gain as a result of below cost selling, this is not a loss to the Exchequer or an additional benefit to the retailer, it is merely how VAT is charged.  As regards calculating the VAT impact of below cost sales of alcohol, separate figures are not available for input VAT on goods that were subsequently sold at a discount because traders&rsquo; VAT returns show only the total input VAT and the total output VAT for the period covered by the return.</p></reply>

These policy issues include clearly determining who is the owner of the Child Benefit payment, whether by taxing the payment, there follows an entitlement to the PAYE tax credit, how the payment is treated for tax purposes in the hands of jointly assessed couples and legal issues surrounding the tax treatment of married couples and co-habiting couples.</p><p>In view of the considerable legal and policy issues involved, it is extremely difficult to estimate the tax liability that may arise in each specific case as a result of taxation of Child Benefit.  However, if all of the above issues were resolved and it was assumed that the mother is the recipient and owner of the child benefit payment, then the taxation of Child Benefit would result in three possible tax outcomes:</p><p>1. An individual would pay <i>no income tax</i> on their child benefit as their tax credits would be sufficient to reduce their tax liability to zero.</p><p>2. An individual would pay tax on their child benefit at the standard rate of tax.</p><p>3.

This data can be found on the Central Bank&#8217;s website <i><font color="#0000FF">www.centralbank.ie</font></i> and indicates that 17.9% of buy to let mortgage accounts (25.5% in terms of balance amounts) were in arrears of more than 90 days.  The focus by Government is primarily on formulating and implementing appropriate measures to assist those homeowners who are experiencing genuine difficulty with the mortgage repayments on their principal home.  In that regard, the Report of the Inter-Departmental Working Group on Mortgage Arrears (&#8220;Keane Report&#8221;) which was published in October 2011, made a number of key recommendations and the Government is now actively progressing the implementation of those main recommendations. However, some of these initiatives will also be of assistance in addressing significant &#8216;buy to let&#8217; mortgage arrears and over indebtedness.  </p><p>  For example, the personal insolvency reforms will be of significant benefit to all insolvent debtors and their creditors as it will enable unsustainable debt positions to be addressed in a holistic way.  In particular, the Personal Insolvency Arrangement framework for secured debt is formulated in such a way that it will also allow in the context of the whole of debt situation of the debtor for unsustainable &#8216;buy to let&#8217; mortgage debts to be dealt with under arrangements formulated by the Personal Insolvency Practitioner and agreed between debtor and creditor. However, the particular protection provisions in the personal insolvency legislation regarding the principal private residence will not be available to &#8216;buy to let&#8217; mortgages or any other secured debts.</p><p>  Also, under the Mortgage Arrears Resolution structure overseen by the Central Bank, mortgage lenders are required to develop and implement appropriate resolution strategies and implementation plans for &#8216;buy to let&#8217; mortgages as well as mortgages on the debtor&#8217;s primary home.  In that regard, it is noted that 22,553 &#8216;buy to let&#8217; mortgages were &#8216;restructured&#8217; at the end of September 2012.</p></reply>

All other euro area Member States solemnly reaffirm their inflexible determination to honour fully their own individual sovereign signature and all their commitments to sustainable fiscal conditions and structural reforms.  The euro area Heads of State fully support this determination as the credibility of all their sovereign signatures is a decisive element for ensuring financial stability in the euro area as a whole.</blockquote>The Irish Government will honour this commitment and will ensure that we work with our EU partners to address the situation in relation to the overall cost to the State of resolving the difficulties in our banking sector.

The ER component was opened to all areas of the bank and is now closed for future applications.  The VS component has been staggered across different areas of the organisation and will be implemented on a phased basis out to 2014 depending on the needs of the business.  I have been informed that as part of its regular reporting cycle, AIB will provide updates on headcount and operational costs, including updated costs with respect to the Exit Programme, as part of its annual results announcement in Q1 2013.

The 2014 target for revenue consolidation is &euro;1.1 billion, with &euro;2 billion for expenditure consolidation.  Around &euro;600 million of the revenue consolidation will be provided through carry forward from measures announced in Budget 2013.

Any amounts withdrawn will be subject to tax at the individual&rsquo;s marginal rate.  The option will be available for three years from the passing of the Finance Bill.  This is a measure which will enable rather than incentivise individuals to access certain pension savings prior to retirement as I would also wish that people continue to provide for their retirement.  As a result, the estimated Exchequer yield of &euro;200 million over three years is conservative and is based on the assumption that 10% of the value of funded AVCs used to supplement retirement benefits (estimated at about &euro;5.5 billion) will be drawn down over the period with half of that amount being drawn down in the first year.</p></reply>

I am also advised by the Revenue Commissioners that while social welfare pensions can be separately identified from other sources of income in Revenue statistics, it is not possible to do so in respect of income from other pensions.  Consequently, there is no complete or reliable basis available to Revenue on which an estimate of the number of pensioners that will be affected by the increase in the universal social charge rates could be compiled.  The figure is an estimate from the Revenue tax-forecasting model using actual data for 2010 adjusted as necessary for income and employment trends in the interim.

Both banks were required to sanction lending of at least &#8364;3 billion in 2011, &#8364;3.5 billion this year and &#8364;4 billion in 2013 for new or increased credit facilities to SMEs. Both banks achieved their 2011 targets and are expected to achieve their 2012 targets. The Deputy knows that SMEs include self employed people.  In addition to the lending targets imposed on the banks,<b></b>  the pillar banks are required to submit their lending plans to the Department and the Credit Review Office (CRO) at the beginning of each year, outlining how they intend to achieve their lending targets. My Department, in conjunction with the CRO, subsequently analyses the plans and meets the banks to discuss any issues of note. The banks also meet with my Department and the CRO on a quarterly basis to discuss progress. The monthly management meetings with the pillar banks also provide a forum for the issue of SME lending to be raised by my Department.</p><p>  In terms of rejection rates from banks, I would remind the Deputy that the CRO can review decisions by the pillar banks to refuse, reduce or withdraw credit facilities, including applications for restructured credit facilities, from &#8364;1,000 up to &#8364;500,000. The CRO is currently overturning 55% of the refusal decisions referred to them and I would appeal to any self employed business people who have been refused credit by the banks to avail of the services of the CRO. </p><p>  The banks report by sector and geographical region but do not report on the basis of the structure of the SME, whether it is a sole trader, self employed, limited company etc. The recent Red C survey shows a credit decline rate of 29% for micro enterprises which would include self employed but does note that the numbers of self employed sampled would not be statistically robust. This rate is an improvement on the two previous surveys. </p><p>  The Deputy should be aware that the Microenterprise Loan Fund Act provides for a scheme which will facilitate up to &#8364;40million in additional lending to microenterprises over the next five years.  Furthermore, the Temporary Partial Credit Guarantee Scheme can facilitate up to &#8364;150m per annum of additional credit. This is designed for SME&#8217;s who, because of lack of collateral or because of the specialised sector they operate in, face difficulties in accessing bank credit.  </p><p>  It is vital that the banks continue to make credit available to support economic recovery. However, it is not in the interest of the banks, businesses or the economy for finance to be provided unless the business is viable and has the capacity to meet the interest payments and repay the sum borrowed.</p></reply>

The figures shown in both tables are subject to adjustment in the event of late returns being filed or where returns already filed are subsequently amended.</p><p>It should be noted that any corresponding data returned by PAYE taxpayers in the income tax return form 12 is not captured in the Revenue computer system. However, any PAYE taxpayer with non-PAYE income greater than &euro;3,174 is required to complete an income tax return form 11. This return is the source of the figures provided in this reply. As rental income of companies is returned as net of interest on borrowings, the figures for interest are not separately distinguishable and there is, therefore, no basis on which an estimate of the cost in respect of companies can be given.</p></reply>

While it would have been preferable not to have to make any changes, by bringing the pupil teacher ratio (PTR) for PLC courses into line with that of free second level schools, e.g., 19:1, the Government has succeeded in protecting class sizes in primary and free second-level schools for the coming year, ensuring that our limited resources are rightly focussed on the children in our education system.  The change will yield estimated savings of &euro;12 million in a full year and &euro;4 million in 2013 because the change will only come into effect from September 2013.   The change will reduce the number of teaching posts by 200 in PLC courses and may lead to some reduction in subject choices for students.  It is now up to VEC CEOs and principals to plan for September 2013 to ensure they can continue to deliver programmes which closely meet the needs of both students and employers.</p></reply>

The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform notified Departments and public bodies of the mandatory requirement to use central contracts, put in place by the National Procurement Service (NPS), when procuring a range of commonly acquired goods and services.  The current arrangements are set out in circular 6/12 Public Procurement (Framework Agreements).  These national contracts are targeted at securing best value for money and facilitating Departments and agencies to deliver services within their budgetary constraints.  Within the Education Sector, the mandatory arrangement relating to stationery currently applies to the Higher Education and VEC Sectors.  I understand that the NPS are working on a new contract for stationery which will be in place from April 2013. </p></reply>

Job creation is not a factor of the profiling exercise. Queries in relation to the profiling of capital allocations are a matter for individual Ministers and their Departments.</p><p>  While my Department is not responsible for the profiling of capital expenditure it does set the overall expenditure allocations of Departments which includes setting the five year multi-annual capital envelopes. Following a Government-wide review of the public capital programme, the five year envelope out to 2016 was set in November last year; this was slightly adjusted in Budget 2013 to address pressures relating to contractual commitments, drawdown of EU funding, replacement of Garda vehicles and to allow for the progression of a new children's detention facility at Oberstown.</p><p>  There will, of course, be direct employment benefits in the delivery of the infrastructure proposed in the Investment Framework and most importantly from the contribution that this capital investment makes to providing the capacity for the economy to grow. In this context, supports to the enterprise sector through agencies such as Enterprise Ireland and the IDA were protected in the review of the Public Capital Programme. The unprecedented level of investment over the past few years delivered through the Enterprise Development Agencies helps to foster sustainable and valuable employment in the exporting sectors of the economy which will be critical to recovery.</p></reply>

It also shows the reduction in the number of employees paid increments on an annual basis from 43% in 2009 to 36% in 2013 of a reducing staff cohort. This reduction arises due to recruitment restrictions and as more people reach the maxima of the scales. This reduction in cost is accentuated as new recruits to the public service are subject also to a 10% reduction in their pay scales with effect from 1 January 2011.</p><p>Of the estimated total annual cost for payment of increments in the Civil Service in 2013, the estimated amount that would not be paid were increments suspended in respect of civil servants due an increment in certain salary bands is as follows:</p><p><table><tr><th>Salary Band </th><th>Amount Saved by Abolition of Increments</th></tr><tr><td>Over &#8364;60,000 to over &#8364;100,000</td><td>&#8364;3.685m</td></tr><tr><td>Over &#8364;75,000 to over &#8364;100,000</td><td>&#8364;2.165m</td></tr><tr><td>Over &#8364;90,000 to over &#8364;100,000</td><td>&#8364;0.925m</td></tr><tr><td>Over &#8364;100,000</td><td>&#8364;0.640m</td></tr></table></p></reply>

This application now is in use in four scheme areas and is in the process of being rolled out to further schemes. One of the benefits of this project is that the Department of Social Protection will, where appropriate, be able to re-use means information already held which in turn will provide better customer service by reducing the need for different parts of the Department to request information from the applicant. </p><p>  The Department of Social Protection is exploring the possibility of sharing means data with other agencies involved in the administration of means tested payments.  A &lsquo;pilot&rsquo; exercise was undertaken across quarters 2 and 3 of 2012 with two other agencies to assess the usability of the available data, to devise the technical infrastructure required to support data sharing and to identify other issues to be addressed in order to share data across all agencies.  Work on this project will continue in 2013 and will inform any future developments in relation to means testing arrangements across a range of Government bodies.</p><p>  The second project involves the establishment of Intreo, the new integrated employment and support service provided by the Department of Social Protection. This integrates the former F&Aacute;S employment services and community programmes and the former HSE Community Welfare Services (CWS) with the income maintenance role of the Department.  This project is transforming social welfare offices into one-stop-shops where clients can access their entitlements and get help with planning their return to work. This means a more coordinated approach to the provision of service to the public and will create opportunities to remove duplication of work, including in the area of means assessment.</p><p>  The Intreo service will be operational in ten social welfare offices by the end of 2012 and will be rolled out to all areas of the country by end 2014.</p></reply>

Copies of these letters, detailing allowances to be abolished for new beneficiaries and allowances to be approved for new beneficiaries but subject to review and/or modification are publicly available on my Departments website at <i>www.per.gov.ie</i>  .  Extensive material relating to the review, including a spreadsheet summarising statistics and the outcome of each allowance reviewed are also published on the website.  </p><p>  Approval for payment of an allowance to a new beneficiary pending the outcome of the review was withdrawn from 31st January 2012 and was not restored in the case where the review found that there is no business case for its payment to new beneficiaries.  Because of the moratorium and limited recruitment across the public sector, the immediate value of these decisions is estimated at &#8364;3.5 million in 2012 rising to &#8364;16 million in 2016, arising mainly in the Education sector where there is some recruitment.  Additional savings will be achieved as further allowances are abolished or modified. </p><p>  As part of the next steps of the Allowances Review process, my Department has written to sectoral management instructing them to engage immediately with staff interests with a view to securing their early agreement to the elimination of those Departmental allowances payable to current beneficiaries, where no business case exists to pay those allowances to new beneficiaries, with a list identified for consideration among  the allowances they should prioritise for early elimination.  In addition, Departments have been asked to identify other allowances, including legacy allowances, for elimination from current beneficiaries.  Departments have responded to my Department on the request for prioritisation and are engaging with staff representatives on the issues.   </p><p>  Given the process currently underway, it is not appropriate to identify a specific target for savings in 2013. </p></reply>

This FPA is being carried out by the Central Expenditure Evaluation Unit of my Department and I expect to see a draft early in the New Year.</p><p>  Focused Policy Assessments are designed to complement the broader range of evaluation tools available within the public service, including Value-for-Money &amp; Policy Reviews, and will assist in maintaining the analytical momentum that was developed during the course of the 2011 Comprehensive Review of Expenditure.  Part of the rationale for FPAs is to stimulate, and to a degree to challenge, thinking within the broader system of public administration about current issues in public policy, and as such the findings of FPAs are not intended to reflect necessarily my views as Minister or the position of Department of Public Expenditure &amp; Reform more generally. Final decisions in particular policy areas will be made by Ministers, weighing all of the various inputs to the decision-making process.</p><p>  The review of the RSS underway is examining a number of core policy evaluation criteria, namely the rationale underpinning the Scheme, the continuing relevance of the objectives of the Scheme, and to a lesser extent, the effectiveness of the Scheme.  Upon finalisation, the FPA will be published on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p></reply>

To promote Irish exporters&rsquo; drive into the Canadian market and to further develop its potential for our entrepreneurs, I led an important EI trade mission there in early November. During that mission I met with the Canadian Finance Minister, Mr. Jim Flaherty, and raised with him the EU-Canada Free Trade Agreement including its possible impact on the agriculture sector.     </p><p>  Last year Canada bought &euro;1.742 billion from us in goods and services (&euro;1.1 billion in services and &euro;627 million in goods). It is notable that last year our services exports to Canada increased a significant 88%. Already in the first 10 months of the year our merchandise exports to Canada are up by a very significant 24% to &euro;639 million. Last year total trade between Canada and Ireland was &euro;2.2 billion. This clearly shows the importance of trade with Canada to the Irish economy. </p><p>  Consequently, a trade agreement with Canada will boost trade with one of our closest trading partners and with an economy with whom we also have very close historic and personal connections. Furthermore, a new generation trade agreement with Canada will help stimulate Ireland&rsquo;s trade potential across the Atlantic and into the United States, with positive impacts on employment and economic growth across the economy.     </p><p>  Throughout the negotiations I have consistently emphasised to the EU Commission Ireland&rsquo;s primary objectives in any trade agreement with Canada. These include both offers and requests to Canada in the agriculture sector and especially the beef sector, as well as other important aspects of the talks such as intellectual property, investment, services and public procurement. </p><p>  I will continue to look for an agreement that is comprehensive and balanced and one that delivers real trade and economic potential for our economy. In this context I recognise the need to minimise the impact of trade liberalisation and market opening on sensitive areas of the economy and will continue to express our concerns that any agreement respects our broad trade interests and especially those of the agriculture sector. </p><p>  My officials met with the EU Commission as recently as this week to again emphasise the importance of an EU Canada agreement in stimulating growth and our reservations about any possible impact on the agriculture sector.</p></reply>

The interim evaluation of JobBridge by Indecon International Economic Consultants (published &ndash; 5th October 2012) states that 52.3% of JobBridge finishers progressed into employment with either their host organisation or another employer since finishing their internship. These progression rates compare favourably with European averages in this area. </p><p>  Given that, in the past, some labour market programmes have been seen as having insignificant or even negative impacts on employment probabilities, this suggests JobBridge is an appropriate labour market intervention. Further information on outcomes will be ascertained as a result of the ongoing formal evaluation of JobBridge. It is anticipated that the final Report will be available in the coming weeks. This evaluation will assess the design, delivery and impact of the JobBridge Scheme, it will provide details of the nature of the work experience of the participants; a measurement of the relevance of that experience to the labour market, analysis of age categories and further findings concerning progression into employment. It will also present recommendations on how the Scheme might be improved.  It is at this stage that further consideration will be given to amending the terms and conditions of the Scheme including any potential extensions to the duration of an internship. Any such amendments to the scheme will be notified via the website.</p></reply>

The primary component of the Irish system of social protection is a social insurance system whereby entitlement to contingency-based benefits is secured largely on the basis of earnings related paid contributions to the Social Insurance Fund (SIF).  There is also a subsidiary system of social assistance for those who do not qualify for social insurance payments whereby entitlement for broadly similar contingency-based payments is made on the basis of an assessment of the person&rsquo;s means.</p><p>  Similar systems exist across the EU, usually with highly comprehensive benefits that are often pay-related.  Social insurance systems are generally based on the &lsquo;contributory principle&rsquo; (contributions are directly linked to benefits) and the &lsquo;solidarity principle&rsquo; (low earners &lsquo;do better&rsquo; on an actuarial basis from their contributions), and these two fundamental principles have different weighting across national insurance systems.</p><p>  The Irish social insurance system is now relatively comprehensive following the extension of coverage over the period 1988 to 1995 to the self-employed, part-time workers and new civil and public servants.  In addition, arrangements were put in place to disregard, for pension purposes, periods spent caring or homemaking.</p><p>  In general, the social insurance system maintains a relationship between labour force status, earnings from work, contributions made and, finally, entitlement to benefits in the event of certain specified contingencies (such as illness, unemployment or old age).  People who pay social insurance do so on the basis that they are building up entitlements which are not subject to a means test in the event of their making a claim, for example because of unemployment, illness or retirement. In that respect, social insurance operates in the same manner as other types of insurance, such as home insurance or motor insurance. I consider that an adequately funded social insurance system is an essential pillar of social protection in Ireland and should remain so in light of its social and administrative benefits.</p><p>  In addition, there are a range of other payments made on a non-means tested basis, such as child benefit, household benefits package and the respite care grant.  Budget 2013 did not extend means testing to any of these payments.</p><p>  Any consideration of means testing all payments made by the Department would have to have regard to a wide range of factors including the significant administrative resources which would be required, the impact it would have on willingness to pay social insurance and the impacts on poverty and existing occupational pension arrangements for employees which in many cases are integrated with the pensions available from the social insurance system.</p></reply>

I understand that the main payments in regard to this question include child benefit and qualified child increases to primary social welfare payments. </p><p>  Child benefit is a universal payment made in respect of the care of children.  Reflecting changes to the payment and its precursor (the children&rsquo;s allowance payment) in the 1970s and 1980s, social welfare legislation provides that the payment is normally made to the mother or step-mother of the qualified child where the child lives with both parents. Similarly, where the child lives with their father but not their mother, payment may be made to the father. </p><p>  Qualified child increases (QCIs) are paid as supplements to weekly social welfare benefit and assistance payments to reflect the need for greater incomes among benefit-dependent households with dependent children. Therefore, QCI payments do not of themselves constitute a specific social welfare scheme and entitlement to the appropriate primary adult payment must be established in the first instance. To qualify for payment of a QCI, the child in respect of whom the increase is claimed must be considered to be normally resident with the person who is claiming the primary payment. In cases where the parents of a child are living apart, the child is considered normally resident with whom s/he is living. Where the child is resident part of the time with each parent the child is generally considered to be normally resident with the parent with whom the child resides most of the time. </p><p>  From this it can be seen that the main principle underlying payment arrangements is that of where the normal residence of the child is, rather than formal arrangements around custody.  Decisions around the well-being of the children is the priority consideration in the operation of the current payment arrangements and this is reflected in the fact that payment is given to a person with whom the child is normally resident rather than on the basis of formal custody arrangements. Therefore these schemes do not provide for the splitting of the payment between parties in joint custody cases.</p><p>  If the Deputy wishes to have a particular case considered in further detail and whether an anomalous situation exists, he can arrange to have the details brought to the attention of my Department for consideration.</p></reply>

The policy objective is to prioritise scarce resources to those in receipt of specified payments or who are on the Live Register so as to increase their chances of leaving it, thereby ensuring a reduction in Exchequer costs over time.  </p><p>  In pursuit of this objective, it has been decided that eligibility for the scheme should be targeted at those in receipt of a qualifying claim (Jobseekers Allowance/Jobseekers Benefit/One Parent Family Payment/Disability Allowance /Signing for Credits) for 78 days out of the last 6 months. Time spent of certain other government-sponsored training may also be taken into account when calculating eligibility.  The Department is not in a position to make any exceptions to these requirements.</p><p>  I wish to advise the Deputy that the person concerned has never made a claim for a Job Seeker's payment.  The person concerned was classified as an adult dependant by virtue of the fact that their partner made the claim for JobSeeker's Allowance and applied for an increase in his payment in respect of them as his adult dependant.  It is open to the person concerned to submit a claim for a Jobseeker's payment/ sign for credits in her own right, which, if allowed, would entitle her for application to the JobBridge Scheme, once she has a live claim for the requisite number of days as outlined above.</p></reply>

Processing times vary across schemes, depending on the differing qualification criteria. Schemes that require a high level of documentary evidence from the customer, particularly in the case of illness-related schemes, can take longer to process. Similarly, means-tested payments can also require more detailed investigation and interaction with the applicant, thereby lengthening the decision making process. Delays can also arise if information is required from social security organisations in other jurisdictions and where additional information has been requested from the applicant but remains outstanding.  For example, pension claims on hand for more than three months typically occur in the case of EU/bilateral pensions where information from other jurisdictions is awaited or, in the case of self-employed, there may be outstanding PRSI liabilities. This delay also impacts on household benefits in many cases as they are linked to when the pension is awarded.</p><p>As part of the Department&rsquo;s programme of service delivery modernisation, a range of initiatives aimed at streamlining the processing of claims, supported by modern technology, have been implemented in recent years. Operational processes, procedures and the organisation of work are continually reviewed to ensure that processing capability is maximised.</p><p>In addition, the staffing needs of the Department are regularly reviewed, having regard to workloads and the competing demands arising, to ensure that the best use is made of all available resources.  The Department will continue to source available staff to fill critical vacancies by way of redeployment, or transfer from within the Department and other</p><p>Government Departments, taking account of the employment control framework (ECF) target, as determined by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p>I wish to assure the Deputy that prompt processing of claims remains a priority for me.</p><p>Table: Applications pending longer than 3 months:</p><p><table><tr><th></th><th></th></tr><tr><td>Scheme</td><td>Applications awaiting decision</td></tr><tr><td>State Pension (contributory) </td><td>1,095</td></tr><tr><td>State Pension (transition) </td><td>952</td></tr><tr><td>State pension (non-contributory) </td><td>372</td></tr><tr><td>Widow(er)&#8217;s and surviving civil partner&#8217;s pension (contributory)  </td><td>118</td></tr><tr><td>Widow(er)&#8217;s and surviving civil partner&#8217;s pension (non-contributory) pension &amp; one parent family payment (widow)</td><td>19</td></tr><tr><td>One parent family payment</td><td>1,364</td></tr><tr><td>Household benefits</td><td>1,086</td></tr><tr><td>Bereavement grant </td><td>649</td></tr><tr><td>Invalidity pension </td><td>2,255</td></tr><tr><td>Family income supplement  - new claims</td><td>4,965</td></tr><tr><td>Family income supplement  - renewals</td><td>941</td></tr><tr><td>Disability Allowance</td><td>2,876</td></tr><tr><td>Carer&#8217;s Benefit</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>Carer&#8217;s Allowance</td><td>6,782</td></tr><tr><td>Jobseeker&#8217;s Benefit  </td><td>643</td></tr><tr><td>Jobseeker&#8217;s Allowance</td><td>3,408</td></tr><tr><td>Illness Benefit  </td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Maternity Benefit </td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Child Benefit (domestic)</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Child Benefit (EC Regulation)</td><td>Not readily available</td></tr><tr><td>Domiciliary Care Allowance</td><td>89<br /><br /><br /></td></tr></table></p></reply>

This is subject to certain specific exceptions, but these exceptions - which include the cutting or grubbing of isolated bushes of gorse during the ordinary course of agriculture - do not allow anything done by burning. Hedgerows are an important reservoir of biodiversity and habitat for birds, insects, wild flowers and other wildlife during the summer breeding season.  The purpose of these provisions is to protect bird life during the nesting season, to prevent forest fires, and to protect vegetation and wildlife habitats during the months of growth and reproduction. </p><p>  However, while hedgerows and scrub are important as wildlife habitats, they need to be managed in the interests of both farming and biodiversity.   Accordingly, I included a commitment in the National Biodiversity Plan 2011-2016 to review the overall policy in this area.  The commitment is to review, in co-operation with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, both hedgerow and scrub regulation with a view to producing guidelines to encourage best practice for hedgerow and scrub management for wildlife. </p><p>  With regard to the specific issues raised with me by the farmers' representatives, I have asked my officials to consider them and to report to me as soon as possible.</p></reply>

The Act gives primary responsibility to planning authorities to identify and protect architectural heritage, including thatched buildings, by including them on the Record of Protected Structures. Inclusion on the Record of Protected Structures places a duty of care on the owners and occupiers of protected structures and also gives planning authorities powers to deal with development proposals affecting them and to seek to safeguard their future. </p><p>  A number of State financial supports have enabled the conservation and restoration of thatched structures. In 2012, my Department provided &#8364;500,000 in grant-aid assistance through a Structures at Risk Fund administered by local authorities to assist with works to safeguard structures protected under the Planning and Development Acts 2000-2012 including the conservation of two thatched structures. The Heritage Council, which is funded by my Department, grant-aided the restoration of twenty-three thatched structures under their Heritage Management Scheme in 2012. </p><p>  The Heritage Council, in partnership with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, also administers a grants scheme to REPS 4 participants on the conservation and repair of traditional farm buildings, known as the Traditional Farm Buildings Grant Scheme. Grants are available under this scheme to carry out approved conservation works to the exterior of farm outbuildings including roofs. I understand that, subject to continued availability of funding, a call for applications for the 2013/14 scheme will be issued next year to participants.</p><p>The level of funding available in 2013 and future years for these schemes will be subject to the normal Budgetary and Estimates processes. It is hoped that the Structures at Risk Fund will be continued in 2013 but, a  s the Deputy can appreciate, the scope for additional funding for the conservation of the built heritage is constrained by the significant reduction in the public finances. </p><p>  In relation to policy and guidance matters, my Department, with the assistance of an Expert Advisory Committee representing key stakeholders, is currently finalising a review of the operation of Part IV of the Planning and Development Acts 2000-2012. The review will consider the need, in the light of current economic circumstances, to develop alternative ways of supporting the conservation of protected structures, including thatched structures. </p><p>In addition, as part of an Architectural Advice Series, my Department plans to publish an advice book on thatching in 2013, which will include further practical advice and guidance on aspects of conserving and restoring thatched structures. The nine previously published booklets in the Architectural Advice Series cover areas such as roof and energy efficiency for traditionally built buildings. The full series is available on my Department&#8217;s website at   .</p></reply>

The Government remains fully committed to the implementation of those agreements, including the provisions relating to the Irish language.  All parties to the Good Friday Agreement recognised the importance of respect, understanding and tolerance in relation to linguistic diversity, including in Northern Ireland, the Irish language and the languages of the various ethnic communities, as part of the cultural wealth of the island of Ireland.  Under that Agreement, the British government committed to a range of measures to promote the Irish language and to facilitate and encourage its use in public and private life, where there is appropriate demand.  </p><p>  In the St. Andrews Agreement, the British government committed to introducing an Irish Language Act reflecting on the experience of Wales and Ireland and to working with the Northern Ireland Executive to enhance and protect the development of the Irish language.  Since the restoration of the devolved institutions on 8 May 2007, the question of an Irish Language Act for Northern Ireland is a devolved matter and is the responsibility of the Northern Ireland Executive.  In terms of recent developments, I should mention that my counterpart, the Northern Ireland Minister for Culture, Arts and Leisure, Car&aacute;l N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n, MLA, launched a public consultation process earlier this year on a draft <i>Strategy for protecting and enhancing the development of the Irish language</i> in Northern Ireland.  This public consultation process ended on 27 November 2012.  I understand that the development of such a strategy is a commitment in the Northern Ireland Executive's <i>Programme for Government 2011-2015</i>.</p></reply>

No other electricity supply company has to date chosen to enter the market and to offer a microgeneration feed-in-tariff on a commercial basis, although the Commission for Energy Regulation invited them to do so.  Previously, a joint ESB/Electric Ireland microgeneration support scheme for the domestic sector offering a total of 19c/kwh (comprising &#8364;10c/kwh from ESB Networks combined with the 9c/kwh from ESB Customer Supply (now Electric Ireland)) ran for 3 years (February 2009-February 2012) and had a take up of between 500 and 600 installations.  In terms of current supports, it is noteworthy that the REFIT scheme operated by my Department does not set lower limits.  There are currently some very small hydro plants operating in the scheme, as well as some small landfill gas and anaerobic digestion (AD) plants. </p><p>  In REFIT 3, covering the biomass sector, the tariff structure is weighted in favour of smaller scale developments, with a higher tariff being offered for AD plants of less than half a megawatt and biomass CHP plants that are less than 1.5MW.</p><p><i>REFIT 3 Tariffs </i></p><p>  i.

In 2009 SEAI initiated a pilot microgeneration programme.  This involved 42 installations of various microgeneration technologies.  A final monitoring report on the performance of the installations and learning from the programme is awaited from SEAI.  This will inform future policy development.  In view of falling technology costs, the Department has also asked SEAI to update  analysis on the costs of varying levels of support for microgeneration technologies, with a view to considering how the sector could be supported going forward.</p></reply>

Better Energy: Homes provides financial assistance to private homeowners who wish to improve the energy performance of their homes.  Fixed grants are provided towards the cost of a range of measures including attic insulation, wall insulation, heating systems upgrades, solar thermal panels and accompanying Building Energy Rating (BER).  From the start of 2012 to the 30 November 2012 the scheme has disbursed over &euro;27million in Exchequer funds and supported the delivery of over 67,000 energy efficiency measures in over 24,000 homes.</p><p>  In order to ensure that the works delivered under the scheme have been completed to an appropriate standard, a proportion of properties are inspected by suitably qualified personnel, in accordance with published checklists, to ascertain compliance with relevant aspects of the Technical Specification and Code of Practice.  The Code of Practice and quality inspections, combined with contractor sanctions and contractor technical bulletins comprise an integrated approach to quality which ensures that measures are implemented to a high standard, where works are not up to standard that defects are remedied and that standards of workmanship among contractors are continuously improving.</p><p>  Up to mid December 2012, SEAI paid out 5,515 grants to home owners for external wall insulation and almost 1,000 (18%) were inspected by SEAI.  Of the external wall insulation works inspected, 80% had zero or minor issues to be rectified.  In 20% of cases, the standards achieved were not satisfactory, and the contractors were required to revisit the house and rectify the issue.  In cases where the installations do not meet the minimum standards, it is practice that grant payment is withheld until resolution of the issue is confirmed.</p></reply>

Given that mobile telephony services are a radio based technology, they are however, affected by several factors, including topography (the surroundings, trees, terrain, buildings etc.) and the capacity of the network (the amount of subscribers on the same base station at a given time).  Notwithstanding this, the recently concluded multi-band spectrum auction, has released spectrum, which was previously unavailable for mobile operators and industry has signalled that this should result in enhanced services being rolled out from 2013.</p></reply>

The four air pollutants concerned (sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, ammonia and volatile organic compounds) contribute to acidification, eutrophication and ground-level ozone.  Revised emission ceilings for 2020 were agreed earlier this year at a Meeting of Parties to the UNECE Gothenburg Protocol.  This will be given effect in EU Member States through a revision of the NEC Directive, with a proposal to be published in the second half of 2013.  The most recent provisional monitoring results from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), in respect of Quarter 1, 2012 show levels of sulphur dioxide, ammonia and volatile organic compounds are below the 2010 emission ceilings.  Emissions of nitrogen oxides, mainly from road traffic, continue to present a challenge.  While these emissions have significantly reduced over the period 1990-2010, they remain marginally above the 2010 ceiling. The EPA monitoring data will be finalised shortly.</p><p>  Reductions in pollutants from industrial sources have been achieved through effective licensing of industrial installations by the EPA.  All industrial installations in Ireland are subject to the licensing, monitoring and enforcement requirements of the Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC) regime.  The activities of companies operating with an IPPC licence are monitored by the EPA to ensure that the terms of their licences are respected, including in relation to emissions.  In addition to the requirements of IPPC, the provisions of the Large Combustion Plant Directive (LCPD) 2001/80/EC also apply to combustion plants with a thermal output of 50MW or more.<b></b> The LCPD aims to reduce acidification, ground-level ozone and particles by controlling emissions of sulphur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>) and particulate matter (PM) from power stations running on solid, liquid or gaseous fuel.</p><p>  Ireland developed a National Emissions Reduction Plan (NERP) under Article 4 (6) of the 2001 LCPD, which is a mechanism that allows &#8220;existing plants&#8221;, as defined in the Directive, to achieve the environmental objectives of the Directive in a cost-effective manner through the installation of abatement at selected qualifying plants.  The NERP option was chosen because it provided both an environmentally ambitious and a cost-effective compliance route for Ireland.  The ESB and other national operators made a commitment to achieve emission limits for SO<sub>2</sub> and NO<sub>x</sub> from existing plants that were significantly more ambitious than the minimum requirements of the LCPD. In the period from 2008 to 2016, emission reductions are 27% more ambitious for SO<sub>2</sub> and 46% more ambitious for NO<sub>x </sub> emissions. </p><p>  The LCPD has now been recast by the Industrial Emissions Directive 2010/75/EU, in respect of which my Department is currently preparing regulations to achieve transposition into national legislation.  As part of the transposition process, my Department is assessing appropriate compliance options for older plants set out under the Directive to ensure that operators continue to commit to ambitious targets that strike the appropriate balance between protection of human health and the environment and cost effectiveness of the abatement solutions.</p></reply>

Through the Electoral Amendment (No. 2) Act 2009, following the consultation process , this provision was amended also to provide for a time limit prior to the polling date, during which election and referendum posters can be displayed.  It specifies that election posters may only be erected from the date of the Polling Day Order or 30 days prior to the date of the poll, whichever is the shorter period.  The time limit for referendum posters was not restricted to 30 days; such posters may be displayed from the date the Polling Day Order is signed.  Any election or referenda posters in place before or after the stipulated timeframe may be subject to an on-the-spot litter fine of &euro;150.

The charge is set at &euro;200 and liability for it falls, in the main, on owners of rental, holiday and vacant properties  It is a matter for an owner to determine if he or she has a liability and, if so, to declare that liability and pay the charge.  A number of exemptions from the charge are set out in section 4 of the 2009 Act and section 4(6) provides for an exemption from the charge in a situation where a residential property is occupied rent-free as the sole or main residence of a relative of the owner and the sole or main residence of the owner is either on the same property or within two kilometres of it.  This provision is partly based on   section 466A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, which deals with the home carer tax credit.</p><p>  Furthermore, the definition of &ldquo;owner&rdquo; in relation to a residential property under the Act refers to a person (other than a mortgagee not in possession) entitled to receive the rent of the property.  There may, however, be situations involving an exclusive right of residence in respect of a relative residing in such a property.  In such cases the owner would not be in a position to receive rent and therefore the owner in question would not be liable.  In any event, under the Act it is a function of a local authority to collect the Non-Principal Private Residence Charge.  Application of the legislation in particular circumstances is a matter for the relevant local authority.  I urge all liable persons who are unsure as to whether they are liable to contact their local authority as a matter of urgency.</p></reply>

This scheme is underwritten by Irish Public Bodies Mutual Insurances Ltd.   </p><p>  However, a national indemnity scheme for landowners to further facilitate access to private lands for recreation purposes, rather than specifically for walking, is currently under development through Comhairle na Tuaithe.  The Occupiers Liability Act of 1995 already provides significant protection to landowners, but the upfront costs of successfully defending a claim from a recreational user can be significant.  In that regard, the proposed indemnity scheme would remove the burden of dealing with insurance companies and engaging legal advisers from any landowner faced with the prospect of a claim arising from injury or damage to the property of a recreational user.   </p><p>  The possibility of introducing a national indemnity scheme for private landowners facilitating access to their lands for recreation purposes is under discussion with the State Claims Agency. There are a number of important issues and technical matters to be addressed as part of this process.  In addition, a comprehensive and robust risk assessment model must be developed and subsequent risk management processes identified and put in place.  The full scope of the scheme is also under consideration and it will seek to address access to private lands in rural areas only. </p><p>  Initially , it was envisaged that individual indemnity schemes would be provided to facilitate Mountain Access and other recreational projects in specific areas but due to the administrative and financial costs associated with such a fragmented approach it was determined that this option was not viable.  Comhairle na Tuaithe agreed that my Department should investigate, in association with the State Claims Agency, a national indemnity scheme that could be administered in an efficient and cost effective manner.

My Department is consulting with the Office of the Attorney General with a view to framing an appropriate legislative response to recent High Court judgments which have created uncertainty in this area of the law.  I want to stress that this issue is not about facilitating wide-scale repossessions by banks and other lending institutions.  It is, if it becomes necessary, about correcting an unintended consequence of reforming legislation enacted in 2009.</p><p>  I should add that under section 99 of the Personal Insolvency Bill as passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas on 19 December 2012, a Personal Insolvency Arrangement proposal shall in so far as is reasonably practicable, be formulated in such a way that will not require the debtor to dispose of an interest in or cease to occupy his or her principal private residence.  However, this significant protection is necessarily tempered to take into account that the debtor may not wish to continue to occupy the house or where the costs of the debtor continuing to reside therein are disproportionately large.</p><p>  The Government is aware of the real and significant difficulties some mortgage holders are facing and is committed to advancing appropriate measures to assist those mortgage holders who are experiencing real and genuine difficulty.  Apart from insolvency reform, which is a key to addressing the problem, the Government is also implementing the other measures as recommended in the 2011 &#8216;Keane Report&#8217; (Inter-Departmental Working Group on Mortgage Arrears).  These include the implementation of mortgage arrears resolution strategies by lenders as overseen by the Central Bank, the launch of the &quot;mortgage to rent&quot; initiative on a nationwide basis and the provision of an independent mortgage advice framework including an enhanced website .  In addition, the Central Bank&#8217;s Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears remains a key protection and provides that each mortgage lender regulated by the Central Bank must put in place a formal Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process to deal with its mortgage customers who are in arrears (or pre-arrears) and in particular it also provides that such lenders must adopt at least a twelve month moratorium in respect of co-operating mortgage holders before applying to the Courts to commence legal action for repossession of a borrower&#8217;s primary residence.  This protection remains in place.</p></reply>

This email was also sent to a number of Deputies and other addressees at the same time.  I will of course be replying directly to the correspondence in due course.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Commissioner's Policing Plan for 2013, which I laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas on 5th December 2012, sets out details of the closure of 100 Garda stations throughout the country, the future opening hours of other stations in Cork and Dublin and a number of District amalgamations.  It is important to remember that while some Garda stations are listed for revised opening hours from 24 hour stations, they will remain as functioning Garda stations on a 24 hour basis.  The full list of these details is available in the Policing Plan which is available in the Oireachtas Library. </p><p>  The Commissioner has concluded that resources could be better deployed and more effectively used on the front-line if particular stations no longer had to be staffed and maintained or if the public opening hours of other stations could be reduced at off-peak times.  In making that decision he has reiterated the commitment of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to providing a professional and effective service to all communities, including those in rural areas.  Each Divisional Officer with responsibility for a Division that will be affected by this decision has been tasked with developing a comprehensive consultation strategy together with a tailored implementation plan that will meet the particular needs of their Division. </p><p>  We also need to be honest about the level of policing service that was capable of being provided from the stations that were and are to be closed.  Of the 100 stations to be closed next year, 98% are only open part-time, 94% are open for 3 hours a day or less, 88% are served by 1 Garda and only 5% are served by 3 or more Garda personnel.  In fact, of the 39 stations closed this year, 8 were not actually open at all.  Their closure was a paper exercise which simply recognised reality.  </p><p>  The intention will be that at all times optimum use is made of Garda resources and the best possible Garda service is provided to the public.  The revised structures will continue to support the community policing philosophy of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na through the clustering of services at policing hubs.  This centralisation of services will facilitate the introduction of an enhanced grid patrolling system that will be operational and intelligence led.  This patrol system will ensure that a high visibility and community oriented policing service continues to be delivered throughout the country.  </p></reply>

It will bring greater transparency to how legal costs are charged and better balance the interests of legal practitioners and their clients as consumers.  The new legal costs regime includes the requirement for a detailed 'Notice' to be provided by legal practitioners to their clients which includes either the known costs involved or, where this is not yet available, the basis upon which the relevant costs are to be calculated.  The Notice, and any updates to it, will allow for a cooling-off period for consideration by the client.  The Bill also sets out a series of Legal Costs Principles and provides for the creation of a new Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicator.  This new Office will take over the current functions of the Office of the Taxing-Master and will modernise the way disputed legal costs are adjudicated.  It will be empowered to prepare and publish Legal Costs Guidelines for the guidance of Legal Costs Adjudicators, legal practitioners and the public.  It will also establish and maintain a publicly available Register of Determinations which will include the outcomes and reasons for its decisions about disputed legal costs.  Two new Taxing-Masters have been already been appointed by public competition in preparing the way for these reforms.  Other reforms contained in the Bill include - </p><p>- a new, independent, Legal Services Regulatory Authority with responsibility for the oversight of both solicitors and barristers. </p><p>- an independent complaints system to deal with public complaints including those relating to professional misconduct.  There will also be an independent Legal Practitioners&rsquo; Disciplinary Tribunal to deal with both legal professions. </p><p>- a framework for new forms of legal services provision similar to those already being rolled out in other common law jurisdictions.  These new or &quot;alternative&quot; business structures will be entirely optional alongside the more traditional forms of legal practice.  Their availability will address a growing competitive disadvantage for our indigenous legal services sector.</p><p>  I expect the Legal Services Regulation Bill, which completed Second Stage in the D&aacute;il earlier this year, to commence Committee Stage in the first quarter of 2013.</p><p>  The Government Legislation Programme includes a Family Law Bill to make provision for pension adjustments in the context of separation agreements and certain other reforms.  Work on this Bill is under way in my Department.  I am also, as I indicated in response to Parliamentary Question No. 66 of 11 December 2012, engaged in the preparation of a Family Relationships and Children Bill.</p></reply>

These should be in place during Quarter 2 of 2013.</p><p>  I expect a significant number of persons to seek to avail of the new or reformed insolvency processes. However, it is difficult to be precise as it will very much depend on individual circumstances and the nature and extent of the debts involved. However, for broad planning purposes for the first full year of operation of the new law and systems, our tentative estimate - based on a rough extrapolation from the comparable UK and Northern Ireland circumstances &ndash; is: 15,000 applications for the two main non-judicial debt resolution processes &ndash; the Debt Settlement Arrangement and Personal Insolvency Arrangement; 3,000 to 4,000 applications for Debt Relief Notices; and 3,000 bankruptcy applications. There were about 30 bankruptcy adjudications in 2011. This number gives an insight into the contrasting increase in work that will arise on the implementation of this Bill.</p><p>  The Deputy will appreciate that these estimates for debtors seeking to avail of the new arrangements are tentative. Not all insolvencies will require to be dealt with under the new statutory debt resolution processes or bankruptcy. I would expect that the certainty brought to the future legal landscape by this Bill will encourage debtors and creditors to agree bilaterally on alternative solutions. These solutions could involve settlement of mortgage debt under the mortgage arrears resolution process operated by mortgage lenders under the supervision of the Central Bank or otherwise.</p></reply>

The December 2010 Council of Fisheries Ministers introduced the first Boarfish quota for the 2011 fishing year, where Ireland secured a quota of 22,000t. At the December 2011 Fisheries Council I negotiated a significantly increased quota of 56,666t for the 2012, which included a redistribution of an &#8220;All Member States&#8221; quota,  this gives Ireland 69% of the total EU catch. </p><p>  Negotiations for the 2013 TAC are ongoing at the moment however this will be one of the most difficult Fisheries Council&#8217;s<i></i>in years.<i></i>There are considerable challenges posed by the range of issues before us at this year&#8217;s Council   and I will be working hard to deliver on TACs that respect scientific advice, reduce the unacceptable practice of discarding fish at sea and are set on a rational basis. </p><p>  It is essential to the future sustainability of our domestic fishing industry that we obtain a fair and positive outcome to these discussions from Ireland&#8217;s perspective. This is particularly important given Ireland&#8217;s imminent presidency of the EU and our strong desire to advance the wider Common Fisheries Policy reform agenda during that time.  It is essential therefore that the industry and other stakeholders are fully aware of the huge challenges faced at this Council and of the range of difficulties faced in getting a satisfactory outcome for Ireland in the coming days.</p></reply>

Such publicity is particularly useful for own brand products where information on origin may be quite limited.  EU requirements on origin labelling are limited. They do cover raw beef and veal; raw poultry meat from a third country; fruit and vegetables, and honey but origin is not required for other foods unless its absence would mislead the consumer. </p><p>  Bord Bia works with producers directly and through major marketing events such as Marketplace Ireland 2012 to advise food and drink businesses on routes to market including supermarkets and on how to identify and build on business opportunities in a very competitive trading environment. </p></reply>

I am of course also conscious of the reduction in farmers' incomes this year and the increase in input costs as a result of the adverse weather, with feed costs likely to remain high. There has, however, been an upward revision in crop forecasts in the last week and I welcome the fact that exports from the agri-food sector have maintained the growth achieved during 2010 and 2011.</p><p>  My officials are in regular contact with farm bodies, various national banks and the Banking Federation concerning the availability of credit to farmers.  My officials have assisted one of the farm organizations in explaining the work of the Credit Review Office, so that they can help their members in this regard.  Despite the concerns expressed about lack of credit, a relatively small number of cases from the Agri-Food sector have come before the Credit Review Office.  I would encourage farmers to make use of this system should they have difficulty in accessing credit.</p><p>  I am aware that a number of banks have designed new credit facilities specifically tailored for the agri-food sector in recent months.  In addition, the most recent Central Bank data for lending to SMEs, covering Q3 2012, shows that the agriculture sector was top of the list in value terms for new lending to SMEs during the quarter. With a total of &euro;138m, it was far ahead of the second placed retail sector on &euro;84m and represented 31% Excluding Financial Intermediation and Property Services of all such new lending during the period.  This level of new lending (31% of all new lending) also applies over the year to date, during which &euro;401m was provided to the sector.  I am also pleased to note a 16.7% increase in the number of new tractors registered year-on-year and a 46% increase over the last two years.</p><p>  </p><p>  I will continue to meet with relevant parties on a regular basis to discuss all credit-related issues.</p></reply>

This follows a constant series of interventions dating back to April of this year, both written and oral, at official and political level with the Directorates for Trade and for Agriculture of the European Commission.   </p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s main concerns are two-fold. First we object to the fact that Canada refuses to accept OIE standards in this instance and will not allow access for EU beef while at the same time it expects that we will grant large quotas to it. Second we have major concerns with the reported size and composition of these quotas.  </p><p>  On the issue of principle, Ireland has consistently asked that the Canadian side respect International standards, as many other countries do, in relation to market access for beef. We have indicated in our submissions to the Commission that this is a stumbling block for Ireland. We do not think it unreasonable to expect Canada to acknowledge this in the context of the negotiations.  To be constructive, we have suggested that any agreement should include a standstill clause or moratorium on the activation of any beef quotas such that there will be no activation of quotas until Canada allows market access for EU beef. </p><p>  As regards the size and composition of any quota, I have suggested that any quota must respect the sensitivity of the EU market in relation to high value cuts and not the totality of the EU beef market. Essentially this means that any quota must be limited in size and must take account of the segmentation of the EU market for beef between high value cuts and other beef &ndash; used primarily for manufacturing.    </p><p>  These are not the only concerns I have in regard to these negotiations.  I am also anxious that we secure reasonable market access for EU dairy products to the Canadian market.  Moreover, the current offers regarding fisheries are not satisfactory in my view and there are outstanding difficulties too regarding the recognition by Canada at sub-national level of certain geographical indications for spirits.  As these negotiations proceed, I will continue to press all of these points vigorously with the Commission and with other Member States.  </p></reply>

Work on the preparation of the legislation is proceeding as a priority and the intention is that the Agency will be established in early 2013.  In order to inform the content of the legislation the Government has decided that upon establishment the Child and Family Support Agency will have responsibility for a range of services.  This includes the full range of child welfare and protection services currently operated by the HSE including family support and alternative care services.  Due to its particular relevance, it has also been decided to include domestic, sexual and gender-based violence services within the Agency's responsibilities.  The Government has further decided that the new Agency will assume responsibility for the functions of both the Family Support Agency and the National Educational Welfare Board.  These two organisations currently operate under the aegis of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  The draft legislation will also provide for the provision of community-based psychology services to children and families by the Agency. It is envisaged that this will involve the transfer of certain psychology staff currently employed by the HSE who are operating within a community setting.  </p><p>  The Government's consideration of these matters was informed, inter alia, by the content and recommendations of the Report of the Task Force on the Child and Family Support Agency which I published in July of this year.  The Task Force considered that the Agency needs to be as broadly based as possible and should include those services that might, in the first instance, help prevent problems arising for a family, that would identify problems and provide supports at an early stage and that would assist children and families in managing serious problems requiring specialised interventions beyond their own resources.  Therefore, in addition to child welfare and protection services the Task Force considered that the core services of the new Agency must include a broad based range of universal and targeted services with an emphasis on prevention, early intervention, family support and therapeutic care interventions.  </p><p>  Arising from the Government's consideration and decision with regard to the functions of the new Agency it has been agreed by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the Department of Health that an impact analysis will be jointly developed of the proposed future arrangements for the provision of the community psychology service as it relates to children and family services covered by the Child and Family Support Agency and to services provided by the HSE.  This work will be undertaken as a priority.</p><p>  I recently met with representatives from the Heads of the Psychology Services Ireland and with a delegation from the IMPACT trade union to discuss issues relating to the future governance and organisational arrangements for the provision of community based psychology services. Our shared objective is to ensure that the optimal national governance and service delivery framework is in place to ensure the best possible outcomes for children and families and other clients who need to avail of this key service.  The views of the profession and its representatives will receive appropriate consideration as part of the impact analysis. </p></reply>

It is currently engaged in a reconfiguration of existing therapy resources to geographic based teams for children (0-18 years) as part of the National Programme on Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People (0-18 years).</p><p>  The Programme is organised at national, regional and local level and includes representatives from the health and education sectors, service providers (both statutory and non-statutory) and parents. These stakeholders are working together to see how current services can be reorganised in line with agreed policy. The HSE has stated that it is very cognisant of stakeholder's views particularly of parents within this context. It has also worked to ensure that information about the Programme is made widely available.</p><p>  The Executive is working very closely with the education sector, which is fully involved in the development of the Programme, to ensure that, from the children&rsquo;s and parents&rsquo; perspective, the services provided by each sector in so far as possible are  integrated. Detailed Local Area action plans are being implemented with the following objectives: one clear pathway to services for all children with disabilities according to need; resources used to the greatest benefit for all children and families, and health and education working together to support children to achieve their potential.</p><p>  The purpose of the reconfiguration of existing therapy resources is to ensure that the resources available are used to best effect, in order to provide health supports and ongoing therapy to all children (0-18 years) in line with their prioritised needs.  In particular, it will mean that all children, regardless of where they receive their education services will have equitable access to services based on their needs.</p><p>  While the HSE supports the principle of providing access to mainstream education where appropriate, the Programme recognises the important continuing role of special schools. In this context, the HSE envisages that children attending special needs primary schools will have access to health supports and therapy services based on their needs. The Department of Education and Skills is a partner in this programme and an Education and Health working group comprised of representatives from both sectors is developing a framework for closer working relationships.</p><p>  Decisions in relation to the local reorganisation of services will be made by Local Implementation Groups, which include representatives of all the service providers in the local area, parents and the education sector. They have a complex task which includes agreeing the principles which should underpin all disability services, mapping of existing services and gaps, consideration of the changes needed in structures and a detailed plan of how to advance.  This plan will include issues of timing and the phasing of proposed changes.</p><p>  My Department has asked the HSE to provide the Deputy with detailed information on the implementation of the Programme in Cork which he has referred to in his question.</p></reply>

The greater the registrant base the lower the annual fee charged. Given the enormous registrant base in teaching and nursing,  for example, the annual fee charged amounts to less than &euro;100 per annum. Health regulators are single profession regulators whereas the Council is charged with regulating twelve disparate professions, which can add significantly to operating costs. The twelve designated professions to be registered by the Council range in number from under 50 Clinical Biochemists to 5,550 Social Care Workers, which amounts to about 20,000 registrants in total across all professions. This is an extremely low registrant base when compared to a registrant base of well in excess of 60,000 for nurses.</p><p>  The Council has extensive statutory functions under the 2005 Act, and considers the annual fee of &euro;295 the minimum required to enable it to operate. The fee charged by the Council, which takes account of the requirement to become self funding by end 2015,  is on a par with that charged by other health regulators and less than some in certain cases. The State is currently funding the Council in its establishment phase (&euro;1.937 million in 2012) to offset the current shortfall in income from registration fees and will continue to do so on a reducing basis for the next 3 years.</p><p>  In response to concerns about the level of fee, the Council has reviewed the regulatory structure to establish what scope exists for controlling registration fees and operational costs and has adopted the following measures: where an existing practitioner with the necessary experience and recognised professional qualifications, or equivalent, pays the registration fee of &euro;295 and is granted registration during the transitional period, also known as grandparenting,  the application fee will cover them for the remainder of the grandparenting period and one full year of retention of registration after expiration of grandparenting. This concession will only apply to existing practitioners availing of the transitional provisions set out in the Act; the Council has entered into discussions with the HSE in regard to the feasibility of arrangements for the deduction of the registration fee from monthly salary thereby spreading the cost throughout the year; finally, the Council has proposed significant restructuring of the way in which the designated professions will be registered and regulated to provide a more cost effective operating system and keep costs to a minimum. This will require the enactment of primary legislation in due course.</p></reply>

The HSE has commenced the procurement of design teams and technical advisors to progress the design and planning submissions for the primary care centre sites, and the preparation of the PPP procurement documents.   Coolock and Darndale were announced as potential locations for primary care centres in the July 2012 PPP Stimulus Package.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-12-20a.854.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012122000072#WRT02300"><p>I can confirm that Directive 2010/63/EU on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes will be transposed into Irish law during December and the new Directive, which will considerably strengthen the protection of animals still needed for research and safety testing, will take effect from 1 January, 2013. </p><p>  Significant changes that are provided for in the transposition of this Directive include a requirement to perform detailed project evaluations prior to authorisation of projects using animals and higher standards of animal care, welfare and accommodation. The Directive will also play a significant role in minimising the number of animals used and requires that alternatives to animal testing be used where possible, whilst ensuring a level playing field for EU industry and enhancing the quality of research conducted in the EU. </p><p>  The Directive also strongly promotes the principles of the three R&rsquo;s (replacement of the use of animals to the greatest extent possible with alternative testing methods, refinement of scientific procedures to improve animal welfare, and reduction in numbers of animals used). It should be noted that many of the provisions set out in Directive 2010/63/EU are mandatory. The European Environment Commissioner affirmed that the European Union will, once the Directive is transposed, have the highest standards of experimental animal welfare in the world.</p><p>  In transposing the Directive I have decided not to transpose Article 42 which provides for a simplified administrative procedure for certain types of projects. My decision in this regard is based on my determination to ensure a high level of protection for all animals that still need to be used for scientific purposes. A simplified procedure along the lines of Article 42 would, in effect, have introduced a two-tiered system, one requiring full project authorisation and another which would undermine that authorisation system. As a consequence of my decision not to introduce any such simplified system all projects using animals for scientific purposes will be subject to the full project approval and authorisation requirements set out in the Directive.</p><p>  The approval of projects and of key individuals involved in those projects and of the establishments where they are carried out will be a matter for the Irish Medicines Board (IMB) which I have designated as the Competent Authority (CA) for the purposes of the Directive. My decision to assign CA functions to the IMB takes into account the fact that replacement and refinement of experimental studies to minimise the use of animals is a central tenet of the Directive. This will require an up-to-date knowledge of such alternative methods and tests as well as the authority to require the use of such alternatives, where possible, by those currently using animals.  This work will also require the employment of persons with veterinary expertise specialising in laboratory animal welfare to evaluate scientific projects and to oversee compliance with Directive requirements. Such specialists will also be expected to be able to offer detailed regulatory advice to those involved in the industry. The IMB has the relevant expertise in relation to both human and veterinary medicine to assist it in undertaking this regulatory work and in ensuring that the three R&rsquo;s will remain central to this area of work in the years ahead. </p><p>  I should also point out that any project involving severe pain or suffering will be automatically subject to a full retrospective assessment by the competent authority. It will also be open to the IMB to retrospectively assess any other project carried out under this Directive. Significant enforcement powers have been included in the transposing statutory instrument to enable the IMB to examine any possible breaches of the legislation and the transposition also provides for significant penalties where serious infringements are identified. </p></reply>

A recruitment process was underway in 2009/2010 from which the Hospital hoped to recruit a urologist, but unfortunately that recruitment process found no suitable candidate for the post. However,   approval has been given by the HSE to recruit a Consultant Urologist and it is hoped that this post will be advertised before year end. The HSE are hopeful that this new recruitment process will succeed in hiring a suitable candidate.</p><p>  Children requiring urgent urological input are prioritised clinically and seen in the UK under the Treatment Abroad Scheme. Where patients have been refused under the Treatment Abroad Scheme, the hospital is currently in final negotiations with St Georges Hospital in London with a view to having the hospital treat these children, pending the appointment of a permanent urologist. Arrangements are currently being made to have a consultant visit from the UK to cover clinical priorities here.  This Government is acutely aware of the challenges that patients with Spina bifida and their families face in managing their condition.

There are, however, regulations governing the product safety aspects of sunbed appliances which are enforced by the National Consumer Agency. </p><p>  The Government has given its approval to the drafting of the Public Health (Sunbeds) Bill by the Office of the Attorney General. It is proposed to prohibit sunbed use by persons under 18 years of age and to promote a greater public awareness across all age groups of the dangers of developing skin cancer, premature ageing and eye damage from exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR).  Key provisions proposed for inclusion in the Bill are:</p><p>  (i) a prohibition on operators of sunbed premises from allowing anyone under 18 years of age to use a sunbed on their premises;</p><p>  (ii) a prohibition on the sale to or hire of sunbeds to anyone under 18 years of age;</p><p>  (iii) an exemption for medical treatment to be provided;</p><p>  (iv) a prohibition on the use of sunbeds in unsupervised commercial premises;</p><p>  (v) control on the remote sale or hire of sunbeds (internet  transactions); </p><p>  (vi) a requirement that sunbed operators provide training for staff; </p><p>  (vii) an enforcement regime and the imposition of penalties for non-compliance; </p><p>  (viii) an obligation on all sunbed operators to provide protective eyewear;</p><p>  (ix) a requirement that warning signs be displayed in all sunbed premises;</p><p>  (x) a prohibition on promotional marketing practices; and</p><p>  (xi) a requirement on operators to ensure that sunbed users are made fully aware of the potential dangers of sunbed use. </p><p>  My Department is currently working with the Office of the Attorney General on this legislation. The Bill, when drafted, will need to be notified to the EU Commission under the Technical Standards Directive prior to its publication.</p></reply>

Benzodiazepines are known to be associated with dependence and withdrawal symptoms and consequently are primarily recommended for short-term treatment only. There is increasing evidence of the inappropriate use of benzodiazepines in Ireland. </p><p>  The 'Z drugs' are a group of medicines (zopiclone, zolpidem and zaleplon) which are used to treat insomnia.  They have a shorter duration of action than benzodiazepines.  However, there are increasing reports of dependence and misuse of these substances also.</p><p>  Overuse of benzodiazepines is an international issue and not specific to Ireland.  The International Narcotics Control Board 2009 statistics show that Europe has the highest average consumption of benzodiazepines internationally.  In its 2009 Report the INCB noted that it has observed a growing international problem of abuse of prescription medicines, including opiates, benzodiazepines and codeine.</p><p>  My Department is reviewing the Misuse of Drugs Regulations with a view to, amongst other issues, introducing additional controls on certain prescription drugs being traded illicitly, including benzodiazepine medicines.</p><p>  My Department has consulted with key stakeholders in relation to the proposed amendments, which include introducing import and export controls as well as an offence of possession, thereby assisting the law enforcement roles of Customs and of the Garda Sioch&aacute;na. It is anticipated that new legislation will be introduced in early 2013.  The Health Service Executive is responsible for the administration of the GMS scheme and the cost of benzodiazepine prescribing within that scheme. The HSE has therefore been asked to examine this matter and I will revert to the Deputy as soon as possible with this information.</p></reply>

They have three main objectives &#8211; to improve the quality of care, to improve access and to improve cost-effectiveness.  The primary aim is to modernise the way hospital services are provided across a wide range of clinical areas.  This is being done through standardising access to and delivery of high quality, safe and efficient hospital services, and maximising linkages to primary care and other community services.  Currently there are a number of Clinical Care Programmes in different stages of development/implementation including a Stroke Programme. <blockquote>  In relation to the specific query raised by the Deputy, as this is a service matter, it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply. </blockquote></p></reply>

Each case must be dealt with individually and each officer making a decision whether to release, not release or partially release records must make the decision based on the specific record set and specific relevant circumstances.</p><p>  In general, the Freedom of Information Acts 1997 and 2003 enable an individual to request access to records held by a public body as named in the schedule to the legislation.  Access may be granted subject to conditions set out in the legislation.  For personal records, as this case would seem to involve, there is no fee for an individual seeking access to their own records, although there may be administrative charges.  In the case of medical records, an individual requesting access to their medical records may be asked to nominate a health professional to whom the records will be released in the first instance.  This nominated individual should have the expertise to interpret and explain the records to the requester.</p><p>  Similarly,  the Data Protection Acts, 1988 and 2003 provide for access to personal information, again subject to conditions in the legislation.  This legislation, however, concerns itself more with protection of data and the length of time that data can be held.</p><p>  An individual record holder, in this case Portlaoise General Hospital, is responsible for the maintenance of its own records and for decisions in relation to release, non-release or partial release of those records.  In all cases, reasons for a decision not to release or to partially release must accompany the decision.</p><p>  In 2007, the HSE published a National Code of Practice for Healthcare Records Management, providing guidelines for hospitals in relation to the management of their healthcare records.  This code of practice can be accessed on line at:. </p><p>  In relation to the specific query raised by the Deputy, as this is a service matter, it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.  </p></reply>

This would include an assignment to provide factual input to an NTPF review of section 39 nursing homes, including Valentia Hospital. </p><p>  Following the appointment of the forensic accountants, a review of the section 39 nursing homes was carried out. I understand that, in the case of Valentia Hospital, the NTPF offered an increase to the rate following the review. This offer was rejected, however, I understand that the NTPF remains open to negotiations with Valentia Hospital.</p><p>  With regard to the question of a meeting between the Department, the HSE, the NTPF and Valentia Hospital, I do not consider that this would be appropriate. The NTPF is independent in the performance of its function under Section 40 of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009 and, in carrying it out, must ensure value for money for both nursing home residents and the State. </p></reply>

These Regulations have been amended on a number of occasions since then, most recently by the Health (Charges for In-patient Services) (Amendment) Regulations 2011, which came into effect on 23 July 2011.  </p><p>  The Act provides that the maximum weekly charge cannot exceed 80% of the maximum rate of the weekly State Pension (non-contributory). The Regulations made under the Act provide for two different classes of charges:</p><p>  - Class 1- charges for those receiving in-patient services on premises where 24 hour nursing care is provided are based on income (subject to a current maximum of &euro;175 per week) and</p><p>  - Class 2- charges for those receiving in-patient services on premises where 24 hour nursing care is not provided are based on income (subject to a current maximum of &euro;130 per week). </p><p>  The maximum charge applicable since July 2011 for Class 1 (&euro;175.00) represents just under 80% of the weekly State Pension (non-contributory) while the maximum rate for Class 2 (&euro;130.00) represents almost 60%. These charges are structured to ensure that those paying charges retain a minimum income for personal use i.e. at least &euro;33 per week for those paying Class 1 rates and at least &euro;64 per week for those paying Class 2 rates.</p><p>  A person in receipt of  Disability Allowance at the current maximum rate of &euro;188 p.w. would be liable, subject to a financial assessment, to a maximum charge under Class 1 of  &euro;155 p.w. and under Class 2 of &euro;120 p.w. </p><p>  Section 53(4) of the Health Act 1970 provides that the HSE may reduce or waive a charge imposed on a person in order to avoid undue financial hardship to that person. To assist in the fair application of the provisions of the Act and the related Regulations, the HSE has developed national guidelines for the determination and levying of charges for in-patient services, which include the need to have regard to the income of the person, the provisions of the Regulations and the patient's individual circumstances.</p><p>  Subject to exceptions specified in the Act, charges are applicable to the maintenance element of in-patient services provided to a person under section 52 of the Health Act 1970 for a period of over 30 consecutive days (or an aggregate period of over 30 days during the preceding 12 months).  Among the exclusions from these charges are persons who are subject to the provisions of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009 (&quot;the Fair Deal&quot;) and those in acute hospitals who require medically acute care and treatment.</p><p>  The facilities to which the charges apply include all hospitals, convalescent homes and homes for persons suffering from physical or mental disability in which the HSE delivers, or arranges for the delivery of, in-patient services. I understand that the HSE at present arranges for and funds the delivery of services, including long-stay residential in-patient services, to a number of individuals in the facility referred to in the question.</p><p>  The HSE is required under the 2005 Act to levy the appropriate charges on individuals in receipt of in-patient services, subject to any relevant exemptions, waivers or reductions provided for in the Act and the Regulations. The funding derived from these charges is directly applied by the HSE towards the provision of health services. Provision of quality public long term care is expensive and it is fair and equitable that those in receipt of such care should pay towards its cost in accordance with their means. </p><p>  There are no proposals to extend the application of the Act or related Regulations from January 2013.</p></reply>

There is an emergency process for a person who is terminally ill, or in urgent need of medical attention and cannot afford to pay for it, that provides a card within 24 hours while the normal application process is completed. Details of this procedure have been made available to all GPs and Social Workers. Such applications can be initiated through the Local Health office whose manager has access to a dedicated fax and e-mail contact line to the Primary Care Reimbursement Service (PCRS). Once the medical condition is verified by a GP or a consultant, and the required personal details are provided, an emergency card is issued to that person for a six-month period.</p></reply>

In a developed primary care system, up to 95 per cent of people&rsquo;s day-to-day health and social care needs can be met in the primary care setting. </p><p>  Fully developed Primary Care Teams  give people direct access to integrated multi-disciplinary teams of general practitioners, nurses, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and others.  There are currently 422 Primary Care Teams in place, albeit at varying stages of development.  The intention is that Primary Care Teams will be supported by a wider range of professionals, including pharmacists, dieticians, psychologists and chiropodists who will form a Health and Social Care Network.

The new Nutley Wing at the hospital, built at a cost of just under &#8364;29m and opened this summer, is designed to provide a state of the art clinical building which includes up to date isolation facilities with accommodation for people with cystic fibrosis.  In the new unit 20 beds are set aside for patients with cystic fibrosis.  Each bed is in a separate room with its own toilet and washing facilities. The 20 beds include 4 complete isolation rooms.  The unit also provides a dedicated CF Day Unit, containing offices, treatment rooms, together with 10 single day treatment rooms, each with en-suite sanitary facilities for treating patients with cystic fibrosis.</p><p>  Under a protocol for the treatment of CF patients at SVUH, signed off in July 2012 with the hospital, the HSE, Department of Health and CFA, up to 34 isolation beds will be made available in the new wing.and the 10-bed day unit will be used effectively to help ensure that patients are treated in the optimum setting. Except in certain circumstances,<font color="#FF0000"> </font>  the additional 14 single inpatient rooms when required will be located in the Nutley Wing and these rooms will be grouped together as far as possible. 1-2 inpatient rooms in the Nutley Wing will be kept available at all times for emergency admissions. In circumstances where the emergency admission rooms have already been utilised and all the other inpatient rooms in the Nutley Wing are occupied, patients with CF will be accommodated elsewhere  in clinically appropriate single rooms until such time as a room becomes available in the Nutley Wing and then the patient will be transferred there as a priority.</p><p>  CUH is one of six specialist centres providing services for patients with cystic fibrosis. The adult cystic fibrosis day centre at Cork University Hospital (CUH) is an ambulatory care facility for adults with cystic fibrosis in the Munster region. I am advised that this centre caters for the majority of clinical needs of CF patients and includes 5 isolation rooms, a dedicated CF gym, a multidisciplinary team room and consultant rooms. The capital costs for this build were supported by a partnership of the HSE South and Build4Life.</p><p>  With regard to in-patient services, I am advised that a location has been identified for a combined adult CF in-patient designated bed facility and respiratory unit on the CUH campus.   The hospital has established a working group to progress this facility and is working in partnership with the Build4Life organisation to co-fund this development.  To date Build4Life have raised over &#8364;2m to support the development of adult inpatient cystic fibrosis facilities at CUH.  The HSE South and CUH management are finalising plans for the inpatient facility within the available capital resources, and within the physical space currently available on the hospital campus to facilitate the unit.  A Design Team has been appointed and preliminary drawings for the unit have been prepared.  The need to develop the adult in-patient facility at CUH remains a priority proposal of the Executive Management Board at CUH and the HSE South, and the HSE will continue to work with Build4Life to complete this project</p></reply>

In accordance with the Act, the HSE's service plan will set out the type and volume of health and personal social services to be provided by the Executive in 2013.

Just over &euro;7 million has been allocated to fund 16 projects, each in a different Local Authority area. A wide variety of route types have been allocated funding, including canal tow path routes, routes along disused rail lines and routes which make use of bypassed national roads. Most projects are substantially progressed. Five will be completed by year end, with the remaining projects expected to be completed in 2013. It is currently planned that a further NCN funding call will be undertaken next year for the determination of projects to be funded from 2014-2016.  </p><p>  In terms of developing urban cycle routes, the NTA, under its Sustainable Transport Management Grants Scheme provides funding to relevant local authorities for a range of schemes to benefit cyclists including cycle paths and cycle corridors. </p><p>  Providing safe cycle routes is a key factor in encouraging more people to cycle for both transport and leisure. The Government will therefore continue to provide funding either directly or through the NTA to local authorities for the development of cycle routes. </p></reply>

However these should be offset by the benefits to the industry in terms of  a better regulated and safer taxi sector.</p><p>  Many of the areas of concern to the Deputy have been addressed in the provisions of the Taxi Regulation Bill 2012, which was published earlier this month. The Bill will support measures to ensure that operators and drivers can operate under a robust regulatory framework that is supported by an effective enforcement regime. The provisions of the Bill include mandatory disqualification from holding a driver licence upon convictions of specified serious offences. This measure is in addition to the existing arrangement for Garda vetting of taxi drivers.  There is also provision for the assessment of the suitability of a person to hold a licence linked to new powers for the licensing authority to revoke or suspend, or to refuse to grant a licence, as well as a demerit scheme aimed at penalising persistent breaches of the taxi regulations. </p><p>  The Taxi Regulation Bill provides for the prohibition on the transfer of a vehicle licence as envisaged in the Taxi Regulation Review Report. The underlying principle for this proposal is that a licence should determine a person's suitability to carry out a function and it should have no monetary value or be traded on the open market.  The prohibition on transfer will apply to company licences and a further technical amendment to the legislation will be required to fully address the issue of company licences.   </p><p>  Concerning vehicle standards and the age of some vehicles currently operating in the industry, the Taxi Review Group proposed to allow vehicles licensed before 2009 to continue to operate to the point where the vehicle reaches the fifteenth anniversary of its first registration subject to a twice yearly NCT test and licence renewal assessment. This will allow some time for vehicle owners and drivers to adjust to the new standards regime. The intention is that, over time, vehicles older than nine years will be removed from the taxi and hackney fleet. It is anticipated that this measure will be implemented from 31 January 2013.   </p><p>  There is provision made in the Taxi Regulation Bill 2012 for appeals and representations to be made with regard to SPSV licensing and the decisions of the licensing authority.    </p><p>  The Taxi Advisory Committee, which I appointed during this summer, includes representatives of small public service vehicle and driver interests in line with the provisions of Section 54 of the Taxi Regulation Act, 2003.    </p><p>  The regulation of the small public service vehicle (SPSV) industry, including entry requirements and the operation of the testing process under the SPSV skills development programme, is a matter for the National Transport Authority (NTA) under the Taxi Regulation Act, 2003. In this regard, I have referred your question to the NTA for direct reply. Please advise my private office if you do not receive a response within 10 working days. </p></reply>

Key commitments in the 2011 Programme for Government were reflected in the Government's Jobs Initiative, with further actions set out in the 2012 Action Plan for Jobs.  The Government has already delivered on measures such as reducing VAT to 9% on a range of tourism services and halving employers' PRSI for those on modest wages.  These measures will continue in 2013.  </p><p>  In terms of our main tourism priority, the Gathering Ireland 2013 will be the biggest tourism led initiative ever held in Ireland.  The event aims to attract an extra 325,000 overseas visitors to Ireland with associated spending of over &euro;150 million.  Significant resources are in place to ensure that 'The Gathering' will be successful in delivering these targets.  A special allocation of &euro;5 million was provided in 2012 and a further specific allocation of &euro;7 million has been provided for 2013.  The overall provision for tourism services in 2013 is approximately &euro;140 million across a diverse range of activities.</p><p>  In seeking to grow overseas visits to Ireland, our objective is ultimately to generate jobs.  The Central Statistics Office (CSO) does not measure tourism employment as such, but does measure &quot;Accommodation and Food Service&quot; employment, a category that includes hotels, restaurants, bars and catering.  According to the most recent figures from the CSO, employment in the accommodation and food sector accounted for 123,100 jobs in the third quarter of 2012.</p><p>  Drawing on an alternative approach, F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s estimate of all direct jobs in tourism and hospitality businesses in 2012 (full-time, part-time, seasonal/casual and not confined to &quot;main job&quot;) indicate total employment across sectors, including tourism services and attractions as well as accommodation and food, of around 185,000.  </p><p>  Using The Gathering Ireland 2013 as our centrepiece for 2013 and through continued collaboration between F&aacute;ilte Ireland, Tourism Ireland and the Irish tourist industry, I am confident that we can further grow business for the tourism sector next year with consequential growth in employment. </p></reply>

I am informed by him that the Government has imposed SME lending targets on the two domestic pillar banks and the banks meet with the Department of Finance and the Credit Review Office (CRO) on a quarterly basis to discuss progress and address any issues arising.  The Government has also introduced the Microenterprise Loan Fund Act which provides for a scheme to facilitate additional lending to microenterprises over the next five years.

It is one of a number of Coast Guard Units around the coast operating from Rocket Houses that have been identified for upgrade.    </p><p>  Funds are not available for the Cleggan upgrade in the current capital envelope as the building projects at Killybegs, Doolin and Greystones will take priority.  The current site of the Unit and the Cleggan BIM Ice Plant have been deemed unsuitable for development by the Office of Public Works (OPW).  The identification of an appropriate site can be progressed when there is more certainty about when funds may become available.</p></reply>
