    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-01-24a.10.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017012400052#WRA00800"><p>My colleague the Minister for Jobs Enterprise and Innovation has responsibility for legislation and regulation in relation to statutory minimum wage levels and to conditions of employment.</p>  <p>  However, I can say that it is not accurate to suggest that part-time work has been an important element in recent employment growth.  In the four years ending in the third quarter of 2016, employment increased by 199,000.  Within this total, full-time employment increased by 184,000 while part-time employment grew by only 15,000.  Indeed the number of part-time workers who describe themselves as &ldquo;under-employed&rdquo; &ndash; in other words, working part-time because they could not find full-time work &ndash; actually fell by 47,000 during this period.  The fall in unemployment (and in the Live Register) in recent years is therefore primarily due to growth in full-time, not in part-time employment.</p>  <p>  In relation to wages, wage inequality in Ireland is above the average for the EU member states.  Eurostat data for 2014 indicate that 21% of workers here earn an hourly wage which is less than two-thirds of the median wage &ndash; defined in the data as &ldquo;low-paid&rdquo;.  On this particular measure of inequality, Ireland ranks seventh highest in the EU, and second-highest in the EU-15. </p>  <p>  However, under this Eurostat definition, the threshold for low pay is set relative to the level of earnings in an individual country, rather than to the absolute value of the wage itself.  Because median wages in Ireland are among the highest in the EU, the &ldquo;low-pay threshold&rdquo; is also relatively high &ndash; at &euro;13.44 per hour, as compared with &euro;8.80 per hour for the EU overall, and, for example, &euro;9.96 in France or &euro;9.87 in the UK.  The low-pay threshold in Ireland is in fact close to the median wage in either of the two countries mentioned.</p>  <p>  Finally, it should also be noted that, while inequality in market incomes in Ireland is relatively high, the Irish tax and welfare system does more to offset this inequality than is the case elsewhere in the EU.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-01-24a.13.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017012400052#WRA01000"><p>Government policy to reduce unemployment is twofold.  First, through policies set out in the Action Plan for Jobs, to create an environment in which business can succeed and create jobs and second, through Pathways to Work to ensure that as many of these new jobs and other vacancies that arise in our economy are filled by people taken from the Live Register, including people over 50 years of age.  These policies have seen a significant reduction in unemployment over the last few years.</p>  <p>  People of all ages have benefited from this reduction none more so than people over 50 years of age.  The unemployment rate for persons aged 50 and over has fallen by almost half, from 11.7% at its peak in the third quarter of 2012 to 6.1% in the third quarter of 2016.   The unemployment rate for older members of the labour force is also lower than for those in younger age groups.  Quarterly National Household Survey Data data show that in the third quarter of 2016, the most recent period for which disaggregated data is available, the unemployment rate for those aged 50-64 was 6.1%, as compared with 7.5% for those aged 25-49 and 17.7% for those aged under 25.</p>  <p>  This pattern &ndash; of lower relative unemployment among those in the older age-groups &ndash; has been a consistent one over time and current trends suggest that older unemployed people will continue to benefit from the improving labour market conditions.   </p>  <p>  With regard to the question of targeting the over 50 age group through specific measures, the Department already prioritises two groups for activation support.  People aged under 25 are prioritised given the higher rate of unemployment among young people, and people who are long-term unemployed are prioritised given their relatively low progression to employment rates.  With the exception of these two groups the prioritisation of resources for employment and activation purposes within the Department is based on a range of factors using a jobseeker profiling and assessment method developed in conjunction with the ESRI.  Age is one of the factors taken into account in this model, as are gender, nationality, level of educational attainment, family circumstances and prior employment experience.  This holistic approach is in line with best international practice and ensures that resources are targeted in a more precise way than using broadly based indicators such as age alone.    </p>  <p>  Given that the underlying unemployment data do not indicate a requirement for specific measures targeted at the over 50s it is not proposed to introduce new measures aimed specifically at the older unemployed at this time.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-01-24a.16.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017012400052#WRA01200"><p>The majority of people in receipt of a payment from the Department of Social Protection receive what they are entitled to be paid.  Nevertheless, my Department recognises that abuse of the welfare system is an ongoing reality and must be tackled.  Anti-fraud measures are set out in the Department&rsquo;s Compliance and Anti-Fraud Strategy 2014 &ndash; 2018 and are designed to prevent and detect fraud, to ensure effective oversight of schemes, to pursue prosecution of offenders and the recovery of any overpaid entitlements identified.  I will be publishing the report on the implementation of the Strategy for the year 2016 before the end of March.</p>  <p>  All Departmental staff exercise a control and compliance function in processing new applications and reviewing existing entitlements.  The systems used to support schemes are designed to detect wrongful claiming and to highlight anomalies.  In addition, the Department&rsquo;s inspectorate undertakes detailed examination of claims on a risk assessed and random basis.  This is supplemented by at least three fraud and error surveys of Departmental schemes annually and by the use of data matching and data analytics techniques.  </p>  <p>  In addition, my Department&rsquo;s Special Investigation Unit, which comprises trained inspectors and Garda officers, is tasked with undertaking targeted and systematic examination of claims to tackle fraud and to work with other enforcement agencies to identify more serious breaches of the law.  </p>  <p>  Cross-functional and targeted actions are undertaken - both internally and in joint operations with other national and international agencies - to ensure a strategic response to high risk sectors or where fraud is considered to be most prevalent.  In particular, actions are focused on sectors of the economy where there is a risk of concurrent working and claiming social welfare payments.  New forms of fraud continue to be identified and the approach of the Department needs to be sufficiently flexible to combat all threats.</p>  <p>  Overall, my Department conducts around one million claim reviews annually comprising customer entitlement enquiries, inspections and special investigations.  Early indications for 2016 are that these activities have prevented incorrect expenditure of over half a billion euro, in what my Department refers to as control savings.</p>  <p>  The continued roll-out of the Public Services Card has considerably reduced the potential for identity fraud and my Department has deployed identity and analytics software and other intelligence systems to reinforce its fraud prevention work.  Members of the public also play an important role in supporting these anti-fraud activities and some 19,000 reports from concerned citizens have been received during 2016.   To this end, I plan to launch a fraud awareness campaign over the coming months in recognition of the important role the public plays in this regard.  </p>  <p>  The value of overpayments recovered has increased steadily in recent years and indications are that approx. &euro;82m was recovered in 2016.  This figure is subject to verification.  </p>  <p>  I am looking at a number of additional anti-fraud measures that I hope to introduce in 2017.  These include publishing the names of persons who are convicted of social welfare fraud and applying surcharges on overpayments resulting from fraud.   </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-01-24a.19.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017012400052#WRA01400"><p>The supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme can consist of a basic weekly payment and/or a weekly/monthly supplement in respect of certain expenses, including rent, as well as single exceptional needs payments (ENPs) and urgent needs payments (UNPs).  Some &euro;378 million has been provided for the SWA scheme in 2017 including &euro;31.5 million for ENPs &amp;amp; UNPs.  The SWA schemes are subject to a means test and are demand led.  The reductions in numbers receiving support under SWA can be attributed to the overall improvement in the economy, improvements in administration and policy changes in recent years.  The numbers on the Live Register have dropped significantly from a peak of almost 450,000 in 2011 to a current figure of some 280,000 - a drop of almost 38%.  For example, to focus on ENPs, expenditure has been stabilising in recent years at between &euro;30 million and &euro;32 million with some 100,000 ENPs made in 2016.</p>  <p>  The ENP guidelines issued to staff in 2012 and 2013 have contributed to more streamlined and consistent approaches being taken to applications across the country.  The guidelines do not affect the statutory discretion available to officers administering the scheme in issuing an ENP to assist an individual or household in any particular hardship situation which may arise.  Separately, my Department is leading on the provision of extra supports for vulnerable people in the development of the Personal Micro Credit (PMS) scheme which aims to move people to legitimate, low cost, locally available alternative access to credit.  To date, 95 Credit Unions, representing 180 credit union locations, have signed up as participants of the scheme. </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that the SWA scheme is kept under review to ensure that the CWS continues to support those most in need of assistance.</p></reply>

There are currently approximately 873,000 customers with direct eligibility with an annual allocation of &euro;80 million.  My Department also provides annual funding of &euro;1.5 million towards the Rural Transport Programme which<b></b>provides services to people whose travel needs are not met by existing bus or train services.</p><p>I have no plans at this time to introduce travel vouchers for persons living in rural Ireland with no access to public transport.  Any decision to do so would significantly change the nature of the free travel scheme and would have budgetary consequences. </p><p>Various alternatives to the existing system, including the use of vouchers, have been examined previously by my Department which concluded that a voucher type system, which would be open to a wide range of transport providers including taxis, would be extremely difficult to administer, open to misuse and unlikely to be sufficient to provide for an acceptable amount of travel. </p><p>Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme my Department may award a travel supplement in any case where the circumstances of the case so warrant.  The supplement is intended to assist with ongoing or recurring travel costs that cannot be met from the client&rsquo;s own resources and are deemed to be necessary.  Every decision is based on consideration of the circumstances of the case, taking account of the nature and extent of the need and of the resources of the person concerned. </p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

These include programmes such as Community Employment (CE), T&uacute;s and Gateway.  These schemes help to break the cycle of unemployment and improve a person&rsquo;s chances of returning to the labour market.  My Department is also very conscious of the valuable contribution the schemes are making in the provision of services to individuals and communities across Ireland.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, these employment schemes provide part-time temporary work in local communities, including opportunities for training and development as a stepping-stone back to employment, for people in receipt of a range of social welfare payments, including those on a long-term jobseeker&rsquo;s payment. </p>  <p>  With the ongoing welcome reductions in the Live Register, issues such as the appropriate level of expenditure, the number of places and the criteria for participation on employment schemes are all being considered.  I hope to bring a Memorandum to Government on these matters in the coming weeks.  If there are any changes to be made, consultations with stakeholders will be facilitated.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This includes enhancing the position of the self-employed through a supportive tax regime, improving the level of PRSI based benefits available to self-employed workers and providing a better safety net for low income self-employed farmers.</p>  <p>  As part of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to rural Ireland, I am announce the total reversal of cuts to the means test for the Farm Assist scheme, a programme which helps over 7,800 self-employed farm families.  At a time of falling farm incomes, it&rsquo;s essential that we strengthen the safety net for farmers who are on the margin.  The introduction of additional income disregards for farmers with children further ensures that farm families with children will benefit.</p>  <p>  Also, in recognition of the crucial work undertaken in rural communities by the Rural Social Scheme, an additional 500 places will be made available to low-income farmers on the scheme this year.  This will bring the total number of places on the scheme up from 2,600 to 3,100 in 2017. </p>  <p>  Improving the PRSI system has been one of my key priorities since becoming Minister in this Department.  On Budget Day, I was pleased to announce important measures which will directly benefit the self-employed. </p>  <p>  From March 2017, the self-employed will have access to the treatment benefit scheme which includes free eye and dental examinations, and contributions towards the cost of hearings aids.  Treatment benefit entitlements will also be extended from October 2017 so as to provide further dental and optical benefits.  This improvement will benefit both the self-employed and employees.</p>  <p>  Even more significantly, self-employed contributors will be eligible for the Invalidity Pension from December 2017.  For the first time, this will give the self-employed access to the safety-net of State income supports if they become permanently incapable of work as a result of an illness or disability without having to go through a means test.

My Department will continue to ensure that those on low incomes and those who are more vulnerable to energy poverty are supported through the fuel allowance and the household benefits package.  The fuel allowance is a payment of &euro;22.50 per week for 26 weeks from October to April, to over 379,000 low income households, at an estimated cost of &euro;229 million in 2017.  This payment assists these households with the higher energy costs that arise in that period.  It is a contribution towards the energy costs of a household.  It is not intended to meet those costs in full. Only one allowance is paid per household.</p>  <p>  My Department also pays an electricity or gas allowance as part of the household benefits package to over 424,000 customers, at an estimated cost of &euro;232 million in 2017. </p>  <p>  Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, a special heating supplement may be paid to assist people in certain circumstances who have special heating needs due to ill health or infirmity.  Exceptional needs payments may also be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost which a person is unable to meet from his/her own resources.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s affordable energy strategy indicated that the best measure to address energy poverty is to improve the thermal efficiency of homes.  The Better Energy Warmer Homes scheme, administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, funds energy efficiency improvements in the homes of the elderly and vulnerable, making the homes more comfortable, healthier and more cost effective to heat.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Contractors are paid quarterly in arrears for each 13 week period of sustained employment of at least 30 hours per week and will only get full payments if the jobseeker stays in employment for 12 months.  Suitability of employment is a key factor in ensuring that jobs are sustainable.  If people are placed into unsuitable jobs they are less likely to remain in employment and as a consequence the providers fees will be reduced.</p><p>The JobPath providers work closely with employers to provide them with the best possible candidates for available jobs.  It is not in the interests of the JobPath companies to place unsuitable candidates into inappropriate jobs as this will have adverse effects on the companies&rsquo; ability to secure jobs for its other clients. </p><p>The report which the Deputy has referred to is limited to very small sample (55 interviews over a three year period).  The findings are at variance with findings from a recently completed large-scale survey of Intreo centre clients carried out by an independent external agency in 2016.  In summary, this survey which will be published shortly, found that jobseekers rated the service highly and on the key aspects of premises, staff, services and processes, the view of jobseekers was almost uniformly positive.  These results echo the results of a similar survey completed in 2015.</p><p>With regard to the issue of penalty rates of payment, jobseeker payments are conditional on jobseekers being genuinely available for work.  The activation and employment support services provided by the Department, at significant expense, are designed to help jobseekers secure employment.  In line with the principle of rights and responsibilities jobseekers are entitled to be provided with these services but are also required to engage with the services when they are made available.  This obligation applies irrespective of whether the service is provided by my Department&rsquo;s own case officers, those employed by the Local Employment Service or by JobPath.  Failure, without good cause, to engage with the services can result in a reduction in the payment to the jobseeker.  However reductions are only applied after the jobseeker has been given due notice on two occasions and an opportunity to provide an explanation for their non-engagement and to re-engage with the services.  All decisions on the application of a reduced rate of payment are made by staff of the Department.  This process is very different to the process in the UK which seemed to inform much of the commentary in the report referenced in the question.</p><p>Currently across the country less than 1% of jobseekers are on a reduced rate of payment relating to their non-engagement with the Department&rsquo;s activation services.  Again this contrasts with the UK rate of 16% rate quoted in the report referenced in the question. </p><p>With regard to the quality of service delivered by the JobPath  providers, an independent survey of a representative sample of over 2,000 participants shows that the majority of jobseekers feel that:</p><p>- They are receiving a good service under JobPath (76 &ndash; 81% satisfaction vs 5 &ndash; 8% dissatisfaction).</p><p>- JobPath staff make them feel valued (90%+) and they have a good relationship with their JobPath advisor (90%+).</p><p>- The JobPath service has improved their chances of getting a job (68% - 77%).</p><p>- The service is as good as or better than the service provided in Intreo centres (80%+).</p><p>A separate analysis of employment outcomes for JobPath participants show that they have a higher chance of securing and remaining in a job than participants of a similar duration of unemployment.  Given that only a small number of people have completed their full engagement with the JobPath service these results can only be treated as indicative, nevertheless they are encouraging.  The results together with a copy of the survey findings together are available at </p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

During the financial crisis the decline of defined benefit pension schemes accelerated.  Occupational pension schemes are generally set up under trust and are contributed to by the employer on a voluntary basis.  Almost all Irish defined benefit schemes have a rule that allows the employer to cease contributions, usually after a notice period.  Neither the Minister for Social Protection nor the Pensions Authority has the power under legislation to intervene to freeze the winding up of a scheme or to compel the employer to make contributions to a scheme.  Neither is there an obligation on the employer to give notice to members or to consult in advance of ceasing contributions.  However, in the case where a restructuring of benefits is proposed, pensioners, deferred scheme members and unions must be kept informed by trustees.  Furthermore, changes made in 2015 require trustees to notify groups representing the interests of pensioners and deferred scheme members in a scheme in such a situation.  </p>  <p>  While there are strong arguments for the introduction of greater employer obligations, it is also the case that certain less desirable side effects may result.  Any changes to the Pensions Act that legislatively alters the relationship between a pension scheme and its sponsoring employer could have far-reaching implications for pensioners and the pension sector as a whole, as well as the employers.  These could include prompting well-funded schemes to wind up to avoid new obligations; threatening a company&rsquo;s financial stability; rendering some employers insolvent; and/or giving a competitive advantage to employers who either never provided a pension and/or put defined contribution schemes in place.</p>  <p>  My Department and the Pensions Authority are currently working on proposals for the reform and simplification of pensions, the purpose of which is to impose higher standards on all occupational schemes.</p>  <p>  I would like to assure the Deputy that my Department and the Pensions Authority are closely monitoring developments in the DB sector and keep the need for legislative change under continuous review.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

As such, those with a stronger attachment to the workforce, who have paid more into that fund, are more likely to be paid at a higher rate under that scheme, than those with more intermittent contributions made during their working life.  Since the contributory pension was introduced in 1961, the &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; contributions test has been used in calculating the level of pension entitlement, where the total contributions paid or credited are divided by the number of years of the working life (from their entry into insurable employment up to the year prior to their reaching State pension age).  There are a number of criteria which must be satisfied in order to qualify for a State pension (contributory), whether at full or reduced level.  These include that the person must be aged 66 or over, and that they have at least 520 paid contributions.  Payment rates are banded.  For example, someone with a yearly average of 48 contributions will qualify for a full pension, whereas someone with a lower yearly average of 40 will qualify for a pension at the 98% rate.</p>  <p>  The home-makers scheme makes qualification for a higher rate of State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme, which was introduced in and took effect from 1994, allows up to 20 years after that date spent caring for children under 12 years of age (or caring for incapacitated people over that age) to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes, subject to the standard qualifying conditions for State pension contributory also being satisfied.  This has the effect of increasing the yearly average of the pensioner, which is used to set the rate of their pension, amounting up to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate.</p>  <p>  The Department is currently working on the development of a &ldquo;Total Contributions Approach&rdquo; (TCA) to replace the yearly average approach.  The aim of this approach is to make the rate of contributory pension more closely match contributions made by a person with a view to making proposals for consideration later in the year.  It is worth noting that this is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative, and technical elements in its implementation.  An important element in the final design of the scheme will be the position of people who have gaps in their contribution records for various reasons, and this factor is being considered very carefully in developing this reform.</p>  <p>  The Deputy should note that, on an actuarial basis, it is a fact that women generally get more back from their PRSI contributions than men.  This is particularly true for women with lower earnings and shorter contribution years.  The Actuarial Review of the Fund in 2012 confirmed that the Fund provides better value to female rather than male contributors.  This is due to the redistributive nature of the Fund.  The forthcoming Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund will provide data that will allow officials to accurately cost and project various options available under the TCA reform.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

With JobPath the department has procured additional resources to enable it to provide a high quality case managed employment support service to people who are long term unemployed and those most at risk of becoming long-term unemployed.</p>  <p>  The JobPath service was designed to augment and complement the Department&rsquo;s existing employment service capacity, including that provide by LES.  The additional capacity provided through the JobPath service has allowed the department to provide the type and intensity of services required by Jobseekers, particularly those most distant from the labour market.</p>  <p>  Prior to the introduction of Intreo and JobPath the Department had a case officer to live register ratio of approximately 1,500:1 compared to international benchmarks of less than 200:1.  Today with the reduction in the unemployment rate and the increase in capacity, both internally through Intreo and externally through JobPath, the ratio is circa 230:1 and is trending downwards.  Nevertheless with a ratio of 230:1 as compared with international norms of less than 200:1 JobPath continues to play a key role in the delivery of the services required by Jobseekers and is likely to do so for the next few years.</p>  <p>  The initial data on the impact of the service is encouraging, showing high satisfaction levels among clients of the service, and that people who engage with the service are more likely to secure employment than those who do not.  The results of an independent customer satisfaction survey recently undertaken (which forms part of the report) indicates that jobseekers feel that they are receiving a good service, and that JobPath has improved their chances of securing employment. </p>  <p>  The department continues to monitor the delivery of the service and will publish performance data on a quarterly basis this year. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The reasons for this are diverse and demand a wide-ranging response.  The Comprehensive Employment Strategy (CES) for People with Disabilities sets the overall direction of the government&rsquo;s response to this problem and seeks to reduce barriers to employment and improve pathways to work.  My Department actively participated in the development of the strategy and takes a full part in its implementation.  For instance, among the commitments contained in the CES was the setting up of an interdepartmental group, under an independent chair, to review and make recommendations to &ldquo;Make Work Pay&rdquo; (MWP) for people with disabilities through the examination of the complex interactions between the benefit system, the additional costs associated with work for people with disabilities and net income earnings from employment.  I understand that the group is concluding its work and the report will be published soon.  Of course, along with its comprehensive range of income supports, my Department provides for a range of supports to allow people with disabilities to improve their employability, to seek and take up employment.  I stress that take-up of the employment supports are of a voluntary nature and are tailored to individual circumstances and a person&rsquo;s capacity to engage with education, training or job-search programmes.  For instance, my Department has progressively extended its Intreo service to persons with disabilities and over 60 officers have received training to enable them to interact effectively with people with disabilities.  The Department of Social Protection provides a wide range of work related supports for people with disabilities.</p>  <p>  One of the principal supports is access to the EmployAbility service, which provides job-coach support to people with disabilities in accessing jobs in the open labour market.  Other supports include the provision of employment subsidies through the Wage Subsidy Scheme, workplace adaptation grants and specialist training courses that are specially designed for people with disabilities.  Funding is also provided to AHEAD (Association for Higher Education Access and Disability) for the Willing Able Mentoring (WAM) programme, an employment placement programme for graduates with disabilities. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This Action Plan will include a road map for the reform of the State pension, rationalisation and reform of the Defined Benefit pension landscape, transposition of the IORP2 directive and the introduction of auto-enrolment Defined Contribution pensions for all working people.</p><p>All reforms we will propose to the pension system will be based on the idea of fairness and equality.  The current gap between State pension payments made to men and women over the age of 66 averages out to a difference of 2%.  Although this 2% gap between genders is not ideal, it does compare favourably to our EU counterparts.</p><p>The National Pensions Framework (2010) proposed that a &ldquo;Total Contributions Approach&rdquo; (TCA) should replace the yearly average approach for new pensioners from 2020.  The aim of this approach is to make the rate of contributory pension more closely match contributions made by a person.  Officials of my Department are currently working on the detailed development of the TCA.  It is planned that, following receipt and analysis of data from the forthcoming independent Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund, a consultation process will be conducted in the middle of this year, and following this, proposals on the final details of the scheme will be made by the Government to the Oireachtas before the end of the year. </p><p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that this is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative, and technical elements in its implementation.  An important element in the final design of the scheme will be the position of people who have gaps in their contribution records for various reasons, and this factor is being considered very carefully in developing this reform. </p><p>The Pensions Authority is the independent body responsible for regulating occupational pension schemes and ensuring compliance with the Pensions Act.  My Department and the Pensions Authority are working on proposals for the reform and simplification of pensions, the purpose of which is to impose higher standards on all occupational schemes.  The reform proposals are intended to apply equally to defined benefit (DB) provision to ensure that those charged with running DB schemes do so in a manner which provides greater security for their members.  Standards in respect of pension schemes will be further enhanced by the transposition of the new IORPS 2 Directive within the next two years.</p><p>In relation to supplementary private pensions and the gender gap, the rate of coverage in Ireland is almost equal at approximately 47% of those in employment for both men and women.  However, it would be true to say that there are gender gaps in terms of the value of private pensions savings.  Given that private pensions are largely a function of the amount contributed by employees, this gap reflects gender differences in employment patterns, notably in pay, working hours and career duration.</p><p>In relation to the supplementary coverage of 47% more generally, despite the considerable efforts by Governments and the pensions industry to promote and incentivise voluntary participation in supplementary pensions, the marginal changes in coverage over the last 20 years indicates that the voluntary approach to pensions participation is not achieving the desired goal in terms of increasing coverage to an appropriate level.  Therefore, it is my intention to bring forward proposals for an auto-enrolment system for those workers without retirement savings.  This is to address a situation where future retirees will suffer unwanted reduction in living standards at retirement<i>.</i></p><p>Detailed analysis and consultation will be required in order to ensure that any system proposed adequately addresses the needs of the target membership and the gender issue will be closely considered as part of this process.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

It enables eligible persons to pursue approved education courses and to continue to receive income support for the duration of a course of study, subject to meeting certain conditions.  The objective of BTEA is to assist those who are distant from the labour market to acquire the necessary education to improve their chances of becoming independent of the social welfare system.  The BTEA should not be viewed, however, as an alternative to the student grant system.</p>  <p>  The focus of the BTEA scheme is on providing assistance to the highest possible number of those in greatest need in terms of meeting the requirements of a modern labour market.  People in possession of a third-level qualification have already achieved a high level of academic attainment which should impact positively on their employment prospects.</p>  <p>  Other than the Professional Masters in Education, which is a pre-requisite to taking up a teaching post, the BTEA does not provide income support to jobseekers seeking to pursue a higher degree qualification at Masters Level.  Having a Masters degree is not regarded as a prerequisite to re-entering the workforce and, at present, I have no plans to extend the scheme to cover courses leading to a Masters degree.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The Action Plan for Jobs support continuing strong economic recovery and employment growth.  Policies and actions to ensure that unemployed people benefit from the increase in employment are set out in the strategy paper Pathways to Work 2016-2020.</p>  <p>  To date, these policies have been effective in reducing both overall and long-term unemployment.  The most recent data show that unemployment has fallen from a peak of 15% in 2012 to 7.2% in December 2016.  The long-term unemployment rate peaked at 9.5% in Q1 2012 before falling to 4.2% in Q3 2016.  At the latter date, the long-term unemployed accounted for 52% of all those unemployed, down from almost 65% in early 2012.  The number of long term unemployed in Q3 2016 was 92,300; this compares to 204,300 in early 2012.</p>  <p>  Long-term unemployment can be expected to fall further this year in line with the forecast fall in overall unemployment.</p>  <p>  The Government recognises the importance of a continued focus on measures to facilitate long-term unemployed people find and sustain employment.  This is the rationale behind the Government&rsquo;s Pathways to Work 2016-2020 strategy (published January 2016). </p>  <p>  A range of measures were introduced under previous Pathways to Work strategies for long-term unemployed people.  This included a structured process of engagement with long-term unemployed people being referred to the activation process (Group Engagement followed by regular one-to-one case officer contact); wage subsidies in JobsPlus; the roll-out of a payment-by-results contracted employment services in JobPath, to provide additional capacity in order to engage more systematically with long-term unemployed jobseekers; and reserved places for long-term unemployed jobseekers on a range of Further Education and Training (FET) and public employment programmes. </p>  <p>  A core focus of Pathways to Work 2016-2020 is on consolidating and improving the quality and consistency of reforms undertaken in previous strategies, with continued prioritisation of those long-term unemployed.  </p>  <p>  I am confident these measures, and continuing economic recovery, will support further reductions in long term unemployment to add to the substantial improvements that have already been seen over the last few years.</p></reply>

Before finalising the Framework, there was an important consultation process both within my Department and with the community and voluntary sector and the HSE.</p>  <p>  One of the main issues discussed in detail during this consultation was that addiction is a complex, bio-psycho-social phenomenon.  Accordingly, a range of factors will affect participant&rsquo;s progression towards recovery and an integrated response is required to ensure effective outcomes for participants, supervisors and sponsors.  I believe that the Framework provides the necessary flexibility and support both to participants entering the CE drug rehabilitation programme and to supervisors and sponsors.</p>  <p>  At the end of December 2016, there were 987 referred clients on drug rehabilitation places (697 male and 290 female) and 138 support workers (50 male and 88 female).  In total, at the end of December 2016 therefore, there were 1,125 places taken up on CE drugs schemes. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, under the National Drugs Strategy, it is also recognised that the response to substance misuse is a cross-cutting issue.  No single agency has the range of competencies or expertise to provide all the supports needed to assist recovering drug users to complete their rehabilitation.  While CE has an important role to play, it needs to be supplemented by support from other bodies such as the HSE, the Department of Education and Science and relevant agencies that play a key role in the overall integrated response to this client group in terms of rehabilitation.</p>  <p>  If the Deputy is aware of particular issues affecting CE drugs schemes, he should bring them to my attention and I will ask my officials to examine them. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This is because many lone parents, on foot of the reforms, are taking up education, training or employment support programmes, which will take time for them to complete.</p>  <p>  However, given the issues raised during the debate on the Social Welfare (SW) Bill 2016, I agreed that my Department would commission an independent report on the OFP reforms to examine the financial and social effects of the amendments to the scheme made since 1 January 2012, taking into account the poverty rates and welfare dependency of those impacted by the reforms.  I am committed to producing the report as quickly as possible, and no later than August 2017 so that it can inform Budget 2018 discussions.</p>  <p>  Under procurement rules it is not yet possible to provide further information on the nature of the report.  However, I can say that my Department has already liaised with the Office of Government Procurement (OGP) on the most efficient way forward.  On their advice an outline of the Request For Tender (RFT) was issued in December to potential providers seeking expressions of interest by 11th January 2017.  The responses received confirm that the RFT can issue under an existing OGP framework.  The drafting of the RFT has commenced and officials are working with the OGP to complete the procurement process.  The timeframe for this report is ambitious but my Department is making every effort to progress this quickly taking account of the procurement rules.</p></reply>

On Budget Day, I was pleased to announce a number of important measures which will benefit the self-employed.</p>  <p>  From March 2017, the self-employed will have access to the treatment benefit scheme which includes free eye and dental exams, and contributions towards the cost of hearings aids.  Treatment benefit entitlements will also be extended from October 2017 so as to provide further dental and optical benefits (these improvements will benefit both the self-employed and employees).</p>  <p>  More significantly, self-employed contributors will be eligible for the Invalidity Pension from December 2017.  For the first time, this will give the self-employed access to the safety-net of State income supports if they become permanently incapable of work as a result of an illness or disability without having to go through a means test.  This is a real advance in the level of cover available to the self-employed.</p>  <p>  The self-employed will also benefit in 2017 from the further increase in Earned Income Tax Credit announced by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, as well as the extension of entrepreneurship supports.  These measures are all part of the Government&rsquo;s policy of making work pay and encouraging self-employment and entrepreneurship.</p>  <p>  I plan to continue extending cover for the self-employed to other benefits on a phased basis in future Budgets.  In 2017, my Department will examine the extension of social insurance to cover new risks and contingencies, including developing proposals on a form of jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit where a person's business fails or they can no longer continue working in their profession or trade.</p></reply>

It is a service designed to enhance the protection of children and vulnerable persons.  The Garda National Vetting Bureau carries out this function in accordance with the provisions of the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Acts 2012 to 2016.  The organisation referred to by the Deputy is registered with the Garda National Vetting Bureau for the provision of vetting services to organisations that are in receipt of the relevant funding only and organisations meeting this criterion are referred by the Vetting Bureau to the organisation for processing.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda Authorities that at present, 80 percent of vetting applications are processed by the Garda National Vetting Bureau in under five working days.  This represents a significant improvement in turnaround times for the processing of vetting applications in recent years, falling from an average of 14 weeks in mid-2013.  This improvement has come about as a result of an unprecedented investment by the Government and the Garda Authorities in providing this service, including an increase of over 80 percent in staffing levels and the roll out earlier this year of an e-Vetting system.</p>  <p>  In April last year I commenced the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Acts 2012 to 2016 and in tandem with that, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na launched the e-Vetting system.  E-Vetting facilitates the on-line processing of applications and this has significantly streamlined the vetting process and contributed to a sustained reduction in processing times for vetting applications.

The purpose of the <i>in camera</i>rule in family law proceedings is to protect the identity of the parties and any child to whom the proceedings relate. While the general principle<b></b>as set out in <i>Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann</i>is that justice be administered in public, the underlying concern is that family law proceedings relate to matters which are sensitive and private to the parties and there is no public interest in requiring that their identities be published. The <i>in camera</i>rule offers protection to children and other family members from the publication or broadcasting of information relating to them which would affect the anonymity of the parties or any child concerned.</p><p>Section 40 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 clarifies the position with regard to the <i>in camera</i>rule and the carrying out of hearings, inquiries and investigations by bodies or persons who are doing so in accordance with their statutory functions.  Section 40(6) allows documents prepared for or given in evidence in family law proceedings to be produced to bodies or persons carrying out statutory functions involving the conducting of a hearing, inquiry or investigation in relation to, or adjudicating on, any matter.  Section 40(7) allows information or evidence given in family law proceedings to be given to bodies or persons carrying out statutory functions involving the conducting of a hearing, inquiry or investigation in relation to, or adjudicating on, any matter.  Section 40(9) provides that such a hearing, inquiry or investigation shall be conducted otherwise than in public, in so far as it involves documents, information or evidence provided under section 40(6) or 40(7), and the documents, information and evidence shall not be published.  </p><p>As section 40 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 ensures that regulatory bodies carrying out their statutory functions can access documents, information or evidence relating to family law proceedings where necessary for the purpose of conducting hearings, inquiries and investigations, I do not believe that further legislation in this area is needed at this time.</p><p>With regard to the specific matter raised by the Deputy regarding investigation of complaints into the professional conduct of psychologists, psychotherapists and psychiatrists who prepare reports under section 47 of the Family Law Act 1995, these are policy matters for the Department of Health which has provided me with the following response:</p><p>&quot;A complaint can be made to a regulatory body for investigation under Fitness to Practice in the case of a regulated health profession such as a medical practitioner, a nurse, a dentist, pharmacist and a number of designated health and social care professions. In the case of a psychiatrist, the Medical Council is the appropriate regulatory body. Psychologists, one of 14 professions designated for regulation under the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005, are not regulated as of yet. Once regulated, the Health and Social Care Professionals Council (CORU) will be the appropriate body to which a complaint can be made. Consideration is currently being given to a proposal to designate counsellors and psychotherapists for regulation under the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 but work is at an early stage.&quot;</p></reply>

There is no requirement for legislation and no proposals for legislation on this issue.</p>  <p>  In September 2015, my predecessor brought a paper to the Cabinet Sub-Committee on Social Policy on the question of recognising Travellers as a distinct ethnic group within Irish society. This followed a process of dialogue with the national level Traveller NGOs during 2015 which culminated in the presentation of an agreed position paper by them and confirmation that there are no legal or expenditure implications arising from such recognition. The key point is that recognition of the distinct heritage, culture and identity of Travellers and their special place in Irish society would be hugely important to Traveller pride, to Traveller self-esteem and to overcoming the legacy of marginalisation and discrimination that the community has experienced.</p>  <p>  I have had a long standing interest in this area, most notably through my chairing of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality when it produced its report on the Recognition of Traveller Ethnicity (April 2014). My officials and I have been working to advance this matter and I made a presentation to the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy in December 2016.  An an invitation has been extended to Traveller representatives to meet that Cabinet Committee to further these discussions.</p></reply>

In assessing the suitability of potential EROCs, consideration is given to a number of factors including:</p>  <p>- the accommodation capacity of the EROC</p>  <p>- its potential for on-site services</p>  <p>- the potential availability of school placements for children of a school going age in the general area</p>  <p>- the potential availability of primary care and hospitals within reasonable travelling distance</p>  <p>- the experience of the location in having asylum seekers previously</p>  <p>- availability of other local services including public transport and shopping</p>  <p>- potential for the centre managers to provide additional services to both residents and local population</p>  <p>- potential benefits to local commerce</p>  <p>  Approximately 90 properties were offered in response to the call for expressions of interest.  After a short-listing exercise based on suitability and state of repair, 14 properties emerged as having potential.  The selection process was suspended in early 2016 because the numbers arriving under the EU relocation programme were lower than anticipated due to operational problems in Greece and Italy.  When the numbers arriving increased in late 2016, the short list was re-examined.  The property in Ballaghaderreen was identified as the only property on the short list that could be made operational as a suitable EROC within a time frame that would meet demand in early 2017.  As there will be a need for further EROCs to receive further persons arriving under the Programme, a new procurement exercise is expected to commence in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

The Joint Committee received 29 submissions and held public hearings following which it issued a report on 6 November 2013 which contained 8 conclusions and was laid before the Houses.</p><p>The 2013 General Scheme provides for the conferring of responsibility for all regulatory matters in this area on the Minister for Justice and Equality, including licensing, inspections and prosecutions, and it envisages that these functions would be carried out by a body located within the Department of Justice and Equality. The General Scheme also provides for a dedicated inspectorate to ensure compliance by licence holders with the terms of their licences and with the new legislation generally.</p><p>The Gambling Control Bill will have consumer protection generally as one of its core principles, and it is envisaged that it will include several measures aimed at the protection of vulnerable persons, including children, from risks to their well-being arising from gambling. The 2013 Scheme includes measures that will require licence holders to act in a socially responsible way. These measures include controls on advertising, promotions and sponsorship.</p><p>It is the intention to proceed with this legislation at the earliest opportunity. In support of these efforts the Government has delegated powers of the Minister for Justice and Equality under the gaming and lotteries legislation to me as Minister of State. </p><p>At the same time, and pending the bringing forward of the main Bill, which is a major undertaking, I have also asked my Department to examine whether there are any individual pressing areas of concern, intended to be dealt with in the Bill, which could be dealt with early this year by separate legislative measures. A number of such measures are, therefore, under active consideration with a view to their inclusion in the Scheme of the forthcoming Courts and Civil Law Miscellaneous Provisions Bill which is, under the Government Legislation Programme, to be submitted for legislative scrutiny early this year. This initial approach will, as I have indicated, be augmented by the completion of the more complex work on the main Bill for Government approval and publication later this year.</p><p>I and officials of my Department are continuing to consult with relevant stake-holders, including those with experience in dealing with persons for whom gambling has become a problem and, as I have outlined, I intend to move forward as quickly as possible with the appropriate legislation.</p></reply>

The Prison Service accept the prisoner on the basis of the Consolidated Committal Order, which refers to male or female gender.  </p>  <p>  I am further advised by the Irish Prison Service that on arrival in prison, all prisoners are brought to the reception/committal unit of the prison, where there is an opportunity to provide personal and physical details as part of the committal interview process.  The assessment of the prisoner&rsquo;s needs, may require the Prison Governor to consider the biological gender, legal gender, gender identity, transgender, gender expression, sexual orientation or gender recognition legislation.  In such cases the Governor may make a recommendation on the appropriate placement within the prison system, taking into consideration good order, security &amp;amp; operational issues, protection issues, available accommodation and the healthcare needs of the prisoner. </p>  <p>  The provision of healthcare is a statutory obligation on the Irish Prison Service as defined in the Prison Rules, 2007. The Irish Prison Service is committed to providing general healthcare services for the assessment, treatment and care of all prisoners, including Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender (LGBT) prisoners, which is comparable to those available in the community and which are appropriate to the prison setting. </p>  <p>  The Irish Prison Service recognises the need for clear policies and protocols to comply with recently enacted legislation in this area. In their 3 year Strategic Plan 2016-2018, the Irish Prison Service sets out its clear commitment to provide a safe and inclusive environment for all minority groups and develop appropriate placement policies. </p>  <p>  The Irish Prisons Service has welcomed the recent publication of research by the Irish Penal Reform Trust, entitled &lsquo;Out on the Inside&rsquo; which highlights issues to be addressed for transgender prisoners. These issues present significant challenges to maintain a balance between safety and security and the overall objective that all persons in custody are treated with dignity and respect.</p>  <p>  The Irish Prison Service has indicated that it will shortly establish a working group in order to prepare a new policy for LGBT prisoners.</p></reply>

Section 63 of the 2011 Act provides that a person may make a complaint to the PSRA alleging improper conduct on the part of a licensed property service provider. Subject to a basic assessment under Section 63 of the admissibility of the complaint, the PSRA is obliged to carry out an investigation into the alleged improper conduct. The complaint may also be resolved informally between the complainant and the licensee with the PSRA facilitating such settlements where possible.</p><p>The Act does not provide for preliminary investigations so in every instance that a complaint is deemed admissible, an Inspector is appointed and a full and formal investigation is undertaken in accordance with Section 65 of the 2011 Act. Complainants in this type of investigation are kept informed of the progress of the investigation, by the investigating Inspector, as required by Section 65(5) of the Act. At the conclusion of the investigation, the Inspector's penultimate task is to prepare a Draft Investigation Report which is sent to both the complainant and the licensee and on which both can make submissions to the Inspector. The Inspector's final task is to prepare the Final Investigation Report, taking into account any submissions received on the Draft Report, and to submit the Final Report to the Authority. It is then a matter for the Authority to consider the content of the Final Investigation Report and to take any action it considers appropriate in relation to the matter, in accordance with the provisions of the Act. </p><p>A table provides details of complaints received by the PSRA for the years 2012 to 2016 inclusive. Of these, 76% have been fully concluded. Additional resources have been provided to the PSRA in recent times, to assist with the reduction of the complaints arrears. I am advised by the PSRA that it is prioritising the finalisation of the older complaints cases.<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Concluded Cases</th><th>Being Assessed</th><th>Investigation Underway or Awaited</th><th>Draft Report in Circulation</th><th>Final Report Prepared</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>56</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>60</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>171</td><td>6</td><td>19</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>200</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>199</td><td>21</td><td>35</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>257</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>162</td><td>18</td><td>23</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>209</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>120</td><td>55</td><td>33</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>209</td></tr><tr><td>Total 2012-2016</td><td>708</td><td>102</td><td>111</td><td>6</td><td>8</td><td>935</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The review concluded that a revised district and station network commensurate with the organisation's resource base would best meet public demand.  On foot of the Programme, some 139 Garda stations were closed and some 32 districts were amalgamated to create 16 enlarged districts.</p>  <p>  As part of this process, in November 2013, the Gorey District was amalgamated with the Enniscorthy District resulting in an enlarged Enniscorthy District and I am informed that no station within the former Gorey District was closed.  I have been advised by the Garda authorities that the District Officer at Enniscorthy, in conjunction with the Inspector at Gorey, ensure that the policing arrangements within the Gorey area are effectively managed on an ongoing basis and there is no diminution in the policing service provided within the context of existing available resources in the Gorey area.</p>  <p>  Local Garda Management also continues to closely monitor the allocation of resources to ensure that optimum use is made of Garda resources and the best possible policing service continues to be provided to the public and this situation will be kept under review.</p>  <p>  The Programme for a Partnership Government recognises that community policing is the embodiment of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, providing a means of recognising that every community, both urban and rural, has its own concerns and expectations. It commits the Government to ensuring visible, effective and responsive policing in every community, including the most minimal response times possible. In support of this, the Policing Authority has been asked to oversee a review of, among other things, the dispersement of Garda stations in rural areas, and in developing urban and suburban areas, with a view to ensuring both an efficient and optimum geographical distribution of stations and minimal response times, including taking account of station closures since 2012.</p>  <p>  While I welcome the beneficial outcomes that have accrued to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na arising from the District and Station Rationalisation Programme, the Programme for Government recognises that there is a need for a review along the lines that I have outlined above.</p></reply>

I am assured by the Garda Commissioner that the allocation of Garda&iacute; is continually monitored and reviewed taking into account all relevant factors including crime trends, demographics, and security assessments relating to the area in question so as to ensure optimal use is made of Garda human resources.</p>  <p>  I have been informed by the Garda Commissioner that the Garda National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Technical Bureau and the Garda National Protective Services Bureau are part of Special Crime Operations.   As of 31 November 2016, the latest date for which figures are available, there were 45 members and 4 Civilians attached to the Garda National Bureau of Criminal Investigation; 72 members, 15 civilians and 3 photographers attached to the Garda National Technical Bureau; and 30 members and 7 Civilians attached to the Garda National Protective Services Bureau.</p>  <p>  In addition, I am informed that the Commissioner has recently held competitions to fill vacancies for members in Garda Special Crime Operations and the needs of the Garda National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Technical Bureau and the Garda National Protective Services Bureau will be considered when assigning successful candidates from these competitions.</p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve of approximately 300.</p>  <p>  Since the reopening of the Garda College, 679 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that another 900 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest in 2017 which will bring Garda numbers to around the 13,500 mark by year end.</p>  <p>  This focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources she needs to allow her to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across the organisation including the specialist units.</p>  <p>  This investment in personnel is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.  In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan. This investment will facilitate the provision of more effective policing services and I have no doubt that these new resources now coming on stream will benefit all areas of Garda activity including the Garda National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Technical Bureau and the Garda National Protective Services Bureau.</p></reply>

Of its nature, prudent management of budgets always requires careful and ongoing assessment throughout the year and the exact nature of the total adjustments to be made will only become clear over the course of the year but will, naturally, incorporate any underspends in areas such as administrative and legal expenses and any surplus receipts which are generated across the sector.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.  I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that in regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Garda Division.  It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his/her Division.</p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring visible, effective and responsive policing throughout the country in order to strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and prevent crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve of approximately 300. </p><p>Since the reopening of the Garda College, 679 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, including 62 to the Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR) West Division which includes the areas to which the Deputy refers.  I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that another 900 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest in 2017 which will bring Garda numbers to around the 13,500 mark by year end. </p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources she needs to allow her to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division, including the DMR West Division, in the coming years.</p><p>This investment in personnel is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.  In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan.  This investment will facilitate the provision of more effective policing services and I have no doubt that these new resources now coming on stream will see an increase in Garda visibility in our communities.</p><p>For the Deputy's information I have set out in the following table the number of Garda&iacute; stationed at Clondalkin, Lucan, Ronanstown and Rathcoole for each of the years from December 2012 to 30 November 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available from the Garda Commissioner.</p><p><b>Garda Strength 2012-2106 </b><table><tr><th>STATION</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th><th>2016*</th></tr><tr><td>CLONDALKIN</td><td>95</td><td>91</td><td>89</td><td>87</td><td>94</td></tr><tr><td>LUCAN</td><td>73</td><td>72</td><td>74</td><td>73</td><td>74</td></tr><tr><td>RONANSTOWN</td><td>93</td><td>91</td><td>91</td><td>94</td><td>91</td></tr><tr><td>RATHCOOLE</td><td>26</td><td>23</td><td>23</td><td>21</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>TOTAL</td><td>287</td><td>277</td><td>277</td><td>275</td><td>279</td></tr></table></p><p>*as of 30 November 2016</p></reply>

This Government remains committed to ratification of the Convention. </p><p>  It is essential that the State is in a position to meet the obligations it assumes under the terms of an international agreement from the moment of its entry into force for Ireland. Before the State can ratify the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, enactment of new legislation and amendment of existing legislation is required to ensure obligations will be met upon entry into force for Ireland.  Ratification of a Convention before we have amended domestic legislation that contradicts it makes no sense and does nothing to ensure compliance or to actually protect the people for whose benefit the Convention exists.  The previous Government published a Roadmap in October 2015, which sets out the legislative measures needed to meet those requirements, along with declarations and reservations to be entered by Ireland on ratification.</p><p>  Considerable progress has already been made to overcome the remaining legislative barriers to Ireland's ratification of the Convention.  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 was signed into law on 30 December 2015 and is a comprehensive reform of the law on decision-making capacity.  The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill 2015 completed Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il on 7 December 2016.  When enacted, the Bill will reform Section 5 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 to facilitate the full participation in family life of persons with intellectual disabilities and the full expression of their human rights.  Achieving the necessary balance between those rights and ensuring appropriate protection is crucial.</p><p>The Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016 was published immediately prior to Christmas.  The primary purpose of the Bill is to address the remaining legislative barriers to Ireland&rsquo;s ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD).  Work is ongoing on all the other issues set out in the previous Government&rsquo;s Roadmap for Ratification published in October 2015 and these will be progressed as Committee Stage amendments.  The Bill will be progressed to enactment at an early date to facilitate ratification of the UN Convention as soon as possible. </p><p>  The precise timing of ratification now depends on how long it takes for the Bill to progress through the enactment process and on issues in relation to commencement of the Deprivation of Liberty provisions, which will be included in the Committee Stage amendments, and of the the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act 2015.</p></reply>

I am assured by the Garda Commissioner that the allocation of Garda&iacute; is continually monitored and reviewed taking into account all relevant factors including crime trends, demographics, and security assessments relating to the area in question so as to ensure optimal use is made of Garda human resources.  It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his/her Division.</p>  <p>  I am informed that the number of Garda&iacute; assigned to the Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR) North Garda Division on the 30 November 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available was 671 of which 22 were assigned to the Divisional Drugs Unit.  It is important to note that all Garda&iacute; have a responsibility in the prevention and detection of criminal activity whether it be in the area of drug offences or otherwise.  The Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau leads out the policing strategy for tackling drugs supply.  This approach allows for the co-ordinated use of Garda resources in tackling all forms of organised crime, including illicit drug activity nationwide.  When appropriate, the work of the Division is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau, and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. </p>  <p>  At the request of the Garda Commissioner in 2016, the Government moved decisively to strengthen Garda resources to deal with gang-related crime in the Dublin area.  In particular funding was approved for the establishment of a dedicated Armed Support Unit for the DMR in order to enhance armed support capability in Dublin and to free up the resources of the ERU.  Following a selection and training process, the Armed Support Unit for the DMR is now fully operational and providing armed cover on a 24 hour basis.  All the necessary resources have been provided to equip the new ASU and I have also taken steps to upgrade the equipment available to the Emergency Response Unit and the Special Detective Unit. </p>  <p>  As part of the range of measures which have been put in place, a new Garda Special Crime Task Force has been in operation in the DMR since July 2016 and is focussing relentlessly on persons involved in gangland activities.  It operates in cooperation with other agencies including the Revenue Commissioners and Department of Social Protection and has the benefit of the expertise of members of the Criminal Assets Bureau, Garda Divisional Asset Profilers, and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Analysis Service. </p>  <p>  I am also informed that Operation Hybrid has been established to coordinate the response to violent crime in Dublin and address public concerns about community safety.  As of 9 January 2017, there have been 51 arrests and 5 charges brought in connection with the recent shootings and 3 charges brought for related offences. In addition, 26 firearms have been seized and over 11,000 lines of enquiry conducted.  In excess of 20,000 high visibility checkpoints have been implemented with significant support from Armed Support Units and a significant amount of CCTV footage, mobile phone traffic, and forensic evidence is also being examined.  I understand Operation Hybrid is reviewed on a weekly basis to maintain optimal impact.</p>  <p>  Underpinning all of these measures is the Government&rsquo;s commitment to ensuring visible, effective and responsive policing throughout the country in order to strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and prevent crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.

Consequently, it is crucial that the bona fides of the contractor in question is fully established at the point the rebate is made.</p>  <p>  As regards the level of interest on the part of contractors, I am advised by Revenue that in the period up to and including 20 January 2017, there have been 53 applications for registration.  Thirteen of these applications have been registered as 'qualifying contractors' and their details published on the Revenue website.  The remaining applications are being processed and any unsuccessful applicants have been advised about how to address any issues arising in their application.   </p>  <p>  I am further advised by Revenue that they have seen a steady increase in the number of applications.  There were nine applications received in 2016, and in the first three weeks of January the number of weekly applications have been 8, 14 and 22, respectively.  I believe that these statistics show that contractors do indeed believe that it is worth their while registering for the incentive.</p></reply>

On the basis that this does not include any government subventions or grants, the CSO have made the determination that Bus &Eacute;ireann is classified in the Non-Financial Corporations sector for the period under consideration.

However, the Exchequer tax revenue performance will continue to be monitored closely in the coming months, along with all other components of the Exchequer.  These performances will be reviewed as part of the next official fiscal forecasts, which will be set out in the Stability Programme Update (SPU) 2017, due to be published in April 2017.  </p>  <p>  The fiscal space is calculated in line with the trend potential growth rate of GDP less a convergence margin that applies as Ireland is not yet at its medium term budgetary objective (MTO) under the balanced budget rule.  It should be noted that changes in revenue levels are not relevant to the calculation of fiscal space unless it arises from a discretionary policy decision.  Additional revenue arising from discretionary measures increases the overall fiscal space while the converse in relation to revenue reductions also applies.

The actual GDP deflators, reference rates and convergence margins values used to assess compliance with the rules each year will be set by the European Commission using their estimates compiled in their Spring and Autumn forecasts.  The general government expenditure values used to evaluate adherence to the rules will be the final Central Statistics Office (CSO) estimates from the National Income and Expenditure (NIE) and Government Finance Statistics (GFS).  Revised projections of fiscal space for the medium-term will be published by my Department in the SPU and / or the Spring Economic Statement.</p></reply>

There is no special Capital Acquisitions Tax (CAT) provision for single child families and the same general rules apply for single or multiple child families.  Every child can avail of the Group A threshold, so, currently where there is only one child or many children, each child can be gifted and/or inherit up to &euro;310,000 from his or her parents in the course of his/her lifetime without incurring CAT.  As I stated in my reply to Parliamentary Question  41804/16, CAT is the overall title for both Gift and Inheritance Tax.  The tax is charged on the amount gifted to, or inherited by, the beneficiary of the gift or inheritance.</p><p>For the purposes of CAT, the relationship between the person who provides the gift or inheritance (i.e. the disponer) and the person who receives the gift or inheritance (i.e. the beneficiary), determines the life-time tax-free threshold known as the &quot;Group threshold&quot; below which gift or inheritance tax does not arise.  Where a person receives gifts or inheritances in excess of their relevant tax free threshold, CAT at a rate of 33% applies on the excess over the tax free threshold.</p><p>There are, in all, three separate Group thresholds based on the relationship of the beneficiary to the disponer.  Each of these was raised in the recent budget, Budget 2017.</p><p><b>Group A: tax free threshold &euro;310,000 (formerly &euro;280,000) </b>applies where the beneficiary is a child (including adopted child, stepchild and certain foster children) or minor child of a deceased child of the disponer.  Parents also fall within this threshold where they take an inheritance of an absolute interest from a child.</p><p><b>Group B: tax free threshold &euro;32,500 (formerly &euro;30,150) </b>applies where the beneficiary is a brother, sister, a nephew, a niece or lineal ancestor or lineal descendant of the disponer.</p><p><b>Group C: tax free threshold &euro;16,250 (formerly &euro;15,075) </b>applies in all other cases.</p><p>In 2015 the Group A CAT threshold, applying to transfers from parents to their children, was &euro;225,000.  I raised it to &euro;280,000 in Budget 2016 and further increased it to &euro;310,000 in budget 2017.  This represents an increase of about 38% in two years.  Options for future changes to CAT will be considered in the context of upcoming budget processes. </p></reply>

Government policy is focused on ensuring that all viable SMEs have access to an appropriate supply of credit from a diverse range of bank and non-bank sources.</p><p>The Deputy will also be aware that in my role as Minister for Finance I have no direct function in the relationship between the banks and their customers.  I have no statutory function in relation to the banking decisions made by individual lending institutions at any particular time and these are taken by the board and management of the relevant institution.  This includes decisions in relation to products as determined by the banks. </p><p>All viable businesses operating in Ireland should have the opportunity to access sufficient finance to meet their enterprise needs in a manner that supports growth and employment in the economy.  As the Deputy will be aware, Chapter 7 (Finance for Growth) of the Action Plan for Jobs 2016 (APJ) set out a range of commitments to ensure viable SME's can access appropriate finance at a reasonable cost from both bank and non-bank sources.  Finance for Growth will again feature in the Action Plan for Jobs 2017 and a number of actions have been proposed by my Department for inclusion in relation to this.</p><p>In line with Action 144 of the APJ 2016, officials from my Department collated and examined data from AIB and Bank of Ireland on a monthly basis, including data pertaining to the various sectors.  Furthermore, my officials meet the banks on a quarterly basis to ensure an informed understanding of the wider SME bank lending environment which assists the development and implementation of policies aimed at ensuring SME access to finance and increased competition in the SME lending sector.</p><p>It should be noted that the results of the most recent Department of Finance SME Credit Demand Survey, covering the period April to September 2016, show that when pending applications are excluded, 84% of credit applications to banks were approved or partially approved.  Demand for credit remains subdued and the latest survey shows only 39% of SMEs in the construction sector requested bank finance in the previous six months a decrease of 9% from September 2015.  Furthermore, the main reason for not applying for bank finance is that SMEs do not need it (86%).Only 1% of respondents stated the reason for not applying for bank finance was because it was too expensive to borrow.  Further results from the survey can be found at <i>www.finance.gov.ie.</i></p><p>The Government remains committed to the SME sector, as reflected in the Programme for a Partnership Government, and sees it as a key engine of ongoing economic growth.  Consequently, my Department and the Credit Review Office, working with the other relevant Departments and Agencies, will continue to monitor the availability of both bank and non-bank credit on both a macro and sectoral basis in order to ensure that sufficient access to finance is available to facilitate indigenous viable SMEs, including those in the construction sector, to reach their full potential in terms of growth and employment generation.</p><p>Separately, the Deputy may also wish to note that the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund ISIF) has been actively involved in a number of important initiatives which enhance the availability of finance to the construction sector in line with the terms of the Fund's mandate.  This includes its investments in:</p><p><b>- Activate Capital</b>- which is an innovative non-bank financing platform that has the potential to provide funding for substantial numbers of new homes in Dublin and the other major urban centres in which demand is most pronounced; </p><p><b>- Ardstone Residential Partnership</b>- which is a residential equity investment fund that is focused on delivering residential units to the market over the short-to medium-term; and </p><p><b>- Wilbur Ross Cardinal Commercial Real Estate Mezzanine Debt Fund</b>- which has funded a number of residential developments in recent months.</p></reply>

The SBCI does not lend directly to SMEs; rather it makes funding available to SMEs through both bank and specialist, non-bank finance providers, known as on-lenders.  At present, the SBCI has eight on-lending partners.</p>  <p>  SBCI Business loans are made available to farmers through its bank on-lenders under the Agricultural Investment Loan Scheme (AILS).  All loan applications are subject to the relevant on-lender's normal lending criteria and credit decisions are solely the responsibility of the individual on-lender and not the SBCI.

This Government has put the right infrastructure in place to encourage the inflow of financial services firms through its IFS 2020 Strategy and the the fact that all key economic indicators point to continued solid economic growth in Ireland should assist in this regard. </p>  <p>  At his recent appearance before the Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and Taoiseach, the Governor of the Central Bank said they were starting to see some signs of increased competition between banks and a strong desire from the banks to start to grow their loan books.

The Senior Medical Officer for the relevant local Health Service Executive administrative area makes a professional clinical determination as to whether an individual applicant satisfies the medical criteria.  A successful applicant is provided with a Primary Medical Certificate, which is required under the Regulations to claim the reliefs provided for in the Regulations.  An unsuccessful applicant can appeal the decision of the Senior Medical Officer to the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal, which makes a new clinical determination in respect of the individual.  The Regulations mandate that the Medical Board of Appeal is independent in the exercise of its functions to ensure the integrity of its clinical determinations.  After six months a citizen can reapply if there is a deterioration in their condition.</p>  <p>  To qualify for the Scheme an applicant must be in possession of a Primary Medical Certificate.  To qualify for a Primary Medical Certificate, an applicant must be permanently and severely disabled within the terms of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994 and satisfy one of the following conditions:</p>  <p>  -  be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs;</p>  <p>  -  be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs;</p>  <p>  -  be without both hands or without both arms;</p>  <p>  -  be without one or both legs;</p>  <p>  -  be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg;</p>  <p>  -  have the medical condition of dwarfism and have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs. </p>  <p>  The Scheme represents a significant tax expenditure. Between the Vehicle Registration Tax and VAT foregone, and the repayment of excise on fuel used by members of the Scheme, the Scheme represented a cost of &euro;50.3 million to the Exchequer in 2015, an increase from &euro;48.6 million in 2014.  These figures do not include the revenue foregone to the Local Government Fund in the respect of the relief from Motor Tax provided to members of the Scheme.  </p>  <p>  I recognise the important role that the Scheme plays in expanding the mobility of citizens with disabilities.  I have managed to maintain the relief at current levels throughout the crisis despite the requirement for significant fiscal consolidation.  From time to time I receive representations from individuals who feel they would benefit from the Scheme but do not qualify under the six criteria.  While I have sympathy for these cases, given the scope and scale of the Scheme, I have no plans to expand the medical criteria beyond the six currently provided for in the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994.</p></reply>

Employers in the higher education sector are also required to operate in accordance with the provisions of national industrial relations agreements.  My Department is not aware of any instance in which a third-level institution is not operating in accordance with good practice in relation to promotion and/or recruitment.</p>  <p>  My Department also understands that all third-level employers have adhered to the terms of the Haddington Road Agreement and are operating in accordance with the provisions of the Lansdowne Road Agreement.  In the event that a union believes that an employer in the higher education sector is not acting in accordance with the terms of the Lansdowne Road Agreement, that union can seek to have the matter addressed using the dispute resolution procedures provided for in the Agreement, and any individuals who have issues of dispute have a variety of dispute resolution options open to them.</p>  <p>  From enquiries made by officials of my Department through the HEA, I understand that TCD last updated its promotions procedures in December 2015 when its Board decided to discontinue annual promotion calls among professional (administrative, technical, library and support) staff and the university authorities are now examining a more formalised job evaluation process to be developed for introduction during the 2016/2017 academic year. This will then be considered by university management and union representatives. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, since the introduction of the moratorium on public sector recruitment, an Employment Control Framework (ECF) has been in place for the higher education sector which provides institutions with considerable flexibility to fill vacancies through recruitment or promotions on the basis of meeting an overall ceiling of posts. </p>  <p>  In Budget 2015, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform announced that the existing ECFs and associated moratoriums would be lifted and replaced with a system of delegated sanction for recruiting and promoting up to Principal Officer level, subject to adherence by Departments to binding pay ceilings and ongoing compliance with Workforce Planning requirements.  In light of this announcement it is hoped that a new Delegated Sanction Agreement for the higher education sector will be put in place shortly.</p></reply>

Progress in developing the network of Special Classes has been significant. </p><p>In 2011 there were 548 special classes, of which 224 were primary ASD classes, 72 were post primary ASD classes and 34 were early intervention classes.  The remaining 218 were special classes service children with mild to moderate/severe general learning difficulties and specific learning difficulties including speech and language difficulties. </p><p>There are currently 1,153 special classes, which is an increase of over 100% on the number available in 2011.  Of these, 127 are ASD early intervention classes, 525 are primary ASD classes and 237 are post-primary ASD classes.  The remainder are non ASD special classes.</p><p>The NCSE has advised that there are almost 18,000 students with ASD attending schools nationally.  Of these 3,484 are attending primary ASD classes and 1,118 are attending post primary ASD classes. </p><p>With regard to County Louth, the NCSE has advised that there are 323 students with ASD attending schools in the county.  Of these, 165 Students attend mainstream schools and are accessing in-school supports including Resource teaching and SNA support.  A further 99 students with ASD are attending 19 Special Classes for children with Autism of which 3 are Early Intervention ASD Classes, 12 are primary ASD classes and 4 are post primary ASD.  The remaining 59 students with ASD are placed in special schools.</p><p>The NCSE continues to review special class placement requirements nationally and have informed the Department that, in general, they are satisfied that there are sufficient ASD special class placements to meet existing demand.</p><p>The continued growth in post primary special class numbers is a natural consequence of the earlier growth in primary special class numbers.  However, it should not be assumed that the same levels of growth in post primary class numbers should apply.  This is because, for children with Autism, transferring from a special class in a primary school to a special class in a post primary school may not always be the optimal choice.  Many children can progress to mainstream post primary with support of SNA and Resource Teaching hours, while more may transfer from primary to a special school depending on their presentation and needs.</p><p>It should also be noted that there is a proportionally larger enrolment at Primary level due to the higher number of standard years.  Of the total enrolment in schools currently 68% of students are enrolled at Primary Level (which includes all Special Schools) and 32% are enrolled at Post Primary level.</p><p>The NCSE has published a guide for Boards of Management and Principals of Primary and Post Primary schools which contains information on setting up and organising special classes, including information on resources which may be provided to schools to establish special classes as requested by the Deputy.  The guide is available to download from www.ncse.ie at the following link: </p><p>Furthermore, it is general practice to include a Special Needs Unit in the accommodation brief for new school buildings, unless local circumstances indicate that it will not be required.  In addition, my Department may also provide capital funding to schools to establish special needs provision e.g. re-configure existing accommodation to provide a special class where this has been approved by the National Council for Special Education through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers.</p></reply>

It has established standards for post-qualification professional practice, as set out in Droichead, the new model of induction and probation for newly qualified primary and post-primary teachers.   The Droichead programme was the subject of a three-year pilot before it was approved by the Council in March 2016.  The programme is being introduced on a phased basis since last September.</p>  <p>  During the growth and development phase of Droichead, teachers employed in a special education or restricted setting must avail of the Droichead programme to achieve full registration with the Council.  While a new policy on teacher probation was adopted by the Teaching Council last December, this does not change the requirement for teachers in a special education setting to avail of Droichead.</p>  <p>  The INTO issued a directive to its members not to co-operate with or participate in Droichead from 1 July 2016.  This directive has prevented newly qualified teachers employed in special education settings from participating in Droichead since September and thereby closed off the registration pathway.  I hope the INTO will review its approach.  </p>  <p>  My Department is also considering the impact of the new policy adopted by the Council.</p></reply>

The guidelines &quot;Responding to Critical Incidents: Guidelines for Schools and resource Materials for Schools&quot; refer to preventive approaches that schools can adopt in creating a safe and supportive environment.  It also outlines how schools can plan for crises. </p><p>A Critical Incident is defined as an incident, or series of events, that overwhelms the normal coping mechanism of the school.  The kinds of critical incidents experienced by schools includes suicide or suspected suicide, death due to violence, accidental death including road traffic accidents and drowning, and death through illness.  The ultimate aim of the process is to return the school to normality.</p><p>The Guidelines focus upon alerting schools to planning processes, structures and actions which will better allow them to cope with a traumatic incidents such as suicide or suspected suicide, murder, accidental death including road traffic accidents and drowning, and death through illness of a member or members of the school community.  In relation to suicide advice is also given on prevention and positive mental health stratagems and approaches.</p><p>They offer a practical step by step guide to schools in how to respond effectively when a critical incident occurs in order to minimise the potential traumatic effect on the school community.  It includes templates, advice and information on how to set up a Critical Incident Management Team and develop a Critical Incident Management Plan.</p><p>The Guidelines have recently been updated and sent out to schools with new or revised information and advice have been included in the Guidelines, including: </p><p>-  Revised section on Suicide/suspected suicide including information on suicide prevention and what schools need to do; information on preventing suicide contagion; how to compassionately deal with a suicidal student returning to school after an attempt</p><p>-  Information on suicide risk and guidance where student expresses suicide ideation</p><p>-  Teachers helping students in time of crisis listen, protect, connect, model and teach</p><p>-  Guidance on social media use</p><p>-  Useful Websites and Helplines for Accessing Resources</p><p>-  Some additional information, including a comprehensive FAQ guide </p><p>During a critical incident NEPS psychologists will also, at the specific invitation of school authorities, attend at the schools following such incidents to offer direct advice and assistance to school staff and pupils.  All such requests are responded to, most usually by the psychologist normally assigned to the affected school but also in some cases, depending on the particular context, by a colleague within the NEPS region and more rarely by colleagues from another NEPS region.  The attached sheet gives detail of the number of such requests that were made from 2011/12 to 2015/16.</p><p>The critical incident process in schools does not by its nature result from dedicated funding to schools but derives from informing practice of existing staffing in schools and from general non-pay resourcing made available to schools.  Direct costs within my Department relate to the development and production of the guidelines and their distribution to schools, general NEPS psychologist time in assisting/advising schools on their implementation and direct NEPS staff time in assisting schools during critical incidents.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p><p><b>Critical Incidents</b><table><tr><th>Academic Year</th><th>Number of Incidents in which NEPS Staff involvement was requested by school </th></tr><tr><td>2008/09</td><td>97</td></tr><tr><td>2009/10</td><td>93</td></tr><tr><td>2010/11</td><td>110</td></tr><tr><td>2011/12</td><td>110</td></tr><tr><td>2012/13</td><td>152</td></tr><tr><td>2013/14</td><td>127</td></tr><tr><td>2014/15</td><td>105</td></tr><tr><td>2015/16</td><td>105</td></tr><tr><td>2016/17</td><td>(*)</td></tr></table>(*) Data not yet available</p></reply>

However, in schools where there are more applicants than places available a selection process may be necessary.  This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.</p><p>The Education (Admission to Schools) Bill was published on 6 July 2016 and passed second stage on 17 November 2016.  The introduction of this Bill reflects the Programme for Government commitment to publish new School Admissions legislation taking account of current draft proposals and addressing issues including publication of school enrolment policies, an end to waiting lists, introduction of annual enrolment structures, and transparency and fairness in admissions for pupils and their parents.</p><p>In relation to the provision of additional school accommodation and of new schools, my Department uses a Geographical Information System (GIS) to identify where the pressure for school places across the country will arise.  In order to plan for school provision and analyse the relevant demographic data, my Department divides the country into 314 school planning areas.  The GIS uses data from a range of sources, including the Central Statistics Office, Ordnance Survey Ireland, the Department of Social Protection and my Department's own databases.  With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic analyses at primary and post-primary level to determine where additional school accommodation, including new school provision, is required.</p><p>In this regard, following completion of such demographic analysis, three new primary schools and eight new post-primary schools opened in September 2016 to cater for areas under increased demographic pressure.  Four new primary schools and nine new post-primary schools will also open in 2017 and 2018 to provide additional capacity in areas under demographic pressure.</p><p>It is open to any school to submit an application to my Department if they have identified a deficit of classroom accommodation to meet increasing enrolments or to accommodate an additional teacher appointment.  Application forms can be accessed on my Department's website . </p></reply>

The Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST) continues to support the SPHE and PE curricula and, through the wider lens of this curriculum support, promotes healthy eating policies. </p>  <p>  Many post-primary schools have a number of food outlets, including school shops and vending machines.  Some schools also offer school lunches.  In addition, some schools offer breakfast and after-school clubs and pre-packed lunches, making the school a key food provider for many students.  </p>  <p>  While educating on healthy eating is not just the responsibility of schools but also of wider society, schools are well placed to support students to develop an understanding of the nutrient value of common and easily accessible products, as well the skills to make informed decisions about their nutrient intake.  </p>  <p>  Boards of Management and Principals are being encouraged, however, to ensure that those supplying food and beverage products to their schools are aware of this guidance, especially when contracts are being agreed or renewed. </p>  <p>  Home Economics Education provides students with opportunities to develop an understanding of the relationship between food, diet and health.  The home economics syllabuses at both Junior Certificate and Leaving Certificate levels focus on developing students&rsquo; food, health and culinary skills.  Students study topics such as the nutritional requirements of different groups of the population, the role of diet in relation to health, how to read food labels and to make informed food choices.  Students also apply this knowledge as they develop their culinary skills in practical lessons.  Therefore, students of Home Economics are enabled to become food literate and act as discerning consumers when faced with a choice and selection of foods for purchase.  </p>  <p>  In addition, students of Home Economics are often a significant positive voice in their own schools when staff are developing and implementing a healthy eating policy.</p></reply>

The Report of the Expert Group on the Future Funding for Higher Education, which was established by previous Minister O'Sullivan, sets out a number of funding options for the sector with income contingent loans being just one of those options.  Other options include a predominantly State-funded system or a State-funded system supplemented with continuing student fees. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware the Report is currently with the Joint Oireachtas Committee for consideration where each of the funding models will be examined and the process will include input from all stakeholders.  I understand the Union of Students in Ireland are one of the groups who have made a submission.</p>  <p>  It will be important to obtain political and societal consensus on achieving a sustainable funding model for the higher education sector in the future and my Department and I continue to work with the Committee as it undertakes this important job.  However, it is important to recognise, as the Cassells Report has done, that doing nothing is not an option and that other measures to improve equality of access would also be necessary. </p>  <p>  Funding overall for the higher education sector is a key concern for me, particularly in light of the additional pressure that will fall on the system over the next decade or so.  That is why I am pleased, that I have for the first time in nine years secured additional funding for the sector with &euro;36.5m additional being made available this year and &euro;160m additional overall over the next three years.  This includes an increase in the funding available to students from disadvantaged backgrounds and other under-represented groups to assist them in overcoming financial barriers to accessing and completing higher education.</p>  <p>  In addition, in Budget 2017 the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and I, announced a policy review with the aim of designing and implementing a sustainable and predictable multi-annual funding model for higher and further education and training involving increased Employer and Exchequer contributions from 2018.  The review will be undertaken as part of the overall response to meeting the anticipated skills needs in the economy over the coming years, in line with the policy framework set out in the National Skills Strategy.</p>  <p>  It will include an analysis of the business case for enhanced investment in the higher and further education and training sectors and of the most effective funding mechanisms to deliver outcomes in respect of our ambitions in this area.  In this context it will identify key elements of the new funding model and of the expected impacts including those on employers.  The review will include consultation with stakeholders.  It is expected that the policy review will be published by the end of April 2017, and will complement the ongoing work by the Oireachtas Committee in relation to the Cassells report.</p></reply>

Recruitment to apprenticeship is therefore driven by employers rather than by SOLAS or by education and training providers.  The 2014 Review of Apprenticeship in Ireland acknowledged that the number of women employed in craft apprenticeships is low as they operate in sectors that have traditionally low levels of female employment. SOLAS offers a bursary to employers to encourage them to employ female apprentices in these areas.  Despite this the number of female apprentices remains low.</p>  <p>  Currently the Apprenticeship Council is overseeing the expansion of the apprenticeship system into a range of new areas, following a call for proposals from employers and education and training providers.  In recent months, we have seen the first of these new apprenticeships with the new Insurance Practitioner Apprenticeship launching in September 2016 and the Industrial Electrical Engineer Apprenticeship commencing in November 2016.  Further new apprenticeships will get underway in 2017, many of which are in sectors where there is a different gender balance in the workplace and I am confident that this will lead to a strong increase in female participation when these new apprenticeships are launched. </p>  <p>  As set out in the National Skills Strategy 2025, my Department will, in conjunction with SOLAS, review female participation in apprenticeship in 2018 in light of the broadening of the apprenticeship system into new areas and will set appropriate targets thereafter.</p>  <p>  Accompanying the renewal and expansion of apprenticeship in Ireland will be a new branding and marketing campaign.  SOLAS will examine how this campaign can assist with promoting apprenticeship to women and to their potential employers.</p></reply>

The central vision of the Plan is that the Irish Education and Training System should become the best in Europe over the next decade.  The Plan&rsquo;s high-level goals are based on the five policy areas which I believe will help us to achieve this ambition.  The goals are: </p>  <p>  1. Improve the learning experience and the success of learners</p>  <p>  2. Improve the progress of learners at risk of educational disadvantage or learners with special educational needs</p>  <p>  3. Help those delivering education services to continuously improve</p>  <p>  4. Build stronger bridges between education and wider community</p>  <p>  5. Improve national planning and support services </p>  <p>  The basic aim of this Government is to sustain our economic progress and use it to build a fair and compassionate society.  Education is the best means of delivering a fairer society, breaking down cycles of disadvantage and ensuring that all our people, in particular those with special educational needs, are able to participate in that progress and fulfil their potential.  Excellent and innovative education and training are the pivot around which personal fulfilment, a fair society and a successful nation should revolve.  It is central to sustaining economic success and in converting economic success into building a strong community.  Having the best education and training service in Europe will allow us to provide better opportunities for more people from disadvantaged groups, as well as ensuring that we create more sustainable well-paying jobs.</p>  <p>  Our approach to special education has undergone a huge transformation with a growing proportion of children with special educational needs being educated with their peers in mainstream schools.  The participation and progress of learners with special educational needs across the whole education system remains a key focus with an emphasis on improving whole-school and whole system approaches.  The Action Plan 2017 sets out a range of measures which will be undertaken during this year.  These include allocating teachers to schools under the new allocation model to support children with special educational needs, publishing the outcomes of a comprehensive review of the S scheme, and consult with partners on the implementation of sections of the EPSEN Act and on the provision of services to children with Down Syndrome. </p>  <p>  Quality of provision is the cornerstone to the success of the education and training system.  We recognise the fundamental roles that leaders, teachers and support staff play and we want to strengthen the system&rsquo;s capacity to continuously improve and to deliver the highest quality education and training services for learners.  The Action Plan 2017 details actions which will ensure that leadership, management, quality frameworks, teaching methods, and initial and continuing training are all operating to the highest standards across the continuum of education and training provision.  These actions include expanding the range of supports available through the Centre for School Leadership, providing dedicated professional support to teachers to support the implementation of curricular and policy change, and developing and introducing a new postgraduate qualification for aspiring school leaders.</p>  <p>  To become an innovation leader and to build a strong talent base, we as a nation must effectively engage with enterprise.  We must work to address identified skills needs in critical areas, and recognise the shifting global economic and political climate in which services are delivered and jobs are created.  Successful enterprise engagement is the foundation of much of the planned activity detailed in the Action Plan 2017.  This includes driving the growth of traineeships and apprenticeships, ensuring the relevance of work placements and work-based projects, and increasing the diversity of opportunity in learning beyond school.  </p>  <p>  In order to ensure that progress is made in all of these areas, including helping children with special needs, supporting schools and building a stronger bridge between education and the workplace, updated annual Action Plans will be published each year, detailing the actions that will be implemented during that year. As part of this process, actions will be monitored against published timelines and progress reports will be published on a quarterly basis.</p></reply>

Indeed international research indicates that school leadership is second only to classroom teaching as an influence on pupil learning. </p>  <p>  Budget 2016 provided 250 posts to second level schools to enable Deputy Principals to be more fully available to assist the school principal with the leadership of the school.  At primary level Budget 2016 provided for additional release days for teaching principals to range between 15 and 25 days depending on the size of the school. </p>  <p>  Budget 2017 has provided for the equivalent of 170 additional posts to second level schools to employ an additional Deputy Principal to assist the school principal with the leadership of the school.  With effect from September 2017, schools with pupil enrolment in excess of 700 will be allocated additional Deputy Principal posts.</p>  <p>  Budget 2017 also provides for the commencement of the restoration of middle management posts in both the primary and post-primary sector. </p>  <p>  The recently established Centre for School Leadership (CSL) is a collaboration between my Department and the representative professional bodies for school principals.  It has been created to offer professional and practical support to schools leaders.  This support structure for leadership teams in schools will attempt to ensure that school leaders have opportunities to access, share and create knowledge and experience within their leadership roles.  The work of the Centre draws on best international practice and research in the professional development of school leaders.  Priorities for the Centre include a new post graduate qualification for aspiring school leaders, a mentoring programme for newly appointed school principals, coaching support for serving principals, a review and alignment of leadership programmes with Department standards. </p>  <p>  Last year my Department published &ldquo;Looking at Our School 2016", a quality framework for primary and post primary schools which is designed to support the efforts of teachers and school leaders, as well as the school system more generally, to strive for excellence in our schools. </p>  <p>  The current review of the post of responsibility structure in schools will, in the context of restoration of posts, address the further development of a distributed leadership model.</p></reply>

In addition, it would be expected that parental complaints in relation to teacher conduct or underperformance may also be dealt with under Section 24 procedures by the school, as employer.</p></reply>

The grant scheme is complemented by the Student Assistance Fund and the Fund for Students with Disabilities, as well as a programme of scholarships and bursaries. </p>  <p>  The Report of the Expert Group on Future Funding for Higher Education, published in July 2016, clearly outlines the funding challenges facing the higher education sector.  The report also makes a number of recommendations for consideration for the future.  As committed to in the Programme for Government, I have referred the report of the expert group to the relevant Oireachtas Committee for its consideration, in order to build political consensus on the most appropriate future funding model for the higher education sector.</p>  <p>  While the Cassells report deals with the medium and long term funding needs of higher education we also have to consider the immediate challenges.  In that context, I am pleased to have secured additional funding for the sector, in Budget 2017, for the first time in nine years.  An additional &euro;36.5m has been made available in 2017 as part of a &euro;160m three year funding package.  This will allow the sector keep pace with demographic increases and introduce targeted initiatives in areas such as disadvantage, skills, research and flexible learning.  Among those who will benefit from the additional third level funding being made available are students from disadvantaged backgrounds, lone parents, and Travellers.</p>  <p>  In addition, in Budget 2017, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and I announced a policy review with the aim of designing and implementing a sustainable and predictable multi-annual funding model for higher and further education and training involving increased employer and Exchequer contributions from 2018.  The review will be undertaken as part of the overall response to meeting the anticipated skills needs in the economy over the coming years in line with the policy framework set out in the national skills strategy.  It will include an analysis of the business case for enhanced investment in the higher and further education and training sectors and of the most effective funding mechanisms to deliver outcomes in respect of our ambitions in this area.  In this context, it will identify key elements of the new funding model and of the expected impacts, including those on employers.  It will also include consultation with stakeholders. It is expected that the review will be published by the end of April 2017 and will complement the ongoing work by the Oireachtas Committee in regard to the Cassells report.</p></reply>

These included pay reductions and also reductions to the pay of new entrant public servants, including teachers, since 2011.  Collective agreements reached between the Government and the public service unions provided vital industrial peace during this very difficult period for the State.</p>  <p>  The Haddington Road/Lansdowne Road Agreement has allowed a programme of restoration to start.  I have used this to negotiate substantial improvements in pay for new teachers.  The agreement reached with TUI and INTO will see pay rises of between 15-22% (between &euro;4600 and &euro;6700) for new entrant teachers. </p>  <p>  In education, there is a well-established increment system.  Teachers are not paid equally.  For example, the pay scale for teachers appointed prior to 2011 ranges from &euro;32,009 to &euro;60,155 depending on the date that the individual began teaching.  Part of the negotiation to date has secured a convergence of the scales of recruits at different periods.  Any further negotiation on new entrant pay cannot focus on just one sector.  A broader assessment of pay and new entrant pay will be informed by the analysis of the Public Service Pay Commission.</p>  <p>  ASTI members are currently balloting on a set of proposals published by the Teachers Conciliation Council in November.

I have stated that I believe that it is unfair that preference is given by publicly-funded religious schools to children of their own religion who might live some distance away, ahead of children of a different religion or of no religion who live close to the school.  In that respect I agree with the aims of the Labour Party&rsquo;s Bill.  I have also stated that I believe that it is unfair that parents, who might otherwise not do so, feel pressure to baptise their children in order to gain admission to the local school and I intend to reform the school admissions system in relation to the role that religion can play in that process.</p>  <p>  I have set out four possible approaches for dealing with the issue, in primary schools in the first instance, including:</p>  <p>  -  A catchment area approach, prohibiting religious schools from giving preference to children of their own religion who live outside the catchment area ahead of non-religious children who live inside the catchment</p>  <p>  -  A &lsquo;nearest school rule&rsquo;, allowing religious schools to give preference to a religious child only where it is that child&rsquo;s nearest school of that particular religion</p>  <p>  -  A quota system, which would allow a religious school give preference to children of its own religion in respect of only a certain proportion of places, meaning that the remaining places would be allocated based on other admissions criteria &ndash; proximity to the school, lottery etc.</p>  <p>  -  An outright prohibition on religious schools using religion as a factor in admissions, meaning that all places would be allocated based on other factors.  Within this approach, there is capacity to allow religious schools to require parents or students to indicate some support or respect for the ethos of the school.</p>  <p>  I am also mindful of the need to avoid possible pitfalls and unintended consequences with each of these approaches, including most importantly possible impacts on minority religions and on the wishes of Protestant, Jewish, Islamic and other communities to be able to run schools in accordance with their ethos and admit children from their communities to attend those schools.</p>  <p>  Other possible consequences to be avoided include possible breaches of the constitution, technical and administrative difficulties impacting on the capacity to effectively run the system of over 4000 schools and the possibility of creating &lsquo;postcode lotteries&rsquo;, such as other countries have experienced, resulting in pronounced divergence in the quality of schools in more advantaged compared to less advantaged areas. </p>  <p>  I will be commencing a short process of consultation on this issue and I am interested in hearing the views of the groups who stand to be impacted by changes as well as any members of the public with views on the issue. After that I will progress to develop and implement measures to deal with this issue.</p></reply>

The agreement reached with TUI and INTO will see pay rises of between 15-22% (between &euro;4600 and &euro;6700) for new entrant teachers.  </p><p>Also, the Government recently moved to address an anomaly issue arising in the context of the recent Labour Court Recommendations in respect of the Garda Associations through an increase in annualised salaries of &euro;1,000 for the period 1 April 2017 to August 2017 inclusive for public servants on annualised salaries up to &euro;65,000 who are parties to the Lansdowne Road Agreement and who do not stand to benefit from those Labour Court Recommendations.</p><p>Following discussions, the Teachers Conciliation Council published a set of proposals in November for consideration by ASTI members aimed at finding a resolution to their dispute.

The teachers involved are benefiting from extensive continuing professional development and are availing of professional time to support implementation.  In June 2017, English will be the first subject to be taken by students as part of the reformed Junior Cycle assessment arrangements.  Business Studies and Science will be examined under the new arrangements in June 2019. </p>  <p>  Phase 3 of the Framework will begin implementation in September 2017, with the introduction of new subject specifications in Irish, Visual Arts and Modern Languages, covering French, German, Spanish and Italian.  The new curriculum area of Wellbeing will also be introduced at that time.</p>  <p>  Phase 4 will begin implementation in September 2018 with the introduction of Mathematics, Home Economics, History, Music and Geography, with the final phase 5 being implemented from September 2019.  Phase 5 subjects will include Technology subjects, Religious Education, Jewish Studies and Classics.</p>  <p>  Teachers of English who are members of ASTI have been directed by their union that, while they are to teach the new Junior Cycle subject specification, they are not to undertake Classroom Based Assessments (CBAs) with their students.  CBAs form a key element of the new Junior Cycle.  Therefore, students who are taught by a teacher who is a member of the ASTI will not receive a grade for their CBAs and also since the written Assessment Task which is to be completed by students is linked to the second CBA, which is worth 10% of the marks for the final examination, these students cannot complete the Assessment Task, or gain marks for this examination component.  Candidates for Junior Cycle English in 2017 who do not complete the assessment task can only be marked and graded based on a maximum of 90% of the available marks.</p>  <p>  My Department requested the ASTI to provide an immediate derogation from their directive regarding the CBAs for current teachers of English in order that some current third year English students are no longer unfairly and unjustifiably disadvantaged. </p>  <p>  Following talks with the teacher unions in late 2016, facilitated by the Chair of the Teachers Conciliation Council, it has been provided that, on a once-off basis, the NCCA and SEC will communicate arrangements in respect of a second calendar window in the 2016/17 school year to allow for the completion and submission of the Junior Cycle English Assessment Task by students who are prevented from meeting the current deadline.  This was notified to schools in the week beginning 19th December 2016.</p>  <p>  This was agreed as a result of an acknowledgement by the parties that a significant number of students were not in a position to meet the timing requirement of completion between 5th and 9th December 2016, as a result of industrial action taken by the ASTI. </p>  <p>  The Department welcomes the decision of the ASTI to give its members a say on the overall offer now available following the recently concluded talks under the Chair of the Teachers Conciliation Council.  While the ASTI&rsquo;s Central Executive Committee has recommended rejection, a decision on whether to accept or reject will now be taken by the wider membership at ballot.  The ASTI has indicated that it will conduct its ballot of members this month. </p></reply>

The Plan contains a range of actions to be implemented with particular focus on disadvantage, skills needs, and continuous improvement within the education service.</p>  <p>  A key objective of this Plan is to address the identified skills needs across key priority sectors of the economy identified by the SLMRU.  These sectors include Financial Services, Manufacturing and ICT, Biopharma, Medtech and others.  </p>  <p>  Launched in 2016 the National Skills Strategy has over 120 Actions involving over 50 stakeholders, the purpose of the National Skills Strategy 2025 is to provide a framework for skills development that will help drive Ireland&rsquo;s growth both economically and societally over the next decade.  Included in the actions in the Strategy is the creation of a new National Skills Council.  The Council, when established shortly, will oversee research and advise on prioritisation and delivery of identified skills needs.  Skills information from the EGFSN, the SLMRU and the recently established Regional Skills Fora will feed into the work of the Council.</p>  <p>  Within the Further Education and Training (FET) sector, significant improvements have been made in the planning and funding of provision since the publication of the FET Strategy in 2014.   Education and Training Boards engage in a service planning process annually against a range of detailed parameters set by SOLAS.  This process has been refined and improved each year and includes the use of strengthened labour market data provided by the SLMRU to ensure that the skill needs of learners and enterprise are met.</p></reply>

A cross-departmental group is now finalising an Action Plan for School Age Childcare which has been considered by me and my colleague, Minister Zappone, T.D.   </p>  <p>  In general, school authorities have a considerable degree of autonomy in relation to how their premises are managed and utilised at local level.  The use of school facilities must be approved by the school authority.  In 2005, my Department issued a circular to Trustees, Boards of Management and Principals of Primary and Voluntary Secondary Schools (Circular Letter Prim 16/05) to encourage Trustees and Boards of Management to make their facilities available where possible for community, education and recreation purposes.  This circular recognises that the decision ultimately lies with the relevant Board or Trustees and that the first priority at all times should be the interest of the school, its teachers and pupils.</p>  <p>  In facilitating such extra provision there are a number of complex issues that need to be considered in respect of such arrangements.  I engaged with education partners specifically in relation to this matter in a very positive roundtable discussion in the Summer.  These issues - including property, governance, insurance and liability - are being considered as part of a review within my Department of the requirements to be established around the use of school premises/property for pre-school and after school services and the preparation of guidelines in consultation with patrons/trustees in relation to same.  </p>  <p>  While there is no provision in this year&rsquo;s budget for additional capital investment specifically in relation to pre-school and afterschool services, capital funding in excess of &euro;400m will be expended on the delivery of school accommodation projects (large scale projects and the Additional Accommodation Scheme) in 2017.</p></reply>

The number of schools to receive supports under a new School Support Programme will be determined by this new identification process, which will assess all schools in the country.

The central vision of the Plan is that the Irish Education and Training System should become the best in Europe over the next decade.  This will contribute to delivering a &ldquo;Step-Change&rdquo; in the development of critical skills, knowledge and competences and providing the foundations for participation in work and society. </p>  <p>  There are important developments in relation to coding across the primary and post-primary sector.  The Action Plan for Education includes a commitment to develop a new subject specification for Leaving Certificate Computer Science which will help to harness and develop student interest in this strategically important discipline.</p>  <p>  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) has, in this regard, recently commenced the curriculum development process, with a view to the subject being introduced to schools from September 2019, following a period of professional development for teachers of the subject.</p>  <p>  The formulation of curriculum and assessment arrangements is a complex and intensive process. It can involve research, analysis, action-research or piloting in schools and extensive consultation with stakeholders including students, parents, teacher unions and others.  This is then followed by a period of professional development for teachers. I am exploring whether the projected timescale for Leaving Certificate Computer Science can be adjusted so that implementation in schools can commence sooner.</p>  <p>  At Junior Cycle level a short course on Coding developed by the NCCA is available to schools on an optional basis.  The course looks to build on the coding skills that primary students may have experienced while offering insight into possible future studies in computer science and software engineering.</p>  <p>  At primary level, the NCCA, at my request, is considering coding as part of a wider review of the curriculum, including the introduction of computational thinking and flexible and creative thinking skills into the Mathematics curriculum.  A new Primary School curriculum for Junior Infants to second class is planned for implementation from September 2018. As part of this I am exploring the introduction of an initiative in the area of Coding at Primary Level.</p>  <p>  There is also a Transition Year module relating to 'Having Fun with Computer Programming and Games'.</p>  <p>  In addition to these initiatives, a large number of schools are running voluntary coding programmes through initiatives such as Coder Dojo, which I believe we should learn from to improve the outcomes of the education system for our children.</p>  <p>  The roll-out of the new Leaving Certificate subject of Politics and Society commenced in 41 schools from September 2016, following an open invitation to introduce this as an optional Leaving Certificate subject. Politics and Society aims to develop the student's ability to be a reflective and active citizen, in a way that is informed by the insights and skills of social and political science.  The introduction of the specification is part of my Department's commemoration of 1916 and its commitment to education for sustainable development.  The subject will be available to all schools from 2018. </p>  <p>  Physical Education is being developed by the NCCA as a full subject that can be assessed for the Leaving Certificate in a manner similar to other subjects.  A specification for Leaving Certificate Physical Education was finalised by the NCCA in late 2016. In addition, a Senior Cycle Physical Education Framework specification has recently been completed by the NCCA.  The Framework will assist schools to design a P.E. programme for those students who may not choose to take P.E. as part of their Leaving Certificate examination.  These developments are in keeping with the strong emphasis from my Department on promoting and encouraging Healthy Lifestyles for all students and commitments in the Programme for Partnership Government. </p>  <p>  The Action Plan for Education also includes commitments to finalise and implement additional subject specifications at Leaving Certificate level as resources permit. </p></reply>

The ratio of 27:1 is an overall classroom teacher allocation ratio for the school and is not a reference to class size.  The configuration of classes and the deployment of classroom teachers are done at local school level.  Depending on the circumstances of the school, e.g. fluctuating enrolment, accommodation available, there may be a variation in the size of the classes in the school.  School authorities are requested to ensure that the number of pupils in any one class is kept as low as possible, taking into account all of the above factors.  The Department requests school authorities to use their autonomy under the staffing schedule to implement smaller class sizes for junior classes.</p>  <p>  Each 1 point adjustment to the staffing schedule is estimated to cost in the region of &euro;15m - &euro;18m per annum.</p>  <p>  Budget 2017 sets out the resources available for schools for the 2017/18 school year.  This Budget represents the start of a major reinvestment in education, and the first phase of implementation of the Action Plan for Education, aimed at becoming the best education system in Europe within a decade.  </p>  <p>  The budget provides for over 2,400 additional teaching posts for our primary and post-primary schools in the next school year.  This includes additional teaching posts to meet demographic need, curriculum reform, additional resource teaching posts and the strengthening of school leadership.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government has a commitment to reduce class sizes at primary level and it is my intention to make further improvements to class sizes over the life of the Government. </p></reply>

The Programme for a Partnership Government reflects the Government&rsquo;s objective of strengthening parental choice and further expanding diversity in our school system.

These included pay reductions and also reductions to the pay of new entrant public servants, including teachers, since 2011.  Collective agreements reached between the Government and the public service unions provided vital industrial peace during this very difficult period for the State.</p>  <p>  The Lansdowne Road Agreement has allowed a programme of restoration to start.  I have used this to negotiate substantial improvements in pay for new teachers.  The agreement reached with TUI and INTO will see pay rises of between 15-22% (between &euro;4600 and &euro;6700) for new entrant teachers. </p>  <p>  I accept that ASTI members have outstanding pay demands and that this deal does not travel the full distance that they set out to achieve.  However, it does represent significant progress, and the door is not closed to the trade union movement seeking to advance the issue further in the context of future public service pay talks.</p>  <p>  In education, there is a well-established increment system.  Teachers are not paid equally.  For example, the pay scale for teachers appointed prior to 2011 ranges from &euro;32,009 to &euro;60,155 depending on the date that the individual began teaching.  Part of the negotiation to date has secured a convergence of the scales of recruits at different periods.  Any further negotiation on new entrant pay cannot focus on just one sector.  A broader assessment of pay and new entrant pay will be informed by the analysis of the Public Service Pay Commission.</p>  <p>  Following discussions, the Teachers Conciliation Council published a set of proposals in November for consideration by ASTI members aimed at finding a resolution to their dispute.  The ASTI Central Executive Committee took a decision to put the outcome of the talks process to a ballot of members with a recommendation to reject.  This ballot is now underway.  The ASTI&rsquo;s leadership have taken a view on the proposals.  It is now over to the members to form their view. </p>  <p>  The proposals provide ASTI members with an opportunity to benefit from the programme of pay restoration I mentioned above, including the agreement reached with TUI and INTO, which will see pay rises of between 15-22% (between &euro;4600 and &euro;6700) for new entrant teachers. </p>  <p>  In addition, there are other immediate undoubted benefits for individual ASTI members in accepting the proposals including:</p>  <p>  -  Avoiding an increment freeze </p>  <p>  -  Inclusion of the S&amp;S allowance of &euro;1,592 into the pay scale</p>  <p>  -  Continued alleviation of the FEMPI Act pay reductions</p>  <p>  -  The Ward Report measures and a revised sequence for filling posts which enable fixed-term and part-time teachers to gain permanent, full-time jobs more easily and quickly than before</p>  <p>  -  An increase in the quantum of the Croke Park hours that can be worked on other than a whole-school basis</p>  <p>  -  A review of the usage of the Croke Park hours</p>  <p>  -  Protection against compulsory redundancy</p>  <p>  Also, the Government recently moved to address an anomaly issue arising in the context of the recent Labour Court Recommendations in respect of the Garda Associations through an increase in annualised salaries of &euro;1,000 for the period 1 April 2017 to August 2017 inclusive for public servants on annualised salaries up to &euro;65,000 who are parties to the Lansdowne Road Agreement and who do not stand to benefit from those Labour Court Recommendations.</p>  <p>  ASTI members will have to weigh these benefits up for themselves.  These benefits are only available to ASTI members if they vote to accept.  ASTI&rsquo;s membership now have a decision to make as to whether to accept the TCC proposals and the immediate benefits on offer or to engage again in industrial action. It is for the ASTI leadership to explain its strategy in respect of the latter approach. </p>  <p>  ASTI&rsquo;s ballot will take place shortly. While that process is ongoing it would not be helpful for me to comment further.</p></reply>

The new model will allocate teachers to schools on the basis of the profiled educational needs of each school.  This will end the unfairness which exists in the current system, whereby many parents are unable to access the assessments needed to qualify for educational resources.  This had a particularly negative impact on children from more disadvantaged areas. </p>  <p>  In order to build upon the very significant development of supports for children with Special Educational Needs, additional provisions were made in Budget 2017.  &euro;18m was provided to fund an additional 900 teaching posts to support the introduction of this new allocation model.  This substantial additional provision will ensure that:</p>  <p>  -  Up to 1,000 schools will receive additional allocations, where the new model indicates additional need.</p>  <p>  -  No school will receive an allocation of resources less than the allocation they received in the 2016/17 school year. </p>  <p>  Also, a further &euro;3.8m was provided to fund an additional 115 Ss in 2017 to meet expected demands for such supports.   </p>  <p>  There are over 1,150 Special Classes in place in comparison to 548 in 2011, with approximately 150 new classes having been made available for the current school year, 2016/17.  125 special schools also provide specialist education for those pupils who need it, from infants to eighteen years of age. </p>  <p>  In recent years, the NCSE has provided my Department with a number of policy advice papers on the provision of supports for children with special needs, all of which are available on the NCSE&rsquo;s website.</p>  <p>  At my request, the NCSE are currently undertaking a comprehensive assessment of the Special Needs Assistant Scheme and I have specifically asked the NCSE to identify the most appropriate form of support options to provide better outcomes for students with Special Educational Needs, having regard to the significant amount of State investment in this area.</p>  <p>  It is intended to bring into effect many improvements to the provision of special educational needs support, through policy developments across a range of areas, in conjunction with NCSE policy advice.</p>  <p>  As committed to in the Programme for a Partnership Government, I plan to examine the adequacy of the present policies and provision, and their scope for improvement.  In doing so, I will take into account the recommendations contained in the NCSE policy advice papers.  The Programme commits that we will invest additional resources in the National Educational Psychological Service to ensure earlier intervention and access for young children and teenagers and to offer immediate support to schools in cases of critical incidents.  The Programme commits to bring the total number of NEPS psychologists to 238 from the current sanctioned limit of 173. A recruitment process is currently underway to bring the numbers of NEPS Psychologists to currently approved numbers. </p>  <p>  I can confirm that this Government will continue to ensure that the supports required to ensure that all children with special educational needs can continue to participate in education will be provided.</p></reply>

These include: </p><p>-  special schools for the deaf have been encouraged in relation to the use of sign language in class.</p><p>-  funding for an ISL weekly home tuition service through which deaf tutors visit the homes of deaf pre-school children and deaf school-going pupils to provide training in ISL for the deaf children, pupils, their siblings and parents.</p><p>-  funding is also made available through the Special Education Support Service (SESS) to enable individual teachers and whole school staff to undertake courses in Irish Sign Language which are available throughout the country through a variety of providers.</p><p>Sign language is an option in the Leaving Certificate Applied. There is also an opportunity for students to learn sign language in the course of Transition Year. </p><p>The Post-Primary Languages Initiative has developed a specification for a short course in Irish Sign Language (ISL) which is available as part of the new Junior Cycle.  The emphasis is on developing communication skills in ISL at level A1 (Common European Framework of Reference for Languages).

The course modules deal with issues such as sign linguistics, bi-lingualism and socio-linguistics of sign language.  The course is delivered in seminar sessions/group work and the award of the diploma is based on continued assessment and a project and course design.  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) published its Policy Advice on the Education of Deaf and Hard of Hearing Children in Ireland which makes a number of recommendations for the improvement of educational provision for Deaf and Hard of Hearing Children, including recommendations relating to ISL provision.  This policy advice is available on the NCSE's website .

To this end, my Department uses a Geographical Information System to identify the areas under increased demographic pressure nationwide.  The system uses a range of data sources in carrying out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level.  The outcome of the latest demographic exercises was that in November 2015, 13 new schools were announced to open nationwide in 2017 and 2018.</p>  <p>  The November 2015 announcement also detailed the new building projects and major extensions, including special schools, that will be progressed in areas where significant demographic need has been established.  In addition, the 6 Year Programme (2016-21) prioritises projects that in addition to meeting increases in enrolments, have a major deficit of mainstream accommodation capacity for current enrolments, require major refurbishment and replacement of poor accommodation.  School projects that were announced under my Department's 5 Year Plan (2012-16) will also be advanced in the Capital Programme.</p>  <p>  While all projects included in the Programme are based on the educational and demographic needs of the particular school and area, the decision of when exactly each individual school building project can proceed to tender and construction is based on a number of factors including the stage reached by the project in architectural planning, the level of overall funding available and the other contractual commitments and profiled expenditures extant under the Programme at that time.</p>  <p>  The Capital Programme also provides for devolved funding for smaller scale projects for schools, where an immediate accommodation requirement has been identified, such as the appointment of an additional teacher.  In that regard, it is open to schools to apply for funding for additional classroom accommodation, where required.</p></reply>

The designation of any performance in the certificate examinations as a 'fail' ceased in 1968. </p>  <p>  The nature of curricular examinations such as the Leaving Certificate and the procedures currently in place for awarding grades are such that a certain amount of fluctuation in the grade distribution from year to year is to be expected.  Grade distributions are also affected significantly by the proportion of candidates who opt to take the examination at each level.  In particular, if the proportion of candidates opting for Higher level increases, the candidates making this move will tend to be those who were towards the higher-achieving end of the Ordinary level distribution and will tend to fall at the lower-achieving end of the Higher level distribution.  This will obviously affect the grade distribution at both levels. Influenced by the combined effect of syllabus change in mathematics, known as Project Maths, and the introduction by the Higher Education Institutions of 'bonus points' for Higher level mathematics, the number of students in recent years presenting for Higher level in Leaving Certificate Mathematics examinations has increased significantly, from 15.8% in 2011 to 28% in 2016. </p>  <p>  During the standard-setting process that happens as part of the marking process each year, the State Examinations Commission (SEC) takes account of these and any other relevant factors in the course of satisfying itself that the distribution of grades awarded is appropriate and that it accurately reflects the performance of the candidates in comparison to the achievement standards envisaged when the syllabus was designed.</p>  <p>  In the context of a significant migration of mathematics candidates from Ordinary to Higher level, it may be noted that a similar absolute number of candidates awarded E, F or no grade at Ordinary level will inevitably be manifested as a higher percentage, since the total number of candidates at this level has reduced.</p>  <p>  The number of candidates who failed to achieve at least a D3 grade at any level of the mathematics examination in 2016, while marginally higher than in the last three or four years, is very similar to the number in the years before that (2009 to 2011, for example).  In the context of the factors mentioned above, there is nothing especially unusual about the grade distribution in mathematics for 2016.</p>  <p>  In the case of the current syllabus change in mathematics, there has been a deliberate attempt to increase the emphasis on higher-order thinking skills, including interpretation, problem solving, and dealing with the unfamiliar.  These are skills that students find difficult to master and teachers find difficult to instil in students.The syllabus expectations are ambitious at all levels. </p>  <p>  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) will be undertaking a review of the Project Maths initiative, now that the full implementation of all phases of the curricular change is complete.  By this time students will have been through the new maths cycle a few times and the NCCA will have good information on which to base the assessment of its impact, especially on the learning of under-achievers.  I have asked the State Examinations Commission to ensure that any lessons that can be learned from candidate performance in recent examinations, and the 2016 examination in particular, be fed into that review process.  The Project Maths Implementation Support Group, an industry-education partnership set up by my Department, including third level bodies, Engineers Ireland, Science Foundation Ireland, will also be able to provide their considered opinions to this process.</p></reply>

The HEA funds retention initiatives in Computer Science disciplines in higher education institutions through the Information Technology Investment Fund.  In 2015 these initiatives included additional classes, attendance mentoring, teaching and learning initiatives, student support sessions, buddy practicals and maths enabling courses.  In 2016 the National Forum for Teaching and Learning established an ICT Retention Scoping Group to examine ways in which students could be enabled to complete ICT courses.  The group working with practitioners and industry are examining areas such as career guidance, pathways, provision and pedagogy.</p>  <p>  One of the key objectives of the National Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education2015-2019 (National Access Plan) is to address the issue of non-completion within higher education institutions, for those in under-represented target groups.  The Plan also commits to the further development of mechanisms to track the progression, retention and student experience of target groups.  The target student groups include entrants from socio-economic groups that have low participation in higher education; first time mature student entrants and students with disabilities.</p>  <p>  To support the implementation of these objectives, a Working Group has been established to consider the issues contributing to the non-completion of target groups in the National Access Plan and to produce recommendations for policy and practice.  The group is chaired by the Higher Education Authority (HEA) and includes representatives of relevant stakeholders.  The HEA, with assistance from the National Forum for the Enhancement of Teaching and Learning, is currently undertaking a scoping exercise to inform the work of the group.</p></reply>

Its first task was to formally invite proposals for new apprenticeship programmes from consortia of enterprise, professional bodies and education and training providers.  Over 80 separate proposals were received all of which were evaluated by the Council.  Following the evaluation process, the Council prioritised 25 proposals for development. Included in these proposals are a number of proposals in the hospitality sector, particularly in the culinary area. </p>  <p>  Work is progressing on the development of a new Commis Chef Apprenticeship led by the Irish Hotels Federation and the Restaurants Association of Ireland working with Kerry Education and Training Board.  It is planned that this programme will commence in 2017.  The Apprenticeship Council recently approved development funding for a separate proposal to develop a Chef de Partie Apprenticeship.  The Council will continue to work closely with these consortia to develop their proposals into sustainable apprenticeships that can be delivered on a nationwide basis.</p></reply>

The use of school facilities must be approved by the school authority.  In 2005, my Department issued a circular to Trustees, Boards of Management and Principals of Primary and Voluntary Secondary Schools (Circular Letter Prim 16/05) to encourage Trustees and Boards of Management to make their facilities available where possible for community, education and recreation purposes.  This circular recognises that the decision ultimately lies with the relevant Board or Trustees and that the first priority at all times should be the interest of the school, its teachers and pupils.</p>  <p>  In facilitating such extra provision there are a number of complex issues that need to be considered in respect of such arrangements.  I engaged with education partners specifically in relation to this matter in a very positive roundtable discussion in the Summer.  These issues - including property, governance, insurance and liability - are being considered as part of a review within my Department of the requirements to be established around the use of school premises/property for pre-school and after school services and the preparation of guidelines in consultation with patrons/trustees in relation to same.</p></reply>

My Department uses a Geographical Information System (GIS) to identify the areas under increased demographic pressure nationwide.  The GIS uses data from the Central Statistics Office, Ordnance Survey Ireland, the Department of Social Protection and my Department's own databases.  With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic analyses to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level.</p>  <p>  When it is decided that a new school is required to meet demographic needs in an area, my Department runs a separate patronage process to decide who will operate the school.  This patronage process incorporates consideration of, and the potential for, Irish-medium provision.  It is open to all patron bodies and prospective patrons, including patrons involved in Irish-medium provision and indeed any prospective patron which wishes to provide Irish-medium education, to apply for patronage of a new school under the patronage process.  Parental preferences for each patron, together with the extent of diversity currently available in the area, are key to decisions in relation to the outcome of this process.  </p>  <p>  Following consideration of feedback from patrons, for the 2016 patronage process concerning the patronage of the nine new post-primary schools to open in 2017 and 2018 and the ongoing patronage process concerning the patronage of the four primary schools opening in 2017 and 2018, my Department has moved to incorporate the medium of instruction of a proposed new school as an integral part of the patronage assessment and recommendation process.  In this regard, as part of the application process, prospective patrons must submit completed parental preferences and indicate their preference for their child(ren) to be educated through that patron's school model and also their preference with regard to education through the medium of English or Irish.  The assessment process includes an analysis of Irish medium provision in the area and the adjacent school planning areas. </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to make provision for Irish-medium education where it is feasible to do so.</p></reply>

The scheme also provides a compensatory educational service for children with special educational needs seeking an educational placement for whom such a placement is not available.  Provision is also made for early educational intervention for children aged from 2.5 years to 3 years with autism.</p>  <p>  Home Tuition is provided as an interim measure only for children for whom a placement in a recognised school is sought but not available and should not be regarded as an optional alternative to a school placement.</p>  <p>  Where parents of children, who are eligible for Home Tuition under the terms of the scheme, and for whom home tuition has been approved, have sought alternative arrangements to be put in place for the tuition, my Department has responded by putting arrangements in place with 12 private pre-school providers which provide group tuition to children in a class type setting.  Each of these providers was selected by the parents. </p>  <p>  My Department will consider similar arrangements with other private providers should parents of eligible children request this. </p>  <p>  In recognition of the demand for group arrangements by parents of children, who are eligible for Home Tuition under the scheme, my Department now advises all such parents of the option to enter into a group arrangement with other parents of children for whom home tuition has been sanctioned.  My Department has no contract with the pre-school providers.  The contract is essentially between the parents and the relevant provider.</p>  <p>  Parents wishing to enter into such an arrangement must notify my Department in advance for approval.  The arrangements must conform to the general terms of the scheme.</p></reply>

The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support, as set out in my Department's Circular 0030/2014.</p><p>The Special Needs Assistant (SNA) scheme is designed to provide schools with additional adult support staff who can assist children with special educational needs who also have additional and significant care needs.  Such support is provided in order to facilitate the attendance of those pupils at school and also to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned, or for their peers, and with a view to developing their independent living skills.  SNA support is allocated to schools to support pupils based on their assessed care needs, as opposed to being allocated on the basis of a particular disability diagnosis.</p><p>SNA allocations are accordingly not made to individual children, but are made to schools to support the care needs of children with assessed special educational needs in the school. </p><p>The consideration of professional reports is an integral part of determining the extent of supports to be provided for pupils with special educational needs.  In making allocations to schools, the NCSE takes into account the assessed individual needs of all children with identified needs in the school.</p><p>A school's allocation of SNA support can change from year to year and may be increased or decreased as students who qualify for SNA support enrol or leave a school. New students with care needs may, or may not, enrol to replace students who have left, for example, or SNA allocations may be decreased where a child's care needs have diminished over time. </p><p>The deployment of SNAs within schools is then a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management.  Department Circular 0030/2014 provides substantial guidance on the deployment and utilisation of SNAs within schools.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated.  It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised.</p><p>The NCSE has published details of SNA allocations to schools for 2016 on its website: <i>http://ncse.ie/statistics. </i></p></reply>

The aim of the NTICI was to accelerate the taking-in-charge process of housing estates, including estates with developer-provided water services infrastructure.  Survey data gathered from each of the 31 local authorities were collated in December 2015 and, subsequently, funding was allocated by my Department for a number of developments on the basis of proposals submitted by the local authorities.   </p>  <p>  The information provided by this survey indicated that, of the 5,566 developments yet to be taken in charge, there are approximately 914 estates with developer-provided water services infrastructure (DPI). </p>  <p>  Under the terms of the NTICI, only those developments subject to valid taking-in-charge applications were eligible for inclusion in the call for funding proposals, outlined in Circular FPS3 of April 2016.  It was also stipulated that funding for estates with DPI would only apply to developments that could demonstrate sustainable solutions that will also be acceptable to Irish Water and EPA.  The valuable knowledge and experience gained under this Initiative will help to inform and direct future taking-in-charge processes.   </p>  <p>  Seven local authorities were selected from the list with DPI; Clare, Cork, Donegal, Galway, Kerry, Tipperary and Wexford, as they contained a significant number of housing estates with DPI.  In total, 68 developments with DPI were submitted by the seven local authorities for funding and 44 were initially approved.   </p>  <p>  After assessing the submissions in detail, a final allocation of &euro;1.9 million was distributed across the 7 local authorities to progress works on 31 housing estates with developer provided water services infrastructure to taking in charge standard.  Work is still progressing on a number of these pilot projects and upon the completion of these works my Department will prepare a report by the Summer of 2017 on key lessons learned with recommendations, based on the experience gained, to inform and progress future taking-in-charge plans.</p></reply>

This legislation requires all local authorities, as a reserved function, to make an allocation scheme determining the order of priority to be accorded in the allocation of dwellings to households qualified for social housing support, the allocation of which would, in the opinion of the authority, meet the accommodation needs and requirements of the households.  Under the 2009 Act, a household is defined as a person living alone, or two or more persons, who in the opinion of the local authority concerned, have a reasonable requirement to live together.</p>  <p>  As such, it is a matter for each housing authority to decide on the type of support to be allocated to individual households.  As Minister, I am precluded by the 2009 Act from intervening in relation to the procedures followed, or decisions made, by housing authorities in the allocation of particular dwellings.</p>  <p>  I have not had discussions with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs in relation to the allocation of accommodation to households of the type referred to. </p></reply>

Under the Act, planning authorities are required to establish a register of vacant sites in their areas, beginning on 1 January 2017, and to issue annual notices to owners of vacant sites by 1 June 2018 in respect of vacant sites on the register on 1 January 2018.  The levy will be applied by planning authorities, commencing on 1 January 2019, in respect of sites which were vacant and on the vacant site register during the preceding year (i.e. 2018) and will subsequently be applied on an annual basis thereafter, as long as a site remains on the vacant site register in the preceding year.</p><p>The timeframes set out in the legislation in relation to the commencement of the application of the levy are based on legal advice in relation to the constitutional rights of property owners and are intended to allow site owners sufficient time and opportunity to initiate development on their sites, or alternatively to sell their sites, in order to avoid becoming liable for the levy. </p><p>Planning authorities are empowered to apply an annual vacant site levy of 3% of the market value of vacant sites exceeding 0.05 hectares (or 500 square metres) in area which, in the planning authority&rsquo;s opinion, were vacant or idle in the preceding year, in areas identified by the planning authority in its development plan or local area plan for residential or regeneration development.  The 3% rate of vacant site levy is consistent with the rate applied to derelict sites under the Derelict Sites Act 1990 and is considered reasonable, without being over-punitive, for the purposes of incentivising the activation of such sites for residential or regeneration purposes. </p><p>In addition, the legislation provides that reduced or zero rates of levy may apply in specific circumstances in order to help alleviate the financial burden faced by owners of vacant sites which are subject to a site loan and where the loan is greater than the market value of the site (i.e. a negative equity situation), and also where the site loan is greater than 50% of the market value of the site.  This is to ensure that the levy provisions are fair, reasonable and proportionate taking account of the difficult circumstances faced by owners who are in this position.</p><p>In this context, I have no proposals to amend the existing legislative provisions relating to the vacant site levy in relation to the timeframes for its implementation or the rate of the levy to be applied, as proposed.</p><p>My Department issued general guidance in July 2016 on the implementation of the vacant site levy to planning authorities by way of Circular Letter PL 7/2016, entitled Implementation of the Vacant Site Levy, as provided for in the Urban Regeneration and Housing Act 2015, which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link:</p><p>.</p><p>Planning authorities are presently engaging in the necessary preparatory work prior to the application of the levy with effect from January 2019, including the revision of development plans to specify the areas in which the levy is to be applied as well as the identification of specific vacant sites for entry on the register.  My Department will monitor the implementation of the levy to ensure that it is being fully used in line with its intended purpose.</p></reply>

My Department maintains regular contact with the ESB to ensure that this data set remains relevant and consistent over time.  The ESB recently confirmed to the Department that the connections figure includes a small, but not easily quantified, number of reconnections to the grid where the unit was disconnected, and therefore vacant, for at least two years.  Furthermore, they also confirmed that service alterations are not included in the connections figures.</p>  <p>  My Department also produces annual estimates of the housing stock using census figures, when available, completions data and an evolving estimate for obsolescence of the housing stock.

There is also consensus on the need for a significant portion of the increased output to be at more affordable prices and rents.  Achieving these aims is the fundamental objective underpinning the Government&rsquo;s Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan on Housing and Homelessness.  </p>  <p>  During the extensive stakeholder consultation that preceded publication of Rebuilding Ireland, the issue of large tracts of land, suitable for housing, but with little or no construction underway, was raised frequently.  In the case of local authority owned lands, I was determined that under Rebuilding Ireland, we would see accelerated delivery of homes from these and other State lands.  In progressing housing activity on these sites, there is no question of reducing social housing output.  Overall, some 47,000 additional social housing units are to be provided under Rebuilding Ireland and in the case of large publicly owned sites, social housing is to be delivered as part of vibrant, integrated, mixed tenure developments.   </p>  <p>  O&rsquo;Devaney Gardens in Dublin City is a good example of one such large site where the City Council has brought forward a significant proposal for accelerated housing development.  In order to optimise delivery of housing from this site, my Department has agreed a mixed tenure approach with the City Council.  This approach delivers accelerated output across all tenures and also has wider benefits in terms of the achievement of more sustainable integrated communities.  Such developments are considered on a case by case and site-specific basis between my Department and the local authority concerned. </p>  <p>  The approach to delivery of housing from such sites is in accordance with State land supply and management objectives contained in Rebuilding Ireland.  More broadly, my Department is engaging with local authorities and other State bodies, to identify and map sites in local authority and public ownership for the purposes of delivering housing more quickly.  This approach to active land management of State land can also enhance land supply more broadly, providing alternatives for a wide variety of housing providers, including the public and voluntary housing sectors, and ensuring that the State extracts the most beneficial use of under-utilised assets for much needed housing in the shortest possible timeframe. </p>  <p>  As part of the broader land management strategy, I recently announced details of 23 Major Urban Housing Development Sites, some in State ownership and some owned privately, with the potential to deliver up to 30,000 additional homes over the next 3 to 4 years on existing zoned lands and close to the key areas of demand.  These sites are being progressed as exemplars for the co-ordination and delivery of plan-led housing development and active land management.   </p></reply>

The aim of this Fund is to relieve critical infrastructural blockages to enable the accelerated delivery of housing on key development sites and to improve the economic viability of new housing projects in Dublin and in urban areas with high demand for housing.  The &euro;200m Fund will be composed of an Exchequer allocation of &euro;150 million, matched by a &euro;50 million contribution from participating local authorities.</p>  <p>  A Call for Proposals under the Fund was issued to local authorities on 26 August 2016, with a closing date for receipt of proposals of 14 October.  It was open to all local authorities to apply, with funding to be allocated on the basis of a competitive bid process.  Twenty-one local authorities have submitted a total of 74 project applications relating to specific sites or development land areas.  Westmeath County Council submitted a proposal in relation to Brawny, Athlone which includes the link road between the sports centre and the Garrycastle area.</p>  <p>  The overall total cost of the 74 funding bid applications is approximately &euro;800m, with funding of some &euro;600 million being sought from the Exchequer and local authorities agreeing to fund approximately &euro;200 million as part of their matching fund requirements.  It will not be possible to approve all applications, given the scale and value of applications received.</p>  <p>  The viability of the applications is currently being examined in detail against the assessment criteria set out in the Call for Proposals, with a focus on the level of funding required and what it might leverage, the number of housing units that could be delivered, their strategic location and speed of delivery, and affordability levels of a proportion of the homes.  Following completion of this analysis, I intend to announce successful applications during the first quarter of this year.</p></reply>

Lands held by local authorities in rent pressure zones are to be brought to market on a competitive tendering basis, with a view to leveraging the value of the land to deliver the optimum number of units for rent, targeting middle income households, in mixed tenure developments.  The cost of providing rental units is to be permanently reduced by lowering the initial investment and development costs for providers - AHB or private - allowing the rental units to be made available at below market prices without the need for ongoing rental subsidies.</p><p>The local authorities concerned will identify a number of sites with the potential for up to 1,000 units of accommodation and will move forward, as soon as possible, to issue calls for proposals from parties interested in developing projects.  As speed of delivery will be critically important, appropriate licence arrangements, incorporating clear timescales for delivery, will be a key feature of the process.</p><p>This programme is being co-ordinated with the dedicated measures in <i>Rebuilding Ireland</i>to accelerate housing output from the Major Urban Housing Delivery Sites, including support from the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund (LIHAF) where necessary.  Possible project locations include O Devaney Gardens and Oscar Traynor Road in Dublin.  In tandem, new-build rental accommodation is also to be provided in the major build-to-rent projects planned for strategic development zones and other large sites in Dublin and other locations, such as Cherrywood in the Dun Laoghaire Rathdown County Council area.</p></reply>

This includes undertaking a detailed analysis, in conjunction with the construction sector, to benchmark housing delivery input costs in Ireland, in order to facilitate an increased level of housing output into the future.  A working group, chaired by my Department, with a broad range of industry representatives has been established.  The first meeting took place in December and there is another meeting   scheduled to take place this week.  While it is intended that the working group will concentrate on the domestic market, the Housing Agency is currently advancing an independent review and analysis of delivery costs and international comparisons.  Both studies are expected to be complete in the first half of 2017.</p>  <p>  My Department has also input into work led by the Department of Finance in relation to construction costs, which was undertaken under the Construction 2020 Strategy.  In addition, costs are examined in the context of proposed legislative changes, particularly in relation to Building Regulations, and a cost benefit analysis and regulatory impact analysis is carried out on any proposed amendments.</p>  <p>  Further measures taken by my Department to bring down the cost of providing housing and reduce the amount of finance required include the &euro;200 million Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund (LIHAF), which will provide much-needed enabling infrastructure on key sites to open up lands for development from early 2017 onwards.</p>  <p>  In addition, the NTMA, through the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF), is developing proposals to offer competitive financing on a commercial basis, and in line with ISIF&rsquo;s statutory mandate, to meet other infrastructure requirements on large development sites.</p></reply>

The strategy is structured around 4 key areas: security, standards, supply and services.  The overarching objective of the strategy is to increase security and supply and support the development of a stable, strong and viable rental sector offering choice for households, investment opportunities for providers and reflecting the rights and responsibilities of both tenants and landlords.</p>  <p>  The measures under these four headings will be implemented through the 29 act ions contained in the Strategy.  Action 9 commits to the establishment of a working group on the tax and fiscal treatment of rental accommodation providers.  The working group will examine and report on the tax treatment of landlords and put forward options, where identified and appropriate, for amendment to such tax treatment.  The first meeting of the working group took place on 19 January 2017.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Rental Strategy contains a number of actions of importance to landlords, which will be implemented in 2017.  These include the introduction of unfurnished lettings in the case of long leases, a fast track process for effective termination procedures in cases of non-payment of rent and measures to improve the enforcement of Determination Orders issued by the Residential Tenancies Board and reduce the time taken for dispute resolution.  The RTB will also establish a one stop shop for information on the Residential Tenancies Act and a voluntary accreditation scheme for landlords.</p></reply>

The independent Pyrite Panel was clear in its view that only dwellings with significant damage due to pyritic heave (i.e. red category) should be remediated and that it would be unreasonable to expect dwellings not exhibiting such damage to be remediated.  Dwellings which have no significant damage but have reactive pyrite in the hardcore material (i.e. amber category) should be monitored and only remediated if they display significant damage due to pyritic heave.  This remains the position with regard to dwellings, which do not display significant pyritic damage.</p><p>In response to this recommendation, <i>I.S. 398-1:2013 - Reactive pyrite in sub-floor hardcore material &ndash; Part 1: Testing and Categorisation</i>was published by the National Standards Authority of Ireland in late January 2013, and provides the means by which dwellings, which may be affected by pyrite can be tested and categorised.  In broad terms, the national standard sets out a two-step process to facilitate the testing and categorisation of dwellings.</p><p>The first step requires that a Building Condition Assessment be carried out; this comprises a desktop study and a visual non-invasive internal and external inspection of a dwelling to establish the presence or absence of visible damage that is consistent with pyritic heave and to quantify the extent and significance of such damage in that dwelling.  Damage ratings of 0, 1 or 2 can be assigned to a dwelling under this process.</p><p>The second step involves the sampling and testing of the sub-floor hardcore material and is informed by the assignment of the Damage Condition Rating under the Building Condition Assessment process.  At the conclusion of this two-step process, buildings may be categorised under I.S. 398-1:2013 into four categories which are broadly consistent with the traffic light system that was used by the Pyrite Panel as a means of prioritising pyrite remediation works.</p><p>The provides for the making of a pyrite remediation scheme by the Pyrite Resolution Board for certain dwellings affected by significant pyrite damage.  The pyrite remediation scheme is a scheme of &ldquo;last resort&rdquo; and is limited in its application and scope.  The full conditions for eligibility under the scheme are set out in the scheme, which is available on the Board&rsquo;s website (<i>www.pyriteboard.ie ).</i></p><p>The scheme is applicable to dwellings which are subject to significant damage attributable to pyritic heave established in accordance with I.S. 398-1:2013.  It is a condition of eligibility under the scheme that an application to the Board must be accompanied by a Building Condition Assessment with a Damage Condition Rating of 2.  Dwellings which do not have a Damage Condition Rating of 2 are not eligible to apply under the scheme.  There are no proposals to amend eligibility criteria.</p><p>In late 2015, the National Standards Authority of Ireland commenced a review of I.S. 398-1:2013 in the light of practical experience since the standard was first introduced in January 2013.  The standard is being updated and revised to reflect the on-site experiences and evidence gathered by technical experts, such as engineers, geologists, professionals providing sampling and testing services and other technical experts, who have been using the standard over the past four years.  A public consultation was announced on the revision of I.S. 398-1:2013, which closed on 17 December 2016.  My Department understands that it is anticipated that the revised standard will be published later this year.</p></reply>

The subsidy is payable to a group water scheme towards their operating costs of providing water for domestic use. The subsidy is payable annually and paid on a per house basis once the scheme qualifies.

The NESC Report, Ireland's Rental Sector: Pathways to Secure Occupancy and Affordable Supply, published in May 2015, estimates that over one-third of all households in the private rented sector are in receipt of social housing support. </p>  <p>  In relation to the amount of former local authority housing that is now in the private rented sector, and the amount of former local authority housing now in the private rented sector that is occupied by tenants under the Rental Accommodation Scheme, the Housing Assistance Payment and Rent Supplement, my Department does not hold or collate this information.</p>  <p>  The Tenant (Incremental) Purchase Scheme 2016 came into operation on 1 January 2016, replacing the 1995 Tenant Purchase Scheme. Tenant purchase schemes are an important way to help people who would otherwise struggle to buy a home, to realise their home ownership ambitions, while at the same time supporting long-term commitment to a location by residents. The current scheme, through a claw-back mechanism, discourages the early re-sale of properties at a profit, thereby encouraging people to only buy houses they intend to live in. The new scheme is open to eligible tenants, including joint tenants, of local authority houses that are available for sale under the scheme. </p>  <p>  Incremental purchase protects the State's investment in the sale of the house to the tenant by giving the housing authority a share of any profits made on the resale of the house within a reasonable period after purchase. This was not the case under the 1995 scheme. The local authority will use these funds to provide new housing or refurbish existing stock. Incremental purchase promotes sustainable communities as it encourages purchasers to stay in their homes for a reasonable period after the purchase. As part of the terms of the scheme purchasers must live in the house as their normal place of residence and get agreement from their local authority if they want to sell, let or sub-let the house. Purchasers are able to sell their house; however, within the incremental charge period they will have to pay back the value of the outstanding charge on the house to the local authority. </p></reply>

In 2011, my Department received a report from the then Regional Authorities on Regional Planning Guidelines implementation which indicated that, prior to the introduction of the above amendment, 41,788 hectares of land in total had been zoned for housing, sufficient for the provision of 1.1 million new homes or an additional population of 2.64 million people, including in certain in appropriate and poorly serviced locations. </p>  <p>  This level of over-zoning was unwarranted, was too often based on aspirational planning, without regard for wider implications as to if or how all these lands could be developed over time and would have presented huge difficulties in terms of the co-ordination of future development and the associated services and infrastructure provision. </p>  <p>  Following the introduction of amending provisions in the 2010 Act and drawing from guidance in the National Spatial Strategy and Regional Planning Guidelines, local authorities rapidly reviewed their development plans and local area plans such that the level of lands zoned and prioritised for housing as Phase 1 lands with in their statutory plans was scaled back to 11,113 hectares, or lands sufficient to provide for around 300,000 new dwellings, which would equate to approximately 12 years ' supply, in the context of the Economic and Social Research Institute's estimate of the new housing requirement of 25,000 units per annum. </p>  <p>  The excess lands were either de-zoned or changed zoning objective to another appropriate use such as employment and amenity lands, or were identified for later phases of development, pending the utilisation of all lands zoned for priority development.  </p>  <p>  My Department monitors all city and county development plans and local area plans to secure broad alignment between the National Spatial Strategy, which will be succeeded later this year with the new National Planning Framework, and Regional Planning Guidelines last published in 2010 and local authority statutory plans.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently engaged in technical analysis of the 2016 Census in the context of providing medium-to longer- term national and regional population and housing requirement estimates for the National Planning Framework, which, in turn, will inform new Regional Spatial and Economic Strategies (RSES), succeeding the existing Planning Guidelines.  I will give consideration to advancing interim guidance to planning authorities on the appropriate population estimates that their statutory plans should provide for, in advance of the publication of the RSESs later this year, and on foot of the publication of the National Planning Framework, so that statutory plans reflect the latest Census data and plan pro-actively for the future on a sound and integrated basis.</p>  <p>  More generally, my Department is satisfied that as regards the major metropolitan areas, in particular, where new housing demand is most acute, the existing round of Regional Planning Guidelines continue to provide a reasonable basis for planning for growth and housing provision and for consideration of housing proposals by planning authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la, ahead of updated guidelines being finalised.</p></reply>

The &euro;200 m Fund will be composed of an Exchequer allocation of &euro;150 million, matched by a &euro;50 million contribution from participating local authorities.</p>  <p>  A Call for Proposals under the Fund was issued to local authorities on 26 August 2016, with a closing date for receipt of proposals of 14 October. It was open to all local authorities to apply, with funding to be allocated on the basis of a competitive bid process. Twenty-one local authorities have submitted a total of 74 project applications relating to specific sites or development land areas. Dublin City Council submitted a proposal in relation to the area, referred to in the Question.</p>  <p>  The overall total cost of the 74 funding bid applications is approximately &euro;800 m, with funding of some &euro;600 million being sought from the Exchequer and local authorities agreeing to fund approximately &euro;200 million as part of their matching fund requirements. It will not be possible to approve all applications, given the scale and value of applications received.</p>  <p>  The viability of the applications is currently being examined in detail against the assessment criteria set out in the Call for Proposals, with a focus on the level of funding required and what it might leverage, the number of housing units that could be delivered, their strategic location and speed of delivery, and affordability levels of a proportion of the homes. Following completion of this analysis, I intend to announce successful applications during the first quarter of this year.</p></reply>

This compares with the most recent available EU figure (from Eurostat) of 18.8% as at November 2016.</p>  <p>  Reflecting the impact of government policy, and the overall improvement in the labour market, the rate of youth unemployment has fallen sharply from a peak of over 31.1% in 2012. At that time, the EU youth unemployment rate was 23.1%. Irish youth unemployment has thus fallen from well above the EU average in 2012 to significantly below the average at the end of 2016.</p>  <p>  While this improvement is welcome, the Government recognises the importance of a continued focus on measures to facilitate young unemployed people find and sustain employment. </p>  <p>  The key objective of Ireland's policy response to the EU Recommendation on a Youth Guarantee is to help newly unemployed young people find and secure sustainable jobs. In this regard there is monthly engagement by case officers with young people to assist them to prepare, review and, if appropriate, revise personal progression plans. Where young people do not find work relatively quickly, additional supports may be offered, both through reserved places on existing employment and training schemes and through youth-specific measures. Most such offers (over 70%) are in existing further education or training programmes. Others are in existing community-based employment programmes such as CE, Gateway and T&uacute;s. Pathways to Work 2016-2020 continues to prioritise these measures for the young unemployed and further commits to a number of additional measures.</p>  <p>  I am confident these measures, and continuing economic recovery, will support further reductions in youth unemployment and add to the substantial improvements that have already been seen over the last few years. </p></reply>

A breakdown of rent supplement recipients by county is provided in the attached tabular statement, this information is not maintained by local authority area.</p><p>In recognition of the ongoing supply difficulties, my Department continues to implement a targeted case-by-case policy approach that allows for flexibility where landlords seek rents in excess of the limits. To date, approximately 10,900 persons at imminent risk of homelessness have been supported through increased rent supplement payments. There has been a significant reduction in these cases following the introduction of the increased rent limits from 1 July 2016.  A county breakdown of these payments is provided in the tabular statement. </p><p>As the Deputies will be aware, the implementation of the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) is a key Government priority and a major pillar of the Social Housing Strategy 2020 and the Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness &ndash; Rebuilding Ireland &ndash; which has committed to an accelerated target of 15,000 HAP tenancies during 2017.  Under HAP, responsibility for the provision of rental assistance to those with a long-term housing need transfers to local authorities, under the auspices of the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.</p><p>From 1st December 2016, the HAP scheme is now operational in 28 of the 31 local authority areas. It is expected that HAP will be fully rolled out to the remaining Dublin administrative areas from 1st March 2017. </p><p>The HAP was first piloted in the Limerick area in early 2014, and there are now some 1,540 HAP supported tenancies in Limerick City and County. The number of HAP recipients in Limerick has exceeded the number of rent supplement recipients (c. 950). In addition to the ongoing transfer of tenancies from rent supplement to HAP, the majority of new applicants in Limerick seeking State support towards their rent are being processed under HAP rather than rent supplement. This activity is reflected in the low number of increased payments provided under rent supplement in this area. </p><p>In tandem with the revised rental limits introduced in July 2016 and on-going transfers to HAP, my Department continues to implement a targeted, flexible, case-by-case approach where rents may exceed the appropriate maximum limit ensuring where possible the threat of homelessness for tenants can be avoided. </p><p>Table 1: Rent Supplement Recipients by County as at end December, 2016<table><tr><th>County</th><th>Recipients</th></tr><tr><td>CARLOW</td><td>593</td></tr><tr><td>CAVAN</td><td>391</td></tr><tr><td>CLARE</td><td>423</td></tr><tr><td>CORK</td><td>4,958</td></tr><tr><td>DONEGAL</td><td>415</td></tr><tr><td>DUBLIN</td><td>20,561</td></tr><tr><td>GALWAY</td><td>2,506</td></tr><tr><td>KERRY</td><td>1,554</td></tr><tr><td>KILDARE</td><td>2,579</td></tr><tr><td>KILKENNY</td><td>319</td></tr><tr><td>LAOIS</td><td>871</td></tr><tr><td>LEITRIM</td><td>281</td></tr><tr><td>LIMERICK</td><td>954</td></tr><tr><td>LONGFORD</td><td>401</td></tr><tr><td>LOUTH</td><td>859</td></tr><tr><td>MAYO</td><td>1,074</td></tr><tr><td>MEATH</td><td>1,001</td></tr><tr><td>MONAGHAN</td><td>188</td></tr><tr><td>OFFALY</td><td>563</td></tr><tr><td>ROSCOMMON</td><td>566</td></tr><tr><td>SLIGO</td><td>289</td></tr><tr><td>TIPPERARY</td><td>901</td></tr><tr><td>WATERFORD</td><td>590</td></tr><tr><td>WESTMEATH</td><td>1,299</td></tr><tr><td>WEXFORD</td><td>1,960</td></tr><tr><td>WICKLOW</td><td>1,945</td></tr><tr><td>Grand Total</td><td>48,041</td></tr></table></p><p>Table 2: Total Cumulative Increased Rental Payments by County as at 16 January 2017<table><tr><th>County</th><th>Awards under National Tenancy Sustainment Framework</th><th>Awards under protocol with Threshold</th><th>Total no. of increased payments by County</th></tr><tr><td>CARLOW</td><td>74</td><td></td><td>74</td></tr><tr><td>CAVAN</td><td>63</td><td></td><td>63</td></tr><tr><td>CLARE</td><td>60</td><td></td><td>60</td></tr><tr><td>CORK</td><td>448</td><td>102</td><td>550</td></tr><tr><td>DONEGAL</td><td>-</td><td></td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>DUBLIN</td><td>4,181</td><td>2,509</td><td>6,690</td></tr><tr><td>GALWAY</td><td>204</td><td>2</td><td>206</td></tr><tr><td>KERRY</td><td>193</td><td></td><td>193</td></tr><tr><td>KILDARE</td><td>549</td><td>3</td><td>552</td></tr><tr><td>KILKENNY</td><td>135</td><td></td><td>135</td></tr><tr><td>LAOIS</td><td>119</td><td></td><td>119</td></tr><tr><td>LEITRIM</td><td>99</td><td></td><td>99</td></tr><tr><td>LIMERICK</td><td>16</td><td></td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>LONGFORD</td><td>310</td><td></td><td>310</td></tr><tr><td>LOUTH</td><td>155</td><td></td><td>155</td></tr><tr><td>MAYO</td><td>3</td><td></td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>MEATH</td><td>430</td><td></td><td>430</td></tr><tr><td>MONAGHAN</td><td>1</td><td></td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>OFFALY</td><td>64</td><td></td><td>64</td></tr><tr><td>ROSCOMMON</td><td>51</td><td></td><td>51</td></tr><tr><td>SLIGO</td><td>1</td><td></td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>TIPPERARY</td><td>283</td><td></td><td>283</td></tr><tr><td>WATERFORD</td><td>62</td><td></td><td>62</td></tr><tr><td>WESTMEATH</td><td>369</td><td></td><td>369</td></tr><tr><td>WEXFORD</td><td>22</td><td></td><td>22</td></tr><tr><td>WICKLOW</td><td>389</td><td>3</td><td>392</td></tr><tr><td>Overall Total</td><td>8,281</td><td>2,619</td><td>10,900</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Nevertheless, my Department recognises that abuse of the welfare system is an ongoing reality and must be tackled.  Anti-fraud measures are set out in the Department's Compliance and Anti-Fraud Strategy 2014 &ndash; 2018 and are designed to prevent and detect fraud, to ensure effective oversight of schemes, to pursue prosecution of offenders and the recovery of any overpaid entitlements identified.  I will be publishing the report on the implementation of the Strategy for the year 2016 before the end of March.</p>  <p>  All Departmental staff exercise a control and compliance function in processing new applications and reviewing existing entitlements.  The systems used to support schemes are designed to detect wrongful claiming and to highlight anomalies.  In addition, the Department's inspectorate undertakes detailed examination of claims on a risk assessed and random basis.  This is supplemented by at least three fraud and error surveys of Departmental schemes annually and by the use of data matching and data analytics techniques.  </p>  <p>  In addition, my Department's Special Investigation Unit, which comprises trained inspectors and Garda officers, is tasked with undertaking targeted and systematic examination of claims to tackle fraud and to work with other enforcement agencies to identify more serious breaches of the law.  </p>  <p>  Cross-functional and targeted actions are undertaken - both internally and in joint operations with other national and international agencies - to ensure a strategic response to high risk sectors or where fraud is considered to be most prevalent.  In particular, actions are focused on sectors of the economy where there is a risk of concurrent working and claiming social welfare payments.  New forms of fraud continue to be identified and the approach of the Department needs to be sufficiently flexible to combat all threats.</p>  <p>  Overall, my Department conducts around one million claim reviews annually comprising customer entitlement enquiries, inspections and special investigations.  Early indications for 2016 are that these activities have prevented incorrect expenditure of over half a billion euro, in what my Department refers to as control savings.</p>  <p>  The continued roll-out of the Public Services Card has considerably reduced the potential for identity fraud and my Department has deployed identity and analytics software and other intelligence systems to reinforce its fraud prevention work.  Members of the public also play an important role in supporting these anti-fraud activities and some 19,000 reports from concerned citizens have been received during 2016.  To this end, I plan to launch a fraud awareness campaign over the coming months in recognition of the important role the public plays in this regard.  </p>  <p>  I am looking at a number of additional anti-fraud measures that I hope to introduce in 2017.  These include publishing the names of persons who are convicted of social welfare fraud and applying surcharges on overpayments resulting from fraud.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The importance of their contribution is reflected in the range of significant supports provided by my Department to support carers in their caring role and ameliorate the financial burden of caring &ndash; indeed it is worth pointing out that the income supports that carers receive from my Department are among the highest rates in Europe. </p>  <p>  The income supports for carers from my Department include carer&rsquo;s benefit (CB), carers allowance (CA) including half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance, carer&rsquo;s support grant (CSG), domiciliary care allowance (DCA), the household benefits package (HBP) to carers residing with the recipient of care), and the free travel scheme. </p>  <p>  The CA is a means tested payment for people who are providing care and attention to a person who needs it. Half-rate CA is paid in addition to certain primary social welfare payments where the carer meets the criteria for both schemes.

I must point out that the income disregard and means test for carers is the most generous within the social welfare system and, at the full payment rate, the amount of weekly earnings disregarded is &euro;332.50 for a single person and &euro;665 for a people who are married, in a civil partnership or cohabiting. </p>  <p>  I have no plans to review the current arrangements around half-rate carer allowance payment.

While communities benefit from the skills and talents of local farmers and fishermen, participants also have the opportunity to improve existing skills, or develop new skills, while performing valuable work in their local communities.  </p>  <p>  As part of the social welfare budget package for 2017, I announced an increase of &euro;5 a week in the personal rate of payment for RSS participants from March 2017.  In recognition of the crucial work undertaken in rural communities under the RSS, I also announced an additional 500 places on the scheme which will be rolled out over the coming weeks. This will increase the overall numbers on the scheme to 3,100.  </p>  <p>  Eligibility for participation on the scheme will continue to be limited to those in receipt of certain specified social welfare payments and all participants must also be actively engaged in farming or fishing.  In future, all participants to the RSS will have to be over 25 years of age.  I believe this is appropriate as it will give younger people an opportunity to explore other training or education options before entering a long-term work programme such as the RSS.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that almost 50% of the current participants have been on the RSS for over 10 years.  As a result, opportunities for new people to go on the scheme are very limited.  It is in this context that I have introduced a 6 year overall participation limit on the scheme.  This will ensure that there will be a throughput of places available.  It should also be remembered that income support will still be available to eligible farmers and fishermen who are not on RSS in the form of Farm or Fish Assist. </p>  <p>  Existing RSS participants will remain on the scheme as long as they continue to satisfy the eligibility conditions of the scheme. The new conditions outlined above will only apply to new RSS participants who commence on the scheme from 1st February 2017.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputies.</p></reply>

This was a once-off call for pilot projects. The purpose of the Ballymun Youth Guarantee (BYG) pilot project was to test key elements to inform the national roll-out of the Youth Guarantee. The project officially finished on the 31st December 2014.</p><p>Lessons learned from the Ballymun Youth Guarantee pilot project have informed the national roll-out of the Youth Guarantee in a number of ways. </p><p>First, the BYG project showed the importance of close engagement by case officers with young jobseekers. This has informed reforms to Intreo processes such that there is now monthly engagement with all young people by case officers to discuss and achieve personal progression plans. </p><p>Second, the BYG project identified a need for a more intensive approach with disadvantaged youth distant from the labour market, to build employability and work readiness skills. This approach has been taken forward in the First Steps programme.</p><p>A third learning was the importance of career guidance. <i>Pathways to Work </i>2016-2020 commits to designing, developing and implementing an accredited professional development programme for Intreo case officers. This will benefit all jobseekers, including young jobseekers, and will contribute to improving the quality of Intreo services.</p><p>Finally, the BYG project was progressed through partnership working at national and local levels. The scale, scope and nature of this partnership working was facilitated by extensive, pre-existing community infrastructures and relationships in Ballymun. It is not feasible or necessarily desirable to replicate these structures in every community in which Intreo offices operate. Nevertheless, <i>Pathways to Work </i>2016-2020 contains a number of actions to strengthen local arrangements and protocols for partnership working, including for example through Regional Skills Fora, which will include a specific focus on youth. </p><p>Already, youth unemployment has fallen from a peak of 31% in 2012 to 14.5% at the end of 2016.  From a situation where youth unemployment here was well above the EU average of 23% in 2012, it is now significantly below the current EU average figure of 18.8%.</p><p>I am satisfied current policies, including measures drawn from the learning of the BYG project, will support further reductions in youth unemployment in the period ahead.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-01-24a.715.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017012400064#WRN04900"><p>There are a number of ways to qualify for a State pension.  The rate of payment under the State pension (contributory) scheme is related to contributions paid over the years into the Social Insurance Fund, and credited contributions where applicable.  As such, those with a stronger attachment to the workforce, who have paid more into that fund, are more likely to be paid at a higher rate under that scheme, than those with more intermittent contributions made during their working life. </p>  <p>  At present, entitlement to the contributory pension is determined by means of a &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; calculation, where the total contributions paid or credited are divided by the number of years of the working life.  The yearly average test has been in existence since 1961 when contributory pensions were first introduced.  Payment rates are banded.  For example, someone with a yearly average of 48 or more contributions will qualify for a full pension, whereas someone with a yearly average of 20-29 will qualify for a pension at the 85% rate. </p>  <p>  Where people cannot qualify for a full rate contributory pension as a result of an intermittent PRSI record, the social protection system provides alternative methods of supporting such people in old age.  For example, if their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension, which by default is paid directly to them.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State pension (non-contributory), amounting up to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate.</p>  <p>  The total contributions approach (TCA) is one of a number of planned reforms to the State pension set out in the National Pensions Framework (NPF) commissioned by the then Government and published in March 2010.  The aim of the TCA is to make the rate of contributory pension more closely match contributions made by a person.  Officials of my Department are currently working on the detailed development of the TCA with a view to making proposals for consideration later this year.  An important element in the final design of the scheme will be the position of people who have gaps in their contribution records for various reasons, and this factor is being considered very carefully in developing this reform.  Although TCA is expected to replace the yearly average approach for new pensioners from 2020, that date is subject to change as this is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative, and technical elements in its implementation.    </p>  <p>  It should be noted that there will be people for whom the new scheme will be more beneficial, and others for whom the older basis was to their advantage.  Therefore, if a cohort of pensioners is allowed choose the scheme which pays them at a higher rate, regardless of when they reached retirement age, this would inevitably result in a significant cost to the Exchequer, which would reduce the funds available for pensions generally.</p>  <p>  The forthcoming independent Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund will provide data that will allow my officials to accurately cost and project various options available under the TCA reform.  Following the analysis of that data, it is intended to have a public consultation, in mid-2017, and following this, proposals on the final details of the scheme, including the number of years contributions required for a full pension, will be made by the Government to the Oireachtas before the end of the year. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This focused on engaging with, and supporting, long term unemployed and young jobseekers on the Live Register on a pathway into employment.</p><p>The Pathways to Work action plan includes an action related to lone parents which is to carry out a value for money review of the Jobseeker's Transitional Payment.  This will now be incorporated into the Independent Review of the OFP reforms as set down in legislation. My Department is currently drafting the Request for Tender for this review.</p><p>While there are no further Pathways to Work actions that cover the activation of lone parents as a specific target group, I must highlight that all lone parents on a Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance (JA) or Jobseeker&rsquo;s Transitional Payment (JST) have access to activation supports. Lone parents on a One-Parent Family Payment (OFP) can avail of activation supports voluntarily if they so wish.</p><p>The activation of JST recipients has commenced. These customers are being  engaged with by Intreo Case Officers in a supportive way via a one to one meeting where they get assistance to develop a personal progression plan.  This plan can include education, training and employment supports. This approach is tailored to the needs of lone parents and the supports are available for up to seven years while they remain on JST.  Given that this targeted and extensive support already exists I have no plans to implement anything further at this time.</p><p>Of the current cohort of JST recipients (approximately 14,500) there are currently over 6,000 in an Activation phase i.e. they have already been selected for activation and have been case managed, are scheduled for an engagement or are awaiting an appointment time. </p><p>Over 3,000 have been fully case managed which means they have met with a Case Officer and have agreed a personal plan and are progressing with this plan.  Of these approximately 1,600 have moved into some form of education and training ranging from personal development, to childcare to third level education.  In total over 9,000 have been activated to date. </p><p>Former OFP recipients who moved to a JA Payment i.e. those with a youngest child 14 year of age or older, gain access to the Intreo supports via the standard activation process for jobseekers commencing with a group engagement with a Case Officer.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-01-24a.740.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017012400065#WRO01500"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 311, 315 and 320 together.</p><p>The supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme provides assistance to eligible people in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs and those of their dependants.  The main purpose of the scheme is to provide immediate and flexible assistance for those in need who do not qualify for payment under other State schemes.  Supports provided under the SWA scheme can consist of a basic primary weekly payment and/or a weekly/monthly supplement in respect of certain expenses, including rent, as well as single exceptional needs payments (ENPs) and urgent needs payments (UNPs).  The Government has provided some &euro;378 million for the SWA scheme in 2017 including &euro;85.4 million for basic SWA and &euro;31.5 million for ENPs &amp;amp; UNPs in 2017.</p><p>The SWA schemes are subject to a means test and are demand led. There has been a reduction in the numbers receiving support through the SWA schemes which can be attributed to the overall improvement in the economy, improvements in administration and policy changes in recent years.  Claim processing times have improved with the introduction of the Intreo centres and establishment of integrated decisions teams which has reduced recourse to basic SWA payments.  For example, decisions on jobseekers allowance and benefit applications are now processed almost immediately where all the supporting information is provided.  The following tabular statement provides details of the number of basic SWA recipients at year end for the past five years, 2012-2016.</p><p>The Department may make a single ENP to help meet essential, once-off and unforeseen expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income.  Although ENP expenditure has reduced in recent years, the scheme is demand led and continues to provide assistance to those with exceptional needs taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case in order to ensure that the payments target those most in need of assistance.  Provisional expenditure for 2016 is &euro;32 million, showing that expenditure under the scheme is stabilising in recent years in line with the improvement in the economy. </p><p>The ENP guidelines issued to staff in 2012 and 2013 have contributed to more streamlined and consistent approaches being taken to applications across the country.  The guidelines do not affect the statutory discretion available to officers administering the scheme in issuing an ENP to assist an individual or household in any particular hardship situation which may arise.  People who consider that they require an ENP should contact the local officials in the Community Welfare Service administering the scheme.</p><p>People claiming supports under the SWA scheme generally only interact with the Department on an occasional basis, for example, when seeking an exceptional needs payment or in claiming additional supports such as rent supplement.  The availability of the Community Welfare Service (CWS) during normal office hours is therefore sufficient for general day to day requirements. CWS services are delivered through Intreo Centres and some 180 clinics nationwide. </p><p>However, in response to emergency situations such as those caused by severe weather events, local management assesses the response required to ensure that supports are provided to those affected as swiftly as possible.  This may include provision of emergency or out of hours services and may be supplemented by facilitating clients with individual appointments and making house calls.</p><p>I trust that this clarifies the issues raised for the Deputy.</p><p><b>Basic Supplementary Welfare Allowance recipients 2012 to 2016</b><table><tr><th>Month</th><th>No. Penalty Rates Applied</th></tr><tr><td>Feb-16</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Mar-16</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Apr-16</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>May-16</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Jun-16</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Jul-16</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Aug-16</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Sep-16</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Oct-16</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Nov-16</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Dec-16</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>24</td></tr></table></p><p><b>Note:</b>Direct provision allowance recipients are included under Basic SWA until 2014.</p></reply>

Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth and the availability of productive employment for young people.  This strategy has been succeeding; by Q1 2016 the number of people in employment is up by over 200,000 from the lowest level reached in 2012.</p>  <p>  Youth unemployment is estimated at 14.5% (29,400 persons) in December 2016 and has fallen from a peak of 31.2% in July 2012.</p>  <p>  Policy on youth unemployment, framed in the context of the EU Recommendation on a Youth Guarantee, concentrates assistance to young people in finding and securing sustainable jobs.  In 2015 monthly engagement by case officers with all young unemployed was implemented.  For those who do not find employment, additional offers are provided for. Most such offers (over 70%) are in further education or training.  Others are in community-based employment programmes such as CE, Gateway and Tus, or through the JobsPlus employment subsidy for private employment.  Pathways to Work 2016-2020 continues to prioritise these measures for the young unemployed and additionally commits to: increasing the share of workplace-based interventions for youth unemployed; ensuring that monthly engagement, at a minimum, is consistently applied and maintained; restructuring the First Steps programme; and implementing the Defence Forces Skills for Life programme.</p>  <p>  Annual Government expenditure on relevant programmes was estimated, in the Youth Guarantee Implementation Plan, at approximately &euro;336 million.  A number of the programmes involved &ndash; for example First Steps and the youth element of the JobsPlus Incentive Scheme, are operated by the Department of Social Protection.</p>  <p>  This expenditure is supported in part by the EU through the Youth Employment Initiative (YEI) and European Social Fund (ESF).  The YEI is being delivered in Ireland as a dedicated priority axis within the ESF Operational Programme for Education, Inclusion and Learning (PEIL) 2014-2020, for which the Irish Managing Authority is the Department of Education and Skills.</p>  <p>  I am informed that the total amount allocated to YEI under PEIL is &euro;204,436,257.  This allocation is comprised of &euro;68,145,419 of specific EU funding for YEI, with matching amounts from Ireland&rsquo;s ESF allocation and from Exchequer funding.</p></reply>

Measures of unemployment from the QNHS are based on International Labour Office (ILO) definitions.  To be &lsquo;ILO unemployed&rsquo; a person must in the week before the survey be without work but available for work and have recently taken specific job-search steps.  The Live Register, which captures those registering for unemployment benefits (including those working part-time and in casual work who draw partial unemployment payments), is an administrative record.  It is not the official measure of unemployment, but can give indicative trends.  My Department uses both Live Register and QNHS data for reporting and monitoring trends and adjusting policies accordingly at national level. </p>  <p>  This includes providing data and trends broken down by age categories.  The QNHS data, being prepared as part of the EU-wide Labour Force Survey, also allow Irish trends to be compared with international developments.</p>  <p>  The Pathways to Work strategy, the key document setting out policy to facilitate the unemployed of all ages back into work, is underpinned by analyses of the labour market situation based on the statistical sources mentioned above.</p>  <p>  By allocating activation resources to persons on the Live Register, the government&rsquo;s policy tends automatically to focus on those areas and age-groups in which unemployment is most concentrated.  The focus on those most in need is further reinforced by the use of profiling to identify, among the newly unemployed, those most likely to face severe difficulties in re-entering employment.  People identified as having a low PEX (probability of exit from unemployment) score are prioritised for intensive engagement and support from the Intreo employment service.</p></reply>

Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension, all contributions paid or credited over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement.</p>  <p>  Since 1961, when contributory pensions were introduced, the average contributions test has been used in calculating the rate of pension entitlement.  Entitlement is banded, with the maximum rate payable to those with a yearly average of 48-52 contributions, and the minimum rate payable to those with a yearly average in the range of ten to 14 contributions per year.  Even if someone has only ten years (520 weeks) of paid reckonable contributions between their 16th and 66th birthdays, they would generally qualify for a State pension (contributory), although the rate payable would vary depending on their circumstances, and it will not always be their most advantageous payment to claim, particularly if they qualify for a full-rate State pension (non-contributory).</p>  <p>  The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme was introduced in 1994 to make qualification for State pension contributory (SPC) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age, or incapacitated people, to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being calculated for pension purposes.  The effect of this is to reduce the number of years by which the person&rsquo;s contributions are divided, thereby increasing their yearly average, making it easier for them to qualify for a maximum rate SPC. It does not involve the award of credits.</p>  <p>  My Department reviews these and other provisions on an ongoing basis and has estimated that the cost of extending the Homemakers scheme to allow people to avail of the full 20 years currently allowed under the scheme, encompassing periods prior to 1994, could cost &euro;290m in 2017.  This figure would increase in subsequent years.</p>  <p>  It is worth noting that the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund in 2012 confirmed that the Fund provides better value to female rather than male contributors.  This is due to the redistributive nature of the Fund.</p>  <p>  Where people who were unattached to the labour market during most of their adult lives cannot qualify for a contributory pension in their own right as they have paid few or no contributions, or cannot qualify for a full rate as a result of an intermittent PRSI record, the social protection system provides alternative methods of supporting such pensioners in old age.  Therefore, if their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension, which by default is paid directly to them.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State Pension (non-contributory), amounting up to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate. </p>  <p>  The marriage bar was abolished in 1973.  Where such employees were in the public service, they paid a reduced (or modified) rate of PRSI.  These contributions provided no cover for the State pension and, accordingly, the marriage bar would not have negatively impacted on their State pension entitlement, as they would, most likely, have had none if they had remained in the public service.  It may, however, have impacted upon their eventual entitlement to a Public Service pension which is a matter for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. </p>  <p>  The National Pensions Framework (2010) proposed that a &ldquo;Total Contribution Approach&rdquo; (TCA) should replace the yearly average approach, for new pensioners from 2020.  The aim of this approach is to make the rate of contributory pension more closely match contributions made by a person.  Officials of my Department are currently working on the detailed development of the TCA with a view to making proposals for consideration later in the year.  This is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative, and technical elements in its implementation.  An important element in the final design of the scheme will be the position of people who have gaps in their contribution records for various reasons, and this factor is being considered very carefully in developing this reform. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Overall, 58.8% of the 25,406 appeals which were finalised in 2015 had a favourable outcome for the appellant, i.e. were either allowed in full or in part, or resolved by way of a revised decision by a Deciding Officer/Designated Person.  59.2% of the 23,220 appeals finalised in 2016 had a favourable outcome for the appellant.</p><p>Of the 18,913 appeals which were finalised by Appeals Officers in 2015, 6,886 (36.4%) were determined following an oral hearing.  4,444 (64.5%) of these had a favourable outcome for the appellant.  Of the 16,990 appeals finalised by Appeals Officers in 2016, 6,527 (38.4%) were determined following an oral hearing.  4,251 (65.1%) of these had a favourable outcome for the appellant.</p><p>There are a number of reasons why a decision which was refused at first instance might be successful on appeal and it is not necessarily the case that the first decision was wrong. </p><p>Where new evidence is provided with an appeal, the original decision may be revised by the Deciding Officer or Designated Person.  This was the case in some 35% of favourable appeal outcomes in 2015 and some 37% of favourable appeal outcomes in 2016.  Where the decision is not revised in the Department in light of the appeal contentions, further evidence is often provided by the appellant as the appeal process proceeds.  In addition, the Appeals Officer may gain insights when they meet the appellant in person at oral hearing which may also influence the outcome of the appeal.</p><p>Social Welfare legislation provides that an Appeals Officer may determine an appeal without an oral hearing where s/he is of the opinion that it can be determined fairly on the basis of the documentary evidence provided.  In general, where there is a conflict in the documentary evidence presented, an Appeals Officer will convene an oral hearing in order to explore the evidence and seek to resolve any conflict.</p><p>In addition, where an appellant requests an oral hearing, the request is generally granted unless the Appeals Officer is of the opinion that the appeal can be allowed on a summary basis, or where there is clearly nothing to be gained by granting an oral hearing.  An example of this would be where the appeal question relates to PRSI contribution conditions or means and the underlying PRSI contribution figures or means are not disputed.</p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p><p><b>Appeal Receipts 2015 &ndash;

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-01-24a.757.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017012400065#WRO03200"><p>In the preparation of this year&rsquo;s Budget, I gave consideration to a number of approaches to improve the position of social welfare recipients generally and to make the social insurance system more comprehensive.  As part of this consideration, I took account of the views of members of the Oireachtas and a wide range of welfare representative groups including those relating to the reversal of measures which had to be introduced in order to stabilize the country&rsquo;s financial position.</p>  <p>  The last Budget was a prudent budget within the resources available. It was a Budget which looked forward, not backwards.  There were no giveaways.  My aim was to make sure that everyone benefits from the recovery - employed, self-employed, retired people, people with disabilities, carers, those who cannot work, urban, rural, young and old.</p>  <p>  More than 840,000 people will benefit from the first increase in weekly Social Welfare payments since 2009 and 650,000 from the &euro;5 increase in the State pension.  The Budget also set out to make work pay through reforms to the PRSI system, including a new deal for the self-employed and it includes a number of targeted measures to assist lone parents, farmers and school children. </p>  <p>  In addition, I was able to pay a Christmas Bonus at an increased rate of 85%.  The Bonus was one of the first items to be abolished at the start of the financial crisis and was now been restored on a progressive basis by the previous and current Governments.  It should be noted that the Bonus paid last December cost close to &euro;220 million.</p>  <p>  In addition to providing cash increases to all those in receipt of weekly welfare payments, I was also anxious to begin reforming the social insurance system.  Budget 2017 expands the new deal for up to 380,000 self-employed people who pay PRSI at the S class.  This includes people like farmers, professionals, taxi drivers and tradesmen who will have new benefits extended to them from next year. </p>  <p>  From March, Class S contributors will be able to avail of Treatment Benefit, which includes free eye and dental exams, and contributions towards the cost of hearings aids and contact lenses.  In addition, and more significantly, self-employed contributors will be eligible for the Invalidity Pension.  For the first time, this will give the self-employed access to the safety-net of State income supports if they have a serious illness or injury that prevents them from working without having to go through a means test.  This will be available from December 2017.</p>  <p>  These measures are all part of the Government&rsquo;s policy of making work pay and encouraging self-employment and entrepreneurship.</p>  <p>  There is also a package of measures supporting lone parents in the Budget, encouraging them into the workplace and into education, and helping to reduce their childcare costs.  All lone parents on One-Parent Family Payment and Jobseeker&rsquo;s Transition and Jobseekers Allowance will benefit from the &euro;5 increase in the weekly rates of payment.</p>  <p>  A new &euro;500 annual Cost of Education Allowance will be made available to Back to Education Allowance participants with children from the next academic year in September.  This will help parents, including lone parents, to return to education.</p>  <p>  The income disregards for the One Parent Family Payment and Jobseeker&rsquo;s Transition payment will rise by &euro;20, from &euro;90 to &euro;110 per week, reversing in part previous reductions, to encourage one parent families to stay in, and return to, work.  This will benefit lone parents earning more than &euro;90 per week. For those earning &euro;110 per week or more, it will increase the combined social welfare and earnings income by up to &euro;15 per week.</p>  <p>  The Single Affordable Childcare Scheme being provided by the Government will also significantly reduce the cost of childcare for lone parents and is a step change in state support for childcare in Ireland.</p>  <p>  The Budget focus on children is on the provision of services rather than on income supports.  Ireland already has the third highest child benefit in the western world.  Where we fall down is on the cost of education and child care and access to services like health and speech and language therapy.  So, this is where resources will be focused in future.  This includes the Childcare package that I just mentioned, the extension of medical cards to all recipients of Domiciliary Care Allowance and measures in Education, like more teachers and SNAs and better and new school buildings.</p>  <p>  For my Department, the main Budget provision for children is increased funding for school breakfasts.  This includes extending the School Breakfast programme to the new DEIS schools from next year.  Also, we are opening the free breakfast programme to non-DEIS schools.  Up to 35,000 children in non-DEIS schools will benefit from free breakfasts.  This is in recognition that the majority of disadvantaged children do not attend a DEIS school.  School breakfasts have been shown to increase attendance and improve concentration.</p>  <p>  There is also a special increase of an additional &euro;10 in payment for guardians who take care of orphans, or those children who cannot be cared for by their parents.</p>  <p>  As part of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to rural Ireland, I announced the total reversal of cuts to Farm Assist, a programme which helps more than 8,000 farm families.  At a time of falling farm incomes, it&rsquo;s essential that we strengthen the safety net for farmers who are on the margin.  And even for farmers who do not qualify for Farm Assist, they have the reassurance of a strong safety net should they need it.  The introduction of additional income disregards for farmers with children further ensures that farm families will benefit.</p>  <p>  I also introduced a number of other targeted improvements.  Looking ahead, our priority is that everyone in Irish society can, and will, benefit under this Government from the economic recovery.  This includes people who rely on welfare payments whether on a long or short term basis.  While I will continue to have regard to the impact of the measures introduced during the crisis, the best approach in future Budgets is not necessarily reversing all of individual measures introduced in past years.  This is the approach adopted by some in this House.  My approach was to ensure that the level of income support for all was improved while at the same time enhancing the social protection system through a wide range of targeted improvements.  I plan to continue this approach in future Budgets, as resources allow.</p></reply>

Prime Minister May has made clear that she wishes to secure the closest possible future economic relationship for Britain with the EU, a goal that Ireland shares.In her speech, Prime Minister May highlighted the specific and historic relationship between Britain and Ireland.  In this context, she made clear that her priorities include maintaining the Common Travel Area and avoiding a return to a hard border with Northern Ireland, both of which are welcome.  The alignment between our concerns regarding the economy and trade and the objective of the UK to have a close, and friction-free, economic and trading relationship with the EU, including with Ireland, is also very important.</p>  <p>  However, it is important to note that the negotiations on the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU have not yet begun.  The trading arrangements between the EU and UK, once the UK leaves the EU, will be the subject of negotiation.  For the Government&rsquo;s part, we have been very clear about our priorities for the upcoming negotiations: minimising impact on trade and the economy; protecting the Northern Ireland Peace Process; maintaining the Common Travel Area; and influencing the future of the European Union.</p>  <p>  A critical part of our work is ensuring that these priorities are heard and understood across Europe and are reflected in the EU&rsquo;s position for the forthcoming negotiations.  An extensive programme of engagement with all other EU Governments and the EU institutions is under way. To date, there has been over 60 engagements are either political or senior official level.</p>  <p>  This programme of engagement includes ongoing meetings with the European Commission&rsquo;s Task Force on Brexit.  These meetings are an opportunity to set out in detail Ireland&rsquo;s concerns and priorities.  Feedback to date from this comprehensive engagement has been very encouraging.

This was the first meeting of the FAC this year, and Ministers had a good exchange on the opportunities and challenges facing us in the short term, and how the EU can make an active and effective contribution to international peace and security, in particular in its own neighbourhood.  The Finish Foreign Minister also reported briefly on his recent visit to Turkey.  I came to Brussels directly from Paris where I participated in an important international conference on the Middle East Peace Process hosted by President Hollande.  The Conference sent a clear message that the international community believes that the only sustainable solution to the conflict is a negotiated two state solution.  Ministers had an informal exchange over lunch on the outcome of the Paris Conference.</p>  <p>  The FAC also addressed the situation in Syria in light of the recent cessation of hostilities, which was broadly welcomed by Foreign Ministers, and the upcoming talks in Astana.  The need for the EU to strengthen its diplomacy to revive the UN-led negotiations was discussed.  I fully support the efforts of the EU High Representative, Federica Mogherini, to build cooperation between the EU and the regional and international stakeholders on a way forward for Syria. Ireland and its EU partners reaffirmed our support for the central role of the United Nations in working for a political transition and peaceful settlement of the conflict in Syria.  The illegal denials of humanitarian access must end.</p>  <p>  I also had a useful discussion on the implications of Brexit with the Spanish Foreign Minister, Alfonso Dastis Quecedo, in the margins of the Council meeting.</p></reply>

I met in Belfast with the Secretary of State on 14 December, 12 January and 19 January.  We have also spoken by phone on a number of occasions. </p>  <p>  I had also spoken by phone to Martin McGuinness on 19 December (following the Assembly debate on the motion to exclude the then First Minister) and again immediately following his resignation as deputy First Minister on 9 January.  On 12 January, I met with the DUP leader Arlene Foster, and a Sinn F&eacute;in delegation led by Martin McGuinness.  This followed on from contacts earlier in the week by telephone with the leaders of the SDLP, UUP and Alliance Party.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach has of course also been actively engaged and was in direct contact with the British Prime Minister, as well as the leaders of both the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in.</p>  <p>  It was clear, immediately following the resignation of the deputy First Minister, that the prospect of a resolution ahead of the triggering of an Assembly election was slim.  However both Governments, in their capacity as co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement, made full use of the narrow window available to ensure that any avenues for resolution between the parties prior to an election were fully explored. </p>  <p>  In the event, an Assembly election has been triggered and it is important to emphasise that this eventuality is one covered by the legislation governing the devolved institutions in Northern Ireland.  When parties in an administration cannot agree, an election is the consequence and the outcome of that is now for the electorate in Northern Ireland to determine.</p>  <p>  The Secretary of State and I have agreed that both Governments should continue to work closely together in the weeks to come, looking ahead to the post-election period, when a new power-sharing Executive will need to be formed.  We have also urged the parties to approach the election campaign in calm and respectful terms, conscious that polarizing rhetoric and frayed relationships will damage the prospects of forming an Executive after the votes have been counted.</p>  <p>  We must all be mindful that effective devolved Government, underpinned by a genuine spirit of partnership, is what the people of Northern Ireland voted for in 1998 and what they expect their politicians to deliver.</p>  <p>  After the election, it will therefore fall to the parties to form a power-sharing Executive and this will require them to find a way forward on issues which contributed to the calling of the election.  The Government is of course always ready to support and assist the parties in any way we can.  Our commitment as a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement is a constant one &ndash; in good times and bad.</p>  <p>  The Government will continue to work with the British Government and the political parties to support the fulfilment of the full promise of that Agreement and to advance political stability, reconciliation and economic prosperity in Northern Ireland.</p></reply>

Some 70 countries and international organisations participated in the meeting, which was a follow up to the first conference held in Paris in June 2016, which I also attended.  This &ldquo;French Initiative&rdquo; was aimed at reigniting a stalled peace process, and reaffirming international support for the two state solution to the conflict between Israel and its Arab and Palestinian neighbours.  Contrary to intentions, the meeting did not include the parties themselves, as Israel refused to attend or to engage in any way with the French initiative.  This was regrettable and mistaken.  The conference adopted a Declaration which clearly expressed the view of the broad international community that the two state solution was the only way forward.  This followed on and reinforced the similar message in Security Council Resolution 2334, adopted in December, which I welcomed at the time. </p>  <p>  However, there was also great concern among all participants about threats to the viability of that solution, stemming principally from the settlement policy of the Israeli Government.  The Middle East Peace Process has been effectively stalled for three years, and there is no clear view on how to renew it.  Uncertainty about the direction which the new US Administration will take was, of course, one factor in that regard.</p>  <p>  The Paris Conference, and the initiative taken by France during 2016, can be said therefore to have been partially successful, particularly in maintaining an international focus on the issue at a time when other events in the Middle East have been dominating attention.  France is to be commended for initiating and persevering with this challenging work, despite the many and clearly anticipated difficulties inherent to it.  The wider ambition, of helping to restart the peace process, remains to be achieved, and is a task for the whole international community.  Ireland will continue be a strong and active voice in this priority policy area.  I will also ensure that the Middle East Peace Process remains on the agenda of the European Union.</p></reply>

The British Prime Minister has said that she intends to trigger Article 50 no later than the end of March this year.  An agreement between the EU and the UK on British withdrawal has to be concluded within two years.  Of course, separate negotiations on a future UK-EU relationship will also need to take place.  The greater clarity provided in the speech on 17 January by the British Prime Minister is welcome, as is her stated objective that once outside the EU, the UK wants to have a positive and constructive relationship with the EU, an objective we very much share.  The Government is very clear on Irish priorities: to protect our economic interests; to protect the Good Friday Agreement; to maintain the Common Travel Area with the UK; to ensure an invisible border; and to maintain the integrity and unity of the EU, which is itself a core national interest.</p>  <p>  Now that we have further detail on the type of future relationship with the EU that the UK will seek and as we approach the start of the Article 50 negotiations, the Government&rsquo;s detailed preparatory work, which began over two years ago and has steadily intensified since then, will increasingly focus on the negotiations themselves, as well as on the analysis of the impacts of Brexit.</p>  <p>  Given the cross-cutting nature of the EU-UK dossier, a number of Divisions within my Department are devoting a considerable share of their resources to the key issues.  They include the EU Division, which has a dedicated EU-UK Unit; the Ireland, United Kingdom and Americas Division; the Legal Division; and the Trade Division.  The overall Departmental effort is led and coordinated by the Secretary General and by the Department&rsquo;s Management Board, a sub-committee of which meets each week.</p>  <p>  With respect to the Article 50 negotiations, EU Division &ndash; re-established in the Department further to a Government decision in July of last year &ndash; is leading on preparations, within the framework of the whole-of-government approach to Brexit, which is led by the Department of the Taoiseach.</p>  <p>  There is daily contact with the Department of the Taoiseach and there is also close engagement with other Government Departments, many of whom have established &ldquo;Brexit&rdquo; teams.  In addition, there is also daily contact with our Permanent Representation in Brussels and regular interaction with our Embassies in all twenty-seven other EU Member States.  Our Embassies are in constant touch with the authorities in their countries of accreditation.  We also ensure that our missions world-wide are properly briefed on developments.  In addition, there is an intensive ongoing programme of detailed discussions with colleagues in other Member States and in the EU institutions, whether in Dublin, Brussels or in other capitals.</p>  <p>  Ireland will be part of the EU team of 27 Member States in the negotiations process, so therefore sensitizing EU partners and the EU institutions to Ireland&rsquo;s particular and unique circumstances is very important. It is of course also essential to understand the objectives and concerns of others.</p>  <p>  This work is led by the Taoiseach who engages regularly with other EU leaders, as I have done and continue to do with all twenty-seven of my Foreign Minister counterparts and as Minister of State Murphy is doing with his opposite numbers.</p>  <p>  Engagement with EU embassies in Dublin is also very important: to that end I will meet with EU Ambassadors on 20 January to share the Government views on Brexit and to set out our preparations for the Article 50 negotiations. </p>  <p>  As we move toward the negotiation phase, I remain confident that, given the extensive work which has been undertaken to date, Ireland will be prepared and ready to protect and defend the best interests of Ireland and Irish citizens.  </p></reply>

However, I increased the volume of meetings in the lead up to the UK referendum and since 23 June, I have chaired meetings of the Export Trade Council (ETC) on 20 July 2016 and on 18 October 2016.  I will be convening the first meeting of 2017 on 7 February.  The Export Trade Council was established in 2011 in order to strengthen cooperation and coordination across all Government Departments and State Agencies involved in the promotion of trade, tourism and inward investment.  It brings together senior Ministers with an economic focus, the heads of State Agencies, and members drawn from the private sector, including IBEC, the Irish Exporters Association, and a number of business people with expertise in specific sectors.  As such it constitutes a unique and invaluable forum for thorough and wide reaching discussions on the opportunities and challenges facing companies exporting from Ireland.  These exchanges are all the more vital in light of current challenges and complexities in the global trading environment and developments in our relationship with key trading partners, notably the UK in the context of Brexit.</p><p>Indeed, the meeting on 20 July last year was convened in the wake of the British referendum decision to leave the European Union.  We had a very productive and substantive discussion which helped identify challenges and opportunities in shaping a whole-of-government response.  The meeting also reaffirmed market diversification and intensification as a key priority and mitigating strategy, helping to strengthen the resilience of our economy.</p><p>In keeping with this important goal the ETC meeting on 18 October had a particular focus on the Asia Pacific region and the opportunities for expanding and deepening market penetration in this crucial region for Irish exporters. Ireland&rsquo;s Ambassadors in Beijing and Tokyo attended the meeting to convey the unique insights of their respective Local Market Teams on this key topic.  The discussions took place in the context of the development of cross-sectoral whole of Government Strategies for the Asia-Pacific and Americas region, as set out in the Programme for Partnership Government, and the development of a new over-arching Trade, Tourism and Investment Strategy.</p><p>The development of the new Trade, Tourism and Investment Strategy, <i>Trading Better</i>, is well under way.  It is being led jointly by my Department and the Department for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  As part of this process, a stakeholder consultation has just been completed and its results are being assessed and inputted into the strategy.</p><p>The upcoming meeting of the ETC on 7 February will be an opportunity to update on this ongoing work and to review developments of importance in the international trading environment, including Brexit and trade related goals of the incoming U.S. administration.</p></reply>

I issued a statement on 11 December, in which I expressed, on behalf of Ireland, my utter condemnation of the appalling attack and extended my condolences to the families of all those affected by this horrific event.  Our Embassy in Ankara joined with other EU representatives in Turkey in a statement which unequivocally condemned this despicable act of terrorism.</p>  <p>  In addition to this heinous attack, Turkey has endured several other terrorist attacks over the past this year carried out predominantly by ISIS or the PKK and its affiliates.  Over the course of 2016, more than 600 people lost their lives in some 20 terrorist attacks.  Turkey has already suffered three terrorist attacks since the beginning of this year.  I issued a statement after the deplorable mass shooting at the Reina nightclub in Istanbul in the early hours of New Year&rsquo;s Day, in which 39 were brutally murdered.  Only a few days later, on 5 January, a car bomb exploded at a checkpoint in Izmir, killing two people and on 16 January, at least four policemen lost their lives in a bomb attack on a police vehicle in Diyarbakir, south-east Turkey. </p>  <p>  I utterly reject terrorism in all its forms. Ireland, along with our European partners, stands in solidarity with Turkey in the fight against terrorism.</p>  <p>  I remain deeply concerned about the overall situation in Turkey in respect of human rights, democracy, rule of law and freedom of expression which are all issues of concern particularly in the aftermath of the attempted coup in July 2016 and the extended state of emergency, which is still in place.  The concerns of the EU, which are fully shared by Ireland, were set out in a detailed statement on 8 November last. Unfortunately, these concerns remain current and are still valid. </p></reply>

The constitutional reform package was not discussed.  </p>  <p>  The issue of constitutional reform has been on the agenda of President Erdogan and the AKP party for a considerable time.  Last Friday the Turkish parliament approved a comprehensive package of constitutional amendments proposed by the President.  Among the proposals are provisions for an increase in the number of MPs from 550 to 600, a lowering of the minimum age to sit in Parliament to 18 from 25, holding parliamentary and presidential elections concurrently every five years, and a considerable expansion of the executive powers of the President.  The next step is a referendum on the complete package which, although no date is yet confirmed, is expected to take place in April.  </p>  <p>  Given the concerns at EU level and internationally about democracy and the rule of law in Turkey, and given the removal of parliamentary immunity from some 130 democratically elected representatives last May and the subsequent arrest of opposition MPs in November, there are serious considerations about the substance, timing and context of the constitutional proposals.</p>  <p>  The Council of Europe, through the Venice Commission, is studying the constitutional package and is scheduled to report on its findings on 10 March.  This assessment will be important in informing the position that the EU and Ireland take on the proposed reforms.</p></reply>

They were a cause for serious concern and were rightly condemned by the United Nations Security Council.  </p>  <p>  Therefore, I welcome the developments in the Gambia over recent days.  I am pleased that the former President has now accepted the election results and left the country, allowing for a peaceful transfer of power.  This positive outcome is a testament to the value of political dialogue and an indication of the important role played by regional organisations in the peaceful resolution of political crises. </p>  <p>  I wish to commend, in particular, the determination of West Africa&rsquo;s political leaders to persuade former President Jammeh to step down and respect the democratic will of the Gambian people.  It is another important step forward for West Africa&rsquo;s democracies, where the peaceful handover of power is increasingly the norm.  I also wish to commend the actions of the Gambian people whose patience and peaceful political engagement contributed in no small measure to the former President&rsquo;s decision to leave the country.</p>  <p>  I join with EU High Representative/Vice-President Frederica Mogherini in wishing President Barrow every success in his new role.  Ireland stands ready to work with the European Union in supporting the new administration in the Gambia, in line with the principles of human rights, democracy and the rule of law, as well as those of sustainable and inclusive development.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-01-24a.799.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017012400066#WRP01400"><p>I have written to Secretary General Guterres congratulating him on his appointment, and I look forward to meeting with him.  I believe that his considerable national and international political experience and his familiarity with the work of the UN leave him well placed to address the challenges that face the organisation.  Ireland welcomes the more transparent and open selection process which led to Mr Guterres&rsquo; appointment, and looks forward to working with him on our shared goals, including on UN reform.  </p>  <p>  In the seven decades since its foundation, the UN has been at the heart of significant global progress on a range of issues of importance to Ireland, including sustainable development, human rights, disarmament and conflict resolution.  Ireland is convinced that the principle of multilateralism upon which the UN is founded, offers the best approach to tackle the complex and interconnected issues facing the world.  However, we recognise that in addition to the UN&rsquo;s many successes and achievements, there have also been failures.  The ongoing crises in the Middle East and Africa illustrate clearly the urgent need for the UN to develop the capacity to respond more effectively to conflict.  </p>  <p>  Ireland welcomes Mr. Guterres&rsquo; identification of conflict prevention and the pursuit of sustainable peace as a core priority for his term in office.  In our statement to the Security Council on 10 January, Ireland underlined our support for this approach.  I believe there is a responsibility for the UN to focus more directly on the reason for its foundation &ndash; to prevent war, rather than to react to it once it has been waged.  I look forward to discussing this subject with Mr. Guterres.  </p>  <p>  This prioritisation reflects the urgent need to respond to the causes of conflict which are at the root of the migration and humanitarian crises facing the world today, and is in line with Ireland&rsquo;s approach to peace and security in our own foreign policy.  We agree that the implementation of the recommendations of the three high-level reviews of the UN&rsquo;s response to situations of conflict will serve as a useful first step in this regard.  Ireland engaged fully with the reviews on (1) UN Peace Operations, (2) Peacebuilding Architecture and (3) Women, Peace and Security, and has called for the implementation of their recommendations as part of our advocacy for UN reform. </p>  <p>  Ireland will also continue to advocate for reform of the UN Security Council.  We believe that the UN Security Council must become more representative, more transparent and more efficient to ensure that the UN can respond appropriately to situations of conflict and mass atrocity.  The blockages and inaction of the Council in recent years have greatly damaged its credibility and have resulted in disastrous consequences for people living in conflict zones.  As a member of the Accountability, Coherence and Transparency (ACT) group of states, Ireland advocates for reforms to the membership and working methods of the Security Council, including the use of the veto.  We will continue to use this and other available fora to call for reform.  </p>  <p>  Ireland also welcomes Mr. Guterres&rsquo; commitment to the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).  Adopted in 2015, these ambitious goals have the potential to transform our world by 2030.  Their comprehensive and interconnected nature mean that the UN institutions and Member States will need to work in a more coordinated and collaborative manner than ever before in order to achieve success.  Reform of UN structures and ways of working will be required. </p>  <p>  The nature of much of the UN&rsquo;s working environment, often in places of crises, armed conflict and underdevelopment, means that it faces challenges which most organisations do not have to face.  In order to ensure that the UN addresses these challenges, the UN needs to be in a position to plan and respond as effectively as possible.  In this respect, effective management of its financial and human resources is crucial.  Ireland will support the new Secretary-General in his efforts to improve delivery and accountability both at UN Headquarters and in the field, including in peacekeeping operations. </p></reply>

Subject to the successful completion of statutory procedures, a decision can then be made regarding progression to the construction stage, which remains programmed for late 2017.

As agreed at the meeting of the EU 27 Heads of State or Government at their meeting on 15 December, Mr. Barnier be the EU&rsquo;s chief negotiator with the UK once the British Government has triggered Article 50, which the British Prime Minister has confirmed will be no later than the end of March.  </p>  <p>  In the negotiations, the Commission and Mr. Barnier will be mandated by the Council, under the political guidance of the European Council.  </p>  <p>  Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union provides the legal framework for withdrawal by a Member State.  As set out in the Article and as stated by Michel Barnier during his press conference on 6 December, an agreement between the EU and the UK on British withdrawal has to be concluded within two years of the triggering of Article 50 unless there is a unanimous decision by the European Council to extend this period.  This timeframe includes both the negotiations themselves and the approval processes for the agreed outcome on both the EU and UK sides.  This includes the need for the European Parliament to give its consent to the withdrawal agreement. In terms of the UK, Prime Minister May confirmed in her speech on 17 February that she will seek the approval of the UK Parliament for the agreement.  The time to complete these procedures must be built into the two year period. </p>  <p>  The exit agreement has to take account of the framework for future relations between the EU and UK.  This broader issue should therefore be discussed in the same timeframe and it is to be hoped that a joint understanding will be reached.  However, formal negotiations on a future EU-UK agreement or agreements can only begin after the UK has left the EU.  Given Prime Minister May&rsquo;s recent statement, these negotiations are likely to be complex and multifaceted and may well last a period of several years.  Ratification by all Member States and the European Parliament is also most likely to be required.</p>  <p>  Consideration will also need to be given in due course to the need for a transition period between both agreements, which would also need to be negotiated and agreed by both sides. </p>  <p>  Regarding Michel Barnier&rsquo;s wider comments last month, I welcome his clear statement that Irish issues will be a priority in the forthcoming Brexit negotiations.  </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s engagement with Mr. Barnier and his Taskforce at political and official levels has been and continues to be very constructive.  Dublin was one of the first capitals visited by Mr. Barnier in his Brexit role.  During his visit on 12 October last, in addition to my own bilateral meeting with him, he had very positive discussions with the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste, and the Minister of State for European Affairs. </p>  <p>  For my own part I had an excellent exchange with Mr. Barnier; he is well-known to us in Ireland, has a strong appreciation of our close historical, political and economic ties with the UK, and also knows of our strong commitment to EU membership.  During our discussions, I took the opportunity to emphasise Ireland's unique set of priorities with regard to Brexit, and the many complex issues relating to Northern Ireland, the Common Travel Area and the depth of our economic and trade relationship with the UK.</p>  <p>  Mr. Barnier will have a critically important role to play in the forthcoming negotiations.  At political and official levels we will continue to work closely with the Commission team as we address the particular challenges ahead.</p></reply>

Effective devolved Government, underpinned by a genuine spirit of partnership, is what the people of Northern Ireland voted for in 1998 and what they expect their politicians to deliver and the Government will work with all parties in support of this in the post-election period.  </p><p>In the fourteen months since the Fresh Start Agreement was signed there has been sustained progress with implementation, with each administration actively pursuing the necessary work to fulfil the respective commitments.</p><p>Progress on implementing the provisions of both the Fresh Start and Stormont House Agreements are considered at periodic review meetings.  These are co-convened by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and I, who attend them along with the First and deputy First Ministers and, where relevant to her portfolio, the Northern Ireland Minister for Justice.  These review meetings are important in providing political direction and momentum for the full implementation of the Agreements. The last review meeting was held in Belfast on 14 December 2016.</p><p>The Fresh Start Agreement provided for the establishment of the Joint Agency Task Force on cross-border crime.  That Task Force was launched in Dublin in December 2015, and has quickly become fully operational and is progressing its work to tackle cross-jurisdictional organised crime and bring to justice those involved in it.  The Task Force builds on existing operational arrangements to tackle organised crime, including that linked to paramilitarism, on a cross-border basis.  The Task Force reports on its work to the two Justice Ministers within the framework of their regular meetings under the Inter-Governmental Agreement on Criminal Justice Co-operation, as provided for in the Fresh Start Agreement.</p><p>The Government is also meeting its commitments as regards infrastructure projects<font color="#004080"> </font>under the Fresh Start Agreement.  This includes a contribution of &euro;25 million from the Irish Government in 2019 for the upgrading of the A5 Western Transport Corridor road project, which is in addition to the &euro;50 million previously committed.  The Government&rsquo;s committed funding of &euro;2.5 million to the North West Development Fund has been provided and is to be matched by the NI Executive.  Discussions are continuing at senior official level with the Northern Ireland Executive regarding co-operation on other infrastructure projects, including the Narrow Water Bridge project and the Ulster Canal and exploring financing options for future border infrastructure projects.</p><p>A key element of the Fresh Start Agreement relates to the ending of the legacy of paramilitarism and there was substantive progress on this front in the second half of 2016.</p><p>Following on from a report by an Expert Panel, the Northern Ireland Executive published its Action Plan on Tackling Paramilitary Activity, Criminality and Organised Crime in July. On 13 September, I signed an international agreement with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland to establish the Independent Reporting Commission (IRC).  The IRC will report annually on progress towards ending continuing paramilitary activity connected with Northern Ireland.  These reports will inform future Northern Ireland Executive Programme for Government commitments through to 2021.  The Government will shortly bring forward legislative proposals before the Oireachtas to establish the IRC in law, with the aim of getting the IRC legally established as soon as possible.</p><p>Following the December review meeting, both Governments and the Northern Ireland Executive announced the appointees to the Independent Reporting Commission.  These Commissioners bring a wealth of experience and a broad range of skills.  The Government has appointed Mr. Tim O&rsquo;Connor a former Secretary General to the President and former senior official of my Department , with considerable experience of the peace process. </p><p>The Northern Ireland Executive and the British Government have also proceeded with implementation of their respective commitments under the Fresh Start Agreement.  The Executive signed off on the 2016-17 Budget last December and the Welfare Bill implementing the relevant provisions in the Agreement passed into UK law on 25 November 2015.  The UK Treasury has also approved the release of monies from the Stormont House Agreement funding to support integrated education. </p><p>The institutional reforms provided for under the Fresh Start Agreement have also been implemented, including the reduction in the number of Executive Ministries from 12 to 9 and the option for parties entitled to a place in the Executive to instead designate as part of the formal opposition in the Assembly.</p><p>In June, the Co-Chairs and members of the Flags, Identity, Culture and Tradition Commission were appointed by the Northern Ireland Executive and the Commission is now progressing its work, as foreseen in the Stormont House Agreement and reiterated in Fresh Start. </p><p>On 6 December, the then First and deputy First Minister announced the formation of a civic advisory panel, which was provided for under the Stormont House and Fresh Start Agreements.

This commitment is reflected in the Programme for a Partnership Government, which makes specific reference to pursuing the issue of the Dublin Monaghan bombings.  </p>  <p>  The All-Party motion on the 1974 Dublin Monaghan bombings adopted in this House on 25 May last year has, like those adopted in 2008 and 2011, been conveyed to the British Government.  These motions call on the British Government to allow access by an independent, international judicial figure to all original documents relating to the bombings.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to actively pursuing the implementation of these all-Party D&aacute;il motions, and has consistently raised the issue with the British Government.  The Taoiseach has raised the issue with Prime Minister May, emphasising the Government&rsquo;s continued support for the D&aacute;il motions.  I have also raised the matter on a number of occasions with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, James Brokenshire, most recently at our meeting in Belfast on 19 January.</p>  <p>  In our discussions, I have advised Secretary of State Brokenshire that the D&aacute;il motions represent the consensus political view in Ireland that an independent, international judicial review of all the relevant documents is required to establish the full facts of the Dublin Monaghan atrocities.  I have also underlined to the Secretary of State that the absence of a response from the British Government is of deep concern to the Government and indeed this House, and emphasised the urgent need for a response from the British Government.</p>  <p>  Secretary of State Brokenshire has acknowledged the importance that the Government and D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann attach to this case, but indicated that the British Government is still considering how it could respond in a way which would adequately address the motions and be consistent with its obligations.</p>  <p>  The Government will continue to pursue this matter with the British Government, urging them to provide a satisfactory response to the motions that have been adopted by this House.  </p>  <p>  There are many families throughout these islands and beyond who continue to deal not only with the awful pain of losing a loved one, but also with the struggle for answers decades after these traumatic events.  Accordingly, the establishment of a new comprehensive framework for dealing with the past, as envisaged in the Stormont House Agreement, is a priority for the Government.</p>  <p>  I am continuing to engage with the Secretary of State and with the Northern Ireland parties to ensure the Executive is up and running as soon as possible after the upcoming Assembly elections, so that a way can be found to achieve a final agreement on legacy issues at political level.  There has been positive work and discussions ongoing over the last number of months.  There remain a number of outstanding issues, but there is an urgent need to achieve progress, so that the institutions can be established and start working to meet the needs of victims and survivors and support broader societal healing and reconciliation.  The Government will continue its engagement to achieve the establishment of these legacy institutions at the earliest possible opportunity following the Assembly election.</p></reply>

In recent weeks, both the Taoiseach and I had intensified contacts with the parties and the British Government on the political difficulties that were threatening the continuation of the Executive.</p><p>Following the resignation of the deputy First Minister on 9 January, it was clear that the prospect of a resolution ahead of the triggering of an Assembly election was slim.  However both Governments, in their capacity as co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement, made full use of the narrow window available to encourage that any avenues for resolution between the parties prior to an election be fully explored. </p><p>In the event, an Assembly election has been triggered and will be held on Thursday 2 March.  It is important to emphasise that this eventuality is one covered by the legislation governing the devolved institutions in Northern Ireland.  When parties in an administration cannot agree, an election is the consequence and the outcome of that is now for the electorate in Northern Ireland to determine. </p><p>In my discussions with each of the party leaders in Northern Ireland, I have urged all parties in the election to be measured and responsible in their rhetoric so that the political institutions of the Agreement will not be damaged in the longer-term.  I will continue to underline this imperative in the weeks ahead.</p><p>Effective devolved Government, underpinned by a genuine spirit of partnership, is what the people of Northern Ireland voted for in 1998 and what they expect their politicians to deliver.  After the election, it will therefore fall to the parties to form a power-sharing Executive and this will require the parties to find a way forward on issues which contributed to the calling of the election.  In this regard, it is of the utmost importance that all parties bear in mind the principles of mutual respect, partnership and equality, which underpin the Good Friday Agreement.<font color="#004080"> </font>The Government is of course always ready to support and assist the parties in any way we can. Our commitment as a co-guarantor of the Agreement is a constant one &ndash; in good times and bad.</p><p>A number of elements of the Good Friday Agreement and St Andrews Agreement have not yet been fully implemented.  The Government&rsquo;s firm position is that the Good Friday Agreement and the successor Agreements must be implemented in full, and this is reflected in the Programme for a Partnership Government.  The Agreements, and the principles and values underpinning them, are at the core of the Government&rsquo;s approach to peace, reconciliation and prosperity on this island.  </p><p>Several of the outstanding provisions are specifically referenced in the 2014 Stormont House Agreement including provisions on the Irish language, the obligation to promote a culture of tolerance, mutual respect and mutual understanding at every level of society and new priorities for North South cooperation.  The Stormont House Agreement provide<font color="#004080">s</font>for regular review meetings with the participation of the Government, the British Government and the Executive party leaders. </p><p>At the last two Review Meetings &ndash; most recently in December &ndash; I had the opportunity to draw attention to these outstanding commitments, which go to the heart of the Good Friday Agreement, so that they remain on the political agenda.</p><p>The Government views as a solemn responsibility our role and mandate as co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement.  We have been unstinting in our efforts to uphold the principles of the Agreement and to advance the full implementation of all provisions.  </p><p><font color="#004080">T</font>he Government will continue to work with the British Government and the political parties to fulfil the full promise of the Good Friday Agreement and to advance political stability, reconciliation and economic prosperity in Northern Ireland.</p></reply>

Our policy for international development, &ldquo;One World, One Future&rdquo;, clearly articulates our commitment to the UN target of providing 0.7% of Gross National Product (GNP) in Official Development Assistance (ODA) as economic conditions allow.  </p>  <p>  In the Programme for Government we have set out our ambition to make progress towards the UN target as resources permit.  It is important this progress is made in a sustainable and manageable way, which continues to strengthen Ireland's recognised role as a reliable and effective partner in providing development assistance.   </p>  <p>  Since 2011 we have made annual contributions in excess of &euro;600 million and have cumulatively allocated over of &euro;4.5 billion in the period 2011 to 2017.  This represents a remarkable commitment of public funds towards development and humanitarian assistance for some of the most vulnerable people in the world. </p>  <p>  I am pleased that we have been in a position to begin to increase funding for ODA, allocation an additional &euro;40 million for 2016 and a further &euro;10 million for 2017.  The total 2017 allocation for ODA will be &euro;651 million.  </p>  <p>  Based on current Department of Finance forecasts for GNP we anticipate the ODA/GNP percentage outturn for 2016 to be in region of 0.3% with a similar level projected for 2017.  The reduction in the percentage has been affected by the step change in the measurement of Ireland&rsquo;s GNP.  </p>  <p>  I can reaffirm our commitment to making incremental, sustainable progress towards achieving the 0.7% UN target by 2030, over the period of the Sustainable Development Goals.  While budget allocations are ultimately a matter for Government, I want to assure the Deputy that I, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, will continue to make the strongest possible case for increasing annual allocations to ODA over the lifetime of this Government. </p></reply>

Ireland will pay an active role in these negotiations.  It is our view that the negotiations will provide a solid basis for much needed progress on nuclear disarmament.  The negotiations will be open to all States, to civil society partners and to international organisations to ensure the broadest possible level of agreement and Ireland is encouraging widespread participation.  </p>  <p>  The Conference has come about as a result of a UN Resolution brought forward by Ireland, together with our partners Austria, Brazil, Mexico, Nigeria and South Africa.  This was adopted at the UN General Assembly in October with 123 states voting in its favour and will mark the first nuclear disarmament multilateral negotiations in over 20 years.  </p>  <p>  Nuclear disarmament is a long-standing priority for Irish foreign policy.  We remain resolute in our commitment to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), the cornerstone of non-proliferation architecture.  The Resolution makes clear that the planned negotiations will be a part of a process towards the total elimination of nuclear weapons.  It also underlines that any new legal instrument that comes about from the negotiations will reinforce the NPT, not weaken it.  Ireland will continue to assert this in all future engagement and negotiations as we maintain our historic commitment to nuclear disarmament.</p></reply>

At that meeting, Ministers adopted conclusions in which they stated their commitment to strengthening the Union&rsquo;s ability to act as a security provider and to enhance its capacity, through the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP), to foster human security, tackle the root causes of conflict and thus resolve crises outside the EU&rsquo;s borders. </p>  <p>  Ireland is a strong supporter of initiatives, through the CSDP, which improve the capacity of the Union to contribute to international peace and security and in support of the UN.  We support cooperation with international partners where this adds value and contributes to the achievement of these objectives.  </p>  <p>  In this context, the EU&rsquo;s Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP), and cooperation with other organisations in this area, is grounded within the EU Treaties and the Lisbon Protocol which protects Ireland&rsquo;s traditional policy of military neutrality. The Council Conclusions expressly stipulated that the specific character of the security and defence policy of all EU Member States will be fully respected in the implementation of the Global Strategy.</p></reply>

Many other countries have negotiated, or are in the process of negotiating, bilateral agreements with Saudi Arabia to lower visa costs.  I consider it important that Irish citizens would also benefit from reduced visa fees, and so my Department is currently exploring the possibility of negotiating a bilateral agreement to this effect.  This will require consultation with other Government Departments, in particular that of my colleague the Minister for Justice and Equality, Frances Fitzgerald TD.</p>  <p>  Facilitating travel between Ireland and Saudi Arabia is imperative if Irish companies are to benefit from the potential of the Saudi market.  It is one of my Department&rsquo;s goals to advance Ireland&rsquo;s prosperity by promoting Irish economic interests internationally, and our economic relationship with Saudi Arabia presents many opportunities in this regard.  </p>  <p>  Ireland has strong economic ties with Saudi Arabia, a designated priority market for Ireland under the Government&rsquo;s Trade, Tourism and Investment Strategy, and is our most significant trading partner in the Middle East.  Bilateral trade was worth almost &euro;2 billion in 2015, and the balance of this trade is overwhelmingly in Ireland&rsquo;s favour.  It is therefore an economic relationship with considerable benefit for the Irish economy and Irish jobs.  In November, I led a trade mission to the Gulf, accompanied by 36 Irish companies and Enterprise Ireland.  I saw first-hand the interest that Irish businesses have in Saudi Arabia.  </p>  <p>  However, the economic partnership that we have with Saudi Arabia does not prevent us from raising human rights and other issues, through the appropriate channels.  In addition to trade-specific events, I had meetings with Saudi Government Ministers on my November trip, including the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Nizar Madani.  While the detail of this meeting is confidential, I can confirm that I raised human rights issues with Minister Madani.  We also discussed the conflict in Yemen, and I can confirm that I expressed Ireland&rsquo;s concern about the appalling humanitarian situation resulting from the conflict, and about attacks on civilian infrastructures.  </p>  <p>  I have made my position on the war in Yemen very clear in this House.  I unreservedly condemn all deliberate targeting of civilians, and I urge all parties to the Yemen conflict to respect International Humanitarian Law and International Human Rights Law.  Whether war crimes have been committed is a legal question to be decided by the courts.  I have also been consistent in supporting calls for an international investigation into allegations of violations of International Humanitarian Law and the Law of War in Yemen, most recently at the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva last September.  </p>  <p>  Ireland has a multifaceted relationship with Saudi Arabia, and the different elements of our engagement are not mutually exclusive.  Our economic relationship benefits Ireland&rsquo;s economy and trade, and I will continue to negotiate bilateral agreements to progress this.  I am equally committed to promoting our diplomatic relationship, in order to facilitate our continued engagement with the Kingdom on human rights and on other matters.   </p></reply>

I also raised it when I spoke to Speaker Paul Ryan by telephone on 23 November 2016. </p>  <p>  The Government has also availed of every opportunity to sensitise the new Administration to our concerns and interests regarding immigration reform, and the plight of the undocumented Irish in particular.  The Taoiseach raised the matter in his separate telephone conversations with then President-elect Trump and Vice-President-elect Pence in the days following the Presidential election. The issue will also feature high on the agenda for my planned visit to Washington DC in early February.

The debate provided a valuable opportunity to re-state the Government&rsquo;s commitment to Ireland&rsquo;s longstanding policy of military neutrality.</p>  <p>  As I said at the time, I am satisfied that Ireland&rsquo;s longstanding policy of military neutrality is safeguarded through existing Constitutional provisions, through the Protocol to the Lisbon Treaty, the Defence Acts, and the long-term policy strategies adopted by Government.  </p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s statement of foreign policy, The Global Island, approved by Government in January 2015, states clearly that, &ldquo;Our policy of military neutrality remains a core element of Irish foreign policy&rdquo;.  This was further reinforced in the ten year strategy on defence policy set out in the White Paper on Defence.</p>  <p>  These policy settings have been developed in the context of a robust constitutional and legal framework.  </p>  <p>  Article 29 of the Constitution commits the State to uphold &ldquo;the ideal of peace and friendly co-operation amongst nations&rdquo; and to   &ldquo;the principle of the pacific settlement of international disputes.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  The &lsquo;Triple Lock&rsquo; arrangement, which governs the deployment of Irish Defence Forces overseas, is set out in the Defence Acts and provides that: the deployment for overseas peace support operations may only be made if that operation is mandated by the United Nations; deployment must also be approved by the Government; and, if it is proposed to deploy more than 12 personnel, a D&aacute;il Resolution must also be approved.  </p>  <p>  The Lisbon Treaty includes a legally binding Protocol which recognises Ireland&rsquo;s traditional policy of military neutrality.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to the policy of military neutrality is complemented by a strong commitment to the United Nations and its work around the world.  Irish troops participate in peacekeeping and, where necessary, peace enforcement.  Our Defence Force personnel have a well-deserved, high reputation internationally for their contribution in this area which extends, unbroken, over more than fifty years.  </p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s engagement in international security cooperation is aimed at ensuring public safety and is conducted with full respect for Irish sovereign decision-making authority and for Ireland&rsquo;s long standing policy of military neutrality.</p></reply>

For information on the wider Public Service I would direct the Deputy to the respective Ministers with responsibility for the other sectors of the Public Sector. My Department does not hold personal information of Civil Servants to the level of detail requested by the Deputy in relation to marital status and children.</p><p>There are two separate Spouses' and Children's Pension Schemes for the Civil Service, one for Established Staff and one for Non-Established Staff.  Within each Scheme there are two further categories (i) the Original Scheme and (ii) the Revised Scheme.  For Established Staff the Original Scheme was introduced for male staff in 1968 and for female staff in 1981, and the Revised Scheme was introduced for all staff in 1984.  For Non-Established Staff the Original Scheme was introduced for male staff in 1978 and the Revised Scheme was introduced in 1986, at which time membership was extended to female staff.  </p><p>When the Original Scheme was introduced, all eligible staff serving at the time of its introduction were given an option to join.  When the Revised Scheme was introduced it replaced the Original Scheme and applied automatically to all people recruited after its introduction.  Again, all eligible staff serving at the time of the introduction of the Revised Scheme were given an option to join (regardless of whether they had been members of the Original Scheme).  Therefore, depending on the date of appointment, and depending also on any membership options the employee may have exercised in the past, an employee may be a member of the Original or the Revised Scheme or of neither.  </p><p>The main differences between the Original and the Revised Schemes are that the Revised Scheme covers marriages after retirement (the Original Scheme did not) and a broader category of eligible children. Where a member was unmarried at the time of retirement, the Original Scheme provided for a refund of some or all the contributions paid by that member. </p><p>It is generally not possible to determine that a person will never benefit from the revised spouses' and children's pension scheme as it provides cover for marriages and civil partnerships after retirement. Furthermore, children conceived after retirement, children born outside of marriage, step-children where the marriage took place after retirement and children adopted after retirement are all covered under the revised scheme. </p><p>Civil Service spouses' and children's schemes are structured on a group insurance basis and the member contribution rates take account of the fact that payment of benefits will not arise in respect of all members. I have no plans to review these arrangements</p><p>Records maintained by my Department indicate that there were just over 37,500 employees in the civil service at the end of Q3 2016.  The detail sought by the deputy with regard to recipients of payments from the spouses' and children's scheme for the civil service is shown in the following table.

The cost of these changes is estimated at about &euro;90 million on a full-year basis from 2018.</p>  <p>  As we move beyond FEMPI and PSPR restoration towards more normal pay and pension setting conditions in the public service, the issue of how to adjust the post-award value of public service pensions through appropriate pay or other linkages will be considered by Government. </p></reply>

The basic principle is that competitive tendering should be used other than in justifiably exceptional circumstances.  Even in the case of procurement which might not be subject to the full scope of EU Directives, the EU Commission and European Court of Justice have ruled that EU Treaty principles must be observed.  The essential Treaty principles include non discrimination, equal treatment, transparency, mutual recognition, proportionality, freedom to provide service and freedom of establishment.  There is also a requirement to publicise contracts of significant value to a degree which allows parties in other Member States the opportunity to express an interest or to submit tenders.</p>  <p>  Individual contracting authorities are responsible for establishing arrangements for ensuring the proper conduct of their affairs, including conformance to standards of good governance and accountability with regard to procurement.  Contracting Authorities cannot favour or discriminate against particular candidates and there are legal remedies which may be used against any public body infringing these rules.  It is the responsibility of contracting authorities to satisfy themselves that the requirements for public procurement are adhered to and to be fully conversant with the current value thresholds for the application of EU and national procurement rules.  </p>  <p>  In relation to compliance, public bodies are subject, at the Comptroller and Auditor General's discretion, to examination regarding the economy and efficiency of their operations and the adequacy of the management systems that they have in place to appraise the effectiveness of their operations.  This includes their adherence to EU and National rules on public procurement.</p></reply>

Current best advice is that diagnosis should be made only after careful examination of the patient's clinical history, physical findings, laboratory evidence and exposure risk evaluation.  Exposure to ticks prior to disease manifestations is necessary for the diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis.  Since an awareness or recollection of a tick-bite is not always present, however, this should not exclude the diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis.  Later stages require the use of antibody detection tests (or advanced DNA detection techniques).  Testing for Lyme Disease is undertaken in most of the larger hospitals in Ireland.  In undertaking Lyme testing, it is essential that the results are interpreted in the light of the clinical condition of the patient.  If the result of this initial screen is equivocal, the patient's samples are referred to the U.K.'s Public Health England Porton Down facility which uses a two-tier system recommended by American and European authorities.  This involves a screening serological test followed by a confirmatory serological test.  </p>  <p>  I understand that representatives from Tick Talk met with Minister of State Marcella Corcoran Kennedy on 2nd August, 2016.  </p>  <p>  A member of the Group has been invited to be the patient representative on a Lyme Borreliosis Sub-Committee which has been established by the Scientific Advisory Committee of the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC).  The aim of this Sub-Committee is to develop strategies to undertake primary prevention in order to minimise the harm caused by Lyme Borreliosis in Ireland.  In addition to staff from the HPSC, the membership of the Sub-Committee includes specialists in Public Health Medicine, Consultants in Infectious Diseases, Clinical Microbiology, Occupational Health an Entomologist from the Parks and Wildlife Service, a representative from the Local Government Management Agency and an Environmental Health Officer. </p>  <p>  The initial work of the Lyme Borreliosis Sub-committee involves a survey of laboratory methods for the diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis in Ireland, the development of Lyme borreliosis guidance for general practitioners, the publication of medical media articles to highlight diagnostics and laboratory methods relating to Lyme borreliosis available in Ireland for general practitioners, and ongoing work in drawing together the Final Report of the Sub-committee.</p></reply>

However, since it does not have psychoactive properties it is not controlled under the Misuse of Drugs Acts.  </p>  <p>  While I am aware that CBD oil is sometimes marketed as a nutritional or dietary supplement, it should be noted that it is not authorised as a medicinal product in Ireland. Under European and Irish legislation, before a medicine can be placed on the Irish market, the manufacturer must seek an authorisation from the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) or, in the case of certain medicinal products, the European Medicines Agency. A determination on an application for authorisation of a medicinal product is based on a rigorous scientific assessment of the application against the criteria of safety, quality, efficacy, legal and regulatory requirements.  I have no role in the process of authorising medicinal products.</p>  <p>  No application has been received from any company for any products containing CBD.  The HPRA are open to receiving such applications.</p>  <p>  Elsewhere products containing CBD are undergoing clinical trials for the treatment of a number of medical conditions, including severe, intractable (treatment-resistant) epilepsy.  There is no prohibition on an Irish registered doctor recommending CBD for a patient under his/her care if they deem that treatment option to be clinically appropriate for their patient.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-01-24a.1011.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017012400069#WRS03400"><p>As the individual case referred to is a service matter for the Health Service Executive, I have asked the HSE to look into the particular matter raised and to reply directly to the Deputy. </p>  <p>  On 1 January 2017, "long stay contributions" under sections 67A to 67D of the Health Act 1970 and the Health (Residential Support Services Maintenance and Accommodation Contributions) Regulations 2016 replaced the system of long stay charges for in-patient services, which was in place from July 2005 until 31 December 2016 under the now-repealed section 53 of that Act. </p>  <p>  Long stay contributions apply to all forms of residential support services, other than acute in-patient services and nursing home services provided to those supported under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme (Fair Deal).  In line with the previous long stay charges system: </p>  <p>  - Long stay contributions apply to the maintenance and accommodation elements only of services which are provided by the HSE or by agencies funded to provide services on behalf of the HSE under section 38 of the Health Act 2004.</p>  <p>  - Contributions become payable when a person has already received at least 30 days of such services during the immediately preceding 12-month period. Accordingly, many episodes of respite care would not result in a requirement to make a long stay contribution towards maintenance and accommodation costs. </p>  <p>  The Health (Residential Support Services Maintenance and Accommodation Contributions) Regulations 2016 provide for three different schedules of income-based long stay contributions towards accommodation and maintenance costs in three accommodation categories:</p>  <p>  - Category A refers to accommodation where full-time (24 hour) nursing and/or medical care is provided, subject to a maximum of &euro;25 daily (&euro;175 per week) for a person whose income is &euro;208 per week or more.</p>  <p>  - Category B relates to contributions payable by those in accommodation where part-time nursing and/or medical care is provided and is subject to a maximum of  &euro;18.57 daily (&euro;130 per week) for a person whose income is &euro;194 per week or more.</p>  <p>  - Category C relates to all other non-nursing settings (such as independent living settings), subject to a maximum of &euro;10 daily (&euro;70 per week)  for a person whose income is &euro;188 per week or more.</p>  <p>  Affordability and the avoidance of financial hardship are built-in features of the long stay contributions provisions.  In all three accommodation categories, the contribution rate schedules are sliding scales, with proportionally lower contribution rates applying to those on lower incomes. Additionally, section 67D of the Health Act 1970 provides that the HSE may reduce or waive a contribution where appropriate, in order to:</p>  <p>- avoid undue financial hardship   on the part of the service user and/or on the part of the service user&rsquo;s dependants</p>  <p>  - advance a service user&rsquo;s identified needs (e.g. care plan objectives), or</p>  <p>  - take account of separate contributions (if any) made by a service user towards his or her maintenance or accommodation costs.</p>  <p>  To assist in the fair application of the framework, the HSE has published national guidelines for the correct determination of long stay contributions and comprehensive waiver guidelines (approved by the Ministers for Health and Public Expenditure and Reform) on the individual circumstances where such contributions may need to be reduced or waived.  The guidelines specify that service providers must have regard to the individual circumstances of each service user and his or her dependants. The guidelines ensure that the applicable contribution may be reduced or waived where appropriate, taking account of each person&rsquo;s income and necessary outgoings, including reasonable regular financial commitments, with a view to ensuring there is no unfair burden on the service user or on his or her dependants. </p>  <p>  The features of the long stay contributions framework ensure that it is reasonable and fair and that each service user's contributions are based on what he or she can afford, taking account of the service user's individual circumstances.</p></reply>

Two changes were made to the Primary Childhood Immunisation Schedule which came into effect on 1 December, 2016 with the introduction of Men B and Rotavirus for all babies born on or after 1 October, 2016.  All vaccines administered through the Primary Childhood Immunisation Schedule are provided free of charge.  Ireland is the second country in Europe to make the vaccine available free of charge as part of its national immunisation programme.</p>  <p>  NIAC makes many recommendations in relation to &ldquo;at risk groups&rdquo; but not all of these are included in the current immunisation schedule.  The introduction of the vaccine to the childhood immunisation programmes means that all children born on or after 1 October 2016, including those in "at risk groups", will automatically receive the vaccine.  However, there are no plans at this stage to introduce a catch-up programme for older children.  Those who have a medical card are eligible to have the vaccine administered by their GP free of charge.  However the purchase of the vaccine is not covered by the medical card scheme.</p></reply>

However, the main statutory scheme for older people is the Nursing Homes Support Scheme, which provides for a system of financial support for those assessed as needing long-term nursing home care.</p>  <p>  The Department has commenced an examination of options to bring greater national consistency to the regulation and financing of home care. This work began in 2016 with a review by the Health Research Board of how home care is regulated and funded in comparable jurisdictions, commissioned by the Department. The review will be finalised shortly and will be used to inform the development of policy proposals for the regulation and funding of these services.</p>  <p>  The development of a regulatory and funding model for home care services is a complex undertaking involving very significant legislative, operational and financial resources. It is considered that the best option for the future may be a statutory home care scheme specifically designed for home care. The Department's intention is that regulation of the home care sector will be done in parallel with the development of a scheme.</p>  <p>  In addition, a public consultation process will be launched in the coming months to allow stakeholders, including older people, their families and healthcare workers to express their views regarding a new homecare scheme.  As is usual with public consultations, details will be publically announced when they have been finalised.</p>  <p>  The development of a statutory home care scheme is a priority for me, as Minister, and I can assure the Deputy it will be progressed as a matter of urgency.</p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their income and assets while the State pays the balance of the cost. The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.</p><p>When the NHSS commenced in 2009, a commitment was made that it would be reviewed after three years. The Report of the Review was published in July 2015. Arising out of the Review, a number of key issues have been identified for more detailed consideration across Departments and Agencies, including recommendations in relation to improving and simplifying the application process. This includes:</p><p>- reviewing documents with advice from the National Adult Literacy Agency to ensure that they are as user-friendly, clear and informative as possible;</p><p>- ensuring that there is clear guidance on where relevant information can be found;</p><p>- making sample application forms available;</p><p>- reviewing the content of correspondence with applicants to make sure that it is clear; and</p><p>- standardising informal advice provided to applicants in relation to the nursing home loan element of the Scheme.</p><p>Work on implementing these improvements is well underway by the HSE, and this should assist with making the process of applying for support under the Fair Deal Scheme more manageable, understandable and efficient for people who are at a vulnerable stage in their lives.</p><p>The HSE website provides helpful information and guides which explain the application process. There are also Nursing Homes Support Offices located throughout the country who are available to assist with any queries in relation to the Scheme.  Contact details for these offices are also available on the HSE website.</p></reply>

The decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds by the HSE. </p>  <p>  For a medicine to be considered for reimbursement it must first have a marketing authorisation from the European Medicine Agency (EMA), before being assessed under the 2013 Act.</p>  <p>  The EMA provides independent recommendations on medicines for human and veterinary use, based on a comprehensive scientific evaluation of data. </p>  <p>  The EMA's evaluations of marketing authorisation applications provide the basis for the authorisation of medicines in Europe.  This is separate to the Statutory Assessment process conducted by the HSE.</p>  <p>  I understand from the HSE that Biogen have applied to the EMA for market authorisation in the EU for the drug Nusinersen brand name Spinraza.  The application to the EMA was submitted in Autumn 2016.  The EMA assessment process generally takes around one year.</p>  <p>  Should Nusinersen receive European marketing authorisation, the manufacturer would then be open to make an application to the HSE to have the product reimbursed under the community drug schemes.</p>  <p>  The operation of patient access schemes is at the discretion of manufacturers.  There is no provision in Irish legislation for the approval of compassionate use programmes for specific groups of patients with an unmet medical need.

This dossier included details on all relevant costs and relevant cost offsets including those associated with hospitalisation, disease management costs, intravenous antibiotics, adverse events and any additional costs arising in patients not taking Orkambi.</p><p>The NCPE has completed its Health Technology Assessment and this is available on its website.  It was submitted to the HSE in June 2016. The NCPE determined, following an evaluation of the economic dossier, that the manufacturer failed to demonstrate cost-effectiveness or value for money from using the drug.  The NCPE have confirmed that all relevant costs were included in the analysis.  In line with the HSE's assessment process, the HSE Drugs Committee considered the NCPE recommendation, the manufacturers submissions and commercial offer and other information.  Following this consideration the Drugs Committee did not recommend reimbursement at the current price.  The HSE Directorate considered the Drugs Committee's recommendation in December and the Directorate took the decision not to reimburse at the current price offered by the company. </p><p>The HSE has since re-entered into negotiations with Vertex, the manufacturer of Orkambi, with a view to significantly reducing the cost of Orkambi.  This process is on-going.  A meeting was held in December and again in early January.  Following completion of this process the HSE's Drugs Committee will make a recommendation on the cost-effectiveness of Orkambi to the HSE Directorate for a decision, taking into consideration the manufacturer's latest price offerings.  Again, this decision will be made on objective, scientific and economic grounds in line with the 2013 Act.</p><p>I fully support the HSE in its efforts to reduce the price of this medicine and I would call on all public representatives, including the members of this house, to do the same.</p></reply>

Our community rated market is supported by a Risk Equalisation Scheme funded by a community rating levy payable by insurers on all written policies.  The legislative basis for the levy is provided for in the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999.  The levy is collected by the Revenue Commissioners from insurers and all of the monies collected are paid over to the Risk Equalisation Fund administered by the independent regulator - the Health Insurance Authority.  The Authority redistributes the monies back to the health insurance companies by way of credits in respect of older and sicker people.  The scheme is designed to protect community rating by spreading the cost of insuring older and sicker people across the market and allows all people to continue to pay the same net amount for a given health insurance product.</p></reply>

However, the main statutory scheme for older people is the Nursing Homes Support Scheme (NHSS), which provides for a system of financial support for those assessed as needing long-term nursing home care.</p>  <p>  The Department has commenced an examination of options to bring greater national consistency to the regulation and financing of home care.  This work began in 2016 with a review by the Health Research Board of how home care is regulated and funded in comparable jurisdictions, commissioned by the Department.  The review will be finalised shortly and will be used to inform the development of policy proposals for the regulation and funding of these services. </p>  <p>  The development of a regulatory and funding model for home care services is a complex undertaking involving very significant legislative, operational and financial resources.  It is considered that the best option for the future may be a statutory home care scheme specifically designed for home care.  The Department's intention is that regulation of the home care sector will be done in parallel with the development of a scheme. </p>  <p>  In addition, a public consultation process will be launched in the coming months to allow stakeholders, including older people, their families and healthcare workers to express their views regarding a new homecare scheme.  As is usual with public consultations, details will be publically announced when they have been finalised.</p>  <p>  The development of a statutory home care scheme is a priority for me, as Minister, and I can assure the Deputy it will be progressed as a matter of urgency.</p></reply>

Its intention is to make it easier for such professionals to practise their professions in EEA countries other than their own but due safeguards are provided in the assessment of the qualification for public health and safety and consumer protection.</p>  <p>  The General System of the Directive, into which professions such as the profession of radiographer fall, provides for an assessment on a case-by-case basis of the formal qualifications and professional experience of an individual applicant against the qualifications required to practise in the host Member State and for a final decision to be communicated to the applicant within 4 months of submission of a complete application.</p>  <p>  In Ireland, the Radiographers Registration Board at CORU is the competent authority under the Directive for the recognition of non-Irish radiography qualifications for the purposes of registration under the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005.  A similar system for recognising foreign professional qualifications outside the scope of the Directive is also in place under the Act.</p>  <p>  As the outcome of a particular application cannot be guaranteed, and given the time lines involved due to the individual nature of each application, CORU&rsquo;s website advises applicants not to make any travel or employment arrangements which depend on their qualifications being recognised.  Likewise, the Health Service Executive (HSE) does not offer any post until candidates are registered with CORU and strongly recommends that anyone interested in pursuing a career in radiography with the HSE commences the validation/registration procedure as early as possible.</p></reply>

My Department and the Health Services Executive (HSE) continues to support the Department of Education and Skills in the implementation of the curriculum and to improve health promotion in school settings.  We will continue to work with the Department of Education and Skills on matters including a whole-school approach to healthy lifestyle programmes including, but not limited to the curriculum, on nutrition, physical activity and exercise, smoking, alcohol, mental well-being and sexual health as was indicated in Action 1.1 of, "A Healthy Weight for Ireland - Obesity Policy and Action Plan 2016-2015."  Under Action point 1.1, it is also intended to develop National Food Standards for primary schools.</p>  <p>  This Policy is particularly concerned with overweight and obesity in children and young people.  Prevention is the primary focus of the Obesity Policy and Action Plan and preventing children from becoming overweight must form the cornerstone of prevention efforts.  It covers a ten year period until 2025 and sets targets to be achieved and actions that will produce measurable outcomes.  The first part is set out as the "Ten Steps Forward."  Each Step includes a number of priority actions, many of which have already commenced.</p>  <p>  The HSE work with the Department of Health and Department of Education and Skills to deliver Healthy Food policy workshops and training to teachers across primary and post-primary schools.  In terms of initiatives in schools, the HSE: provides information tools and resources to schools such as 'Eat Smart Move More booklet', reward chart and posters, 'Healthy Lunchbox' leaflets; it funds the Irish Heart Foundation Health Promotion Programme which is rolling out a Happy Heart@School Catering Award in post-primary schools the HSE is in the process of providing all schools with a bi-lingual set of 'Healthy Eating for Life' resources which were launched in November 2016 by my Department.  The HSE also provides training for the community based cooking programmes Healthy Food Made Easy/Cook-it which some schools have adapted and integrated into their curriculum for Transition Year students.</p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their income and assets while the State pays the balance of the cost.  The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.  A financial assessment is carried out by the HSE to determine how much a participant in the Scheme will contribute to the cost of their care.  </p>  <p>  Funding for the Scheme in 2017 is &euro;940 million.  This represents an increase of &euro;18.5 million on 2016 expenditure, and will enable an additional 500 people to be supported in 2017, increasing the numbers supported under the Scheme to just over 23,600 by the end of the year.  Time spent on the placement list for funding is not expected to exceed four weeks during 2017. </p>  <p>  When the NHSS commenced in 2009, a commitment was made that it would be reviewed after three years.  The Report of the Review was published in July 2015.  Arising out of the Review, a number of key issues have been identified for more detailed consideration across Departments and Agencies, including the treatment of business and farm assets for the purposes of the financial assessment element of the Scheme.  This work is currently underway and the IFA has made a submission in this context to the Interdepartmental Group which is overseeing the implementation of certain recommendations contained in the Review.  The proposals put forward by the IFA are currently being considered.  Once all of the relevant Review recommendations have been considered, any amendments required to the Scheme will be identified.  Any changes to the Scheme which require legislative implementation will be addressed collectively.</p></reply>

The Strategy is intended to promote older people&rsquo;s health and well being so that older people can continue to contribute to social, economic, cultural and family life in their own communities for as long as possible, thereby representing a vision for an age-friendly society.  The Strategy highlights that ageing is not just a health issue, but rather requires a whole of Government approach to address a range of social, economic and environmental factors that affect the health and wellbeing of our ageing citizens.  The Department of Health has an overall coordinating and collating role for the Strategy and a more direct role for the health-related objectives.  </p><p>At the launch of the Strategy, a commitment was made to publish an Implementation Plan to facilitate the translation of the Goals and Objectives of the Strategy into action on the ground.  The approach to implementation originally included in the Strategy would have worked where a finite number of discrete and concrete steps could be taken after which the implementation could be deemed complete.  However, many of the objectives included in this Strategy are quite broad, and can be viewed as a set of principles to which Government has committed, and which will inform policies that affect older people on an indefinite basis into the future, rather than concrete objectives that can be delivered in the short term.</p><p>The Department has therefore formulated new arrangements to implement and monitor the implementation of the National Positive Ageing Strategy.  The new proposals will see mechanisms established that will give stakeholder groups effective and on-going access to Government Departments and State Agencies relevant to older people.  An Annual Forum for stakeholders will be established which will seek to identify what stakeholders consider to be their key priorities for Government for the coming year and the next three years.  Issues will be considered on a thematic basis and will include Health, Social Protection, Transport, Security, Community Housing and Local Government  etc.  Clear channels of communications will be established with relevant Government Departments assigning a named senior official to engage with stakeholder representatives on issues relevant to their remit.  </p><p>The revised arrangements were approved by the Cabinet  Committee on Social Policy and Public Service Reform on 27 October, 2016.  These new arrangements will now be communicated to stakeholders and arrangements made to commence implementation. </p><p>As part of the NPAS implementation process, a Healthy and Positive Ageing Initiative has been established in collaboration with the HSE&rsquo;s Health and Wellbeing Programme and the Atlantic Philanthropies to measure the impact of the Strategy and establish an ongoing system for measuring and reporting on Positive Ageing.  The Initiative will monitor changes in older people&rsquo;s health and wellbeing linked to the Goals and Objectives of the National Positive Ageing Strategy.  This will be done primarily through the development of Positive Ageing indicators to be published every two years.  The Initiative is intended to provide evidence of the factors contributing to positive ageing, including at local level and ultimately inform policy responses to population ageing in Ireland.  The first national Positive Ageing Indicators report was published in 2016 and highlights many of the positive and negative aspects of growing old in Ireland.</p><p>The National Positive Ageing Strategy and the activities of the HaPAI are strongly embedded within the vision and actions set out for Healthy Ireland, the Government-led initiative which aims to create an Irish society where people of all ages can enjoy good physical and mental health<b>,</b>and where wellbeing<b>is </b>supported at every level of society.  The Healthy Ireland Framework was launched in 2013 and seeks to provide people and communities with<b></b>accurate information on how to improve their health and wellbeing and to make the healthy choices easier choices.  Healthy Ireland takes a whole-of-Government and whole-of-society approach to improving health and wellbeing and the quality of people&rsquo;s lives and a number of new structures have been put in place to ensure that all sectors of society are given opportunities to participate.</p></reply>

The Strategy emphasises that most people with dementia live in their own communities and can continue to live well and to participate in those communities.  The Strategy contains a set of priority actions capable of implementation within existing resources or by reconfiguring resources.  It also contains a number of additional actions which may require resources additional to what is currently available and which will be considered as these become available in the future. </p><p>A number of priority areas for action for the National Dementia Strategy have been identified, which include the provision of integrated services, supports and care for people with dementia and their carers.  To meet this priority, and to support the implementation of the strategy, The Atlantic Philanthropies, the Dept. of Health and the Health Service Executive have agreed a co-investment programme of &euro;27.5m.  This National Dementia Strategy Implementation Programme contains a number of elements which include:</p><p>- The rollout of a programme of Intensive Home Supports and Homecare Packages for people with dementia;</p><p>- The provision of additional dementia-specific resources for GPs, who are the critical and initial point of contact with the health system for those with dementia; and</p><p>- Measures to raise public awareness, address stigma, and promote the inclusion and involvement in society of those with dementia.</p><p>The overall funding for Services for Older People available to the Health Service Executive (HSE) for 2017 has increased to &euro;765 million and the Home Help Service and Home Care Packages account for about 50% of this.  The additional funding for homecare is aimed at allowing people to continue to live in their own homes and at facilitating discharge of older people from hospitals when the acute phase of their treatment has been completed.  The HSE&rsquo;s National Service Plan for 2017 provides for a target of 10.57million Home Help Hours to support about 49,000 people, 16,750<b></b>Home Care Packages<b></b>and<b></b>190<b></b>Intensive Home Care Packages for clients with complex needs including 60<b></b>clients with dementia supported with co-funding from Atlantic Philanthropies under the Irish National Dementia Strategy.</p></reply>

The main features of the process to date include:</p><p>(i) a high level review of the current Strategy by an international panel of experts;</p><p>(ii) a review of systematic evidence reviews of interventions on the drug problem;</p><p>(iii) a 10 year trends analysis of the drugs situation in Ireland; and</p><p>(iv) proposals from multi-stakeholder focus groups on measures to address gaps in the current response to the drugs problem.</p><p>In addition, a wide-ranging and comprehensive consultation process has been undertaken, which has resulted in over 2000 submissions on the matter.</p><p>It is envisaged that the new Strategy will be based on a health-led approach to the drug problem and build on progress achieved under previous drug strategies.  I understand that the Steering Committee is continuing with its deliberations and is expected to submit its final report to me by the end of March.  I hope to bring my proposals to Government on the new Strategy thereafter.</p></reply>

However, since it does not have psychoactive properties it is not controlled under the Misuse of Drugs Acts.</p>  <p>  While I am aware that CBD oil is sometimes marketed as a nutritional or dietary supplement, it should be noted that it is not authorised as a medicinal product in Ireland. Under European and Irish legislation, before a medicine can be placed on the Irish market, the manufacturer must seek an authorisation from the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) or, in the case of certain medicinal products, the European Medicines Agency. A determination on an application for authorisation of a medicinal product is based on a rigorous scientific assessment of the application against the criteria of safety, quality, efficacy, legal and regulatory requirements.  I have no role in the process of authorising medicinal products.</p>  <p>  No application has been received from any company for any products containing CBD.  The HPRA are open to receiving such applications.</p>  <p>  Elsewhere products containing CBD are undergoing clinical trials for the treatment of a number of medical conditions, including severe, intractable (treatment-resistant) epilepsy.  There is no prohibition on an Irish registered doctor recommending CBD for a patient under his/her care if they deem that treatment option to be clinically appropriate for their patient.</p></reply>

They recognise the challenges posed for part-time farmers in attending courses and every effort is made to accommodate them, by delivering training in a flexible manner, balanced against the need to maintain education quality. It must also be appreciated that agricultural education by its nature requires a high level of hands on skills based instruction to encourage learners to develop proficiency in farm tasks and complete farm based assignment and projects. </p>  <p>  Insofar as the Green Cert programme is concerned, it has been developed to meet the training requirements for both full-time and part-time farmers, and is provided on both a part-time and distance education basis to facilitate people who have an off farm job.</p></reply>

As I stated in the D&aacute;il just last week, I believe that a further stakeholders forum will help us all scope out the issues for this vital Sector providing a platform for the stakeholders to express their views and concerns on the challenges they are facing, but equally to discuss the opportunities that lie ahead for the industry.</p>  <p>  You may also be aware that one of my chief priorities is to provide low-cost more flexible finance for the industry and in this regard I was happy to announce on Budget Day, my plans for a &euro;150 million Agri Cash Flow Loan Support Scheme. This has been developed in conjunction with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI), by leveraging EU and Exchequer funding totalling &euro;25million from my Department, to deliver a total loan fund of &euro;150 million, which will support highly flexible loans for up to six years, for amounts up to &euro;150,000. </p>  <p>  The interest rate applying is 2.95% and the product will be available to livestock, tillage and horticulture farmers.  Loans to tillage and horticulture farmers will be provided in line with the EU&rsquo;s agriculture State Aid de minimis requirements. This is a cash flow support facility, to improve the working capital position of farmers and other viable primary agriculture SMEs. The loans will be unsecured and are primarily to pay down expensive forms of credit such as merchant credit and other short-term financing facilities such as overdrafts. I recently welcomed the SBCI &ldquo;Open Call&rdquo; for financial intermediaries to deliver the Scheme. </p>  <p>  The SBCI is targeting that the loans will be available in the market by the end of this month. I am encouraging farmers to consider their cash flow and borrowings situation now and, if appropriate to their circumstances, to be prepared to apply for these loans when they become available. The loan scheme is part of a &ldquo;three pillar strategy&rdquo; in response to income volatility that I announced in the Budget, along with additional tax measures and farm payments. Among the tax measures, I agreed with my colleague the Minister for Finance, for an adjustment to the current &lsquo;Income Averaging&rsquo; system, which will allow for an opt-out in an exceptional year. This is available for 2016 tax liability, and will go some way towards addressing cash flow concerns. </p>  <p>  As an additional support to cash flow on farms, including Tillage farms, I also confirmed that advance payments would be made in 2016 in respect of the Basic Payment and Greening Payment schemes.</p>  <p>  Advance payments commenced on the 17 October last, the earliest possible date by which payments can begin under the governing EU Regulations, with the addition of balancing payments from the 1 December. To date &euro;1,168 billion   has been paid out to more than 122,889 farmers and payments are ongoing. Payments in excess of &euro;195 million have also been made to more than 91,000 applicants under the Areas of Natural Constraints scheme. </p>  <p>  Also a TAMS Scheme, specifically tailored to the tillage sector, is due to open early this year. This Scheme will support grain growers in achieving further economic efficiencies and details will be made available in the near future. I want to restate my view that in this changing landscape we need to take a fresh look at our tillage industry to ensure that it is best positioned to withstand possible future threats and to avail of the new opportunities which may present themselves. </p>  <p>  I fully acknowledge and accept the difficulties that have been experienced by the farming community, not least by our tillage farmers. This sector is a very important area in the agricultural economy and 2016 was a challenging year both in terms of market returns and variable weather conditions experienced during the harvest.</p></reply>

However I have made enquiries with Bord Na gCon in relation to the matters raised by the deputy. </p>  <p>  Bord na gCon inform me that in 2015 there were 5,632 samples analysed at Board approved Laboratories for the purpose of prohibited substance detection. 79 of these samples returned a positive result for an Adverse Analytical Finding.   The corresponding figure for 2016 is 5,388 with 47 confirmed Adverse Analytical Findings returned (to date). A number of samples from 2016 remain to be completed.  12,681 greyhounds raced at licensed stadia in 2015 and 12,312 greyhounds raced at licensed stadia in 2016. The minimum requirement for testing at a licensed race meeting is two random samples per race meeting. More extensive sampling is undertaken by testing teams which are deployed both on a random and targeted basis. Samples are also taken at Sales Trials and at trainer&rsquo;s premises for greyhounds currently racing. </p>  <p>  They state that of the 79 Adverse Analytical Findings in 2015, 13 were taken from winning greyhounds at greyhound races. Of the 47  Adverse Analytical Findings in 2016, 4 were taken from winning greyhounds.</p>  <p>  They further state that during the year 2016, 1st   placed greyhounds were the most frequently tested at just under 20% of all greyhound tested. However prohibited substances can be used to enhance or to impair performance in racing greyhounds. Testing all winners (amounting to some 16,500 samples) is not therefore the most efficient use of available resources nor an effective anti-doping &amp;amp; medication control strategy.</p>  <p>  Bord na gCon state that the results of all samples taken since the 1st   October 2015 are placed on the IGB Website immediately after the results are notified to IGB along with information which identifies the dog in question. Samples taken prior to that date could only be published for legal reasons where the Control Committee had found a breach of the racing regulation had occurred. The overall statistics for 2015 have been published on a regular basis.</p></reply>

The EU Commission has conducted a thorough analysis of the situation and held a series of discussions with Thai authorities since 2011.  Following the conclusion of this process, on 25 April 2015 the European Commission issued Thailand with a &lsquo;yellow card&rsquo; warning due to its inadequate fisheries legal framework and poor monitoring, control and traceability systems.  This key instrument in the fight against illegal fishing ensures that only fisheries products that have been certified as legal can access the EU market.  By doing so, the European Commission has initiated a dialogue process with the Thai authorities, with the purpose of identifying the shortcomings and determining corrective measures.</p>  <p>  The associated problems of human trafficking and slave labour in Thailand&rsquo;s fisheries sector are recognised.  While the EU IUU Regulation does not directly address the human trafficking and working conditions on-board fishing vessels, it is intended that improvements in the fisheries control system will also improve the control of labour conditions in the seafood industry. I should also note that several Commission services continue to work on the issues of human trafficking and slave labour in Thailand.  In view of the commitment of the Thai Government to address not only the IUU fishing but also to improve the labour situation, the European Commission is now holding a parallel dialogue on labour and supports the Thai Government with technical assistance programmes aiming at combatting child labour and forced labour in the fisheries and seafood sectors. </p>  <p>  The Thai authorities have given the highest political attention to this matter.  A tailored action plan to address the shortcomings in Thailand&rsquo;s fishing industry as well as a formal dialogue with the Thai authorities to make them take the necessary corrective measures is currently in place. Progress has been recorded, particularly on the legislative front.  However, the EU Commission has reported that the dialogue is proving difficult and there remain serious concerns about the steps taken by Thailand to fight IUU fishing activities. This means that further action by the Commission cannot be ruled out.</p>  <p>  I would like to take this opportunity to assure you that Ireland fully supports the EU approach to date.</p></reply>

While I welcome the fact that Prime Minister May has provided some clarity on the approach the UK Government propose to take in the upcoming negotiations, there is still considerable uncertainty on the future trading relationship between the EU and the UK and therefore in relation to tariffs.  I will continue to seek to have these issues at the top of the EU negotiating agenda, given the potential implications for the agri-food sector.</p>  <p>  While An Taoiseach has met Prime Minister May on a number of occasions and will meet her again shortly during her proposed visit to Ireland, I have already had meetings with Michelle McIlveen in Belfast and Andrea Leadsom in London before Christmas and I met Secretary of State Leadsom again at the Berlin Green Week over the weekend. </p>  <p>  The most immediate impact of the Brexit vote on Irish farming has been the effect of exchange rate volatility.  I am pleased to say that my Department and our agencies have ensured that measures have been put in place to help alleviate the pressures of income volatility, and these include:</p>  <p>  -  Direct payments, estimated by Teagasc at an average of over &euro;17,000 per farm, provide a valuable source of farm income support and act as a hedge against price volatility.</p>  <p>  -  The adjustment in Budget 2017 to the income averaging scheme for tax purposes will allow farmers to avail of an opt-out in an exceptional year.</p>  <p>  -  The &lsquo;Agriculture Cashflow Support Loan Scheme&rsquo;, developed by my Department in cooperation with the Strategic Bank Corporation of Ireland (SBCI), will make &euro;150 million available to farmers throughout Ireland at low-cost interest rates of 2.95%.

The SBCI is aiming to make these loans available by the end of January and I hope to make an announcement in relation to this shortly.</p>  <p>  -  Bord Bia has activated a 4-pillar support strategy for Irish food companies to maintain growth in this period of volatility and over the longer term. These activities are captured under the headings of Managing Volatility, Obtaining Consumer and Market Insight, Deepening Customer Engagement and Extending Market Reach.</p>  <p>  -  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s initial, industry-wide, 5-point plan included provision of information (on improving competitiveness, reducing supply chain costs through the provision of LEAN and R&amp;D/Innovation supports to clients, and accessing funding), market development support and UK market support. Both agencies have also been working with individual companies in order to tailor the response in accordance with the particular difficulties being faced, and have been working together on strategic marketing initiatives.</p>  <p>  The situation will continue to be monitored on an ongoing basis and discussed with the sector, including through my Department&rsquo;s Consultative Committee of Stakeholders on Brexit and the All Island Civic Dialogue.</p></reply>

The &ldquo;Agriculture Cashflow Support Loan Scheme&rdquo; was developed by my Department in co-operation with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI).  It will provide farmers with a low cost, flexible source of working capital and will allow them to pay down more expensive forms of short-term debt, ensuring the ongoing financial sustainability of viable farming enterprises. </p>  <p>  This innovative loan Scheme will make &euro;150 million available to farmers throughout Ireland at low-cost interest rates of 2.95%.  This is supported by &euro;25 million being provided by my Department, including &euro;11 million in EU exceptional adjustment aid.  The SBCI is aiming to bring the loans to market by the end of January and I hope to make an announcement in this regard shortly. </p></reply>

Fishermen are provided with special heavy duty bags by BIM which are filled by the fishermen while at sea and these bags are deposited in fishery harbours for sustainable disposal.  BIM are preparing waste characterisation plans for each fishery harbour as the initiative is rolled out.  Under the Net Recycling initiative, end of life nets are dismantled into a number of components, enabling the material to enter a number of recycling streams thus diverting such material from landfill.  Both initiatives are proving very popular with fishermen, who are actively supporting the initiatives, and this in turn contributes to their certification under the BIM responsibly sourced standard and Bord Bia&rsquo;s Origin Green.</p></reply>

The European Union (Household Food Waste and Bio-waste) Regulations 2015 and the commercial Waste Management (Food Waste) Regulations 2009 both aim to maximise the resource potential and minimise the disposal of food waste.  These two sets of regulations place clear obligations on waste collectors, businesses and households to promote the segregation and recovery of food waste for the purposes of producing energy, compost and digestate, thereby supporting job creation in the waste and bio-energy sectors. </p>  <p>  Through preventing food waste, and becoming more efficient in using what we have, Ireland can reduce the environmental impacts associated with food waste, improve the financial performance of businesses and householders alike, and help those who struggle to put food on the table. Reuse is the next favourable waste management option of the waste hierarchy and donation of surplus food has a role to play in the reduction of food waste.  It is also important to communicate a clear and consistent message, promoting the food waste management hierarchy as an integrated solution rather than promoting a single option over another. Ireland is already making significant strides in this area and through the EPA-led National Waste Prevention Programme (NWPP), has been working on food waste prevention in partnership with many stakeholders since 2009. A national Forum on Food Waste is scheduled for March, 2017 to bring together stakeholders from across the food cycle with the specific focus of exploring a collaborative approach to reducing waste food.</p>  <p>  "Stop Food Waste" is a national food waste prevention programme, whose aim is to raise awareness and enable initiatives to promote changes in behaviour, through a combination of education, training, local champions, peer example and easy to use information.  The programme is aimed at householders and individuals, and small businesses such as caf&eacute;s, pubs serving food and small local supermarkets. </p></reply>

A key principle of the NBP is to support and stimulate commercial investment through policy and regulatory measures. Commercial investment since the publication of the NBP has considerably exceeded expectations.  To date, the commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2.5bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.</p><p>Currently, approximately 1.4m premises in Ireland can get high speed broadband from commercial service providers and investment by the telecoms sector is continuing to expand this footprint. </p><p>The High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at<i>www.broadband.gov.ie</i>shows the current extent of the State Intervention area:</p><p>- The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or have previously indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services;</p><p>- The areas marked AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the target areas for the State Intervention, which are the subject of the current procurement process. It is intended that premises within this area will have access to services of at least 30 megabits per second when the procurement process is completed and the network rolled out.  </p><p>The Department is actively monitoring the commercial deployment plans in the BLUE areas to ensure that all premises can get access to services. In this regard, direct feedback from consumers is important and if customers in these areas cannot access high speed broadband services,  I would encourage them to contact my Department directly at <i><font color="#2F2F2F">broadband@dccae.gov.ie</font></i>, quoting their address and Eircode and giving details of providers they have contacted with a view to obtaining services. </p><p>A formal procurement process is now in train to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area.  The Department will also shortly update the High Speed Broadband map and finalise this Intervention Area for bidders, taking into account any industry investments that have not materialised and potential other new investments. </p><p>The procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years.  Intensive dialogue with bidders is continuing and the three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution. This provides for a future proofed solution for the  25 years of the contract and beyond.  A fibre-to-the-home solution means that householders and businesses may get speeds not just of 30 Megabits per second but much higher, potentially up to 1000 Megabits per second.  </p><p>The timeframe for the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders, during the procurement process.  During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated a 3-5 year timeline to rollout a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP. As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and/or high demand.  This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network rollout plan.  A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. A detailed rollout plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place. </p><p>The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the rollout of the network once a contract is awarded. In this regard, Minister Humphreys is leading on the establishment of two regional action groups, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices and other relevant agencies to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded.</p><p>In a further positive initiative, last July, I established a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce with my colleague Minister Humphreys to address immediate issues in relation to the quality of mobile phone and broadband coverage.  The Taskforce report is available at the following link: <i></i></p><p>I have signed Regulations allowing ComReg to proceed with an early 2017 auction of the 3.6GHz radio spectrum band, to provide an 86% increase in total spectrum available for mobile and fixed wireless services. I have also secured &euro;8m for RTE which will allow it to free up the 700MHz spectrum band, to provide enhanced mobile services.  </p><p>In the meantime, my Department continues to liaise closely with industry and relevant other Departments and agencies to assist in the commercial deployment of telecommunications networks. </p><p>These investments should assist in significantly improving the coverage and quality of broadband and mobile voice and data services throughout the country.</p></reply>

The measures currently supported are those that can deliver the most energy savings at the lowest cost.  The upgrade of windows is not currently supported under the Better Energy Programme due to the need to balance the budgetary resources available with the demand for  the programme.  While window insulation does improve the energy efficiency of a home, the cost of such a measure is high in relation to the energy efficiency gains made. </p><p>I have asked SEAI to conduct a review of the technologies that are currently supported through the Better Energy Homes scheme and to consider whether grant support should be offered for a wider range of energy upgrades.

GNI is mandated under Section 8 of the Gas Act 1976, as amended, to develop and maintain a national system for the supply of natural gas that is both economical and efficient.  GNI's published "Connections Policy", which was most recently revised in 2015, sets out its policy for new connections to the transmission and distribution gas networks.  Under this policy, GNI conducts studies to assess towns for connections to the gas network. In order for any town to be so connected certain economic criteria need to be satisfied.  These criteria provide that the construction and operating costs of connecting a town, or group of towns, to the network must be recovered through the consumption of gas and the associated network charges. In this regard, the 2015 Energy White Paper underlined that new infrastructure proposals will continue to be assessed through robust analysis. </p>  <p>  The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) is statutorily responsible for assessing and approving the GNI Connections Policy, and it concluded its last such approval process in October 2015 following the usual public consultation.

The Directive requires that certain minimum levels of monitoring are carried out for the purposes of assessment and management of air quality.  The EPA monitors a range of atmospheric pollutants, based on data obtained from its monitoring stations that form the national ambient air quality network.  The Agency's most recent annual air quality report was published in November 2016 and provides an assessment of air quality in Ireland for 2015. Emissions of NOx were monitored at 15 locations across Ireland for the report, and values for all these sites were below the annual limit value.  The report cautions however that NOx values may increase in line with growth in economic activity in the State.  City centre and urban monitoring sites in Ireland are approaching EU limit values for NO2, and it is possible that we will see limit values exceeded in the near future unless mitigation steps are taken.</p>  <p>  A significant contributor to the rise in NOx emissions in recent years throughout the EU has been the higher than expected emissions from the new fleet of road vehicles, particularly diesel vehicles.  Over time, discrepancies have come to light between the emissions recorded from vehicles during emissions testing and &lsquo;real&rsquo; driving.  The European Commission approach has been to revise the test cycle to be more representative of emissions from real-world driving experience (RDE). Ireland fully supported these proposals and their early implementation.  The Road Safety Authority, which is under the aegis of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, is the agency centrally involved in this issue on behalf of Ireland. </p>  <p>  My Department did not make a submission on the question of the equalisation of excise duty rates between petrol and diesel during the preparation of the Finance Bill, 2016.

The objective was not to establish the criteria for determining spatial feasibility as it was solely an acoustic exercise.  The acoustic models produced in the study were based on the identification of potentially viable areas for wind turbine placement and a number of assumptions were made in compiling the report.   Proposals for individual wind farm developments are subject to the statutory requirements of planning law, in the same manner as other proposed developments.  Aside from exclusion zones around dwellings, exclusion zones were applied in the report around environmental, cultural heritage and archaeological zones. It is important to reiterate the limited scope of this report, which did not include an environmental study.</p>  <p>  The 12 exclusion zones constitute areas protected under national and EU law such as the Habitats Directive.  By their nature, any development proposed within those areas, would be subject to specific environment assessment.  Under each of the listed exclusion zones, further environmental constraints impact the likelihood of a project receiving planning approval. Therefore, in order to assess the implications of acoustic parameters, it was reasonable to apply the 12 exclusion zones in question, which were agreed by the Steering Group, membership of which included the then Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, the National Parks  and Wildlife Service, the SEAI and Local Authority representation, prior to the commencement of this modelling exercise.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.  This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment by the telecommunications sector and a State Intervention in those areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.  A key principle of the NBP is to support and stimulate commercial investment in Broadband through policy and regulatory measures. Commercial investment since the publication of the NBP has considerably exceeded expectations.  To date, the commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2.5bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.</p><p>Currently, approximately 1.4m premises in the Blue area in Ireland can get high speed broadband from commercial service providers including eir and investment by the telecoms sector is continuing to expand this footprint.  The breakdown of planned coverage of premises per townland is available on the High Speed Broadband Map at <i>www.broadband.gov.ie. </i></p><p>The rollout of High Speed Broadband services in the Blue area by commercial operators including eir is being kept under ongoing review by my Department to ensure that all premises can get access to services, either through commercial investment or the State intervention. In this regard my Department continues to liaise closely with industry and relevant other Departments and Agencies to assist in the commercial deployment of telecommunications networks.  The Department will also shortly update the High Speed Broadband map and finalise the intervention area for bidders, taking into account any industry investments that have not materialized and potential other new investments.</p><p>A formal procurement process is now in train to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area.  The procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years. Intensive dialogue with bidders is continuing and the three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution.  This provides for a future proofed solution for the 25 years of the contract and beyond.  A fibre-to-the-home solution means that householders and businesses may get speeds not just of 30 Megabits per second but much higher, potentially up to 1000 Megabits per second.</p><p>As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and/or high demand.  This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network rollout plan.  A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  A detailed rollout plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place. </p><p>The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the rollout of the network once a contract is awarded.  In this regard, Minister Humphreys is leading on the establishment of two regional action groups, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices and other relevant agencies to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded.</p><p>In a further positive initiative, last July, I established a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce with my colleague Minister Humphreys to address immediate issues in relation to the quality of mobile phone and broadband coverage.  The Taskforce report is available at the following link:</p><p>I recently signed Regulations allowing ComReg to proceed with an early 2017 auction of the 3.6GHz radio spectrum band, to provide an 86% increase in total spectrum available for mobile and fixed wireless services.  I have also secured &euro;8m for RTE which will allow it to free up the 700MHz spectrum band, to provide enhanced mobile services.  </p><p>These investments should assist in significantly improving the coverage and quality of broadband and mobile voice and data services throughout the country.</p></reply>

It will also complement and add value to it, by having a particular focus on national priority areas not addressed by EU legislation.  This process necessarily involves discussion and consultation with a wide number of stakeholders, including the European Commission, relevant Departments and agencies of Government, the residential fuel industry, and the general public. Discussions on issues that may arise in connection with the strategy have already commenced with some of these stakeholders.</p>  <p>  In addition, the EPA has commenced preparation of a draft national ambient air monitoring programme under section 65 of the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992 (as amended), which will provide the basis and options for the continued development and expansion of the national ambient air monitoring network, including providing the data necessary to inform funding decisions.  The development of the national ambient air monitoring programme will include a review of the adequacy of the current network for both determining compliance with European and national standards for air quality and for the provision of information to the public about local air quality.  A  stakeholder consultation on this process was recently completed, and my officials look forward to further engagement with the agency on this important initiative over the coming year.</p></reply>

This administrative and legal framework establishes the Search and Rescue function as a State function with the Irish Coast Guard designated as responsible for maritime Search and Rescue.  It further defines the jurisdiction and legal authority of the Rescue Co-ordination Centres with relevant standards of the International Civlil Aviation Organisation and the International Maritime Organisation.</p>  <p>  In light of the context set out above, it is my view that there is no need to place the IRCG on any additional statutory footing.</p></reply>

Amongst the key questions highlighted for consideration was the means of how best to ensure that sports coaching is as effective as possible at all levels and that coaches are given the necessary support to work with a variety of people, including children, older people and people with disabilities.</p>  <p>  I consider that the particular question of whether legislation should be introduced to make it mandatory for all sports clubs to have a code of conduct for youth coaches can best be considered as part of the overall process of concluding the new National Sports Policy.  I would welcome the view of Sport Ireland, the Government's agency with responsibility for overseeing sporting National Governing Bodies (NGBs), on the suggestion.</p>  <p>  I should also highlight that the Child and Family Agency (TUSLA), under the aegis of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, is the dedicated State agency responsible for improving wellbeing and outcomes for children, and provides valuable guidelines in matters relating to child protection.  Sport Ireland liaises closely with TUSLA and the NGBs on child protection matters.</p></reply>

A provisional review of the road fatal collisions in 2016 was carried out by the Road Safety Authority (RSA) based on a statistical analysis of such fatalities across a range of variables and causes.  It shows for example that of the 2016 fatal collisions, 18% of drivers and 32% of passengers were confirmed as not wearing a seat belt, while 41% of drivers and 34% of passengers were confirmed as wearing a seatbelt, with the remainder not known at this time.</p>  <p>  Detailed reports by the RSA on Fatal Collisions, which were published last year, indicates excessive speed was a contributory factor in 32% of fatal collisions and alcohol in 38% of collisions for which files were available for analysis by the RSA for the period 2008 - 2012.   </p>  <p>  While 2015 (together with 2012) had the joint lowest number of road deaths at 162 persons since records began in Ireland there was an increase in 2016 to 187.  I am determined that we will reverse this trend in road deaths we saw last year. I held a Special meeting of the Ministerial Committee on road safety earlier this month, and I very much welcome the assurance by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at that meeting that there will be an increase of 10% in the traffic corps during the course of 2017 with more check points and greater enforcement of traffic law and that road safety enforcement is a priority in the 2017 Garda Policing Plan.</p></reply>

Recently I met with the Chair of the Company who briefed me on the very serious situation the Company faces and how the Board is resolved to address the situation and to restore the company to a sustainable position.   Last week the Company issued an invitation to trade unions to commence discussions on the available options. Bus &Eacute;ireann faces a difficult situation and the discussions which the Company has invited trade unions to commence will require consideration of a range of difficult issues.</p>  <p>  I am however firmly of the belief that difficult issues such as this can only be resolved through open, constructive and realistic engagement between the company and its employees and I encourage both sides to engage constructively on the matter.</p></reply>

Under new powers provided to the Garda under the Road Traffic Act 2014, the Garda (since June 2015) can now arrest drivers who are detected driving while disqualified.  Such drivers, following conviction in court, face a maximum fine of &euro;5,000 and/or six months' imprisonment. The Garda can also detain, remove and store the vehicle used by such a driver under section 41 of the Road Traffic Act 1994.  Furthermore, non-surrendering of a licence is an offence.</p>  <p>  Enforcement of  road traffic laws are a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and I very much welcome the assurance by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at a Special meeting of the Ministerial Committee on road safety, which I held on 12th January, that there will be an increase of 10% in the traffic corps during 2017 resulting in more check points and greater enforcement of traffic law and that road safety enforcement is a priority in the Garda Policing Plan for 2017. </p>  <p>  During the passage of the Road Traffic Act 2016 through the Houses of the Oireachtas, the Road Safety Authority submitted proposals for "naming and shaming disqualified" drivers. This is considered to be an effective tool in dealing with the issue of drivers continuing to drive following a disqualification. While it was not possible to accommodate the necessary provisions in that Act, I hope  to bring proposals on this in the forthcoming Road Safety Authority Bill, which is currently being developed by my Departmental officials.</p></reply>

The consultation is being undertaken in response to public concern at the resale of tickets for major entertainment and sporting events at a price often well in excess of their face value.  Though ticket resale has been the subject of considerable comment, there is a lack of reliable information about important aspects of the practice, including its incidence, the sources of tickets put up for resale, and the prices achieved, as opposed to advertised, on the secondary ticket market.  The aim of the consultation is to provide us with a better understanding of the issue and to help us identify the practical measures that might be taken to give consumers fairer access to tickets in the future. </p>  <p>  The consultation paper sets out, and seeks views, on a number of possible measures that might be taken by the parties involved in the organisation of entertainment and sporting events and in the primary and secondary ticket markets, and by Government, to ensure that fans who wish to attend major entertainment or sporting events do not have to pay inflated prices to do so.  I would encourage all interested parties - consumers, performers and their representatives, promoters, sporting bodies, primary ticketing services providers, secondary ticket marketplaces and others - to respond to the consultation.  Following the consultation process, the possible options for future action will be fully assessed.  While legislation to regulate ticket resale is among the measures that will be considered, it is imperative that any such legislation will be effective and targeted and will not give rise to unwelcome unintended consequences such as driving ticket resale underground or diverting it to other countries.</p></reply>

Both are available free of charge on my Department&rsquo;s website (www.djei.ie).</p><p>Prior to and at the time of commencement, the Companies Registration Office (CRO) ran a number of information campaigns in the national newspapers; urban radio and digital media.  In addition, a number of articles were published in the Chamber of Commerce&rsquo;s Business Editorial Quarterly, a publication which is circulated to all of its members.  The Registrar of Companies wrote directly to every company director in April 2015 and updated the CRO website to comprehensively address issues arising from the implementation of the Act.</p><p>The Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement (ODCE) also issued a number of information booklets (available free of charge at<i></i>on issues ranging from the principal duties of directors and company secretaries to those of companies&rsquo; members and shareholders.  </p><p>In addition, my Department provided a number of presentations to various stakeholders in a number of locations across Ireland; participated in seminars and workshops and engaged directly with representative organisations on issues that may have arisen during the transition period and implementation of the Act. </p><p>I am satisfied that there is good awareness concerning the implementation of the Companies Act 2014 in the business community.  This is evidenced by the fact, for example, that by 30 November 2016 (the date when the transition period from the &lsquo;old&rsquo; company law to the &lsquo;new&rsquo; company law came to an end and any private limited company that required an objects clause had to actively re-register with the CRO) over 45,000 Designated Activity Companies (dacs) have formally re-registered with the Companies Registration Office pursuant to the Act. </p></reply>

In this way Irish exports to global markets can be maintained and increased despite challenges in any one individual market. </p><p>One of the key implications of the Brexit vote is that Irish firms will need to find new international markets.  Research Development and Innovation (RDI) capabilities and activity will create the greatest competitive advantage for Irish firms and Enterprise Ireland is ready to work with companies commencing RDI activities for the first time or increasing their existing levels of innovation or ready to collaborate with others to achieve step changes in capabilities that could never be achieved alone. </p><p>Enterprise Ireland currently helps companies to innovate and develop new products and services in two main ways:</p><p>1. In-Company Research, Development &amp;amp; Innovation Support</p><p>This comprises of direct supports for R&amp;amp;D activity within Irish firms, and supports for companies to build R&amp;amp;D capability and acquire new technology through licensing.  This activity is an important element in supporting companies to bring new products to market and to drive down costs through product and process innovation. This funding supports projects which have the potential to develop novel products and services with a clear competitive advantage in their target market thus enabling companies to increase employment through sustainable and substantially increased sales. </p><p>In light of the need for SMEs to engage in more RDI and to make increasingly nimble strategic shifts Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s in-company RDI supports are being refined so as to be even more responsive to company needs.  For example, Enterprise Ireland recently started supporting &lsquo;Business Innovation&rsquo; projects which allow for the development &amp;amp; implementation of new services delivery, production methods and substantive changes to the business model of a company.</p><p>2. Collaboration with the Higher Education Sector &amp;amp; with International Partners</p><p>In order for Irish businesses to remain sustainable and competitive, they need to be constantly reviewing their levels of innovation to ensure that their products and processes are leading edge.  The barriers to this happening include:</p><p>the potential high costs of R&amp;amp;D</p><p>the associated risk of undertaking R&amp;amp;D</p><p>low capability in businesses to undertake R&amp;amp;D in-house</p><p>access to, and affordability of capital equipment </p><p>Enterprise Ireland operates a range of collaboration supports to help companies mitigate these issues by supporting them to engage with higher level researchers to undertake collaborative research for the benefit of the company.  In this way Enterprise Ireland helps to unlock the skills and expertise of higher level research so that companies can access solutions to their challenges that are beyond their current capabilities and thus improve their economic competitiveness. Enterprise Ireland also helps companies to identify leading edge international partners and researchers and to secure valuable sources of non-exchequer RDI funding such as Horizon 2020 (over &euro;150M secured for Irish companies and academic each year) and the European Space Agency (around &euro;10M in RDI related contracts to Irish companies each year). </p><p>On January 9th of this year, Enterprise Ireland published its 2017-2020 Strategy &ndash; Build Scale, Expand Reach. The strategy builds on the success of recent years and sets new, ambitious targets for export growth and jobs.</p><p>In terms of research, development and innovation, key priorities for Enterprise Ireland over this period will include: </p><p>Driving innovation in Irish enterprise to unprecedented levels through new supports to reach the target of &euro;1.25bn in R&amp;amp;D expenditure per annum by 2020.</p><p>Increasing connections between its client companies and the international innovation ecosystem</p><p>Increasing access to Irish public sector procurement opportunities through the Small Business Research Innovation Fund (SBIR) as a means of validating innovative products/services with international application potential</p><p>Implementing a new Innovation Toolkit to support identification of innovation opportunities by its client companies</p><p>Driving greater connectivity between investment and technology networks to transfer knowledge, skills and Intellectual Property (IP)</p><p>Showcasing client innovation capabilities to inspire more innovation investment.</p></reply>

It is a time bound co-funding arrangement with resources of &euro;29.7m from 2013 to 2017.  The aim of the ABC Programme is to test and evaluate prevention and early intervention approaches to improve outcomes for children and families living in poverty in 13 areas of disadvantage.</p>  <p>  The ABC Programme was preceded by the Prevention and Early Intervention Programme (PEIP) (2007-2013) in which three sites participated: Preparing for Life Programme, Youngballymun, and the Childhood Development Initiative Tallaght. Youngballymun received &euro;15m as a participant in the Prevention and Early Intervention programme.  The total original funding for Youngballymun under the ABC programme was &euro;5m bringing the total funding received by Youngballymun under both programmes to &euro;20m. </p>  <p>  Owing to their earlier transition into the ABC programme, Youngballymun and the other two sites were contracted to deliver services in their areas until mid-2016. In July of 2016, my Department and co-funder The Atlantic Philanthropies furnished additional funding to Youngballymun of &euro;500,000 to enable the organisation to extend its service provision for a further year, to end July 2017 bringing their total budget under the ABC Programme to &euro;5.5m. </p>  <p>  My Department is currently working with ABC programme managers to identify the full running costs for each site to end December 2017 with a view to ensuring all sites are extended to end 2017.  My Department also anticipate seeking additional funding in the 2017 estimates process to meet the Programme for Government commitments and ensure findings from the ABC Programme Evaluation can be fully considered in meeting those commitments.  </p>  <p>  I look forward to the continued engagement of Youngballymun, and all other ABC sites with my Department as we work towards the implementation of quality prevention and early intervention initiatives in order to achieve our shared goal of improving the lives of children and families throughout the country.</p></reply>

In practice, this provided for the retention of 4,069 personnel spread countrywide based in barracks and 16 other locations.  As part of the subsequent re-organisation, all RDF units have been disestablished and amalgamated within PDF units.  The re-organisation has provided significant advantages in terms of training and development with PDF units having Reserve components rather than the previous parallel structure.  Reserve units are supported by their parent PDF unit and the 16 units outside of PDF installations are supported by dedicated full time PDF personnel. </p>  <p>  There are, therefore, no plans to stand down the Reserve.  On the contrary, in the White Paper on Defence 2015, the Government recognises the important role that the Reserve Defence Force has played in contributing to Ireland&rsquo;s defence capability, and in particular, to the spirit of voluntary service which has been the hallmark of the Reserve.  The Government appreciates the service of the members of the Reserve and the White Paper on Defence is clear that there is a continued requirement to retain and develop the Reserve.  In that regard, the White Paper also sets out a developmental path for the RDF.  It provides that the overarching establishment of the Army Reserve (AR) and Naval Service Reserve (NSR) is to be set at 4,169 personnel, consisting of 3,869 Army Reservists and the expansion of the establishment of the four NSR Units from currently 200 personnel to 300. </p>  <p>  Initiatives for the Reserve outlined in the White Paper include the following:</p>  <p>  - The potential to utilise the Reserve in a voluntary unpaid capacity will be progressed in consultation with the Representative Associations.</p>  <p>  - Consideration will be given to activating Reserve Sub-Units for short periods of training with PDF Units or other support tasks.</p>  <p>  - Specialist members of the RDF will be placed on a panel, to be known as the Specialist Reserve and, subject to their availability, they will be considered as an option to meet specialist skills shortages.</p>  <p>  - The terms and conditions of membership of the First Line Reserve will be revised to include capping the length of service of members, reactivating annual paid training and introducing criteria for retention as an effective member.  The case for the current gratuity will also be examined.</p>  <p>  - Consideration will be given to establishing a database of former members of the Army Reserve, Naval Service Reserve, First Line Reserve and Permanent Defence Force who could be called upon to volunteer in a crisis situation, by listing these as an &ldquo;Inactive Reserve&rdquo;. </p>  <p>  The strength of the Reserve Defence Force (RDF) at the end of December, 2016 (the latest date for which figures are available) was 2,049 effective personnel.  As the Deputy will be aware, a key challenge is to recruit, train and retain sufficient personnel to meet the reserve establishment provided for in the White Paper.  It is necessary to strike an appropriate balance in terms of both PDF and RDF recruitment so as to deliver the desired effects in terms of maintaining the capacity of the Defence Forces to undertake all roles assigned by Government and to advance the single-force concept.  However, within that framework and having regard to the training capacity of the Defence Forces, I am anxious to accelerate the rate of recruitment to the RDF.</p>  <p>  For administrative reasons, the military authorities were unable to provide the data sought.  Figures relating to RDF recruitment, the numbers in service and discharges for the years 2013 to 2016 will be provided to the Deputy within the allowed timeframe.</p></reply>

As I outlined in my answer dated 17<sup>th</sup>January 2017, I met with the Veterans Organisations on the 15<sup>th</sup>December last, and whilst I reiterated to them that there are no plans to award the 1916 Centenary Commemorative Medal to Veterans, it was proposed that a further meeting be held between the Department and the Veterans Organisations to explore alternative means of recognition including exploring further the Department&rsquo;s existing proposal of issuing a commemorative plaque.  The meeting between senior officials of the Department and the Veterans Organisations will be arranged shortly.</p></reply>
