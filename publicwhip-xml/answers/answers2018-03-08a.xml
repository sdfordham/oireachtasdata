    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-03-08a.7.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1365" speakername="Paul Kehoe" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018030800038#WRA00600"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</p>  <p>  Defence Forces pay is increasing in accordance with public sector pay agreements. The focus of these increases is weighted in favour of those on lower pay. Members of the Permanent Defence Force have received the pay increases due under the Lansdowne Road Agreement.</p>  <p>  In addition, following negotiations with PDFORRA on behalf of their members, improved payscales for general service recruits and privates who joined the Permanent Defence Force post 1 January 2013, were backdated to 1 July 2016 and paid in August 2017. </p>  <p>  The Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 provides for further increases in pay ranging from 6.2% to 7.4% over the lifetime of the Agreement with the benefits, once  again, weighted towards those on lower pay. By the end of the Agreement the payscales for all public servants earning up to &euro;70,000 will be restored to the levels that existed prior to the Financial Emergency legislation.</p>  <p>  The first incremental increase under this agreement of 1% in annualised salaries due from 1 January 2018 has been paid to enlisted personnel.</p>  <p>  Following these revisions in pay, the starting pay for a newly qualified three star private, and their Naval Service equivalent, (inclusive of military service allowance) is &euro;27,257, gross annual earnings, with scope for further income from duty allowances. </p>  <p>  The non-standard time and attendance patterns of military personnel and the rates of remuneration associated with a wide spectrum of duties undertaken by such military personnel can vary across the different branches of the Defence Forces and, consequently, does not facilitate the general application of a threshold rate of pay.</p></reply>

The Department provides policy direction, centralised training through the Civil Defence College, administrative support and guidance and centralised procurement of major items of uniform and equipment in support of local authority Civil Defence efforts. Civil Defence is funded by way of a grant from the Defence Vote. Funding for Civil Defence operations at local level is shared on a 70/30 basis between the Department of Defence and local authorities by way of an annual grant to each authority. </p>  <p>  Civil Defence services are delivered through the Civil Defence Officer (CDO) of the relevant Local Authority for that area. The CDO is a full time employee of the local authority and is responsible for the day-to-day management of Civil Defence matters under the overall direction of the relevant Chief Executive of the local authority.</p>  <p>  It is a matter for each local authority, in this case Longford County Council, to decide when to deploy their Civil Defence Unit. The Department of Defence does not have a role in these decisions. I understand that a number of other local authorities stood down their Civil Defence Units for short periods during the recent severe weather.</p></reply>

Irish Naval vessel L.&Eacute;. Niamh, subsequently  deployed to the Mediterranean from October to December 2017.  </p>  <p>  In the course of its deployment in Operation Sophia last year, the crew of L.&Eacute;. Niamh were engaged in both security tasks and in responding to Safety of Life at sea events (search and rescue) in the area of operation.  In addition the core task of the mission including, gathering information on oil smuggling, patrols focusing on countering illegal arms trafficking, surveillance operations with the purpose of intercepting smugglers and people traffickers and monitoring the effectiveness of the Libyan Navy &amp;amp; Coastguard activity from a stand-off distance the L.&Eacute;. Niamh also undertook search and rescue operations. </p>  <p>  All activities undertaken by the Naval Service as part of Operation Sophia in the Mediterranean adhere to and are conducted in accordance with international law, including human rights, humanitarian and refugee law and the principle of non-refoulement.  The status of individuals rescued at sea is a matter for the authorities at the point of disembarkation in accordance with relevant international law and conventions on the trafficking in Human Beings.  </p>  <p>  Where people have been rescued by Operation Sophia, they are brought to a safe port or transferred to another vessel to be taken to a safe port. In that regard,  the ports of embarkation for migrants rescued by Operation Sophia have been in Sicily.</p>  <p>  Operation Sophia has so far contributed to the apprehension of 130 suspected smugglers and traffickers, removed approximately 520 boats from criminal organisations availability, contributed to almost 290 Safety of Life at Sea events  and rescued over 42,400 migrants. </p>  <p>   At the Government  Meeting of  27 February last , I secured approval for the deployment in 2018 of a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force  to serve once again as part of Operation Sophia. Arrangements are currently being made for two Irish naval vessels to deploy consecutively under rotation for a period of approximately 32 weeks in total.</p></reply>

The Act provides, among other things, that a person must be an Irish citizen before a passport can be issued to him/her. In order to meet this legal requirement, each person must demonstrate an entitlement to Irish citizenship in his/her passport application. The applicant referred to was born in January 2017. Any possible claim to citizenship for the applicant is governed by the terms of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956 as amended (&ldquo;the 1956 Act&rdquo;). Section 6A of the 1956 Act provides that a person born in the State on or after 1 January 2005, where neither parent is an Irish or British citizen or otherwise entitled to reside in the State or Northern Ireland without restriction at the time of that person&rsquo;s birth, may claim citizenship by birth in the State (and thereby establish eligibility for an Irish passport) only where a parent has been lawfully resident in the State for three years of the four years preceding his/her birth.In such cases, proofs of lawful residence in the State are required to determine if a parent has the required three year residence. For non-EU parents, permission to remain in the State recorded on passports, and/or registration cards, as issued by the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), are acceptable proofs of a parent&rsquo;s lawful residence in the context of a passport application.</p><p>In this case, the applicant&rsquo;s parent has not provided proof of lawful residence in the State for the required time-period prior to the child&rsquo;s birth. Without such proof of lawful residence, an entitlement to citizenship and therefore eligibility for an Irish passport, has not been established. </p><p>Citizenship &ndash; including naturalisation &ndash; comes under the remit of the Department of Justice and Equality (Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service) and further information is available on the website <i>www.inis.gov.ie</i></p></reply>

Sharing information on complaints of sexual harassment must be handled with the utmost sensitivity and diligence by all organisations.</p>  <p>  Reporting obligations for organisations are detailed within funding contracts. While the Department is not a statutory body with specific responsibility for handling cases of sexual exploitation or abuse, it does expect to be informed of issues that indicate a breakdown of any organisational systems necessary for effective programme delivery. Compliance issues linked to these systems are addressed on a case-by-case basis as they arise, in line with contractual obligations of funding.</p>  <p>  As part of the process of ongoing grant monitoring and oversight, the Department will continue to request updates from partners on compliance with their policies and procedures.</p>  <p>  The Department is convening a meeting with NGOs receiving Irish Aid funding, to share good practice in the area of safeguarding and to continue to strengthen systems to prevent and respond effectively to cases of sexual exploitation and abuse.</p>  <p>  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade&rsquo;s processes for dealing with bullying, sexual harassment and related complaints are outlined in the 2015 &ldquo;Dignity at Work&rdquo; policy &ndash; an anti-bullying, harassment and sexual harassment policy for the Civil Service.  The policy aims to promote respect, dignity, safety and equality in the workplace.

The Council discussed developments in Moldova, the situation in Venezuela and the Middle East Peace Process.EU Foreign Ministers had a comprehensive discussion on Moldova and adopted Council Conclusions taking stock of the reform process and setting out expectations for the period ahead.  Ministers also discussed developments in Venezuela, expressing deep concern at the deteriorating humanitarian, economic, political and social situation. During the discussion on the Middle East Peace Process, I updated my EU counterparts on my recent meetings in Washington with US Secretary of State Tillerson and Jared Kushner. I urged that the EU play a strong and proactive role in any new peace initiative and encouraged the Palestinians and other regional interlocutors to engage constructively on this.  EU Ministers met over lunch with Foreign Ministers from Palestine, Jordan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Morocco, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, and the discussion focussed on the Middle East Peace Process.</p></reply>

Most of these people have settled in refugee camps that have existed in the region since the early 1990s where conditions are precarious and ongoing international efforts will be required to sustain those living in the camps.  An estimated 120,000 Rohingya remain in Northern Rakhine and humanitarian access there has been heavily restricted.</p>  <p>  The exodus of refugees has been accompanied by credible claims of serious human rights violations by the Myanmar Security Forces.  These include reports of killing of civilians, sexual and gender based violence, arbitrary arrests, and the burning of Rohingya villages. Recent allegations of the existence of mass graves within Rakhine State have also emerged, which is deeply concerning.  </p>  <p>  As access to the region remains restricted, independent confirmation of these reports remains challenging but they absolutely reinforce the need for the Myanmar authorities to heed the calls by the international community for access to the area by humanitarian workers and the media in order to assess and verify what has occurred in the region especially since last August.</p>  <p>  It also reinforces the importance of the role being played by the U.N. special envoy on human rights in Myanmar, Yanghee Lee, who has said that the military's operations against the Rohingya bear "the hallmarks of a genocide". </p>  <p>  There has been widespread international condemnation of the actions of the Myanmar Security Forces in Rakhine State and the international community is continuing to press for a positive and long-term solution to the situation in Rakhine State, including for the Rohingya community, and for the large number of refugees who are now situated in Bangladesh.  For our part, Ireland has sought to deploy political pressure with the aim of easing the crisis through bilateral contacts in Myanmar and via participation in the EU and UN.</p>  <p>  Recently, Ireland was an active participant in the formulation of new EU Council Conclusions on Myanmar adopted by the EU Foreign Affairs Council on 26 February.  These conclusions condemn the human rights violations in Myanmar, and call for the implementation of the findings of the Advisory Commission on Rakhine State.  The conclusions also call for the voluntary, safe and dignified return of refugees to Myanmar.  The new Council conclusions invite High Representative/Vice-President Mogherini to make proposals for targeted restrictive measures against senior military officers of the Myanmar armed forces responsible for serious human rights violations.  I would like to express my support of these conclusions and hope that the forthcoming proposals will send a clear message to those in military control in Myanmar.</p>  <p>  At the UN, the 37th Session of the UN Human Rights Council is currently ongoing in Geneva where the situation in Myanmar is one of the main topics of discussion.  The Council will receive an update from UN Special Rapporteur to Myanmar Yanghee Lee as well as the UN mandated independent international fact-finding mission.  Minister of State Cannon addressed the Council on 27th  February and outlined Ireland&rsquo;s ongoing concerns in the matter.</p>  <p>  Ireland and the international community are also continuing to support the humanitarian response to the refugee crisis.  In October 2017, the EU hosted a Pledging Conference on the Rohingya Refugee Crisis in Geneva where Ireland pledged &euro;2 million in direct support.  We provided &euro;1 million 2017, and an additional &euro;1 million has been allocated for 2018. In addition, Ireland&rsquo;s Rapid Response Corps have provided humanitarian expertise to the international response. </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to liaise closely with EU and other international partners to contribute to the international response to this issue including through our Embassy in Thailand who are closely monitoring the situation.</p></reply>

They also involve the clear and persistent abuse of human rights, especially of women and girls.  These acts undermine, as is the perpetrator&rsquo;s intention, the peace, stability, and prosperity of Nigeria and its neighbouring countries.</p>  <p>  I reiterate the Government&rsquo;s deep concern regarding Boko Haram&rsquo;s practice of kidnapping women and girls, including the 200 girls known as the &lsquo;Chibok girls&rsquo;, kidnapped in Borno State in 2014.  Around 50 of these girls are believed to remain in Boko Haram custody.</p>  <p>  The risk of abduction in the north-east of Nigeria remains high, as the reports that over 100 girls were kidnapped last month from a Girls Science and Technical School in Dapchi, Yobe State.  I unreservedly condemn this act.</p>  <p>  The safe release of the kidnapped girls and their early return to their communities, and to education, must be a priority.</p>  <p>  Ireland, with our EU partners, continues to support the Nigerian Government in its efforts against Boko Haram, and reiterates the need for a regional approach to ensuring that those in captivity are released, and to prevent future occurrences.  The EU has pledged up to &euro;50 million in support Nigeria and neighbouring countries. </p>  <p>  The Embassy of Ireland in Abuja closely monitors the situation on the ground, and works with national and international partners in Nigeria in the coordination of support.</p></reply>

I met with Mr Barnier on a number of occasions since taking office, most recently in Brussels on 26 February, in advance of the General Affairs Council (Article 50) on 27 February.  Mr Barnier gave me an overview of the draft Withdrawal Agreement, which was published two days later, on 28 February.  We spoke in detail about the draft protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, which is an integral part of the proposed withdrawal agreement.  The draft protocol gives legal effect to the commitments agreed in December&rsquo;s EU-UK Progress Report on avoiding a hard border and protecting the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts. It also includes elements on rights and on the Common Travel Area.  Since they were agreed in December, we have been working closely with the Task Force to ensure that commitments and guarantees provided by the UK are reflected faithfully in draft Withdrawal Agreement.  I took the opportunity to express our satisfaction to Mr Barnier with how this process was managed.  </p><p>I also reiterated to Mr Barnier, the Government&rsquo;s preference to resolve the Irish-specific issues through the wider future relationship agreement between the EU and the UK.  We agreed that while both Ireland and the EU stand ready to consider proposals from the UK on specific solutions, it is necessary to have legal certainty on the backstop as part of the Withdrawal Agreement.  This is a default and will only be triggered if the commitments made by the UK in phase one cannot be delivered through the wider future relationship agreement or specific solutions.</p><p>The draft Withdrawal Agreement also sets out the legal terms of the transition period, which will be hugely important for Ireland in giving certainty to individuals and businesses.  We welcome that the EU has proposed that the whole of the EU <i>acquis</i>will apply during the transition, which means that the status quo will be preserved with the aim of avoiding any gaps or cliff edge effects between the UK leaving the EU and when a future relationship agreement enters into force.</p><p>Michel Barnier&rsquo;s comment on the transition period reflects that fact that the negotiations between the EU and the UK on the transition period, which is an integral part of the draft Withdrawal Agreement, are progressing but have yet to be completed.  I welcome that these discussions are proceeding at pace.  The EU Task Force will provide an update on progress to the Member States following the latest round of negotiations, which conclude this week. </p><p>The European Council was clear in December that negotiations in phase two, which includes transitional arrangements, can only progress as long as all commitments undertaken in phase one are respected in full and translated faithfully into legal terms.  As transitional arrangements are an integral part of the Withdrawal Agreement, agreement on transition will depend on agreement on the entire Withdrawal Agreement, including on the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland.  The aim is to conclude the withdrawal agreement by October and this is why it is important the UK engages positively with the Commission&rsquo;s draft in the coming weeks and months.  However, I am hopeful that the European Council in March will be in a position to register good progress on agreeing the fundamental elements of the transitional arrangements as proposed by the EU. </p></reply>

This finance can come from many sources, including governments, international development NGOs, multilateral bodies, international finance institutions, philanthropists, and the private sector.</p><p>Regardless of the source, the Government position is that funding for international development should be transparent and used to improve the delivery of development results for the eradication of poverty.  The OECD Development Assistance Committee, of which Ireland is an active member, has strict criteria for what can be counted as official development aid. </p><p>Ireland is a member of the International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI) &ndash; a multi-stakeholder initiative that seeks to improve the transparency of aid, development and humanitarian resources in order to increase their effectiveness in tackling poverty.  IATI publishes information on the financial flows of over 650 organisations, including international aid agencies, and as such is an important tool in mitigating potential conflicts of interests. </p><p>Ireland is committed to implement fully our international commitments on aid transparency, and to publish aid data in the internationally agreed format.  In addition, Ireland is subject to regular peer review by the OECD Development Assistance Committee: this important quality assurance mechanism has consistently found Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to continued untied aid to be exemplary.</p><p>Robust Irish legislation and guidelines assist in ensuring transparency and accountability standards in Irish Aid funded organisations, including making declarations on the source, amount and purpose of all other funding they receive, as well as the submission of annual audited accounts.</p><p>The Irish Charities Regulatory Authority has important guidance to prevent conflict of interest arising as a result of aid agencies receiving funding from major financial investment corporations or banking institutions.

It does this primarily through the UN Security Council.  The Council has a variety of tools at its disposal to address threats to international peace and to contribute towards the settlement of disputes and conflicts: it has the power to authorise military action, deploy peacekeeping and political missions, and to impose sanctions against non-compliant States. </p>  <p>   On the one hand the Member States of the UN undoubtedly have a central role to play in addressing conflict.  On the other hand, ongoing crises in various parts of the world serve to underscore the need for the UN to be much more effective.  Ireland will continue to support efforts to reform the UN&rsquo;s structures and systems.</p>  <p>  In 2015, the then UN Secretary General initiated three major review exercises which were aimed at improving the overall effectiveness of the UN&rsquo;s response to conflict.  The findings from the high level policy reviews on (1) UN Peace Operations, (2) Peacebuilding Architecture and (3) Women, Peace and Security were published and are in the process of being implemented.  Ireland engaged fully with all three reviews, calling for the recommendations to be discussed and implemented as part of our broader calls for UN reform. In 2017 the current Secretary-General moved forward on these reviews and has sought to reform the Organisation&rsquo;s policies and structures.</p>  <p>  Ireland has also called for reform of the UN Security Council and has consistently stated that the Council needs to become more representative, more transparent and more effective.  Ireland believes  that such reform is critical to ensuring that the UN maintains its efficacy and respected position within the rules based international system architecture.</p>  <p>  Every Member State requires a UN that works better &ndash; in the field, where Peacekeeping Missions and Development work are ongoing, and at Headquarters, where the management and administrative systems need to be improved.  In an era of international uncertainty there is a pressing need for a multilateral system that is strong and that can successfully address the many global challenges facing us.  </p>  <p>  In addition to participating in the ongoing discussions and reviews, Ireland will continue to advocate for reform of the UN&rsquo;s structures and systems to ensure it is enabled to fulfil its crucial role in the maintenance of international peace and security, prevention, reduction and resolution of conflict and the upholding of fundamental human rights.</p></reply>

Ireland pays particular attention to the needs of those enduring protracted crises, and those in crises no longer at the forefront of public attention but where needs are great.</p>  <p>  Over the past five years, significant levels of funding have been provided in response to the crises in Syria (over &euro;90 million), South Sudan (over &euro;50 million) and Somalia (over &euro;34 million), in particular. Ireland is also a significant funder of the responses in Iraq, Yemen and the Democratic Republic of Congo which, together with Syria, are currently categorized under the highest level alert in the humanitarian system.  Ireland provided &euro;2 million for humanitarian needs in Haiti in 2016, in response to Hurricane Matthew. </p>  <p>  In addition to our earmarked funding to these and other crises, Ireland is a strong supporter of the UN&rsquo;s Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF), a global pooled funding mechanism which is one of the fastest and largest enablers of life-saving humanitarian action for people affected by conflict and natural disasters around the world.  The CERF, to which Ireland contributed &euro;22 million in 2017, enables humanitarian partners to immediately jump-start or scale up urgent aid in new or rapidly deteriorating emergencies. </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s humanitarian assistance is needs-based, with an annual categorisation of need identifying the highest priorities for the allocation of funds and highlighting areas where early funding is required: in addition, Ireland can and does respond to emergency situations, such as the devastation caused by the Caribbean hurricanes last year.  </p>  <p>  In 2018, Ireland will continue to provide humanitarian support to the most severe ongoing crises, as well as reacting to sudden-onset crises or sudden spikes in humanitarian need due to conflict or natural disasters.  Our focus on forgotten and underfunded crises will remain, and it is anticipated that we will continue to provide support to crises such as the Central African Republic, Eritrea, Lake Chad and Sudan.  Ireland will also continue to work to ensure that our assistance is targeted at and reaches those in greatest need, in the most efficient and effective way possible.</p></reply>

In the case of the European Union, Foreign Ministers remain focused on implementation of the June 2017 Council Conclusions on Counter-terrorism and on the contribution that the EU can make through external action to preventing and countering terrorism.  Engagement with third countries to prevent violent extremism and to strengthen their capacity to detect and prevent terrorism, in full compliance with international law and human rights, remains at the core of the EU&rsquo;s strategy.</p><p>The EU has also placed considerable emphasis on strengthening cooperation with its immediate neighbours in the Western Balkans, Turkey and the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) countries through dedicated political dialogue and the cultivation of effective counter-terrorism partnerships.</p><p>The European Council has also expressed its support for practical cooperation and coordination between the EU and the United Nations in the area of counter-terrorism and has welcomed the establishment in June 2017 of the UN Office of Counter-Terrorism by the UN Secretary General.  This office will provide strategic leadership to United Nations counter-terrorism efforts.</p><p>The former UN Secretary General&rsquo;s comprehensive <i>Plan of Action to Prevent Violent Extremism</i>and subsequent reports are an important and welcome contribution to addressing the threat posed by international terrorism.  These highlight the need to examine drivers of violent extremism through dialogue and conflict prevention, strengthening governance and the rule of law, gender equality and empowering women, community engagement and youth empowerment, and education and skills development.</p><p>Two initiatives in which Ireland has been particularly engaged are the effects of violent extremism on Youth and Women, and their role in countering such extremism. Ireland was strongly supportive of the adoption by the Security Council of Resolution 2250 on Youth, Peace and Security.  This Resolution confirmed that inclusion and participation by young people must lie at the core of efforts by the international community to respond to crises and conflict.</p><p>Women, Peace and Security is also a key element in the fight against violent extremism.  Ireland has long been a supporter of the full implementation of Resolution 1325 on Women Peace and Security and its successor Resolutions.  Women can have an important role to play in helping to counter radicalisation and extremism in their families and communities, and also have the potential to be radicalised themselves. Therefore, effective Countering Violent Extremism strategies must take cognisance of the particular situation and perspectives of women and girls into consideration.</p></reply>

In the Rome Declaration of March last year, EU Heads of State and Government pledged &lsquo;to listen and respond to the concerns expressed by our citizens&rsquo; and to &ldquo;address the challenges of a rapidly changing world.  &rdquo;Having gone through a series of crises in recent years, including the Eurozone crisis, terror attacks, Migration and Brexit, the EU is now moving in a more positive direction characterised by economic growth across all member states.  To maintain this impetus we need to ensure that the EU is delivering practical improvements to the lives of citizens through policies to promote jobs and growth and by addressing internal and external challenges such as migration and international terrorism.  Completion of the single market and Digital Single Market &ndash; which Ireland has been pushing &ndash; are two ways of doing that.</p>  <p>  The public launch of the Citizens&rsquo; Dialogue on the Future of Europe by the Taoiseach in November marked the formal start of a process designed to engage the Irish public directly in a debate on the kind of Europe they want to see evolve.  Our aim is to raise awareness of the issues involved; to encourage participation in the debate; and to use this engagement process to formulate Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to the wider European debate and specifically to President Tusk&rsquo;s Leaders&rsquo; Agenda, an ambitious work programme for the EU for the next two years. </p>  <p>  Engaging meaningfully with citizens across the Union; listening and responding to their concerns is the best means of ensuring support for our work on EU issues.</p></reply>

This steadfast support and solidarity has been demonstrated through the adoption of the various EU negotiating positions which have consistently identified the need to address these unique challenges as a Union priority for the Brexit negotiations.  This point was again highlighted recently at the General Affairs Council (Art. 50) of 27 February where I was once again impressed by the level of support expressed by the EU Chief Negotiator Michel Barnier and all Member States around table for Ireland.  All our EU partners share the need to ensure that the commitments and guarantees provided by the UK in phase 1 of the Brexit negotiations on protecting the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts and the gains of the peace process, including on avoiding a hard border, and on maintaining the Common Travel Area, must be given legal effect in the draft Withdrawal Agreement.     Going forward, I and my officials will continue to set forward Ireland&rsquo;s position in the negotiations at EU level through the General Affairs Council (Art. 50) and the relevant preparatory bodies as well as through bilateral contacts with the EU Taskforce and EU27 counterparts.  My ongoing programme of bilateral engagement has, most recently, included my meetings with EU Chief Negotiator Michel Barnier and European Parliament Brexit Coordinator Guy Verhofstadt separately in Brussels on 26 February, Foreign Minister Linas Linkevi&egrave;ius of Lithuania on 13 February and Foreign Minister Angelino Alfano of Italy, on 14 February last. </p></reply>

The conflict, which is now in its seventh year, has cost an estimated half a million lives.  Over 13 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance inside Syria, including close to 3 million people trapped in besieged and hard-to-reach areas.  Over 6 million people are displaced internally, and a further 5.5 million have fled to neighboring countries and the wider region. The recent increase in violence in Syria, in particular the vicious siege of Eastern Ghouta which has cost the lives of hundreds of civilians, underscores the extent to which an end to the violence is urgently needed in order to relieve the suffering of the Syrian people.  Ireland and the EU support the UN-led Geneva peace process and the work of UN Special Envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura.  I was present at a UN Security Council briefing on Syria in New York in late February, where UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres appealed for an immediate suspension of violence in Eastern Ghouta to allow for the delivery of humanitarian aid, and for evacuations.  I fully support those calls.</p>  <p>  Since 2012, Ireland has contributed over &euro;90 million to the humanitarian response to the Syria crisis, including &euro;25 million in 2017 alone.  In addition, the EU and its Member States have to date mobilised more than &euro;10.4 billion for humanitarian, stabilisation and resilience assistance inside Syria and in neighbouring countries, making the EU the largest single donor to the effort.  The EU will host another donors&rsquo; conference for Syria in April of this year.  The EU is also supporting the Turkey Refugee Facility in response to the almost 3 million refugees being hosted in that country, and &euro;3 billion has been committed to this by the EU between 2016 and 2019, with Ireland providing &euro;22.9 million. </p>  <p>  Under the terms of the Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP), administered by the Department of Justice, Ireland has also committed to accept up to 4,000 refugees from the region. To date, almost 2,000 people have already arrived. </p>  <p>  In Iraq, the UN estimates that 11 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance, as the country begins to recover from the atrocities committed by Da&rsquo;esh.  The current number of internally displaced persons requiring humanitarian assistance stands at almost 3.3 million, of which 1.6 million are living outside of camps in host communities.  In addition, there are an estimated 240,000 Syrian refugees in Iraq. The EU is working to support the Iraqi government on stabilisation and reconciliation.</p>  <p>  Since 2014, Ireland has provided over &euro;8 million in humanitarian assistance to Iraq, including &euro;2 million in 2017 for the UN Iraq Humanitarian Pooled Fund.  Via our annual contributions to the EU budget, Ireland also supports the EU&rsquo;s humanitarian response to the situation in Iraq, which amounts to &euro;650 million since 2014. </p>  <p>  The situations in both Syria and Iraq were discussed by EU Foreign Ministers at the Foreign Affairs Council meeting in Brussels in December. At the Foreign Affairs Council in January, Foreign Ministers adopted the new EU strategy for engagement with Iraq, and initiated a formal exchange on migration with Iraq.  EU Foreign Ministers discussed the situation in Syria at their informal meeting in February of this year, and at the February Foreign Affairs Council.</p>  <p>  Through the EU, Ireland has long advocated for and supported the development of durable solutions for refugees and internally displaced persons, and in tackling the root causes of displacement.  Through our engagement with conflict-affected countries, refugee hosting countries and our EU counterparts, Ireland supports conflict resolution and development in Syria, Iraq and the wider region. </p></reply>

The aims of the Eastern Partnership are to promote peace and stability in the region and to enhance economic and political integration between the participating countries and the EU.  The model of cooperation with each of the participating states has been tailored to meet their needs and priorities and those of the EU.  The fifth Eastern Partnership Summit which took place on 24 November 2017 adopted a roadmap setting out future priorities for the initiative, entitled &ldquo;Eastern Partnership - 20 Deliverables for 2020".  A range of short and long-term milestones including improving connectivity, energy efficiency, support to SMEs, engaging with youth and a broadened outreach to civil society are identified.</p>  <p>  The EU is committed to assisting Ukraine in delivering its ambitious and wide-ranging programme of reform and has provided unprecedented levels of support.  This assistance includes loans, budget support, humanitarian aid, technical assistance as well as important trade preferences, granted under the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement which came into force in 2016. In addition, the EU is helping to reform the civilian security sector through its Advisory Mission to Ukraine.</p>  <p>  In terms of the situation in eastern Ukraine, the EU continues to support diplomatic efforts to secure full implementation of the Minsk peace agreements, which provide the basis for a comprehensive settlement of the four year conflict.</p>  <p>  The High Representative is travelling to Ukraine on 12 March in advance of a discussion on Ukraine at the upcoming Foreign Affairs Council.  Together with our EU partners, we have called on all parties to the conflict to support and facilitate the vital work of international humanitarian organisations, to ensure their protection and to allow the provision of assistance to the civilian population in accordance with international law. </p>  <p>  Georgia signed an Association Agreement and a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement with the EU in 2014 which entered into force on 1 July 2016.  By removing customs tariffs and quotas and by comprehensively approximating trade-related laws and regulations to the standards of the European Union, the Agreement offers Georgia a framework for boosting trade and economic growth.  As part of this process, Georgia has committed to undertaking a number of reforms, including on democratic development and fundamental freedoms, on constitutional and parliamentary reform, and anti-corruption reforms.</p>  <p>  On 24 November 2017, in the margins of the Eastern Partnership Summit, Armenia signed a Comprehensive and Enhanced Partnership Agreement with the EU which facilitates political, economic and sectoral cooperation. By intensifying political dialogue and improving cooperation in a broad range of areas, the Agreement lays the foundations for more effective engagement with Armenia. </p>  <p>  Ireland remains a committed member of the EU and of the Eurozone.  Now, more than ever, our membership of the EU must remain at the heart of our engagement with the world. Continuing access to a Single Market of 500 million consumers is vital to the well-being of the Irish people and EU membership has been central to Ireland&rsquo;s economic and social development.  To this end, membership of the EU also includes trading arrangements with third countries such as those with Ukraine, Georgia and Armenia.</p></reply>

In December EU Foreign Ministers had the opportunity to reiterate this during an informal breakfast meeting with Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel before the Foreign Affairs Council.The EU side used the meeting to underline to PM Netanyahu our key concerns about the Middle East Peace Process and the occupation, including actions by his government that we consider to be unhelpful or indeed unacceptable.  We also reiterated that our position on Jerusalem has not changed &ndash; that it must be the capital of two states, following an agreement between the parties on all of the final status issues.  In this context, I raised the need for a freeze on settlement construction, and pressed Israel on the issue of a two-state solution.</p>  <p>  I also raised a number of specific concerns about the occupation with the Israeli authorities during my visit to the region in January of this year. </p>  <p>  I believe that these opportunities for dialogue are extremely useful, including as an opportunity to raise issues of concern. </p>  <p>  The Government does not support a policy of &ldquo;Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions&rdquo;, or BDS, in relation to Israel.  I firmly believe that such an approach is counter-productive, and that it will not help to increase ordinary Israelis' understanding of the sound basis for international concern about the impact of the occupation.  Such an all-encompassing policy also conflates the State of Israel, on the one hand, and illegal settlements on Palestinian land, on the other.  I believe it is important to be clear on the distinction between the two, and I know that many Israeli citizens are also opposed to the construction of settlements. </p>  <p>  In relation to the decision taken by Israel to exclude members of certain groups supporting BDS, I believe that this action also does not help to build a better mutual understanding or to move the situation forward. Israel is of course entitled to decide who it allows into its territory, as is any other state.  However, I believe that excluding people simply for critical opinions they hold is not the usual practice of a democracy.  Moreover, such exclusions also have the effect of denying people access to the occupied Palestinian territory which Israel controls. During my visit to the Middle East in January, I raised this issue directly with Prime Minister Netanyahu. </p>  <p>While the Government does not support a policy of &ldquo;Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions&rdquo;, it is a legitimate and non-violent political viewpoint, albeit one regarded in Israel as hostile, and   one that I fundamentally disagree with.</p></reply>

The proposed EastMed pipeline project, which would connect East Mediterranean resources to Greece via Cyprus and Crete, could contribute to the aim of creating a single European market for gas and a reliable and safe transmission network capable of meeting Europe's current and future needs.  In that regard, increased cooperation and consultation between Greece and Cyprus and their maritime neighbours, including Israel, is a natural step.  The European Union, and its Member States, have close economic ties with Israel, and positive relations with Israel in a range of areas.  This partnership, and the areas on which we cooperate, do not prevent us from raising concerns with Israel on a range of issues, especially the many concerns related to Israel&rsquo;s occupation of the Palestinian Territory.</p>  <p>  In discussions with my EU colleagues, most recently at the Foreign Affairs Councils in January and February this year, I have stated that the EU must continue to work actively in support of progress in the Middle East Peace Process, but also that the EU must continue our own work, including work on the ground, to help preserve and create the political and physical space in which the two state solution can be achieved.</p></reply>

We also stand ready to consider proposals from the UK on specific solutions.  At the same time, it is necessary to have legal certainty on the backstop as part of the Withdrawal Agreement.  This is a default and will only be triggered if the commitments made by the UK in phase one cannot be delivered through the wider future relationship agreement or specific solutions.</p>  <p>  Since the principles and commitments set out in the Joint Report from the EU and UK negotiators published on 8 December 2017 were agreed, including on citizens&rsquo; rights, the financial settlement and on the Irish specific issues, my team and I have been working closely with the Task Force to ensure that the agreements reached in December are given legal effect through the Withdrawal Agreement.  I am fully satisfied with how this process was managed by the EU Chief Negotiator, Michel Barnier and I welcome the proposed Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland. </p>  <p>  The draft protocol, which is an integral part of the proposed Withdrawal Agreement, gives legal effect to the commitments on avoiding a hard border, protecting the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts and also includes elements on rights and on the Common Travel Area.  </p>  <p>  In terms of protecting North South cooperation and avoiding a hard border, and in line with the commitments agreed by the UK in paragraph 49 of the joint progress report of December, the protocol proposes a common regulatory area in which the UK in respect of Northern Ireland would stay fully aligned with those rules of the Customs Union and Single Market necessary to achieve these objectives.  It also proposes the establishment of a joint EU-UK specialised committee to ensure the ongoing effective implementation of the protocol, including a robust oversight and enforcement mechanism.  This is important both in terms of the implementation of the protocol but also to ensure the integrity of the Single Market and Customs Union and Ireland&rsquo;s place in them.  </p></reply>

Recent developments in Stormont are of serious concern to all of us who want to see the establishment of a functioning, power-sharing Executive in Northern Ireland, and the other Institutions of the Good Friday Agreement.</p>  <p>  The devolved, power-sharing Institutions of the Good Friday Agreement are the only way forward for Northern Ireland, and are urgently required.</p>  <p>  The Government is now working with the British Government to decide on the best way forward.  The Irish and British Governments, as co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement, have a shared responsibility to make every effort to seek a route that will get the devolved institutions operating as soon as possible. </p>  <p>  The Taoiseach has spoken with Prime Minister May to emphasise the Government's full commitment to the Good Friday Agreement, and its determination to secure the effective operation of all its institutions.  I am in very regular contact with Secretary of State Karen Bradley as we seek a way forward from the current impasse in the discussions to secure the formation of a new Executive.</p>  <p>  As co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement, the Irish and British Governments have an obligation to uphold and protect the letter and spirit of that Agreement.  The Good Friday Agreement remains the indispensable framework for providing stable, inclusive, power-sharing government for all the people of Northern Ireland and for sustaining our interlocking relationships - within Northern Ireland, on the island of Ireland and between the UK and Ireland.</p>  <p>  Last week, the Taoiseach and I welcomed the publication of the draft EU-UK Withdrawal Agreement, including the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, which gives legal effect to the commitments made in December.  This represents the practical and logical outworking of the commitments made by the UK, including the protection of the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts and the gains of the peace process and avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland.</p>  <p>  The Government has also welcomed Prime Minister May&rsquo;s reiteration in her speech last Friday, of the UK&rsquo;s commitment to the Good Friday Agreement and to the agreement reached last December, including on avoiding a hard border.  These commitments need to be translated into concrete proposals and the Government looks forward to UK setting out its proposals in more detail in the Article 50 negotiations.</p>  <p>  The Government is of course acutely conscious that the Article 50 negotiations could impact on the urgent need to secure the formation of a new Executive.  The negotiations on the UK&rsquo;s exit from the European Union are fundamentally political in nature, as is the formation of a power-sharing Executive and the operation of the devolved institutions. </p>  <p>  It is incumbent on all with responsibilities in both processes to work to ensure that the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts can operate fully and effectively, consistent with the resounding democratic endorsement of the Agreement by the people, North and South on this island, almost 20 years ago.</p>  <p>  That will remain the Government&rsquo;s unrelenting focus and solemn duty as a co-guarantor of the Agreement, as we continue to engage to address the impact of the UK exit for the island of Ireland and support the urgent resumption of the devolved institutions in Belfast.</p></reply>

However, you should be aware that the provision of insurance and the price at which it is offered is a commercial matter for insurance companies, which has to be based on a proper assessment of the risks they are willing to accept. Neither I nor the Central Bank can interfere in this process.</p>  <p>  My Department carried out a review of policy in relation to flood insurance in 2016, which formed part of the Interdepartmental Flood Policy Coordination Group Interim Report, as approved by Government in November 2016.  As part of the review, a number of possible approaches were examined including those in other jurisdictions.  For example, an Insurance Pool with State Indemnification similar to Flood Re in the UK was considered, however it was concluded that such an approach would lead to additional levies being imposed on all household insurance policies at a time of increasing insurance costs, and could potentially lead to a considerable financial exposure to the Exchequer.</p>  <p>  The review recommended the continuation of the existing policy approach which has been in place since 2010, and confirmed by Government again in November 2016.  This policy is focused on the development of a sustainable, planned and risk-based approach to dealing with flooding problems. This in turn should lead to the increased availability of flood insurance. To achieve this aim, there is a focus on:  </p>  <p>  - prioritising spending on flood relief measures by the Office of Public Works (OPW) and relevant local authorities,  </p>  <p>  - development and implementation of plans by the OPW to implement flood relief schemes, and   </p>  <p>  - improving channels of communication between the OPW and the insurance industry, in order to reach a better understanding about the provision of flood cover in marginal areas.  </p>  <p>  This strategy is complemented by a Memorandum of Understanding between the OPW and Insurance Ireland, the representative body for insurance companies in Ireland, which provides for the exchange of data in relation to completed flood defence schemes which should provide a basis for the increased provision of flood insurance in areas where works have been completed.  In this regard, the Insurance Ireland/OPW working group, which the Department of Finance attends, now meets on a quarterly basis to support the information flow and improve the understanding of issues between both parties. </p>  <p>  Directly related to the above is the OPW Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme. The CFRAM Programme focussed on 300 Areas for Further Assessment (AFAs) including 90 coastal areas, mainly in urban locations nationwide, identified as being at potentially significant risk of flooding. The proposed feasible measures, both structural and non-structural, identified for AFAs are outlined in Flood Risk Management Plans.  </p>  <p>  I am advised by the OPW that the finalised Flood Risk Management Plans were submitted to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in Summer 2017 for an independent review of the environmental assessments.  Having now received the outcomes of the independent review, the Commissioners of Public Works expect in the coming weeks to formally submit the Flood Risk Management Plans for my approval.</p>  <p>  Finally, you should be aware that a consumer can make a complaint to the Financial Services Ombudsman in relation to any dealings with a Financial Services or Insurance provider during which they feel they have been unfairly treated.  In addition, individuals who are experiencing difficulty in obtaining flood insurance or believe that they are being treated unfairly may contact Insurance Ireland which operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to insurance.</p></reply>

It will provide the Central Bank with powers to hold and maintain this database and to carry out statistical analysis of movements in private motor insurance claims costs and trends.  Drafting of the Bill has been given priority status in the Government&rsquo;s Legislative Programme for this term, and has been commenced by Parliamentary Counsel.  In addition, the Joint Oireachtas Committee for Finance, Public Service and Reform, and Taoiseach, informed me recently that no further pre-legislative scrutiny is required on the draft Scheme.  I would like to thank the Committee for this and am hopeful that the Government will be able to publish the final Bill in the coming months.</p>  <p>  In relation to the CSO data,  I am informed that it uses a variety of detailed profiles (including car age, car model, driver experience, driver history) sent directly each month to motor insurance companies that represent a substantial portion of the market share.  The profiles each company receives remain consistent each month so that the CSO can use a continuous "like with like" comparison in the best way possible and in this regard each company is sent a representative set of profiles for their consumer base.  The risks vary based on the detail contained in each of the profiles in order to get a larger spread of the realistic market.  </p>  <p>  Finally, the most recent CSO data (for January 2018) indicates that private motor insurance premiums have decreased by 17% since peaking in July 2016.  I am satisfied that the CSO statistics indicate a particular direction of travel in relation to pricing and also a greater degree of stability on an overall basis.  However, I do accept that these figures represent a broad average and therefore there are some people who may still be seeing increases.  However, I am hopeful that this greater stability in pricing will be maintained and that premiums should continue to fall from the very high levels of mid-2016.</p></reply>

On the 20th February, the bank gave details of the portfolio of loans which is under consideration. The bank confirmed in these details that 18,000 properties are linked to loans which are within the scope of Project Glas, 14,000 of which are private dwelling homes (PDHs). </p>  <p>  In relation to PDHs, the bank highlighted just under &euro;2 billion is accounted for by loans which are typically owned by customers who have not engaged with the Bank, whose mortgages are unsustainable or who have been unable to meet the terms of various treatments put in place. Of this portion of Project Glas, some account holders have not engaged with the Bank for over 7 years and on average the loans are over 3.5 years in arrears. Many of these account holders have made no payments at all for years. </p>  <p>  In addition, the bank confirmed that Project Glas also includes some loans which are currently subject to agreed forbearance measures, but which remain categorised as NPLs and this, therefore needs to be addressed.</p>  <p>  For clarity, I should highlight for the deputy that I cannot stop loan sales by the banks, nor can I interfere with the composition of such sales. This applies even for the banks in which the State has a shareholding. These decisions are the responsibility of the Board and management of the banks which must be run on an independent and commercial basis. Their independence is also protected by Relationship Frameworks, which are legally binding documents that I cannot change unilaterally. These frameworks were insisted upon by the European Commission to protect competition in the Irish market. Loan sales do not require my consent, though the banks are required to formally consult with me if the disposals are of a sufficient scale. In the case of the PTSB loan sale, the bank has not yet consulted with me but will do so in due course.</p>  <p>  It is worth noting that no loan has been sold yet and it won&rsquo;t be known how many loans will be sold for a number of months, nor the composition of these loans. In addition, it is not known to whom the loans will be sold. However, I want and expect PTSB to be transparent with their customers when it comes to this sale process as it evolves.</p>  <p>  It is important to highlight that there are no changes to the rights or obligations of a customer whose loan is sold by a bank. All terms and conditions attached to their mortgage contract remain in place. In addition, as credit servicing firms servicing loans on behalf of unregulated entities are required to comply with the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA), all protections under the CCMA are unchanged. The customer is in the exact same position as they were before their loan was sold. In relation specifically to restructured loans, including splits, any purchaser will be obliged to honour the terms of the restructure agreement, should such loans be included in the final sale. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the protections currently in place, I have made it clear that I am prepared to engage with Deputies from other parties in an effort to see if we can strengthen and enhance the protections, in a sensible manner, that are already in place for mortgage holders.</p>  <p>In relation to its powers, the Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach is entitled to request an explanation or confirmation from any of the banks on any matter and I would expect such a request to be dealt with to the satisfaction of the Committee. The Deputy may be aware that the Committee invited PTSB to attend a meeting on 27th February to discuss Project Glas. In its response to the Committee, the bank highlighted that it was not appropriate for executives to attend a meeting on the date proposed, as the bank is currently in a closed period ahead of the publication of its annual results on 14th March. However, the bank did state it was agreeable to meeting with the Committee on an alternative date sometime after 14th   March. I understand that PTSB is awaiting a response from the Committee with a proposed alternative date.</p></reply>

Neither I nor the Central Bank can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on the risks they are willing to accept.</p>  <p>  However, it is acknowledged that pricing in the motor insurance sector has been subject to a lot of volatility in recent years, from a point where some premiums appeared to be priced at an unsustainably low level to the more recent experience of large increases.</p>  <p>  Indeed, the problem of rising motor insurance premiums was the main impetus for the establishment of the Cost of Insurance Working Group in July 2016.  Its Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance was published in January 2017.  That Report made 33 recommendations with 71 associated actions to be carried out in agreed timeframes, as set out in the Action Plan. </p>  <p>  These recommendations were formulated to address the issue of increasing motor insurance costs, whilst taking account of the need to ensure a financially stable insurance sector.  This stability aspect is important, as we do not want to find ourselves in a situation again where particular firms drive prices down to a level that is unsustainable and which ultimately results in insolvency.</p>  <p>  Work is ongoing on the implementation of the recommendations by the relevant Government Departments and Agencies and there is a commitment within the Report that the Working Group will prepare quarterly updates on its progress.  </p>  <p>  The fourth such update was published on the Department&rsquo;s website on 20 February 2018 and shows that of the 46 separate deadlines set during 2017 within the Action Plan, 39 have been met.  Substantial work has also been undertaken in respect of the nine action points categorised as &ldquo;ongoing&rdquo;.  </p>  <p>  I believe that the ongoing implementation of the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance, in parallel with the implementation of the Working Group's Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance &ndash; which was published in January 2018 &ndash; will make a difference to the pricing of insurance premiums over the next 12 or so months.  It is envisaged that the implementation of all the recommendations cumulatively, with the appropriate levels of commitment and cooperation from all relevant stakeholders, will achieve the objective of delivering fairer premiums for consumers.  I also believe that the Setanta judgment, by finding that MIBI is not liable to meet third party claims, removes a major uncertainty from industry, which I would expect to be reflected in pricing in the short to medium term.</p>  <p>  Finally, it should be noted that the most recent CSO data (for January 2018) indicates that private motor insurance premiums have decreased by 17% since peaking in July 2016.  While the CSO statistics indicate a greater degree of stability on an overall basis, these figures represent a broad average and therefore there are many people who may still be seeing increases.  However, I am hopeful that this greater stability in pricing will be maintained and that premiums should continue to fall from the very high levels of mid-2016.</p></reply>

This shift in focus has been accompanied by a new strict definition Europe-wide of what constitutes an NPL by the European Banking Authority (EBA) which means that certain restructures are deemed NPL even if customers are meeting the revised payment schedule.  </p><p>Officials in my Department met with staff of the SSM at the highest level on two occasions since late 2016. In the course of their discussions they outlined the background and history to the restructuring effort in Ireland and questioned the logic of now classifying some types of restructured loans, including certain split mortgages, as NPL indefinitely. While my Department has been informed that the SSM is looking into the regulatory treatment of split mortgages across a number of European member states I have no evidence at this point that this categorisation is going to change.  Banks may be able to reduce their NPLs to levels acceptable to the SSM without the requirement for loan sales and/or the loan sales involving restructured mortgages.</p><p>I have been advised by the Central Bank of Ireland that as per the EBA Implementing Technical Standards on supervisory reporting and the ECB Guidance on non-performing loans, non-performing exposures are those that satisfy either or both of the following criteria:</p><p>1.material exposures which are more than 90 days past-due;</p><p>2.the debtor is assessed as unlikely to pay its credit obligations in full without realisation of collateral, regardless of the existence of any past-due amount or of the number of days past due.</p><p>There are instances where an exposure can remain a non-performing exposure, notwithstanding the fact that there are agreed forbearance terms with a lender and the borrower is meeting those terms. This can include instances attributable to the criteria outlined in point 2 above. </p><p>Again to reference the EBA Implementing Technical Standards on supervisory reporting;</p><p>When forbearance measures are extended to non-performing exposures, the exposures may be considered to have ceased being non-performing only when all the following conditions are met:</p><p>1.the extension of forbearance does not lead to the recognition of impairment or default; </p><p>2one year has passed since the forbearance measures were extended;  </p><p>3.  there is not, following the forbearance measures, any past-due amount or concerns regarding the full repayment of the exposure according to the post forbearance conditions. The absence of concerns has to be determined after an analysis of the debtor&rsquo;s financial situation. Concerns may be considered as no longer existing when the debtor has paid, via its regular payments in accordance with the post-forbearance conditions, a total equal to the amount that was previously past-due (if there were past-due amounts) or that has been written-off (if there were no past-due amounts) under the forbearance measures or the debtor has otherwise demonstrated its ability to comply with the post forbearance conditions.</p><p>These specific exit criteria shall apply in addition to the criteria applied by reporting institutions for impaired and defaulted exposures.</p><p>The full ECB guidance on NPLs and the EBA Implementing Technical Standards are published here:</p><p><i></i></p><p><i></i></p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, most loan agreements include a clause that allows the original lender to sell the loan on to another firm. The Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2015 (&ldquo;the 2015 Act&rdquo;) was introduced to fill the consumer protection gap where loans are sold by the original lender to an unregulated firm. Under the 2015 Act, if the firm who bought loans from the original lender is an unregulated firm, then the loans must be serviced by a &lsquo;credit servicing firm&rsquo; which is regulated by the Central Bank.  Credit Servicing Firms are typically firms that manage or administer credit agreements such as mortgages or other loans on behalf of unregulated entities. </p><p>Credit servicing firms must act in accordance with the requirements of Irish financial services law that applies to &lsquo;regulated financial service providers&rsquo;. This ensures that consumers, whose loans are sold to another firm, maintain the same regulatory protections that they had prior to the sale, including under the various statutory Codes of Conduct issued by the Central Bank such as the Consumer Protection Code 2012, Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears 2013, and the SME Regulations.  Contractual terms are not changed by the sale of the loan.</p><p>Provision 3.11 of the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code 2012(the Code) requires that, where a regulated lender intends to transfer all or part of its &lsquo;regulated activities&rsquo; to another regulated entity, it must provide advance notification to both the Central Bank and affected consumers.  Specifically, a lender must provide a consumer with at least 2 months&rsquo; notice before transferring all or part of its loan book covered by the Code to another person, including where the transferee is an unregulated entity. Where the transferee is an unregulated entity, the Code requires that the regulated lender also notify the consumer of the name of the regulated entity that will be &lsquo;servicing&rsquo; the loan for the unregulated entity.  In the event that there is a change in the credit servicing firm, the existing credit servicing firm must also notify the Central Bank and the consumer in advance, in accordance with the timelines set out under Provision 3.11 of the Code.</p><p>A Government Decision last week agreed to support the FF Private Members Bill in relation to the regulation of loan owners.  The Government will work with Deputy McGrath and the House to improve the Bill, with a view to addressing any difficulties that might arise with it as currently drafted. I have also asked the Central Bank to carry out a review of the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) to ensure it remains as effective as possible and for the review to be completed as soon as possible.</p></reply>

Growth is broad based with net exports also contributing positively to growth in the first three quarters.</p>  <p>  The strength of underlying domestic demand is being felt in the labour market. Employment growth remains strong with an annual rate of 2.8 per cent recorded in the first three quarters of 2017, representing the creation of almost 60,000 additional jobs. </p>  <p>  Data published in the first quarter of this year indicate that:</p>  <p>  - Expansion in the manufacturing  and services sectors continued in February with the Purchasing Managers&rsquo;  Index for the sectors recording their fifty seventh and sixty seventh  successive month of expansion respectively. </p>  <p>  - The Consumer Sentiment Index was 110.4 in January, well above its long run average. </p>  <p>  - The seasonally adjusted monthly unemployment rate for February was 6.0 per cent, down from 7.3 per cent in February 2015.  As a result, the unemployment rate has fallen by almost two thirds since its peak of 16 per cent in early-2012.</p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2018, my Department is forecasting real GDP growth of 3.5 per cent this year. The strong performance of the labour market is set to continue in the short term; my Department is projecting that an additional 48,000 jobs will be created this year. Strong employment growth is expected to further reduce the unemployment rate, to around 5 &frac12; per cent by the end of this year. The limited data so far available for 2018 has generally been positive and indicate that the momentum in the economy has been maintained. </p>  <p>  However, there are a number of risks at present including the UK&rsquo;s decision to exit the EU. In addition, the sharp appreciation of the euro-sterling rate is posing significant challenges, particularly for the traditional sector, the tourism sector and areas sensitive to cross-border trade.</p>  <p>  My Department has incorporated the estimated impact of a &ldquo;hard&rdquo; Brexit into the macroeconomic forecasts published as part of Budget 2018. This shock is projected to reduce GDP growth by approximately &frac34; of a percentage point on average per annum over the 2019-2021 period. These forecasts were endorsed by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council (IFAC). The Department will publish updated forecasts as part of the April 2018 Stability Programme Update.</p>  <p>  These projections were informed by Department of Finance &ndash; ESRI joint research which modelled the medium to long term impact of Brexit on Ireland. In particular, the forecasts were guided by the &ldquo;WTO scenario&rdquo;, whereby the UK and EU do not conclude a bilateral trade agreement and instead the UK exercises its rights under the Most Favoured Nation (MFN) clause of the WTO. </p>  <p>  The best way to mitigate risks such as Brexit is to improve the resilience of the economy. The Government will play its part by continuing to implement competitiveness oriented policies &ndash; including those that address emerging bottlenecks &ndash; and ensuring that the public finances continue to be managed in a prudent fashion.</p>  <p>  In addition, as part of the Government&rsquo;s trade strategy, Ireland Connected, a number of measures have been set out to specifically address Brexit related issues, including diversification of markets for indigenous exporters. Greater market diversification must be part of the policy response, so that dependence and exposure to the UK market is reduced.</p></reply>

In addition, my Department&rsquo;s macroeconomic forecasts have continued to take account of the impact of Brexit.</p>  <p>  While all available research has indicated that the potential impact of Brexit on the Irish economy will be significant and negative under all scenarios, with output below what it otherwise would have been in a no Brexit scenario, it is important to note that the economy will continue to grow, albeit at a slower pace than it otherwise would have.  It should also be noted that all of these research studies are conducted on a &ldquo;no policy change basis&rdquo;, in other words they do not account for efforts that the Government has made, and will continue to make, to prepare the economy for Brexit. </p>  <p>  Indeed, the best way and most immediate policy under the Government's control to counter the likely negative economic impacts of Brexit is to prudently manage the public finances in order to ensure that Ireland's economy continues to remain competitive in the face of future economic headwinds.  In this context, the Government has taken a number of important steps to prepare our economy for the challenges of Brexit, including in Budgets 2017 and 2018, the Action Plan for Jobs, the Ireland Connected trade and investment strategy, and the preparation of a new 10-year Capital Plan.</p>  <p>  As discussions on the future relationship between the UK and the EU progress, my Department will continue to monitor the economic impacts of Brexit, including carrying out relevant analysis and contingency planning for the future challenges ahead.</p></reply>

Progress can also be seen in our improved international rankings. For example, Ireland ranks 6th in the IMD World Competitiveness Rankings. This compares to a ranking of 24th at the height of the crisis in 2011.</p>  <p>  The restoration of Irish competitiveness since 2008 has been hard-won through productivity improvements and wage and price moderation. It is important that this competitiveness is preserved and continues to support growth. This is all the more important given the significant economic risks we face both internationally and domestically. </p>  <p>  On the external side, the impact of Brexit is being felt through the strengthening of the euro against sterling. Similarly, gains from the fall in oil prices may unwind in the future. Other international risks include the policy stance in the US, including in relation to taxation. In terms of domestic risks to competitiveness, housing supply pressures are of particular concern. The housing sector can adversely impact on competitiveness through for example, restricting the mobility of labour.</p>  <p>  These risks highlight the importance of maintaining competitiveness oriented policies, including sustainable fiscal policies, to help address emerging uncertainties. With regard to housing, a number of initiatives were introduced in Budget 2018, in addition to the measures implemented in &lsquo;Rebuilding Ireland: An Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness&rsquo;,  to tackle the underlying problem of  a supply shortage:</p>  <p>  - Home Building Finance Ireland (HBFI) will boost the supply of debt funding to residential development. Utilising up to &euro;750 million from the Irish Strategic Investment Fund, HBFI will fund new housing construction across all regions in the country. </p>  <p>  - An additional &euro;500 million was allocated to the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government to build a further 3,000 social housing units by 2021. </p>  <p>  - An extra &euro;75 million is also being provided under the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund. </p>  <p>  - Budget 2018 included an increase to the rate applicable under the vacant site levy in the second and subsequent years of vacancy. This will provide a strong incentive to landowners to either develop their land or sell them for the purpose of development.</p>  <p>  In summary, competitiveness has improved but we must not be complacent. My Department will continue to monitor all relevant developments closely as we seek to ensure that the economy is best placed to weather economic shocks to the greatest extent possible. Competitiveness is an important factor in this.</p></reply>

A critical part of the Government&rsquo;s strategy and preparations for the negotiations has been to ensure that our priorities and unique concerns are heard and understood across Europe.  The very strong acknowledgement of our unique circumstances by the EU 27, both in the European Council Negotiating Guidelines and the European Commission Draft Withdrawal Agreement is reflective of this engagement. We continue to work closely with the Commission Task Force and our EU 27 partners. As we prepare for the European Council later this month, and for the negotiation period ahead, the Government will continue to engage politically to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s interests are kept to the forefront of the negotiations as much as possible.</p></reply>

We are, therefore, a solution to firms who wish to passport their financial services to the EU market post-Brexit.</p>  <p>  Government and the State Agencies have been working closely with industry to implement the international financial services strategy (IFS2020). The vision of IFS2020 is for Ireland to be recognised as the global location of choice for specialist international financial services.  </p>  <p>  We have made great progress in becoming a strong hub for international financial services business over the years &ndash; Ireland is currently home to some of the world&rsquo;s largest IFS companies across all the sectors.  We are a global lead in aviation leasing and financing and also among the top destinations for funds (asset management) and FinTech, building on our strengths in technology and financial services.</p>  <p>  A number of firms have already indicated that Ireland is their preferred choice for their European headquarters, including many household names. In respect of relocations post Brexit not every firm will want to make the relocation decision public for commercial and other reasons.</p>  <p>  We have a very strong offering and we've done extensive work to promote that offering.</p></reply>

The Department of Finance is the lead Department on 8 of the 168 actions in the plan. In the latest status report on the Action Plan, published on January 25th, 7 of the 8 actions associated with my Department were complete. The one remaining action &ndash; concerning private sector investment in social housing through long term leases &ndash; is on schedule. </p>  <p>  Increasing supply is key to addressing the current difficulties in the housing market. In addition to the measures contained in the Action Plan, Budget 2018 contained a number of initiatives aimed at increasing the supply of new homes. Home Building Finance Ireland (HBFI) will boost the supply of debt funding to residential development. Utilising up to &euro;750 million from the Irish Strategic Investment Fund, HBFI will fund new housing construction across all regions in the country. An additional &euro;500 million was allocated to the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government to build a further 3,000 social housing units by 2021. An extra &euro;75 million is also being provided under the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund. Budget 2018 included an increase to the rate applicable under the vacant site levy in the second and subsequent years of vacancy. This will provide a strong incentive to landowners to either develop their land or sell them for the purpose of development. In Budget 2018, I also increased the rate of stamp duty applicable on the sale of non-residential property from 2% to 6%. This measure will help incentivise a re-balancing of activity away from non-residential commercial construction in favour of residential activity. It will also ensure that the construction sector is able to meet the demand for residential property, while avoiding overheating in the sector as a whole.</p></reply>

Credit Servicing Firms are typically firms that manage or administer credit agreements such as mortgages or other loans on behalf of unregulated entities.</p>  <p>  Under the 2015 Act, if the firm who bought loans from the original lender is an unregulated firm, then the loans must be serviced by a &lsquo;credit servicing firm&rsquo;. Loans can be sold by regulated entities to entities that are not regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland (the Central Bank).</p>  <p>  Credit servicing firms must act in accordance with the requirements of Irish financial services law that applies to &lsquo;regulated financial service providers&rsquo;. This ensures that consumers, whose loans are sold to another firm, maintain the same regulatory protections that they had prior to the sale, including under the various Statutory Codes of Conduct issued by the Central Bank.</p>  <p>  A Government Decision last week agreed to support the FF Private Members Bill in relation to the regulation of loan owners.  The Government will work with Deputy McGrath and the House to improve the Bill, with a view to addressing any difficulties that might arise with it as currently drafted.</p>  <p>  The Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) is a key part of the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection framework. It is a statutory Code first introduced by the Central Bank in February 2009, with the current CCMA becoming effective from 1 July 2013. The CCMA provides a strong consumer protection framework, aimed specifically at the process to be followed by relevant firms with each borrower by reference to that borrower&rsquo;s individual circumstances, to ensure borrowers in arrears or pre-arrears in respect of a mortgage loan secured on a primary residence are treated in a timely, transparent and fair manner by reference to that&rsquo;s borrower&rsquo;s individual circumstances.</p>  <p>  Regulated entities, including credit servicing firms servicing loans on behalf of unregulated loan owners, are all required to comply with the CCMA. The overriding objective of the CCMA is to ensure the fair and transparent treatment of consumers in mortgage arrears or pre-arrears, and that due regard is had to the fact that each case of mortgage arrears is unique and needs to be considered on its own merits. The CCMA recognises that it is in the interests of borrowers and regulated firms to address financial difficulties as speedily, effectively and sympathetically as circumstances allow. It sets out the mortgage arrears resolution process (MARP), a four-step process that regulated entities must follow:</p>  <p>  Step 1: Communicate with borrower;</p>  <p>  Step 2: Gather financial information;</p>  <p>  Step 3: Assess the borrower&rsquo;s circumstances; and</p>  <p>  Step 4: Propose a resolution</p>  <p>  Each regulated entity must consider the borrower&rsquo;s situation in the context of the solutions they provide, which may differ from firm to firm. The CCMA includes requirements that arrangements be sustainable and based on a full assessment of the individual circumstances of the borrower and that repossession be used only as a last resort. The CCMA does not prescribe the solution which must be offered. A regulated entity may only commence legal proceedings for repossession where the firm has made every reasonable effort under the CCMA to agree an alternative repayment arrangement with the borrower or his/her nominated representative, and the specific timeframes set out in the CCMA have been adhered to or the borrower has been classified as not co-operating.</p>  <p>  Details on the protections and options available to a borrower under Irish personal insolvency legislation can be found at isi.gov.ie, should this be of relevance. This aspect of the framework of protections for individuals (including mortgage borrowers) is overseen by the Insolvency Service of Ireland, not the Central Bank.</p>  <p>  Following on from last weeks Government Decision as mentioned above, I have also asked the Central Bank to carry out a review of the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) to ensure it remains as effective as possible and for the review to be completed as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  Finally in relation to repossessions by those who purchase loan books (non-Banks), the following Central Bank data will be of interest to the Deputy.   </p>  <p>  - In 2015, the total Principal dwelling house (PDH) properties repossessed by Banks was 1,535, this was made up of 1,299 by Banks and 236 by Non-Banks.</p>  <p>  - In 2016, the total PDH properties repossessed by Banks was 1,693, this was made up of 1,452 by Banks and 241 by Non-Banks.</p>  <p>  - In 2017 (up to end September), the total PDH properties repossessed by Banks was 1,106, this was made up of 982 by Banks and 124 by Non-Banks.</p>  <p>  Across state agencies, there are numerous bodies and processes in place to assist those in mortgage arrears in the hope of avoiding repossession. The Abhaile service has been established and offers help to borrowers in arrears to find the best solutions and keep them, if possible, in their own homes. This is assisting borrowers, particularly those in longer term arrears. A dedicated adviser will work with borrowers in arrears and their lender to find the best solution for them. Borrowers can get free advice from an expert financial adviser who can help them to work through their financial situation. An Expert adviser could be from MABS or a Personal Insolvency Practitioner (PIP) or an accountant. Borrowers may also need legal advice and under Abhaile they can have a free meeting with a solicitor. If called to court to face repossession proceedings on their home, they will be able to meet a Duty Solicitor at the court. A MABS staff member will also be present at court to help them.</p>  <p>  A Helpline is available Monday to Friday and a face-to-face service which is completely free, confidential and independent is also available in more than 60 MABS locations nationwide.</p></reply>

The SBCI channels its funds through lending partners known as on-lenders. The SBCI currently has three bank on-lending partners and four non-bank on-lending partners.  To the end of December 2017, the SBCI has supported loans totalling &euro;925 million to 22,928 Irish SMEs employing 119,533 people and working capital made up over 11 percent of lending issued.</p><p>The Microenterprise Loan Fund, administered by Microfinance Ireland, is an additional source of credit that provides loans for up to &euro;25,000 to start-up, newly established, or growing micro enterprises employing few than ten people.  Up to the end of Q3 2017, &euro;21m in loans have been approved, supporting 3,336 jobs.</p><p>The Credit Review Office is another government initiative that helps SMEs who have had an application for credit of up to &euro;3 million declined or reduced by the main banks, and who feel that they have a viable business proposition. This is a strictly confidential process between the business, the Credit Review Office and the bank. The Credit Review Office overturns more than 50% of lenders decisions in the appeals it receives.  </p><p>The Government remains committed to the SME sector and sees it as the key engine of ongoing economic growth.  I can assure the Deputy that my Department, working with other relevant Departments, Bodies and Agencies, such as the Credit Review Office, will continue to advance policies to ensure the availability of both bank and non-bank credit so as to ensure that viable Irish SMEs have sufficient access to finance for working capital.</p></reply>

In this regard, the Insurance Ireland/OPW working group, which the Department of Finance attends, now meets on a quarterly basis to support the information flow and improve the understanding of issues between both parties.  </p>  <p>  Finally, you should be aware that a consumer can make a complaint to the Financial Services Ombudsman in relation to any dealings with a Financial Services or Insurance provider during which they feel they have been unfairly treated. In addition, individuals who are experiencing difficulty in obtaining flood insurance or believe that they are being treated unfairly may contact Insurance Ireland which operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to insurance.</p></reply>

Many businesses took prudent measures to ensure the health and safety of customers and staff and closed their businesses for a number of days. </p>  <p>  This is likely to have had some adverse impact on the Irish economy, but it is not yet possible to quantify the extent of that impact. Furthermore, the overall affect will depend on the extent to which economic activity was deferred until the adverse weather had passed. </p>  <p>  The retail sector in particular is likely to have been negatively affected as a result of the weather conditions and this may be reflected in the Retail Sales Index for March. Fortunately, retail sales have been robust over the last year, with 'core' retail sales increasing by 7 per cent on an annual basis in 2017. This growth has been driven by rising household incomes and sustained consumer confidence and these factors will help to mitigate the short term impact of the adverse weather conditions. </p>  <p>  Households, along with businesses and the public sector, will also have incurred additional expenditure, given the additional heating and lighting costs along with the added costs of repairs and maintenance as a result of the weather. </p>  <p>  As set out in Budget 2018, The Department of Finance estimated real GDP growth of 3.5 per cent in 2018. These forecasts were endorsed by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council (IFAC). The Department will publish updated forecasts in April with the Stability Programme Update 2018. </p></reply>

An 18 Step Action Plan was developed in 2016 by the Government CIO in collaboration with the ICT Advisory Board.  Good progress continues to be achieved in implementing the Action Plan and the Strategy which is now also reinforced by the eGovernment Strategy 2017-2020.  </p><p>The eGovernment Strategy 2017 &ndash; 2020 was approved by Government and published in July 2017.  The Strategy is underpinned by the Government&rsquo;s commitment to be open, flexible and collaborative with our citizens and businesses, using digitisation and technology to increase efficiency and effectiveness and constantly improve public services.  Our eGovernment priorities will be taken forward through the delivery of 10 key actions.  A particular focus of the implementation plan is a programme, put in place with public bodies, to progress the adoption of the Public Services Card and its online equivalent MyGovID which offers a single, secure way to verify people looking to avail of public services.  </p><p>The OGCIO is working with public bodies to take forward a significant programme of work related to implementing these strategies some elements of which are set out hereunder.  The first version of a government digital services portal,<i></i><i>,</i>was launched at the end of 2017 and provides an intuitive interface which acts as a simple signposting site to a catalogue of all Government digital services.  In collaboration with the Government&rsquo;s Strategic Communications Unit, the service will continue to be developed, adding more information and functionality for citizens and businesses, and using appropriate consultation within Government and with other stakeholders, including the public and/or their representatives.  </p><p>In addition, my officials are working to progress the Data Sharing and Governance Bill.  The purpose of this Bill is to promote and encourage data-sharing between public bodies by providing a statutory framework for data sharing for legitimate and clearly specified purposes that are compliant with Data Protection legislation; and to improve the protection of individual privacy rights by setting new governance standards for data sharing by public bodies.  Work is also ongoing to build on and promote the use of common data models across Government, such as the Public Service Identity dataset and Eircodes, that underpin our data protection obligations, the provision of digitised and streamlined services, and the linking of data to improve decision making.</p><p>In July 2017 the Open Data Strategy 2017-2022 was published which builds on the substantial achievements made in implementing the Open Data Initiative and sets out a roadmap for continued progress and development.  The concept of Open Data is about making data held by public bodies available freely and easily accessible online for reuse and redistribution.  The initiative aims to create an environment where, by opening up Government data, new opportunities for research, innovation, transparency, engagement and greater efficiency are delivered and realised by public bodies, businesses, researchers and citizens.  Measures to achieve this include a centralised Open Data portal, data.gov.ie, which provides access to official data in open format, development of a Technical Framework to underpin the publication of such data in line with best practice internationally and to ensure it is interoperable, establishment of an Open Data Governance Board to lead the initiative, outreach and engagement with public bodies and other stakeholders.  The deputy may wish to be aware that Ireland has achieved first place in the European Commission's Open Data Maturity assessment for 2017.</p></reply>

Section 9(2) of the Act prescribes that the NSSO is responsible for providing shared services in the civil service, setting standards and developing operational policies in relation to the provision of those shared services and providing guidance and advice on shared services across the public service. </p>  <p>  The NSSO is currently delivering HR and pensions administration shared services to 35,200 civil servants and payroll shared services to 124,600 public servants. The NSSO will begin the provision of finance shared services during 2018 and by 2020 will be delivering finance shared services to 48 public service bodies.   There are shared services projects currently underway in the sectors of Health, Education and Local Government, as well as in the civil service. </p>  <p>  In order to balance scale and risk and establish a co-ordinated approach to shared service policy implementation, the governance for design and implementation of shared services in each sector resides with the sector, not with the NSSO. A cost-benefit analysis is typically required before any investment in shared services is made. </p>  <p>  I am not aware of any current plans to further expand the role of the National Shared Services Office, in 2018, beyond what is currently provided for.</p></reply>

These discussions can then inform Government and Oireachtas considerations on the Budget; </p>  <p>  - The publication of a Mid-Year Expenditure Report that identifies baseline pre-Budget expenditure ceilings; and </p>  <p>  - Circulation of the Tax Strategy Papers in advance of the Budget.</p>  <p>  To enhance the ongoing performance budgeting initiative, which aims to facilitate Oireachtas Committees in holding Ministers and Departments to account for how resources are used, last year my Department published the first Public Service Performance Report. A key objective of this Report is to equip Oireachtas Committees with timely information on what was delivered with public funds for each Department the previous year. The Report on performance in 2017 is currently in preparation. Following on from the pilot programme in relation to equality budgeting, with equality goals and indicators published in the Revised Estimates, the Report will contain an update on the progress and steps that are being taken by Departments to work towards realising their objectives in this area. </p>  <p>  Specifically looking at the equality budgeting initiative my Department will continue to work on the future roll-out and expansion of this initiative and to support Departments participating in the initiative to develop the skills necessary to successfully equality proof relevant policies and programmes. </p>  <p>  As part of my Estimates speech on Budget day in 2016, I announced that a spending review would take place on a three-year rolling basis. The Spending Review in 2017 was the first cycle of a series of selective reviews of the current expenditure base that will remain in place for a 3-year period. The spending review will operate as a separate but parallel process to the Budget and will therefore inform the preparation of the next two Budgets.</p>  <p>  In advance of Budget 2019, the Spending Review in 2018 will examine the next phase of expenditure topics. It is planned that the remaining phase of the Spending Review will be covered the following year.  The primary objective of the Spending Review in 2018 is to build on the work completed in 2017 and continue to reinforce the use of data, evidence and analysis to support decision-making in the Estimates process.</p>  <p>  The work programme of the Committee on Budget Oversight supported by the work of the independent Parliamentary Budget Office also have a very important role to play in the budget scrutiny process.  In that context, I am open to considering proposals agreed by the Committee on the how the budget scrutiny process can be further strengthened.</p></reply>

The Environmental Impact Assessment Report is nearing completion. </p>  <p>  It is envisaged that the scheme will move to formal Public Exhibition in mid 2018, which is the formal statutory public consultation phase of the Scheme development. This will involve a month-long public display of the preferred option and attendant documents. Following this, all comments/observations received will be assessed, and the detailed design of the scheme will be finalised. The next step will be the submission of the scheme for formal Confirmation by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, which should take place later in 2018.  Subject to Ministerial approval, construction should commence in early 2019.</p></reply>

The codes of practice which are relevant to the marketing and display of the National Lottery in and outside National Lottery agents&rsquo; premises are the Sales Code of Practice and the Advertising and Promotion Code of Practice. A copy of the codes can be found on the Regulator&rsquo;s website.</p><p>Under the terms of their appointment, lottery agents are required to comply with the provisions of the above codes as they relate to their activities and the Operator provides lottery agents with guidelines regarding best practice relating to the point of sale placement and display of materials. Under the Sales Code, the Operator is responsible for monitoring lottery agents&rsquo; compliance with their obligations and the Operator, not the Regulator, is responsible for issuing any sanctions or penalties to lottery agents. </p><p>No lottery agents have been found to have sold National Lottery tickets to persons under 18. The sale, or offer for sale, of a ticket to a minor is a criminal offence under section 42(9) of the National Lottery Act 2013. </p><p>The Regulator does regulate the advertising and marketing of the National Lottery by the Operator, including advertising and marketing online. The Advertising and Promotion Code of Practice contains numerous standards designed to maintain the integrity and sustainability of the National Lottery whilst protecting players&rsquo; interests.</p><p>In regard to unclaimed prizes, Clause 6.9.2 of the Licence provides that any expired Unclaimed Prizes shall be forfeited in favour of the Licensee, provided that such Expired Unclaimed Prizes shall be used: solely for the promotion of the National Lottery and/or the Lottery Games (excluding Base Marketing), in a manner determined by the Licensee, which shall include the funding of special draws and additional or top-up prizes; and which may include Incremental Marketing and advertising of the National Lottery and/or Lottery Games; or such other activities to promote the National Lottery and/or Lottery Games as specifically agreed in writing with the Regulator from time to time; and no later than within three hundred and sixty five (365) days from the day on which they were forfeited in favour of the Licensee.</p><p>The Licence is available to read on the website of the Regulator of the National Lottery:</p><p><i>.</i></p><p>As of Tuesday 6th March, the number of authorised retail outlets is 5,790.  This represents an increase of 2,090 outlets since the start of the Licence in 2014 and the 3,700 minimum number of agents that the Licence requires the Operator to have. </p><p>Section 42(1)(b) of the National Lottery Act 2013 provides that the Licence must set out a minimum number of agents.  Neither the Act nor the Licence impose a maximum number.</p></reply>

This Memorandum of Understanding has a specific focus with agreeing a basis on which information can be provided to the insurance industry on flood relief schemes completed by the OPW to an agreed standard of protection desired by the industry.  </p><p>The Memorandum came into effect on 1<sup>st</sup>June, 2014 with an initial tranche of data provided by the Office of Public Works to Insurance Ireland in respect of twelve completed flood defence schemes; showing the design, extent and nature of the protections offered by these works.  Details of a further five schemes were provided in January 2015 and details of the Waterford Flood Defence Scheme were provided last year. </p><p>The Department of Finance and the OPW meet with Insurance Ireland on a quarterly basis in order to address issues in relation to this transfer of data. Recent meetings, while not exclusively, have focused on the flood cover in areas protected by demountable defences. The insurance sector has acknowledged that demountable defences are designed and when properly erected meet the desired standard. The OPW has given Insurance Ireland detailed information it sought to explain the protocols and procedures in place to maintain, test and erect demountable defences. Discussions are continuing with the Department of Finance to explore options to address the industry&rsquo;s concerns about the &lsquo;human element&rsquo; of demountable defences.</p><p>The Memorandum notes the OPW requirement that, when assessing exposure to flood risk, insurers take full account of information provided by the OPW on completed flood defence schemes. The Memorandum does not guarantee the availability of flood risk cover in the locations for which information has been provided by the OPW, and it accepts that the provision of cover, the level of premiums charged and the policy terms applied are a matter for individual insurers.</p></reply>

This is a national scheme of humanitarian assistance, targeting aid at those worst affected properties, for which there are no alternative feasible measures. </p><p>The Government decision confirmed that a homeowner had to meet a number of conditions to be eligible for assistance under this scheme, including: </p><p>-  That floodwater entered and damaged the building during the relevant dates such as to render it uninhabitable. </p><p>-  That the property was the homeowner&rsquo;s primary residence at the time of the floods. </p><p>-  That the affected property must have a significant probability of the recurrence of the flood depth, duration or frequency on a scale that could cause further serious and similar damage to the home. </p><p>-  That the property is not due to or may not benefit from a planned or possible future major, minor or individual flood defence scheme. </p><p>-  That the property may not be protected adequately from being flooded in the future, at an economically feasible cost, through other flood mitigation works including minor works, individual property protection or other possible measures that can be considered at this time. </p><p>-  That the homeowner is unable to obtain flood risk insurance.</p><p>At this time, in relation to those homeowners being considered under the scheme, the OPW is working with each of the Local Authorities, using their extensive and detailed local knowledge, to consider approximately 70 homes that have been flooded during the event may benefit from a known or possible engineering solution. A further 31 homeowners have been contacted and/or met by the OPW under the administrative arrangements for the scheme, of which the OPW is seeking further information from 7 of these homeowners. </p><p>Where it has been established that there is no viable engineering solution at this initial stage of assessment, the Local Authorities have contacted homeowners known to have flooded during the period in question.  These homeowners have been asked to make contact with the OPW in relation to being considered under the scheme. </p><p>The numbers of homes within the process are changing regularly as homeowners make contact with the OPW and as assessments are completed.  </p><p>The OPW has budgeted up to &euro;3m this year for the potential costs associated with this scheme. </p><p>Shannon Group &amp;amp; Lake Levels </p><p>The Shannon Flood Risk State Agency Co-ordination Working Group met on six occasions in 2016. During 2016, the primary focus of the Group was to clarify the roles and responsibilities of the various agencies and set out a Work Programme. In 2017, a number of sub-committees were established in accordance with the Group's Terms of Reference to progress the delivery of initiatives agreed by the Group. The Group met formally twice in 2017 with sub-committee and other bilateral meetings taking place more frequently as required. The Group will meet twice during 2018.</p><p>Information about the Group is available on the OPW website, <i>www.opw.ie</i>. </p><p>The Group took a decision in October 2016 to trial the lowering of the lake levels on Lough Allen, within the existing statutory framework, during the Winter 2016/2017 to help mitigate potential flood risk.  A protocol was finalised between ESB, Waterways Ireland and the OPW </p><p>to lower the late Autumn and Winter minimum lake levels in Lough Allen by approximately 0.7 metres with the first reduction implemented in October 2016. The trial has been repeated for the Winter 2017/2018.</p><p>Interdepartmental Flood Policy Co-ordination Group </p><p>The Interdepartmental Flood Policy Coordination Group, that I chair, met twice in 2015, four times in 2016, and once in 2017. The most recent meeting was held on 7thFebruary, 2018. </p><p>In November 2016, Government agreed an interim report from the Interdepartmental Flood Policy Coordination Group setting out progress on its work and making appropriate recommendations for consideration by Government. This report is available to view on the OPW website at</p><p><i></i></p><p>At the Group&rsquo;s most recent meeting, members reported on progress in their areas in national flood policy that included updates in relation to the National Adaptation Framework, published by Minister Denis Naughten T.D. on 19 January 2018 and the Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme and the associated Flood Risk Management Plans. </p><p>National Flood Forecasting &amp;amp; Warning Service</p><p>A Steering Group has been established to steer, support and oversee the establishment of a new National Flood Forecasting Service. The Steering Group has met on fifteen occasions to date, agreed a Terms of Reference and prepared and agreed an implementation plan comprising a number of phases, including an initial set-up phase and a development and trial phase. Work is now progressing on these phases. The service will deal with flood forecasting from fluvial (river) and coastal sources. When established it will involve the issuing of flood forecasts and general alerts.</p><p>Given the complexities involved in establishing, designing, developing and testing this new service, it is anticipated that it will take at least 5 years before it is fully operational and it is estimated it will require a staffing complement of 15 full-time posts. Met &Eacute;ireann has appointed two staff members to date to the project.</p><p>Individual Property Protection </p><p>The Interdepartmental Flood Policy Co-ordination Group this year is considering the potential costs and benefits associated with the introduction of an individual property protection scheme. </p><p>The Group is being informed by two different pilot projects, in Thomastown and Graiguenamanagh in County Kilkenny and Crossmolina in County Mayo. The Co-ordination Group&rsquo;s work, when completed, will be submitted to Government for consideration in the context of the merits of the introduction by Government of any scheme to support individual property protection measures. </p><p>Both pilots are being funded through the OPW&rsquo;s Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme. In respect of the Kilkenny pilot, the OPW is funding the costs of a research and feasibility study into the potential provision of individual property protection.  Kilkenny County Council is considering the consulting engineers&rsquo; preliminary report to help inform recommendations to the OPW on the next stages of the pilot. To date the council have drawn down some &euro;30,000 towards the cost of the study. </p><p>In Crossmolina, consultants completed surveys of individual properties to assess their suitability for floodgates and Mayo County Council procured a contractor who is currently engaging with the community and installing the defences at the relevant properties. The OPW has provided some &euro;237,000 in funding to date for this pilot. </p><p>Minor Works</p><p>The review of the Minor Works Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme was completed in June 2017 which resulted in many improvements to the eligibility/benefit criteria of the Scheme.</p><p>For example, the upper financial threshold has been increased substantially from &euro;500,000 to &euro;750,000 and benefit allowances have been updated to reflect different property types, with inclusion of farm yard/buildings as commercial premises.</p><p>All Local Authorities were notified of the revised criteria, which are effective for applications received after 1 June 2017. The revised criteria are available onwww.opw.ie. </p><p>Riparian Guidance</p><p>The OPW will shortly be publishing on <i>www.flooding.ie</i>guidance to landowners in relation to the maintenance of watercourses on or near their lands in the context of managing flood risk.</p></reply>

My reply of 28 February is that it is constitutionally impermissible to proceed with a PAC recommendation to legislate to give the Comptroller and Auditor General oversight in respect of wardship funds, which are not public funds. The context in 2001 was the contemplated audit of court funds by a bespoke statutory body with some mooted and unspecified, but seemingly indirect, involvement on the part of the Comptroller. There was and remains a constitutional concern regarding the direct involvement of the Comptroller and Auditor General in performing any such oversight function.</p></reply>

It must be borne in mind that the pay reduction for post-2011 entrants to the public service applied to all public servants and not just teachers, and that any restoration of these measures in respect of teachers would be expected to be applied elsewhere across the public service. While I am not in a position to provide an estimate of the total cost of restoring all post-1 January 2011 entrants in all of the public service to the pre-2011 pay scale arrangements, I can say that in the case of education and training sector employees, including teachers, the estimated current full year cost would be in the order of &euro;130 million. Clearly, the cost across the entire public service would be substantially higher.</p>  <p>  To have gone further than the pay increases that have been negotiated for 2018 would mean I would have had less money available to hire over 1,000 extra SNAs and over 1,000 extra teachers in 2018. </p>  <p>  Any further negotiation on new entrant pay is a cross sectoral issue, not just an issue for the education sector. The Government also supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants. </p>  <p>  A commitment is included in the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 to consider the issue of newly qualified pay within 12 months of the commencement of the Agreement. That process has now commenced with a first meeting on 12 October 2017.  The three teacher unions attended that first meeting.</p>  <p>  In addition, under the terms of the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform is required, within 3 months of the passing of the Act, to prepare and lay before the Oireachtas a report on the cost of dealing with pay equalisation for new entrants to the public service. It is understood that work on the report is progressing.</p></reply>

Each SENO works in an assigned local area with parents, schools, teachers, psychologists, health professionals and other staff who are involved in the provision of services in that area for children with special educational needs. In dealing with parents of children with special educational needs, SENOs will keep parents informed of what resourcing decisions are being made on their child&rsquo;s behalf. The SENO will also discuss any concerns that parents have about the present or future educational needs of their child. Contact details for all SENOs is available at .</p><p>As such, all pupils with learning difficulties have access to additional teaching support in school.  It is a matter for schools to monitor and utilise their allocation of additional teaching support to best support the needs of identified pupils, in accordance with the Department's guidance. The teaching time afforded to each individual pupil is decided and managed by schools, taking into account each child's individual learning needs.</p><p>On 1 September 2017, the new Special Education Teaching allocation model was introduced, which provides a single unified allocation for special educational support teaching needs to each school, based on a school&rsquo;s educational profile. This allocation allows schools to provide additional teaching support for all pupils who require such support in their schools and for schools to deploy resources based on each pupil&rsquo;s individual learning needs.</p><p>The new allocation model gives greater flexibility to schools in relation to the manner in which they use their resources. Schools may deploy special education teachers in a variety of ways in order to effectively meet pupils&rsquo; needs, for example, in-class support, small groups, team teaching or withdrawal.  </p><p>The SNA scheme is designed to provide recognised schools with additional adult support staff to cater for the care needs of pupils with disabilities in an educational context, where the nature of these care needs have been outlined in professional reports as being so significant that a pupil will require adult assistance in order to be able to attend school and to participate in education and also to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned, or for their peers, and with a view to developing their independent living skills.  </p><p>The criteria by which SNA support is allocated to pupils is set out in my Department's Circular 0030/2014. In considering applications for SNA supports for individual pupils, the SENOs take account of the pupils' needs and consider the resources available to the school to identify whether additionality is needed or whether the school might reasonably be expected to meet the needs of the pupils from its current level of resources. SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource.</p><p>My Department provides funding to schools towards the cost of assistive technology for pupils with special educational needs in Primary, Post Primary and Special schools for personal computers and specialist software for educational purposes under the Assistive Technology scheme, as set out in my Department's Circular 0010/2013.  This Circular states that equipment is provided under the scheme for children with more complex disabilities who require essential specialist equipment to access the school curriculum, which they do not already have, or which cannot be provided for them through the school's existing provisions.</p><p>Other supports available to schools include:</p><p>-  the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) delivers a consultative, tiered service delivery model to schools, in line with international best practice for the effective andefficient delivery of educational psychological services that best meet the needs of all pupils/students in schools.  This service delivery model allows NEPS psychologists to support schools to provide an effective continuum of support to meet the needs of pupils/students. </p><p>-  NCSE&rsquo;s Support service brought under their control, the Special Education Support Service (SESS), the National Behaviour Support Service (NBSS) and the Visiting Teacher Service for children who are deaf/hard of hearing and for children who are blind/visually impaired (VTSVHI). The Support Service provides advice and support to schools on the education and inclusion of students with special educational needs, providing in-school support for support teachers, continuing professional development for teachers, and support to schools on the management of challenging behaviour. It will also enhance the multi-disciplinary capacity of the education system through providing access to expert knowledge in areas such as autism, speech and language therapy and challenging behavior. </p><p>-  Special school transport arrangements.</p><p>-  Enhanced capitation grants for special schools and special classes attached to mainstream primary and post primary schools. </p><p>-  Modification of school buildings.</p><p>My Department is not aware of specific concerns relating to provision for the child to which the Deputy has referred. I am also advised that the child has not come to the specific attention of the NCSE. </p><p>Details of supports provided by the NCSE to all schools is available on a county basis on its website at www.ncse.ie.</p></reply>

However, an assessment, or diagnosis, will no longer be needed to access additional teaching support in schools. </p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that my Department&rsquo;s National Educational Psychological Service provides educational psychological support to all primary and post-primary schools. This involves direct support in the event of a critical incident, access to national and regional support and development work to build school capacity to support students, access to a NEPS psychologist for responses to queries arising, and access to individual pupil casework via a NEPS psychologist or through the Scheme for the Commissioning of Psychological Assessments. (SCPA).</p>  <p>  In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service. The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximize positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. </p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention.</p>  <p>  I have made enquiries with my Department's National Educational Psychological Service in respect of   the child, the subject of the Deputy&rsquo;s question and can inform him that as late as last week the child's case was raised by the school with their assigned NEPS psychologist and that following on from this approach an assessment is being scheduled later in this academic year.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This can be due to significant difficulties in areas such as behaviour or sensory needs which have not been ameliorated, even with appropriate intervention, in mainstream.</p><p>Other children may have such complex needs that the recommendation in their professional reports state that they are best placed in a special school. </p><p>In 2018, almost &euro;1.8 billion will be invested in Special Education, nearly one fifth of the overall Education budget, and up 43% since 2011.</p><p>This funding includes provision for the following: </p><p>-  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of Special Needs Organisers (SENOs), for fulfilling the functions of the NCSE Council within a designated area in relation to the identification of and delivery and co-ordination of education services to children with disabilities. All schools have the contact details of their local SENO and parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details on the NCSE website. </p><p>-  over 13,400 Special Education Teaching posts in mainstream primary and post primary schools for the 2017/2018 school year, providing additional teaching support to pupils with special educational needs, </p><p>-  approximately 1,300 special classes, with 169 new Special Classes opened to date for the 2017/18 school year. This compares to 548 special classes in 2011. </p><p>-  14,120 Special Needs Assistants available for allocation to the end of the 2017/18 school year, an increase of over 33% since 2011 when 10,575 SNA were allocated to primary and post primary schools</p><p>-  Over 1,400 teachers in 124 Special Schools</p><p>-  the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) delivers a consultative, tiered service delivery model to schools, in line with international best practice for the effective and efficient delivery of educational psychological services that best meet the needs of all pupils/students in schools.  This service delivery model allows NEPS psychologists to support schools to provide an effective continuum of support to meet the needs of pupils/students. </p><p>-  NCSE&rsquo;s Support service brought under their control, the Special Education Support Service (SESS), the National Behaviour Support Service (NBSS) and the Visiting Teacher Service for children who are deaf/hard of hearing and for children who are blind/visually impaired (VTSVHI). The Support Service provides advice and support to schools on the education and inclusion of students with special educational needs, providing in-school support for support teachers, continuing professional development for teachers, and support to schools on the management of challenging behaviour. It will also enhance the multi-disciplinary capacity of the education system through providing access to expert knowledge in areas such as autism, speech and language and challenging behavior.</p><p>-  Assistive technology/specialised equipment. </p><p>-  Special school transport arrangements.</p><p>-  Enhanced capitation grants for special schools and special classes attached to mainstream primary and post primary schools. </p><p>-  Modification of school buildings.</p><p>-  Special Arrangements for State Examinations.</p><p>-  ESF Aided Fund for Students with Disabilities at 3<sup>rd</sup>level.</p><p>-  Vocational Training for people with disabilities.</p><p>-  Adult Education &ndash; once off projects for disability in education.</p><p>My Department is unaware of any specific concerns relating to Special Educational Provision for the school to which the Deputy has referred. The school received an increased teaching allocation under new Special Education Teacher allocation model which was applied from September 2017, bringing its allocation to 87.5 hours. In addition, the school has an allocation of 2 special needs assistants. </p><p>Supports provided by the NCSE to all schools is available on a county basis on its website at www.ncse.ie.</p></reply>

However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</p>  <p>  Section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 provides for an appeal by a parent or guardian to the Secretary General of my Department, or in the case of an Educational Training Board (ETB) school to the ETB in the first instance, where a Board of Management of a school, or a person acting on behalf of the Board, refuses to enrol a student in a school, expels a student or suspends a student for 20 or more days in any school year. Further information on the Section 29 appeals process is available on the Department's website www.education.ie.</p>  <p>  The Educational Welfare Service of the Child and Family Agency (EWS) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child. The EWS can be contacted at 01-7718500.</p>  <p>  In relation to the Leaving Certificate Applied (LCA) programme, the programme is one of the three leaving certificate options made available by my Department for senior cycle students. The LCA is a two-year programme designed for those students who do not wish to proceed directly to higher education or for those whose needs, aptitudes and learning styles are not fully catered for by the other two Leaving Certificate programmes.      </p>  <p>  It is a matter for each individual school to decide whether or not to put in place the LCA programme in its own school. </p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) provides educational psychological support to all primary and post-primary schools. It is open for the parents of the student concerned to raise their specific concerns about the educational development and progress of their child with the Principal of the school the student currently attends. This can be done with a view to the school raising those concerns with an assigned NEPS psychologist.</p></reply>

A minimum of one hour of physical education per week is recommended for all primary school pupils. The curriculum has been structured so as to allow individual schools a high degree of flexibility and choice in the planning of a broad and balanced Physical Education programme for pupils, and includes six broad strands featuring Athletics, Dance, Gymnastics, Games, Outdoor and Adventure activities and Aquatics. </p>  <p>  The Physical Education curricula at both primary and second level have been developed on the understanding that facilities available to schools vary. Consequently, they offer a level of flexibility that allows each individual school to design a programme that can be delivered using the resources and supports available to it. </p>  <p>  Where schools decide to provide pupils with swimming classes in school time, they are expected to fund them from resources already available to them. Under the Rules for National Schools, while voluntary contributions may be sought, no school may charge a fee as a condition of admission to an activity provided within school hours.</p></reply>

The system uses data from the Central Statistics Office, Ordnance Survey Ireland, the Department of Social Protection and information from my Department&rsquo;s own databases. With this information, my Department is currently carrying out demographic analyses to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and at post-primary level. It is anticipated that decisions based on these exercises will be announced in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  In relation to the Balbriggan school planning area, my Department&rsquo;s main responsibility is to ensure that the existing schools in the Balbriggan area can, between them, cater for the demand from within the school planning area in the 2018/19 school year. It is important that school size is monitored and that a balance is preserved among all schools in the school planning area to ensure that one school is not expanding at the expense of another school.</p>  <p>  In this regard, my Department will continue to monitor the position in the Balbriggan area, but considers that there is adequate accommodation between the existing primary schools in the Balbriggan area to meet demand.</p>  <p>  Regarding the position in the Swords school planning area, my Department has recently contacted all of the primary schools in the Swords area to review their projected enrolments for September 2018. The schools concerned generally commenced their enrolment process for the new junior infants in early January of this year and this process is not yet complete. In that regard, the level of demand for all schools is not available at this point. Each school has issued invitations for enrolment through school notes and local announcements and are currently offering places in line with their respective enrolment policies. My Department will continue to liaise with the schools and their Patrons to keep the matter under review in the coming weeks with a view to putting any necessary arrangements in place to address any accommodation needs.</p></reply>

The nationality requirements for the student grant scheme are set out in section 14 of the Student Support Act 2011 and regulation 5 of the Student Support Regulations 2017. To qualify for a student grant, it is the candidate's nationality or his/her immigration status in the State that determines whether or not he/she meets the nationality requirement outlined in the Act and Regulations.

The agreements to date have restored an estimated 75% of the difference in pay for more recently recruited teachers and deliver full equality at later points in the scale.</p>  <p>  As a result of the changes I negotiated together with my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, the current starting salary of a new teacher is &euro;35,958 and from 1 October 2020 onwards will be &euro;37,692. If full equalisation was achieved the starting salary for a post-primary teacher from 1 October 2020 would be &euro;43,879 and for a primary teacher would be &euro;41,511, at a cost of over &euro;200 million across the public service.</p>  <p>  Differential pay scales were introduced by the then Government in 2010. It must be borne in mind that the pay reduction for post-2011 entrants to the public service applied to all public servants and not just teachers, and that any restoration of these measures in respect of teachers would be expected to be applied elsewhere across the public service. While I am not in a position to provide an estimate of the total cost of restoring all post-1 January 2011 entrants in all of the public service to the pre-2011 pay scale arrangements, I can say that in the case of education and training sector employees, including teachers, the estimated current full year cost would be in the order of &euro;130 million. Clearly, the cost across the entire public service would be substantially higher.</p>  <p>  To have gone further than the pay increases that have been negotiated for 2018 would mean I would have had less money available to hire over 1,000 extra SNAs and over 1,000 extra teachers in 2018. </p>  <p>  Any further negotiation on new entrant pay is a cross sectoral issue, not just an issue for the education sector. The Government also supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants. </p>  <p>  A commitment is included in the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 to consider the issue of newly qualified pay within 12 months of the commencement of the Agreement.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-03-08a.443.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018030800045#WRH00700"><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the 2012 Report of the Advisory Group to the Forum on Patronage and Pluralism in the Primary Sector recommended that demand for patronage diversity should be met in areas of stable population by divesting patronage of existing schools where there is evidence of parental demand for change.  </p>  <p>  In this context, in 2012/13, my Department undertook surveys of parental preferences in 43 areas of stable population to establish the level of demand for a wider choice in the patronage of primary schools.  These areas were all stable in terms of population growth, so no new school places were required. However sufficient demand for more choice emerged in 28 areas, including the areas referred to by the Deputy. </p>  <p>  In the majority of the 28 areas surveyed where sufficient demand emerged, the level of parental demand for a wider choice indicated a size of a four classroom school being required to accommodate such a level of demand.</p>  <p>  Following completion of the surveys consultations took place with the main Catholic patrons in each area to discuss patronage divesting options.  Under the patronage divesting process, a school could be opened where a school building became, or was due to become available as a result of an amalgamation/closure of an existing school.  In some areas, in responding to demand for diversity where existing patrons were unable make school properties available, the Department expanded the scope to include an examination of properties held in public ownership. </p>  <p>  To date, ten new schools have opened under the patronage divesting process.  Of the five schools referred to by the Deputy, one is operating from a State-owned building and one is located in a former school building owned by the Catholic Church.  In one area a property has transferred from the Catholic Church under the Redress process and arrangements are underway for the necessary works to be carried out in order for the Educate Together school to operate from here. In the remaining two areas, work is ongoing on securing school buildings arising from amalgamations.    </p>  <p>  In order to facilitate the opening of the schools, their initial establishment, as with most new schools, has been in temporary start-up accommodation, pending a permanent school building being made available.  All schools, irrespective of their location, have to operate within their available accommodation and manage annual pupil intake accordingly.</p>  <p>  The initial establishment of these schools as four-classroom schools and the need to be cognisant of managing the available accommodation has been reflected in my Department&rsquo;s engagement with the patron body of the schools, Educate Together.  When one of the schools raised the issue of expanding its enrolment, my Department invited Educate Together to submit a case to it in this regard.  A case has been submitted by Educate Together to further expand the five schools and a case for each of these schools is currently under consideration.  A meeting has been arranged with Educate Together to further discuss the issues involved.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently carrying out nationwide demographic exercises at primary and post-primary level to identify areas of demographic growth and determine where additional school accommodation is needed in order to plan for school provision nationwide and this work is almost complete.  In this context, the outcome of the nationwide demographic exercises will input into consideration of the case submitted by Educate Together. </p>  <p>  I have announced a new Patronage Reconfiguration process, which will accelerate the delivery of multi-denominational and non-denominational schools, to reach 400 live schools by 2030. Unlike the previous process, this plan will focus on live transfers, so that a school which transfers under this process would not be reliant on temporary accommodation.</p></reply>

The Deputy will appreciate that it would be inappropriate for me to comment on the outcome of individual cases within this statutory appeals process. </p>  <p>  With regard to the general issue of assessment of income under the Student Grants Scheme, student grant applications are means tested on gross income from all sources earned inside and outside the State within a specified reference period. The means test arrangements of the Student Grant Scheme are applied nationally. The assessment of income from the same starting point is deemed to be fair and reasonable because this approach eliminates any distortion which might arise from different spending decisions in different households. Consequently, there is no provision under the Student Grant Scheme to provide for any exceptions to those involved in the process of bankruptcy and/or insolvency agreements.</p>  <p>  Students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund. This Fund assists students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Information on the fund is available through the Access Office in the third level institution attended. This fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis.</p>  <p>  Also, tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education. Further information on this tax relief is available from the Revenue Commissioners at www.revenue.ie.</p></reply>

This can be due to significant difficulties in areas such as behaviour or sensory needs which have not been ameliorated, even with appropriate intervention, in mainstream.</p>  <p>  Other children may have such complex needs that the recommendation in their professional reports state that they are best placed in a special school. </p>  <p>  Where there is no placement available for a child with Special Educational Needs, my Department will consider applications under the Home Tuition Grant Scheme, where a student can receive up to 20 hours home tuition per week as an interim measure until a placement becomes available. </p>  <p>  Home Tuition Grant allocations to siblings generally reflect the school grouping principle. This is where one teacher is allocated to a class of six pupils at the appropriate educational level, primary or post primary. Within State-funded classes, differentiated needs are accommodated through a differentiated approach in teaching. </p>  <p>  It is expected that Home Tutors should have the capacity to develop and deliver tuition in an environment which includes other children. </p>  <p>  However, my Department recognises that it may be difficult to cater for the significant differentiated needs of some siblings through a differentiated approach in tuition at Home. To provide for such instances, under the 2017/18 Home Tuition scheme, my Department grants siblings a combined allocation which includes a 50% increase on the standard home tuition allocation. This is allocated on initial application without the requirement for additional supporting documentation.</p>  <p>  In addition, my Department will consider applications for separate allocations where evidence is provided that siblings cannot be tutored together due to their significant differentiated needs. Applications for separate allocations for siblings are considered on a case by case basis.</p>  <p>  As outlined above, my Department&rsquo;s Home Tuition Scheme makes provision for the needs of siblings. I do not intend to make changes to the 2017/18 Home Tuition scheme. </p>  <p>  The cost of providing funding for 1 child towards the provision of 20 hours home tuition per week for the current school year is approx. &euro;31,000 per annum.</p></reply>

The Personal Insolvency Arrangement, in particular, is an innovative solution that seeks to restructure or settle secured debt. Other important elements of this framework include the statutory protections regarding the debtor's reasonable living expenses and their home.</p><p>Since its establishment in 2013, the Insolvency Service of Ireland (ISI) has returned over 6,000 debtors to solvency with over 2,000 of those cases being Personal Insolvency Arrangements (PIAs) which deal with mortgage debt. In over 90% of these PIA cases, debtors have been able to stay in their homes. This is a significant achievement given that many cases involved arrears exceeding 720 days.</p><p>In addition, the solutions introduced in the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 have served as a catalyst for over 120,000 informal agreements between debtors and creditors, as reported by the Central Bank of Ireland. Debtors now have realistic alternative options available to them through the ISI if negotiations break down.</p><p>The Government has introduced a number of amendments and supports, since 2012, to ensure the success of the solutions provided by the personal insolvency legislation. These include the section 115A court review process and the Abhaile Mortgage Arrears Resolution Service.</p><p>The section 115A court review process permits a debtor to ask the Court to review and assess the reasonableness of a rejected PIA and, where satisfied as to its reasonableness, make an order confirming the PIA proposal.  This removes the so-called &ldquo;Bank Veto&rdquo;.</p><p>The Government agreed late last year to bring forward its own proposals in a Courts and Land and Conveyancing Bill derived from a Private Member's Bill proposed by the then Deputy 'Boxer' Moran.  This Bill is on the present legislative programme for publication during the current session.</p><p>Another important enhancement is Abhaile, the Government&rsquo;s national Mortgage Arrears Resolution Service. This was introduced in 2016 to ensure that people who are in danger of losing their home have access to free professional advice, including advice from a personal insolvency practitioner. In addition to detailed financial advice, Abhaile offers legal advice to homeowners in mortgage arrears with the aim of allowing them to find a solution to their arrears and to stay in their homes where possible.</p><p>Up to 5 March, 2018, Abhaile had provided 8,389 vouchers for free financial advice and help from a personal insolvency practitioner.  In addition, 2,308 borrowers had been issued consultation solicitor vouchers under the scheme. This voucher entitles a person to a free legal advice consultation with a solicitor.  The scheme also provides for funding by the Legal Aid Board of these applications for review to the Circuit Court where a personal insolvency arrangement has been voted down by creditors.  Up to 23 February 2018, legal aid had been approved under the Abhaile scheme for 607 such reviews.</p><p>In 2017, the Government introduced a series of actions and amendments that will make Mortgage to Rent (MTR) quicker, more transparent, easier to navigate for borrowers and ultimately, more accessible to more households in mortgage distress. Crucially, the changes will also dramatically increase the numbers of households availing of the scheme</p><p>My Department is also finalising a review of the operation of the Personal Insolvency Acts. The review is taking place under section 141 of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012, which requires the Minister for Justice and Equality (in consultation with the Minister for Finance) to review the operation of Part 3 of the 2012 Act, and responds to a commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government.</p><p>Submissions made by stakeholders via a public consultation on the operation of Part Three of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 contain a range of recommendations to enhance the process and to support increased engagement with the personal insolvency system. These submissions are being analysed and considered by my Department as part of the review along with recent developments in personal insolvency, including recent High Court judgments related to the process. I look forward to bringing proposals to Government in the coming months to address the conclusions of the review.</p></reply>

The Act was signed into law on 30 December 2015.</p>  <p>  New administrative processes and support measures, including the setting up of the Decision Support Service within the Mental Health Commission (a body under the Department of Health), must be put in place before the substantive provisions of the Act can be commenced. A high-level Steering Group comprised of senior officials from the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Health, the Mental Health Commission and the Courts Service, together with the Director of the Decision Support Service, is overseeing the establishment and commissioning of the Decision Support Service (DSS) and this work is ongoing.    </p>  <p>  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 (Commencement of Certain Provisions) Order 2016 (S.I. No. 515 of 2016), brought some provisions of Part 1 (Preliminary and General) and Part 9 (Director of the Decision Support Service) of the Act into operation on 17 October 2016. These provisions were brought into operation in order to progress the setting up of the DSS and to enable the process of recruitment of the Director of the DSS to begin.  The recruitment and appointment of the Director of the DSS, and the appointment of DSS staff, is a matter for the Mental Health Commission with the approval of the Minister for Health. Ms &Aacute;ine Flynn was appointed Director of the Decision Support Service on 2 October 2017. </p>  <p>  The key preparations are being put in place under the oversight of the Steering Group to allow for further commencement orders for the provisions of the 2015 Act to be made when the DSS is ready to roll out the new decision-making support options. The Director is also working in a very determined way to get the necessary staff resources, processes, IT system, expert panels, codes of practice and regulations in place in order that the Decision Support Service can be up and running as quickly as possible. However, it is not possible at the moment to provide an exact time line for the full implementation of the 2015 Act, as there are many complex strands to this work, including involvement of multiple organisations, and the prevailing view is that the Decision Support Service will not be ready to become operational until 2019.  </p>  <p>  The 2018 Budget provides for an allocation of &euro;3 million in the Justice and Equality Vote for the establishment of the Decision Support Service.  </p>  <p>  The commencement of Part 8 of the Act, which provides for a legislative framework for advance healthcare directives, is a matter for the Minister for Health.</p></reply>

For burglary, the maximum penalty is 14 years' imprisonment, and for aggravated burglary, a sentence of up to life imprisonment can be imposed. In 2015, the law in this area was further strengthened by the introduction of legislation targeting repeat offenders. The Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Act 2015 seeks to ensure that persons awaiting trial for burglary of a dwelling who have recent convictions or pending charges for domestic burglaries can be denied bail in appropriate cases. The Act also provides for consecutive sentences for prolific burglars of dwellings. In addition, the Criminal Justice Act 2007 provides for presumptive minimum sentences for certain repeat offences in certain circumstances. The offences to which these presumptive minimum sentences apply include aggravated burglary. In deciding the sentence to be imposed in a particular case, a court will take into account the mitigating and aggravating factors, including the vulnerability of the victim. </p>  <p>  On mandatory sentences, I am mindful that there are differing views. The Law Reform Commission and the Strategic Review of Penal Policy have made recommendations against mandatory sentences and their views are always considered seriously. However, I will continue to keep the law in this area under review.</p></reply>

As Minister, I have no direct role in these matters.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Building and Refurbishment Programme 2016 &ndash; 2021, which is an ambitious 5 year building Programme reflecting the priorities of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, will benefit some 30 locations throughout the State. I am informed by the Garda authorities that the Programme does not provide for significant building works at Cootehill Garda station. </p><p>The Deputy will appreciate, it is the Garda Commissioner who is responsible for the distribution of resources, including personnel, among the various Garda Divisions and I, as Minister, have no direct role in the matter. Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.</p><p>I understand that Cootehill Garda station forms part of the Baileboro Garda District in the Cavan/Monaghan Division. I am informed by the Commissioner that on the 31 January 2018, the latest date for which figures are readily available, the strength of the Cavan/Monaghan Division was 329, 66 of whom are assigned to the Baileboro District and 6 assigned to Cootehill Garda station. There are also 11 Garda Reserves and 38 Garda civilian staff attached to the Division. When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.</p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just under 1,600 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of whom 40 have been assigned to the Cavan/Monaghan Division. I am pleased to say that Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 - a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016. </p><p>I am also pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track. This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College. Also 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, reach 14,000 by the end of 2018. </p><p>In addition, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties. There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training in 2018.</p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division, including the Cavan/Monaghan Division.</p><p>The number of newly attested Gardai allocated to the Cavan/Monaghan Division since the recommencement of recruitment is outlined below. It should be noted that Cootehill Garda station is not a training station.</p><p><table><tr><th>DIVISION</th><th>STATION</th><th>2015</th><th>2016</th><th>2017</th></tr><tr><td>CAVAN / MONAGHAN</td><td>MONAGHAN</td><td>5</td><td>1</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CAVAN</td><td>5</td><td>7</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CARRICKMACROSS</td><td></td><td></td><td>5</td></tr></table></p><p>I am also informed that the resourcing of each Garda region and division is fully considered within the overall context of the needs and requirements of Garda regions throughout the country. Garda personnel assigned throughout the country, together with overall policing arrangements and operational strategies, are continually monitored and reviewed. Such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources and the best possible Garda service is provided to the general public. </p><p>The allocation and transfer of Garda personnel is determined by a number of factors, including crime and non-crime workload, minimum establishment, population, area, policing arrangements, operational strategies and transfers applications, including welfare issues. When allocations are taking place, comprehensive consultation is carried out with local Garda management during which all factors are taken into consideration. Where a deficiency in resources is identified the matter is considered fully and addressed accordingly.</p></reply>

Likewise, the imposition of particular penalties on those found guilty of offences is a matter for the Courts.</p>  <p>  The statutory framework relating to young offenders is set out in the Children Act 2001. The Act requires the various authorities within the youth justice system to apply a series of incremental measures, ranging from diversion to community sanctions, with detention as a last resort.</p>  <p>  The first main filter in the youth justice system is the Garda Diversion Programme, which, depending on the seriousness of the offence, may include an informal caution (without supervision) and a formal caution (with supervision), which are given to the young offender by a Garda Juvenile Liaison Officer. The Diversion Programme also incorporates elements of Restorative Justice including processes whereby the victim of the offence is provided the opportunity to meet with or have views presented to the young offender.</p>  <p>  In addition, Garda Youth Diversion Projects (GYDPs) operate at local level as a further support to the Diversion Programme. The GYDPs aim to support young people to develop and mature through positive interventions and interactions with a local project.  GYDPs provide a range of education and training programmes e.g. academic support, IT, employment preparation and specific job training.</p>  <p>  The second main filter provided in the Children Act is the range of non-custodial sanctions available to the courts including court orders for dismissal; conditional discharge; the payment of fines or costs; compensation and the binding over of parents, and orders imposing a community sanction involving a suite of Probation Service supervised sanctions. In supervising community sanctions, the Probation Service uses the services of a number of community-based organisations with dedicated resources to work with young offenders.</p>  <p>  Finally, and as a last resort, detention may be used.</p></reply>

It is open to the same organisations to apply under the Call for Proposals for future provision of the service. The Call for Proposals will allow for applications from any not-for-profit organisation with the necessary capacity and experience provide the required service.</p>  <p>  While certain aspects of the new service model have been determined, my Department is currently undertaking an extensive consultation process with all relevant stakeholders with a view to informing further development of the model in advance of the call being issued.</p>  <p>  GYDPs deliver a valuable service to young offenders and provide an effective and essential support to the operation of the statutory Garda Diversion Programme by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

He also advised that not all of the services described in the Guide for women infected with Hepatitis C may be directly relevant to the Magdalen women.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, the women are provided with an enhanced medical card (RWRCI card) which allows them access to a range of medical services and to primary and community health services.  These services are free of charge and include GP services, prescribed drugs, medicines, aids and appliances, dental, ophthalmic and aural services, home support, home nursing, counselling services, chiropody, podiatry and physiotherapy.  This is the same range of services as provided to HAA cardholders, the exception being medicines and treatments specific to Hepatitis C sufferers which clearly  would not need to apply to Magdalen women. Provision for medical support for women residing abroad has also been made by way of administrative arrangements. </p>  <p>  It might be noted that there is no means assessment for any of the above services provided to these women. In addition, they are exempt from charges for acute in-patient services and out-patient services.  </p>  <p>  In relation to capacity, there has been a delay in making payments to certain women where there are issues relating to capacity, which may render them vulnerable to financial exploitation. Pending the commencement of the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act, 2015 and the establishment of the Decision Support Service, my officials have been encouraging the use of other options to allow payments to be made and they continue to examine what other options may be available. </p>  <p>  Overall, 45 applicants were identified as not having the necessary capacity to sign legal documents.  That number has now reduced to 15, mostly through capacity re-assessment or being made Wards of Court.  Unfortunately 7 persons have died, and in all cases awards were made to their estate.  Of the remaining 15 cases, 3 are in the application process to be made Wards of Court.</p>  <p>   I have considered the report of the Ombudsman and I intend to meet with him in the coming weeks. </p>  <p>   In relation to the memorial, in December 2017 Dublin City Council (DCC) announced that it will carry out a significant commercial redevelopment of the Sean McDermott Street site and confirmed that there will be a Magdalen Memorial at the site.  I wish to provide support and assistance for this project and Officials from my Department have met with DCC officials in this regard.  I am also aware of a proposed conference later this year and I have offered my support for this initiative to the Justice for Magdalenes Research Group.</p></reply>

The question to the then Minister for Justice and Equality related to whether host families were at liberty to enter into cultural exchange programmes. Accordingly, the question was responded to in the context of the traditional interpretation and understanding of the au pair arrangement as a private, voluntary, and shared understanding between the parties concerned - i.e. between a private household or sponsor family and a private individual. The basic premise of the question to the then Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation was in relation to persons engaged in employment and potential abuses arising therein. The response to that question makes it clear that the determination of  whether there is a contract of employment or not, was not based on the title of &ldquo;au pair&rdquo; per se but rather by reference to employment legislation and contract law. It went on to state that the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) would examine any complaint received in the light of the facts of each case.</p>  <p>  The meaning of au pairs has evolved over time, particularly following a ruling of the WRC in 2016.  Therefore, persons who work as au pairs are entitled to the full protection of employment legislation in an employer-employee relationship and this is governed under the employment permit regulations of my colleague the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation.</p>  <p>  The finding of the WRC, as I understand it, is that an individual working as an au pair is deemed to be an employee, with the entitlements that go with that status, including payment of at least the minimum wage.   While there has traditionally been a social and cultural dimension to work as an au pair, which presumably can continue into the future, this cannot alter the entitlements of individuals deemed to be employees.  This applies irrespective of the immigration arrangements under which they are resident in Ireland. </p>  <p>  My remit in this area is limited to the immigration status of non-EEA nationals and in that context, as far as the immigration aspects of this issue are concerned, a non-EEA national would not be granted immigration permission for the primary purpose of being an au pair.  Furthermore, I understand that such employment would not be eligible for an employment permit from the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation.   Persons on student permission with an Immigration Stamp 2 are, however, entitled to engage in casual work for up to 40 hours per week during the months June to September and for a 4-week period from mid-December to mid-January.  Outside that time the limit is 20 hours per week.  Working as an "au pair" within those temporal limits is not forbidden but such work is subject to employment law and the various entitlements that employees have, and the responsibilities that an employer has.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.</p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. </p><p>This plan is progressing apace. This year, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves.</p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just under 1,600 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide. Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 - a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016.</p><p>I am also pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track. This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College. Also 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during 2018, the first 200 of whom will pass out of the Garda College next week and be assigned to locations around the country. Further attestations are planned for June, September and November which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, reach 14,000 by the end of 2018. </p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division in the coming years. </p><p>In so far as the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute; is concerned, this is a matter for the Commissioner.  I am assured by the Commissioner that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of resources. However, it is important to keep in mind that newly attested Garda&iacute; have a further 16 months of practical and classroom based training to complete in order to receive their BA in Applied Policing.  To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required training and development structures and resources in place, including trained Garda tutors and access to a permanently appointed supervisory Sergeant who is thoroughly familiar with their responsibilities under the training programme. </p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that the number of Garda&iacute; as of 31 December 2017 by rank and Division is as set out in the following table.</p><p><b>GARDA STRENGTH BY DIVISION AND RANK 31 DECEMBER 2017</b><table><tr><th>DIVISION</th><th>GD*</th><th>SG</th><th>IN</th><th>SU</th><th>CS</th><th>AC</th><th>TOTAL</th></tr><tr><td>D.M.R.

As Minister, I have no direct role in the matter.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Garda Station Rationalisation Programme of 2012 and 2013 resulted in the closure of some 139 Garda stations, which has allowed front line Garda&iacute; to be managed and deployed with greater mobility, greater flexibility and in a more focused fashion, particularly with regard to various targeted police operations.</p>  <p>  Upon closure, almost all of these stations were returned to the Office of Public Works (OPW).  It is understood that the OPW sold a number of properties, assigned a number of properties to community groups and retained a number of properties for State use.  The future use of such properties is a matter for the OPW as owner.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Programme for a Partnership Government commits to a pilot scheme to reopen 6 Garda stations, both urban and rural, to determine possible positive impacts that such openings will have on criminal activity, with special emphasis on burglaries, theft and public order.</p>  <p>  The Garda Commissioner's final report, which was noted by Government on 19 December 2017, is available on my Department's website at www.justice.ie.  It recommends that the following six stations be included in the pilot: Ballinspittle, Co. Cork, Bawnboy, Co. Cavan, Leighlinbridge, Co. Carlow, Donard, Co. Wicklow, and Rush and Stepaside, Co. Dublin.</p>  <p>  I understand that the Commissioner has written to the OPW with regard to the pilot and that arrangements are being made for technical inspections and other necessary steps to progress the matter.  As the Deputy will appreciate, a procurement process will be required for any necessary works. </p>  <p>  Finally, the Deputy may also be aware that the dispersal and use of resources available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the delivery of policing services to local communities and the appropriate structures and management arrangements for delivery of these services is under consideration by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate and the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland respectively.

Such incidents cannot be tolerated in our society and this Government will continue to support An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in tackling the gangs, including mobile criminal gangs, who target rural areas.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government underlines the need for close engagement between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and local communities. This is an essential feature of the strong community policing ethos which has long been central to policing in this jurisdiction.  The Deputy will be aware that, as part of the overall strategy to oppose criminality, the Garda authorities pursue a range of partnerships with community stakeholders, including the farming organisations.  These include the well established Community Alert Programme, which receives annual funding from my Department, as well as the work of the Metal Theft Forum, the Crimestoppers campaign highlighting the Theft of Livestock, the Theftstop initiative in relation to farm equipment, and the highly successful Garda Text Alert Scheme. </p>  <p>  On 02 January 2018, I was pleased to announce that my Department will be providing an additional &euro;50,000 in financial support to Community Text Alert Groups as a further measure in this Government's support to crime prevention.  This is in addition to the &euro;100,000 which I announced at the National Ploughing Championships in September 2017. The Rebate Scheme, which also ran in 2016, will allow Text Alert Groups registered with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to apply for funding to contribute towards their yearly running costs.  The Text Alert Rebate Scheme will be administered by Muintir na T&iacute;re and I would like to urge groups wishing to participate in the Scheme to contact Muintir na T&iacute;re for more information.  The website is www.muintir.ie.</p>  <p>  Other policing initiatives include Theft Stop which was launched by the Garda&iacute; and the Irish Farmers Association.  Theft Stop is designed to deter criminals from taking and selling farm equipment by ensuring it is clearly marked with a unique ID (such as an EirCode) and then registered on a nationwide database. </p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is responsible for tackling crime, including rural crime. While it is open to private security firms to operate a business where such a demand exists, it is important to stress that it should not interfere with the work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in any way. There are no funding schemes at present operated by my Department which are specifically aimed at private security businesses.  However, in general terms, the Local Enterprise Office (LEO) in Galway may be able to offer further guidance in respect of establishing a new business.  Details of the services provided by LEOs and the contact details for same are available at: www.localenterprise.ie.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 places a strong emphasis on developing and supporting the community policing ethos of the organisation and enhancing the current delivery model so that Garda&iacute; spend more time in the community, gaining public confidence and trust and providing a greater sense of security.  It will result in the introduction of multi-skilled Community Policing Teams in every District. Community Policing Teams will be made-up of Garda&iacute; from a number of different units who will work with the local community to prevent and detect crime.  Undoubtedly, the ongoing recruitment process will support all Garda activities and will enhance the provision of effective Community Policing throughout the country. </p>  <p>  The Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  Budget 2018 will support the continuation of this high level of investment in the Garda workforce and ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track. </p></reply>

Second, consideration is given to what action is required by the Minister. The individual is then informed of what action is to be taken. All reasonable efforts are taken to keep the identity of the individual concerned confidential. </p>  <p>  Actions taken can include: seeking a Garda report from the Garda Commissioner (having first confirmed that the individual is agreeable to that course of action); referring matters to GSOC under powers available to me as Minister under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005; or referring matters to an external body or person for review. </p>  <p>  In this particular case officials from my Department have written to this person on three occasions requesting their consent to refer the correspondence to the Garda Commissioner and to request a report on the allegations made in the correspondence. To date the person concerned has not responded.</p>  <p>  While the 2014 Act contains provisions protecting the identity of a person making a protected disclosure it also permits the disclosure of the information, in this case by me as Minister, where it is necessary for the effective investigation of any alleged wrongdoing.  On that basis my Department will bring the concerns raised by the person to the attention of the Acting Garda Commissioner asking for a report on the matters.  When that report is received a decision can be made on what further action may be necessary.</p></reply>

A number of legal issues arose in relation to publication of the full report, including possible prejudice to pending criminal proceedings. However, my predecessor thought it prudent in the public interest to publish Part 1 of the report at that time, with the intention to publish the full report once these impediments to full publication had been removed. </p>  <p>  I am now satisfied that the full report can be published, subject to some minor redactions, and I have arranged for the legal representatives of Sergeant Galvin's family, GSOC and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to be informed accordingly.</p>  <p>  The Report will be published on my Department's website shortly and copies of the Report will be provided in advance of publication to Sergeant Galvin's family.</p></reply>

In particular, the report proposed new or enhanced arrangements in areas such as training and specialisation, inter-agency working, services to victims, investigative strategies and procedures, and crime counting and recording.  The great majority of these recommendations were of an operational nature and addressed specifically to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, with some requiring the inputs of other agencies and in particular the HSE (subsequently Tusla).  None of these recommendations were addressed to my Department and there is no record of a meeting having been convened between my Department and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs specifically in relation to the report; there would, however, be regular contacts between the two Departments on a range of issues of mutual interest.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, my predecessor, requested the Garda Inspectorate to carry out a follow-up review of the 2012 Report with a view to ensuring that progress in this crucial area continued to be monitored and further developments or requirements identified.  The outcome of that review, as published by me on 27 February, provides a valuable policy resource for developing better services and protections to children who are victims of, or at risk of, sexual crime.  </p>  <p>  As I announced upon publishing the Inspectorate's new report, the Government has agreed to my proposal to establish an independently chaired, cross-sectoral Implementation Group to ensure that the report's recommendations are addressed in a timely, thorough and effective manner and on a whole-of-Government basis.  The Group shall report on a quarterly basis to the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy and shall be chaired by Ms. Caroline Biggs SC, who is an acknowledged expert in criminal law with a particular interest in the investigation and prosecution of child sexual abuse.</p>  <p>  Separately, I am also referring the new Inspectorate report to the Policing Authority under section 117A(2) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 (as amended), with regard to the Authority&rsquo;s statutory role in monitoring, assessing and reporting to the Minister on the measures taken by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to recommendations made in a report of the Inspectorate.  </p></reply>

They recognise that firearms dealers are entitled to be in possession of large quantities of firearms but require them to conduct business from a premises that has been constructed to a high standard. The Regulations also recognise the different categories of firearms dealers and scales the requirements depending on the quantities of ammunition and firearms being stored. For example, a time lock requirement does not apply to those dealers who deal only in small quantities of ammunition. </p>  <p>  The Regulations were developed following consultation with a sub-group of the Firearms Consultative Panel (FCP) consisting of registered firearms dealers as well as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p>  <p>  Concerns have been raised by some firearms dealers, particularly in relation to the time lock requirement.   The inclusion of the requirement for time locks was originally suggested by the above mentioned sub-group to act as a significant deterrent and discouragement to criminal attack. The Commissioner of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has endorsed the security measures contained in this Regulation and has advised that the inclusion of a requirement for a time-lock on the strong room door will deter criminal activity and require the use of greater resources by any person attempting to access firearms or ammunition illegally.  Similar security measures have been applied successfully elsewhere, e.g. in banks, pharmacies and the jewellery sector.     </p>  <p>  In order to minimise the financial impact, a lead-in time of twelve months for compliance has been included in the Regulation in order to permit dealers sufficient time to comply with the legislation. </p>  <p>  I have no plans to amend or postpone these regulations which have been introduced as a public safety measure.  </p></reply>

This was issued in response to the urgent and unforeseen demand for accommodation and related services from those persons arriving in the state seeking international protection. The closing date for receipt of expressions of interest was the 28th January 2018.</p>  <p>  In total, just under 20 premises were offered to the Department of which 11 were made available for inspection. The criteria against which the Department assessed the offers of accommodation were availability, standard of property, ability to provide communal social spaces for residents, ability to cater at mealtimes and proximity to required services such as schools, shops, post office etc. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that these premises were offered to the Department by individual contractors across the country. The Department did not randomly choose any one location over another location. </p>  <p>  Following on-site assessments carried out by staff in the Department, the offer of the King Thomond Hotel in Lisdoonvarna was deemed to the most suitable premises offered to the Department. The premises is available, decorated to a high standard, capable of providing meals to residents, has scope to provide the required communal social areas required by residents and is located close to a town with both primary and secondary schools, shops and a post office.</p>  <p>  As with every other accommodation centre in the country, my Department works closely with the HSE and Departments of Education &amp;amp; Skills and Employment Affairs and Social Protection and all other relevant Government Departments and Agencies to coordinate the delivery of State services to residents. </p>  <p>  Specifically in relation to the medical needs of residents of the centre in Lisdoonvarna, the HSE has confirmed that it will provide a mobile health screening unit that will provide a full medical history for review by a local General Practitioner who will ultimately provide on-going services. </p>  <p>  Additional medical services will be provided through the existing mainstream services (all services to those in the protection process are mainstreamed by the relevant State agency or Department).</p>  <p>  Any children who are residents of the Centre will access schools locally. English language supports are provided to school children through the established EAL (English as an Additional Language) support services in schools. English language training is provided on-site to adults by the local Educational Training Board.</p>  <p>  I wish to clearly state that, as is the case in all other accommodation centres, supports from Government offices and agencies will be provided to residents of the Centre. My Department will work closely with Centre management, the local community, volunteers and NGOs to ensure that the supports available to people resident in accommodation centres throughout the country are available to the residents of the King Thomond Centre in Lisdoonvarna.</p></reply>

With a small domestic market, further expansion in other markets is essential to our continued economic growth.  Overall, export growth in Ireland in recent years has been exceptionally strong and exports continue to contribute positively to growth.  </p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s Trade Strategy, &lsquo;Ireland Connected: Trading and Investing in a Dynamic World&rsquo;, supports an extensive programme of Ministerial-led trade missions, as part of a major drive towards market diversification.  This includes markets that are growing and have scale as well as markets where we are already well established but with potential for further growth.  We aim by 2020 to increase indigenous exports by Enterprise Ireland supported companies, including food, to reach &euro;26 billion, achieve 80% of indigenous export growth outside of the UK market and secure 900 new foreign direct investments.  </p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland delivered an impressive programme of international trade events in 2017, giving Irish companies the opportunity to meet with potential buyers and network with key influencers in countries around the world.  In total, 57 internationally focused trade events were organised by Enterprise Ireland in 2017 including ministerial-led trade missions to Canada, Singapore, Japan, the United Arab Emirates, Oman and a major trade programme as part of the State visit to Australia and New Zealand.</p>  <p>  In relation to 2018, the programme of ministerial-led trade missions and events has been finalised and will shortly be published by Enterprise Ireland.  Several events have already taken place, including ministerial-led missions to the USA in January, and Mexico and Russia in February.  Missions to EU markets will be a priority focus for the 2018 programme, together with missions to key markets where the EU has or is negotiating free trade agreements.  As part of the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day &ldquo;Promote Ireland&rdquo; Programmes, Ministerial visits around world are organised to ensure that we use this exposure to maximise the promotion of Ireland's trade, tourism and investment interests.  The Taoiseach and I will take part in a wide range of meetings and activities to promote Ireland and Irish business in the United States.</p>  <p>  As well as the global efforts supported by Enterprise Ireland, key to our success has been our commitment to trade liberalisation in order to open new markets for our indigenous sectors.  The EU has successfully concluded a number of important trade agreements with trading partners and is in the process of negotiating or upgrading its agreements with many more.  These existing EU Agreements and new trade deals will continue to be very important for Ireland.  With a small domestic market, further expansion in other markets is essential to our continued economic growth.  In this regard Ireland will continue to support the EU&rsquo;s ambitious programme of negotiating new Free Trade Agreements opening new markets Irish Firm&rsquo;s goods and services and increasing export and investment opportunities.</p>  <p>  Most recently, the EU&ndash;Canada Comprehensive Economic Trade Agreement (CETA) entered into force provisionally from the 21st September 2017.  Irish companies may now take advantage of the all important provisions of CETA including the elimination of tariffs on almost all key exports, access to the Canadian procurement market, the easing of regulatory barriers and more transparent rules for market access.  CETA presents new opportunities for Irish business and professionals to work and provide services in Canada.</p>  <p>  The EU and Mexico hope to reach political agreement early this year on the modernisation of the EU-Mexico Global Agreement to include regulatory cooperation, more trade in agriculture and food, common sanitary and phytosanitary standards and sustainable development.  Ireland supports comparable trade conditions for investors and businesses across the Americas, making it easier for Irish businesses to trade in and enter these markets.  The main benefits for Ireland in a modernised agreement with Mexico would include the opening up of public procurement markets to Irish businesses and the removal of technical barriers to trade to reduce the costs of entry to the Mexican market. It will further remove industrial tariffs and important agricultural tariffs.  This will be important for Ireland&rsquo;s important Agri-food sector especially for dairy products where Ireland is a significant exporter to Mexico of powdered milk and milk derivatives but there are currently significant barriers both to increasing powdered milk exports and to commencing exports of fresh dairy produce.</p>  <p>  The EU is continuing its negotiations with Mercosur and recently announced the successful conclusion of negotiations of the EU-Japan Economic Partnership Agreement.  The agri-food sector, in particular will see benefits from access to Japan&rsquo;s highly valuable export market, with improved access for beef, pork, cheese and processed agricultural products.  </p>  <p>  During his September 2017 State of the Union address, the President of the European Parliament, Jean-Claude Juncker, proposed opening trade negotiations with Australia and New Zealand.  The draft negotiating mandates for Australia and New Zealand are currently being discussed by the Commission and Member States.</p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to support the EU&rsquo;s ambitious programme of negotiating new FTA&rsquo;s giving Irish firms expanded market access and a predictable trading environment in third countries.</p></reply>

The 2015 legislation was developed in response to the finding by the Supreme Court that the previous regime of Registered Employment Agreements was unconstitutional. </p>  <p>  The 2015 Act allows for applications for SEOs to be made to the Labour Court by a trade union or an employer body either individually or on a joint basis. The Court must then examine and assess the application against the criteria set down in the 2015 legislation. This includes the issue of how representative the union or employer body is in the particular economic sector. </p>  <p>  The Labour Court advertises in the national media its intention to undertake an examination of the application for the sector before it and invites submissions from all interested parties. I should emphasise that it is open to any interested party to make a submission to the Court at that point. In addition, parties that make written submissions to the Court will subsequently be invited to a hearing on the matter at the Court where further oral submissions can be made to the Court.</p>  <p>  Following examination by the Court of the merits of the application against the criteria set down in the legislation, the Court can either decide to submit a recommendation to the Minister to adopt the proposal for a sectorial agreement by way of a Ministerial Order or, it can decide not to submit a recommendation. </p>  <p>  My role as Minister is to examine the Labour Court recommendation and to ensure that in its examination, the Court has taken account of the relevant criteria set down in the 2015 legislation. </p>  <p>  In the current instance of the SEO affecting plumbers, pipefitters etc. the Labour Court recommendation was submitted to me in December 2017.  The Labour Court had previously advertised the application presented to it by the UNITE and TEEU trade unions in the national media and invited submissions in July 2017. Four submissions were received from the Mechanical Engineering and Building Services Contractors&rsquo; Association; the TEEU; Unite and the Construction Workers Pension Scheme. All submissions supported the application before the Court. </p>  <p>  Having considered the Labour Court recommendation, I accepted the recommendation on the basis that it met the requirements of the 2015 Act and a draft of a Ministerial Order to give effect to the SEO was laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas on 25 January 2018. The matter was referred to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Business, Enterprise and Innovation in February 2018 and got the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas also in February. </p>  <p>  It should be noted also, that in tandem with this statutory process, employers and unions in this sector had already signed up to a voluntary agreement, on foot of proposals developed working with the Workplace Relations Commission which provided most recently for a 2.5% increase from 1 March 2018.  This increase is in line with the rates now provided for in the SEO which has been signed into law to take effect from 6 March 2018.</p></reply>

They also accounted for 69.1% of total persons engaged, with large enterprises (employing 250 or more persons) employing 30.9% of persons engaged. Nearly 28% of persons engaged work in micro companies (under 10 employees) but these companies accounted for over 92% of the 249,000 businesses in Ireland. This confirms that the majority of these micro businesses are sole traders or engaging 1-2 employees. Their businesses, ranging from construction to business services to logistics are essential to the operation of the business ecosystem in Ireland.  </p><p>When working by yourself, it is imperative for the well-being of that person to mix and interact with others, particularly those who share a common interest and in your local area. That is why networking is an excellent solution to possible loneliness and isolation for sole traders and those in the SME sector. The Local Enterprise Offices operate a number of different networks such as the Women in Business Network and the Business Network- where meetings are driven by the needs of the group. </p><p>Business owners of these micro companies are often time poor and are reluctant to use their time on something that they do not see a direct return in their profits. That is why my Department developed an online mapping of supports for small businesses, located on the website at</p><p><i>.</i></p><p>In this mapping tool, there are 83 hubs and co-working spaces and 82 networking groups. There are also 75 community enterprise centres who are members of NACEC (The National Association of Community Enterprise Centres). </p><p>In addition, Enterprise Ireland has recently completed the &euro;5m Community Enterprise Initiative Fund, stimulating and supporting enterprise and job creation at a local, community and regional level. This fund is part of the Government&rsquo;s &euro;250m Regional Enterprise Development Initiative aimed at accelerating economic recovery in every part of the country. Through the utilisation of existing infrastructure and the leveraging of nationally available enterprise supports, the specific objectives of the scheme include:</p><p>- Fostering an increased collaborative, networked and linked approach to regional and local enterprise development and job creation.</p><p>- Establishment of hubs, accelerators, networks and clusters or other partnerships based on regional strengths, opportunities and uniqueness.</p><p>- Proactively seeking out, encouraging and supporting applications from economically disadvantaged areas. </p><p>- Promotion of a progression pathway for companies as they start, develop and scale.</p><p>The above-mentioned initiatives alongside the Community Enterprise Centres and the networking organisations outlined can help to alleviate potential loneliness and isolation in the SME sector. It is important to promote the message that the hubs and co-working spaces are spread throughout the country. Business people who join these organisations will benefit not only from rich business connections but also the social aspect and connectivity that shared working spaces bring.</p></reply>

As this is a matter primarily for the Minister for Health, I suggest that the deputy might wish to pursue this issue directly with that Department.</p><p>As regards the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC), it is responsible in general for ensuring compliance with employment rights legislation, including the national minimum wage in all employment sectors. As the deputy will be aware, WRC inspectors, formerly NERA inspectors, routinely carry out inspections in all employment sectors, including in the social care sector, with a view to checking for and enforcing employment rights compliance by employers.</p><p>In the first instance, the WRC aims to achieve voluntary compliance with employment law through the provision of education and awareness, inspection of employers&rsquo; employment records and, enforcement where necessary.  If voluntary compliance cannot be achieved and employers either refuse or fail to rectify the breaches identified and/or pay money due to their employees, these cases are referred for further prosecution.</p><p>The following table sets out the outcome of inspection activities in the broader healthcare sector in the years 2014 to 2018. Figures for the sector were not captured separately prior to 2014.</p><p>Inspections in Health Nursing and Childcare Sector</p><p><table><tr><th>#</th><th>No. of   Inspections</th><th>Unpaid Wages Recovered</th></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>88</td><td>&euro;32,250</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>83</td><td>&euro;67,043</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>73</td><td>&euro;156,071</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>78</td><td>&euro;200,198</td></tr><tr><td>2018</td><td>4</td><td>&euro;0</td></tr></table></p><p>It is not possible to disaggregate the available data to identify the proportion of unpaid wages recouped by the WRC that relates to sleep over shifts in the social care sector.</p><p>It may be helpful to note that in response to compliance issues identified by NERA in the social care sector, guidance was published for the sector on the issue of entitlement to payment for hours worked by overnight workers.</p><p>This guidance can be accessed at:</p><p><i>).</i></p></reply>

This legislation applies to certain construction contracts entered into after the 25th July 2016 and imposes minimum contractual provisions in relation to payments, particularly the timing of payments, arising under a construction contract. It also provides a statutory entitlement to avail of adjudication as a means of resolving payment disputes that arise under applicable construction contracts. </p><p>The Act sets out the necessary procedures to pursue such a case through adjudication and my Department has published an information booklet on the Act and template forms which may be used to refer a case.

I welcome also that all motorways and national roads are open and that all public transport services are operating with a small number of diversions or curtailments. Local Authority Crisis Management Teams have now been stood down in the majority of counties reflecting the improved conditions. </p>  <p>  Every arm of Government, all Departments and Agencies in the different sectors, have been actively managing issues within their remit related to this severe weather, and will continue to do so as required.</p>  <p>  As is now established practice after such severe weather events, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government has signalled the Government&rsquo;s intention to fund local authorities for the exceptional and unbudgeted costs incurred in necessary immediate works associated with significant severe weather emergency events.</p>  <p>  Additionally, each Department is being requested to quantify, in so far as this is possible at this stage, the estimates for loss and damage incurred within their sector. Departments are to liaise directly with the local authorities and other relevant agencies in relation to funding necessary repairs and restoration through current or capital allocations as appropriate.</p>  <p>  In relation to damage to buildings and property which has been caused by the snow and wind, our advice is that people should in the first instance get in touch with their insurance companies. Businesses that suffer damage to stock or loss of property should ordinarily have insurance against that risk.</p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) are the &lsquo;first-stop-shop&rsquo; State support service for micro and small businesses in each local area, providing a &lsquo;signposting&rsquo; service in relation to all relevant state supports available including Revenue, the Department of Social Protection etc. The Local Enterprise Offices and Enterprise Ireland are the main Agencies within my Department that offer advice and support to indigenous companies. In the first instance businesses should contact their Local Authority where there are issues arising and information and advice will be available from the the Authorities' Business Support Units or the Local Enterprise Office. </p>  <p>  More generally, there are a number of existing emergency humanitarian support schemes that are operated by different Departments for sectors who may be impacted by flooding arising from severe weather. These include the Humanitarian Assistance Scheme operated by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, which is available to assist people whose homes are damaged by flooding and who are not in a position to meet costs for essential needs, household items and in some instances structural repair. The scheme is means tested and assistance is not provided for losses which are covered by insurance or for commercial and business losses. </p>  <p>  The Irish Red Cross also operate a Humanitarian Support Scheme for small businesses and community, voluntary and sporting bodies who are affected by flooding and who do not have insurance in place. </p>  <p>  The Department of Agriculture has been working constructively with industry and state services in the immediate aftermath of the severe weather event to get the farming sector up and running and fully operational again as quickly as possible. In order to provide ongoing support to the sector the Department runs a number of investment schemes which are already in place.</p></reply>

The conditions covered by the LTI are: acute leukaemia; mental handicap; cerebral palsy; mental illness (in a person under 16); cystic fibrosis; multiple sclerosis; diabetes insipidus; muscular dystrophies; diabetes mellitus; parkinsonism; epilepsy; phenylketonuria; haemophilia; spina bifida; hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide. Under the LTI Scheme, patients receive drugs, medicines, and medical and surgical appliances directly related to the treatment of their illness, free of charge. There are no plans to extend the list of conditions covered by the Scheme.</p>  <p>  For people who are not eligible for the LTI scheme, there are other arrangements which protect them from excessive medicine costs. </p>  <p>  Under the Drug Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;134 a month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals with ongoing expenditure on medicines.</p>  <p>  People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. In the assessment process, the HSE can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.  </p>  <p>  People who are not eligible for a medical card may still be able to avail of a GP visit card, which covers the cost of GP consultations.</p></reply>

Although not subject to professional statutory regulation, complementary therapists are subject to a range of legislation and regulation similar to other practitioners, including consumer legislation, competition, contract and criminal law. </p>  <p>  As previously advised, Department policy has been informed by the National Working Group on the Regulation of Complementary Therapists that was published in 2005. In addition to considering this report, the Department of Health has supported greater voluntary self-regulation of complementary therapy.  </p>  <p>  The immediate priority for the Department is the establishment of the boards of the remaining professions designated under the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005. The draft Regulations to designate the professions of counsellor and psychotherapist and to establish a registration board for these professions have now, in accordance with the provisions of the Act, been laid before each House of the Oireachtas and resolutions approving the drafts have been submitted to each House for consideration. </p>  <p>  Subject to the approval of the Houses, the next steps will be to make the regulations and appoint the 13 members of the registration board following the submission of suitable candidates for my consideration by the Public Appointments Service.  When the registration board has been established and its members appointed its primary tasks will be to commence drafting the various bye-laws to allow it to establish its registers.</p>  <p>  All applicants for registration with a Registration Board maintained by the Health and Social Care Professionals Council are required to undergo vetting with the National Vetting Bureau.</p></reply>

The Programme for a Partnership Government acknowledges the ongoing drafting of primary legislation for a new Transport Support Scheme to assist those with a disability to meet their mobility costs. The Health (Transport Support) Bill is on the list of priority legislation for publication in the Spring/Summer session 2018. I can confirm that work on the policy proposals for the new Scheme is at an advanced stage. The proposals seek to ensure that: </p><p>- There is a firm statutory basis to the Scheme's operation; </p><p>- There is transparency and equity in the eligibility criteria attaching to the Scheme; </p><p>- Resources are targeted at those with greatest needs; and </p><p>- The Scheme is capable of being costed and is affordable on its introduction and on an ongoing basis.</p><p>It is hoped to bring a General Scheme and Heads of Bill to Government shortly, seeking Government approval to the drafting of the Bill for the new Transport Support Payment.</p><p>Since the closure of the Mobility Allowance, the Government has directed that the Health Service Executive should continue to pay an equivalent monthly payment of up to &euro;208.50 per month to the 4,133 people in receipt of the Mobility Allowance, on an interim basis, pending the establishment of a new Transport Support Scheme.</p><p>Following closure of the Motorised Transport Grant Scheme in February 2013,  no further Motorised Transport Grants have been payable.</p><p>It is important to note that the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers scheme operated by the Revenue Commissioners, remains in place. This scheme provides VRT and VAT relief, an exemption from road tax and a fuel grant to drivers and passengers with a disability, who qualify under the relevant criteria set out in governing regulations made by the Minister for Finance.  Specifically adapted vehicles driven by disabled persons are also exempt from payment of tolls on national toll roads and toll bridges. Transport Infrastructure Ireland has responsibility for this particular Scheme.</p><p>Responsibility for the legislation governing the Road Traffic (Bus Lanes) (Exemption) Regulations rests with my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport. </p></reply>

Securing access to existing and new and innovative medicines is a key objective of the health service. However, the challenge is to do this in a safe and sustainable manner. Treatment must be appropriate and proportionate and clinical decision-making, such as prescribing, should be based on both patient needs and sound medical evidence.</p><p>Lidocaine 5% medicated plasters are licensed for the localised relief of post-shingles pain in adults. This is the only licensed use for the patch in Ireland. It has been reimbursed in the community drugs schemes since 2010. </p><p>When the plasters were first introduced, the budget impact was low, because of the specific indication for which they are licensed. It was therefore a cause of clinical concern that, from 2012 on, usage increased significantly, to the point where, as a nation, we were using more plasters than the entire UK National Health Service, with ten times our population. </p><p>When a treatment is intended for a small group of patients, and evidence suggests that it is being used for many times that number, it is important and appropriate for clinicians to review its use. In 2016, the HSE Medicines Management Programme reviewed the use of the plasters. The review estimated that only 5-10% of prescribing had been for the licensed indication. </p><p>Following the clinical review, and in the interest of ensuring appropriate patient care, the HSE introduced a new reimbursement approval system for the patches from 1 September 2017. This process supports their appropriate use, ensuring that post-shingles patients continue to receive this treatment.</p><p>Under the new arrangements, all patients receiving lidocaine plasters for the licensed indication, shingles, were automatically approved on the HSE system. All of these patients continue to receive the treatment under the community schemes. </p><p>Non-shingles patients were given a three month grace period, in which their GP could move them to other treatments or apply for continued reimbursement. However, from 1 December 2017, non-shingles patients were no longer automatically reimbursed under the community drugs schemes.</p><p>In order for non-shingles patients to receive the patch through the community schemes, their GP must apply online for continued reimbursement approval.  If an application is refused, the GP may appeal, making a clinical case for the patient.  The HSE advises that the turnaround time for applications is three working days and for appeals it is five days.</p><p>As of 5 March 2018, there have been 5,156 online applications from GPs requesting the reimbursement of Versatis. Of these applications, over 17%, or 896 patients, have been approved.</p><p>In addition, 437 online appeals have been made, and over 66% of these patients have been approved. The MMP has sought further information on 40 appeals before a recommendation on reimbursement can be made.</p><p>Since 1 September 2017, some 1,182 patients have been approved for the reimbursement of lidocaine plasters, based on the clinical case made by the GP.</p><p>It is clear that this new process supports appropriate use and prescribing and both post-shingles patients and other appropriate cases can continue to be treated with lidocaine plasters.</p><p>The introduction of the new approval system was flagged in August 2017, when details of the proposed changes were circulated by the HSE to prescribers and pharmacies. This advice has been re-issued in the last week, and information for patients and practitioners is on the HSE Medicines Management Programme website.  <i><i>().</i></i></p><p>This decision is a matter for the HSE. However, I fully support the objectives of the HSE Medicines Management Programme.</p></reply>

There is no provision under the GMS GP contract for persons who hold a medical card or GP visit card to be charged for routine phlebotomy services provided by their GP which are required to either assist in the diagnosis of illness or the treatment of a condition. The HSE has advised GPs that where a blood test forms part of the investigation or necessary treatment of a patient&rsquo;s symptoms or conditions, this should be free of charge for patients who hold a medical card or GP visit card. Notwithstanding this, I am aware that some GPs have begun to charge GMS patients for phlebotomy services in some circumstances. </p>  <p>  This is a matter of concern for me as it has long been the position, under successive Governments, that no user charges should apply to GP services provided to GMS and GP visit card patients.  If a patient who holds a medical card or GP visit card believes he or she has been incorrectly charged for routine phlebotomy services by his or her GP, then that patient may take the matter up with their HSE Local Health Office, who will investigate the complaint.</p>  <p>  If the local office determines that the charge was inappropriate, it will inform the HSE Primary Care Reimbursement Service who will arrange to refund the cost of the blood test to patient and recoup this amount from the GP. The local office will inform the GP of the decision to deduct the payment.</p></reply>

Securing access to existing and new and innovative medicines is a key objective of the health service. However, the challenge is to do this in a safe and sustainable manner. Treatment must be appropriate and proportionate and clinical decision-making, such as prescribing, should be based on both patient needs and sound medical evidence.</p><p>Lidocaine 5% medicated plasters are licensed for the localised relief of post-shingles pain in adults. This is the only licensed use for the patch in Ireland. It has been reimbursed in the community drugs schemes since 2010. </p><p>When the plasters were first introduced, the budget impact was low, because of the specific indication for which they are licensed. It was therefore a cause of clinical concern that, from 2012 on, usage increased significantly, to the point where, as a nation, we were using more plasters than the entire UK National Health Service, with ten times our population. </p><p>When a treatment is intended for a small group of patients, and evidence suggests that it is being used for many times that number, it is important and appropriate for clinicians to review its use. In 2016, the HSE Medicines Management Programme reviewed the use of the plasters. The review estimated that only 5-10% of prescribing had been for the licensed indication. </p><p>Following the clinical review, and in the interest of ensuring appropriate patient care, the HSE introduced a new reimbursement approval system for the patches from 1 September 2017. This process supports their appropriate use, ensuring that post-shingles patients continue to receive this treatment.</p><p>Under the new arrangements, all patients receiving lidocaine plasters for the licensed indication, shingles, were automatically approved on the HSE system. All of these patients continue to receive the treatment under the community schemes. </p><p>Non-shingles patients were given a three month grace period, in which their GP could move them to other treatments or apply for continued reimbursement. However, from 1 December 2017, non-shingles patients were no longer automatically reimbursed under the community drugs schemes.</p><p>In order for non-shingles patients to receive the patch through the community schemes, their GP must apply online for continued reimbursement approval.  If an application is refused, the GP may appeal, making a clinical case for the patient.  The HSE advises that the turnaround time for applications is three working days and for appeals it is five days.</p><p>As of 5 March 2018, there have been 5,156 online applications from GPs requesting the reimbursement of Versatis. Of these applications, over 17%, or 896 patients, have been approved.</p><p>In addition, 437 online appeals have been made, and over 66% of these patients have been approved. The MMP has sought further information on 40 appeals before a recommendation on reimbursement can be made.</p><p>Since 1 September 2017, some 1,182 patients have been approved for the reimbursement of lidocaine plasters, based on the clinical case made by the GP.</p><p>It is clear that this new process supports appropriate use and prescribing and both post-shingles patients and other appropriate cases can continue to be treated with lidocaine plasters.</p><p>The introduction of the new approval system was flagged in August 2017, when details of the proposed changes were circulated by the HSE to prescribers and pharmacies. This advice has been re-issued in the last week, and information for patients and practitioners is on the HSE Medicines Management Programme website.  <i>().</i></p><p>This decision is a matter for the HSE. However, I fully support the objectives of the HSE Medicines Management Programme</p></reply>

Under Section 52 of the Health Act 1970, as amended by Section 12 of the Health (Amendment) Act 2013, a person who has been referred to a hospital for an in-patient service, including that provided on a day case basis, will have to pay the statutory daily charge, currently &euro;80 per day, up to a maximum of &euro;800 per year. On this basis, where venesection is classed as a day case procedure and is not carried out in an out-patient setting, the public in-patient charge applies. </p><p>However, on admission to a public hospital, all patients have the option of being treated as a public or private patient. Patients opting to be treated privately choose to pay the consultant and the hospital in respect of the services that each provides. On this basis, where a patient has opted to be a private patient and where venesection is classed as a day case procedure, the following statutory hospital charges under Section 55 apply.<table><tr><th>Hospital Category </th><th>Daily charge for day case in-patient services where overnight accommodation not provided </th></tr><tr><td>Hospital Specified in Fifth Schedule </td><td>&euro;407</td></tr><tr><td>Hospital Specified in Sixth Schedule </td><td>&euro;329</td></tr></table></p><p>The charges applied in respect of private care in a public hospital relate not only to accommodation costs but also costs associated with non-consultant hospital doctors, nursing staff, medicines, blood, medical and surgical supplies, radiology, diagnostics, operating theatres, laboratories, administration and support staff. It is also noted that patients opting to be treated privately must also pay the consultant fees associated with their treatment.</p><p>My Department is currently considering the issue of the application of the public in-patient charge of &euro;80 for venesection in Acute Hospitals as well as broader issues in relation to the treatment of patients with Hereditary Haemochromatosis. </p></reply>

Support for eHealth and the E.H.R. programme is a key recommendation in the Sl&aacute;inteCare Report which advocated &ldquo;continued strong support of the e-health strategy - particularly ensuring the necessary funding for timely roll-out of the EHR system".  eHealth deployment also forms part of the recently published National Development Plan where Project Ireland 2040 states that "The National Development Plan will support the provision of digital health services, including the development of electronic health records in many health care settings such as the New Children&rsquo;s Hospital over the 10-year implementation timescale and reflects what was envisaged in the eHealth strategy for Ireland." Details of the eHealth elements of the implementation plan for Sl&aacute;intecare will be announced shortly.</p>  <p>  Significant progress is being made with the implementation of the Health Identifiers Act 2014, which provides for a system of unique identification for patients, professionals and providers. On 30 May 2017, a Commencement Order and Regulations under the Health Identifiers Act 2014 were signed, allowing for the implementation of the I.H.I. for patients. The technical implementation project of the IHI has begun with a roll-out for the integration of the identifier into various ICT systems nationally on a phased basis across health services.</p>  <p>  In addition to the I.H.I., other national ICT systems are being introduced or standardised.  For example, the Maternal and New-born system (MN-CMS) which is effectively our first national electronic patient record, has been phased-in to the Maternity Units in Kerry, Cork University Hospital, the Rotunda and the National Maternity Hospital in Dublin. It continues to be further deployed nationally on a phased basis. Other systems such as the national laboratory system (MedLIS), the national oncology management system (MOCIS) and other systems such as eReferrals are being implemented.</p>  <p>  The HSE are currently progressing with a health portal initiative which will provide patients with access to their information. The initial focus of the health portal will be on maternity service users and will allow patients access to medical reports and upcoming appointments. The range of services available will expand as the National E.H.R. Programme progresses.</p>  <p>  Ensuring patients and health professionals have access to the right information, in the right place, at the right time, supports more effective decision-making on the part of clinicians, improves administrative efficiency and can also empower patients to be more informed and involved in their own care or treatment. However, there must be a balance between using and sharing personal health information appropriately while continuing to protect rights to privacy and confidentiality.

The implementation of the recommendations in the VFM Review continues to be a priority in the HSE&rsquo;s National Service Plan for 2018.</p><p>The Report &ldquo;Time to Move on from Congregated Settings &ndash; A Strategy for Community Inclusion&rdquo; proposes a new model of support in the community moving people from Congregated settings to the community in line with Government policy. </p><p>The Programme for Partnership Government contains a commitment to continue to move people with disabilities out of congregated settings, to enable them to live independently and to be included in the community.  The objective is to reduce this figure by one-third by 2021 and ultimately, to eliminate all congregated settings.</p><p>At the end of December 2017, there were less than 2,400 people with a disability living in congregated settings. The HSE has prioritised the transition of 170 people from congregated settings in 2018 under its Service Plan. The HSE has established a subgroup, under the Value for Money Steering Group, which is developing an implementation plan for moving people from institutions that will be rolled out at a regional and local level, in full consultation with residents and their families. </p><p>To ensure that the needs of people transitioning from congregated settings are fully taken into account during the process, the model of care for individuals will be based on a person centred plan (PCP). The PCP may change over time in line with an individual&rsquo;s needs and circumstances and the model of service delivery applicable at a particular time.</p><p>I am acutely aware of the degree of social isolation experienced by people with a disability. </p><p>The Deputy will be interested to know that in my portfolio as Minister of State at the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, yesterday, together with my colleague Regina Doherty, I launched an extensive consultation process in relation to how our Department can support people with disabilities to obtain and retain employment. I firmly believe that securing employment can play a fundamental part in helping with the difficulties of social isolation experienced by many people with a disability. </p><p>In the context of the Deputy&rsquo;s specific questions on the issues of loneliness and social isolation, in particular among people with a disability, he may wish to access the research conducted by IDS TILDA. This is a longitudinal study researching ageing in Ireland among people with an intellectual disability aged 40 and over, funded by the Department of Health, through the Health Research Board.

Since the closure of the Mobility Allowance, the Government has directed that the Health Service Executive should continue to pay an equivalent monthly payment of up to &euro;208.50 per month to the 4,133 people in receipt of the Mobility Allowance, on an interim basis, pending the establishment of a new Transport Support Scheme.</p>  <p>  The Government decided that the detailed preparatory work required for a new Transport Support Scheme and associated statutory provisions should be progressed by the Minister for Health.  The Programme for a Partnership Government acknowledges the ongoing drafting of primary legislation for a new Transport Support Scheme to assist those with a disability to meet their mobility costs. The Health (Transport Support) Bill is on the list of priority legislation for publication in the Spring/Summer session 2018. I can confirm that work on the policy proposals for the new Scheme is at an advanced stage. The proposals seek to ensure that: </p>  <p>  - There is a firm statutory basis to the Scheme's operation; </p>  <p>  - There is transparency and equity in the eligibility criteria attaching to the Scheme;</p>  <p>  - Resources are targeted at those with greatest needs; and </p>  <p>  - The Scheme is capable of being costed and is affordable on its introduction and on an ongoing basis.</p>  <p>  It is hoped to bring a General Scheme and Heads of Bill to Government shortly, seeking Government approval to the drafting of the Bill for the new Transport Support Payment.</p>  <p>  With regard to the Motorised Transport Grant, this scheme operated as a means-tested grant to assist persons with severe disabilities with the purchase or adaptation of a car, where that car was essential to retain employment. The maximum Motorised Transport Grant, which was payable once in any three-year period, was &euro;5,020.  Following closure of the scheme in February 2013,  no further Motorised Transport Grants have been payable. It is important to note that the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers scheme operated by the Revenue Commissioners, remains in place. This scheme provides VRT and VAT relief, an exemption from road tax and a fuel grant to drivers and passengers with a disability, who qualify under the relevant criteria set out in governing regulations made by the Minister for Finance.  Specifically adapted vehicles driven by disabled persons are also exempt from payment of tolls on national toll roads and toll bridges. Transport Infrastructure Ireland has responsibility for this particular Scheme.</p></reply>

Under the Directive, known as the Cross Border Healthcare Directive (CBD), insured patients are entitled to have the costs of cross-border healthcare services reimbursed if the healthcare service in question is among the benefits to which they are entitled in their Member State of affiliation.

While completion of the detailed legal agreement will require further engagement between both hospitals, the HSE and my Department, I can confirm that a broad understanding has been reached on the way forward.  This will protect the State's resources in investing in this important project and it will also further underpin the operational independence of the maternity hospital. </p><p>The Deputy will, I hope, appreciate that pending finalisation of agreement between all stakeholders, it is premature for me to give any further information at this point.</p></reply>

In that context, the Department has emphasised the need for robust measures to ensure compliance and that consultants deliver their work commitment to the public system.</p>  <p>  The HSE has submitted details of measures it has implemented and proposals in train. On 12 February the Director General of the HSE confirmed to the Secretary General that all Hospital Groups have been directed to put in place a robust assurance process with each of their hospitals to confirm contract compliance, including a monthly monitoring process by hospitals of performance at individual consultant level. </p>  <p>  A meeting has been arranged between officials of my Department and senior HSE Management on 22 March 2018 to discuss these proposals and any other measures that may be required to ensure that the arrangements in place are sufficiently robust to monitor consultants activity and to ensure compliance.</p>  <p>  In the longer term I have established an independent group, chaired by Dr Donal de Buitl&eacute;ir, to examine the impact of separating private practice from the public hospital system given that this was one of the key recommendations of the Sl&aacute;intecare Report.</p></reply>

It is generally accepted that there is a need to modernise the current GMS contract and ensure that general practice is a viable and rewarding career for medical graduates. My aim is to develop a contract which has a population health focus, providing in particular for health promotion and disease prevention and for the structured ongoing care of chronic conditions. A new contract must be flexible and be able to respond to the changing nature of the GP workforce. It must also include provisions in relation to service quality and standards, performance, accountability and transparency. </p>  <p>  It is essential that engagement on GP contractual issues is aimed squarely at meeting the substantial challenges, current and future, the health service and general practice face. The latest phase of engagement with GP representatives commenced in January 2017, and discussions were progressed on a wide range of items throughout 2017.  Discussions are currently paused, and, at my request, officials of my Department are working with their counterparts in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and in the HSE to ensure that the overall approach is focused fully on the strategic challenges and on the Government&rsquo;s health services reform agenda. It is important to ensure that any new contract will result in service improvements across general practice benefitting both patients and GPs.</p>  <p>  I expect that engagement with GP representative bodies will recommence shortly. I look forward to further progress in the coming months on the GP contract. </p></reply>

I acknowledge the contribution made by GPs and other health professionals who provide services under contract on behalf of the HSE, through reductions in the fees in respect of these services, to addressing the unprecedented economic crisis which the State faced over recent years.  </p>  <p>  I announced in November my intention to undertake a process of engagement with representative bodies of contracted health professionals aimed at putting in place a new multi-annual approach to fees, commencing in 2019, in return for service improvement and contractual reform and in line with Government priorities for the health service. Officials of my Department are also undertaking preparatory work with the Department of Public Expenditure and the HSE in relation to this important agenda. I expect engagement to begin shortly.</p>  <p>  As at 1 January 2018, there were 25 GMS vacancies nationally. As there are currently almost 2,500 GPs contracted to provide services under the GMS scheme, this represents a relatively low percentage of vacancy of 1%. All vacancies are currently covered by a locum GP, therefore a GP service continues to be provided in all of the affected areas.</p>  <p>  It should also be noted that, despite reductions to certain payment rates made under FEMPI legislation the number of GPs contracted under the GMS scheme has risen from 2,136 in 2009 to 2,484 as at 1st March 2018.  Furthermore, the total fees paid to GPs under the GMS scheme have also increased during this period from just over &euro;427 million in 2009 to approximately &euro;517 million in 2017. This increase in fees is largely due to significant developments in GP services introduced in recent years, with more services being made available to our citizens and additional financial support provided by the HSE.</p></reply>

The HSE will continue to pursue the delivery of primary care centres in line with national requirements of appraisal, design, planning, tender and construction. In addition, where private funding is involved, this is subject to market pressures such as the developers' access to adequate financing.

The Steering Group considers that a Managed Clinical Rehabilitation Network model represents best practice as a means of providing neuro-rehabilitation care and support/accommodation needs.  The HSE&rsquo;s Social Care Division and its Clinical Programme and Strategy Division are working in tandem to  progress this.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health is not directly represented on the National Steering Group as the development of the implementation framework is a service matter, in the first instance, for the HSE. However, the HSE keeps the Department  informed of progress on an ongoing basis. Updates and briefings are  provided and meetings are held, as and when required. The Minister is kept informed of all developments as part of ongoing reporting  arrangements.</p></reply>

Each year in Ireland around 300 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer and 90 die from the disease.  All cervical cancers are linked to high risk Human Papillomavirus (HPV) types.  In 2009 the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) recommended HPV vaccination for all 12 year old girls to reduce their risk of cervical cancer and in September 2010 the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in first year of second level schools. </p>  <p>  There are claims of an association between HPV vaccination and a number of conditions experienced by a group of young women.  An illness that occurs around the time a vaccine is given and is already known to be common in adolescence does not imply the vaccine caused the problem.  It appears that some girls first suffered symptoms around the time they received the HPV vaccine, and understandably some parents have connected the vaccine to their daughter&rsquo;s condition.  However, these claims have led to a significant drop in uptake rates of the HPV vaccine from 87% in 2014/15 to 72% in 2015/16 and 51% in 2016/17.  Provisional figures from the HSE indicate that HPV vaccine uptake rates increased in September/October 2017 to 62% due to a comprehensive communications campaign for parents with support from a large number of key stakeholders e.g. the HPV alliance which currently has 37 organisations working together such as the Irish Cancer Society and the Marie Keating Foundation.</p>  <p>  While no medicine (including vaccines) is entirely without risk, the safety profile of Gardasil has been continuously monitored since it was first authorised in September 2006 both nationally and at EU level.  The Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) is responsible for monitoring the safety and quality of all medicines including vaccines that are licensed in Ireland.  The HPRA operates a national adverse reaction reporting system, which members of the public and healthcare professionals are encouraged to submit any suspected adverse reactions through this system.  All Reports received by the HPRA are routinely transmitted to the European Medicines Agency's adverse reaction database for inclusion in global signal detection and monitoring activities. Gardasil is one of the most closely studied and monitored medicinal products.  The vast majority of reports received by the HPRA have been consistent with the expected pattern of short term adverse side effects for the vaccine, as described in the product information.  </p>  <p>  Anyone who is suffering ill health is eligible to seek medical attention, and to access appropriate health and social care services, irrespective of the cause of their symptoms.  The diverse nature of these symptoms, which can have both physical and psychological causes, are shared by many conditions which has implications for both diagnostic and treatment services.  The individual nature of the needs of some children may require access to specialist services and the HSE are currently working to put in place clinical care pathways appropriate to the differing medical needs of this group.  As there is no scientific evidence that the vaccine causes long term illnesses, the HPV vaccine cannot be held responsible for these illnesses. </p>  <p>  It is important that people receive accurate information from reliable sources in relation to the safety of vaccines, and to increase the uptake rates of all vaccines in the State&rsquo;s immunisation programmes. The scientific evidence is clear and misinformation is causing real harm to those unvaccinated children and adults who develop vaccine preventable diseases, and to people who seek inappropriate treatments for real conditions that are not caused by vaccines.</p></reply>

Teagasc is also monitoring the fodder situation in adjoining areas and will carry further assessments if necessary. As with all measures, certain criteria apply. Farmers, within the region identified by Teagasc as having a significant fodder shortage and having completed a fodder budgeting exercise with their FAS agricultural advisor, will be eligible to receive a financial contribution of &euro;8 per standard 4x4 bale of hay or straw for feeding and &euro;12 per standard 4x4 bale of silage or haylage. </p>  <p>  This contribution is payable towards the additional cost of transporting fodder sourced through the Co-operative system. Farmers will still pay the cost of the fodder in the normal way. Only the shortfall in fodder will be eligible to receive support under the measure. </p>  <p>  It is important to emphasise that this is a very targeted and locally focused measure, centring on areas of fodder scarcity where normal local trading in fodder cannot service. At present the southern part of the country has not been identified by Teagasc as an area that is currently experiencing a significant fodder shortage and reports indicate that there is currently adequate fodder available within the region. My Department will continue to monitor the situation.</p></reply>

Successful applicants are required to have completed a recognised course of education in agriculture giving rise to an award at FETAC level 6 or its equivalent. This requirement is in place to ensure that National Reserve and Young Farmer Scheme funding is targeted at bona fide young farmers.  Under the 2015 National Reserve and Young Farmer Scheme Ireland introduced increased flexibility in order to maximise the number of eligible applicants into the schemes and  students of agricultural education were included if otherwise eligible. Ireland was required to notify the EU Commission of the additional educational criteria being applied to the schemes in 2015.  </p><p>The EU Commission subsequently advised Ireland that the flexible arrangements that would allow an applicant to commence their agricultural education after the date of submission of an application under the National Reserve and/or Young Farmers Scheme did not fit with the &lsquo;annual logic of the Direct Payments&rsquo; and was a risk of non-compliance with Regulatory requirements.

This Regulation included an amendment to EU Regulation 1307/2013 regarding the number of years a successful applicant under the Young Farmers Scheme (YFS) can receive payment.  The relevant amendment is in two parts.  The first part of the regulatory amendment provides that YFS applicants may receive payment for five years starting from the first submission of an application for payment, provided that the application takes place within five years of the commencement of farming.  This period of five years also applies to farmers who had received payment under the scheme in respect of applications prior to 2018.  The second part of the regulatory amendment provides that it is optional for Member States to extend the provision to young farmers who set up a holding in the period 2010-2013, and who had received payment under the YFS in respect of applications before the 2018 scheme year.</p>  <p>  Ireland has applied the maximum 2% of the national ceiling to create a YFS fund of &euro;24 million annually.  Ireland has also utilised the option to overestimate the BPS ceiling in order to take account of unused YFS funds and this funding was used to allocate entitlements to young farmers and new entrants under the 2017 National Reserve.  Therefore the allocation of &euro;24 million is fully utilised in Ireland.  If Ireland opted to implement just the first part of the amended regulatory provision it would result in a windfall gain for some Young Farmers Scheme applicants who had commenced farming between 2010 and 2013 and who have already received payment based on the regulatory provisions applying at the time.  It is estimated that the additional cost of implementing just the first part of the regulatory amendment in Ireland would be in excess of &euro;5.5 million in 2018 and &euro;7.5 million in 2019 which would result in a requirement for a linear cut to all farmers&rsquo; basic payments in order to fund this additional spend under the Young Farmers Scheme.</p>  <p>  It is for this reason that Ireland will implement the relevant regulatory amendment of Regulation 2017/2393 in full.  This will provide for a situation where with effect from the 2018 scheme year, successful applicants under the Young Farmers Scheme who commenced farming from 2014 onwards and submit their first YFS application within five years of commencement of farming may receive payment under the YFS for five years.  </p>  <p>  EU Regulations provide for the operation of the Young Farmers Scheme from 2015 to 2019.  On this basis my Department has not carried out modelling on estimated costs of the scheme beyond the scheme end date of 2019.</p></reply>

Member States with direct payments per hectare less than 90% of the EU average may transfer up to 25% from Pillar 2 to Pillar 1 on an annual basis. If any transfers were to be made between Pillar 1 and Pillar 2, the deadlines to notify the Commission were 1 August 2014 for calendar years 2015-2019 and 1 August 2017 for any revised transfers from calendar year 2018. Ireland did not avail of this provision as there were no funds available under the Rural Development Programme to transfer to Pillar 1. There will be no underspend under the RDP and the &euro;4 billion of EU/Exchequer funds provided for will be spent over the lifetime of the programme. </p>  <p>  EU Regulation 1307/2013 sets out the basis for the establishment and replenishment of the National Reserve.  In 2015, in the first year of implementation of the Basic Payment Scheme, Ireland applied the maximum 3% of the Basic Payment Scheme financial ceiling to establish a National Reserve fund of over &euro;24 million.  Since 2015 the three methods for replenishing the National Reserve are:</p>  <p>  - Surrender of entitlements that remain unused by farmers for two consecutive years; </p>  <p>  - Clawback derived following the transfer of entitlements without land.  In Ireland the rate of clawback is currently set at 20% on the sale of entitlements without land; </p>  <p>  - A linear cut to the value of all farmers&rsquo; entitlements.</p>  <p>  EU Regulation 1307/2013 also sets out the basis for financing the Young Farmers Scheme.  Ireland has applied the maximum 2% of the national ceiling to establish a Young Farmers Scheme of some &euro;24 million in each year from 2015 to 2019.</p>  <p>  There is no Regulatory provision to allow for the use of Exchequer funding to supplement either the National Reserve or the Young Farmers Scheme.</p></reply>

The following table provides all the Beef, Pigmeat and Dairy exports for each of the years 2015, 2016 and 2017 to the USA, in both value and volume terms. Ireland does not currently have sheep meat access to the USA.</p><p>In view of the volume of statistical data collected as part of agri-food trade statistics, some errors in respect of individual products may occur.  Where these anomalies are identified, the Department will liaise with the CSO to highlight and amend the information as required.  <table><tr><th></th><th>2015</th><th></th><th>2016</th><th></th><th>2017</th><th></th></tr><tr><td></td><td>&euro;000s</td><td>tonnes</td><td>&euro;000s</td><td>tonnes</td><td>&euro;000s</td><td>tonnes</td></tr><tr><td>Beef</td><td>5,452</td><td>912</td><td>9,840</td><td>1,772</td><td>7,719</td><td>1,571</td></tr><tr><td>Pigmeat</td><td>27,465</td><td>6,827</td><td>25,427</td><td>6,360</td><td>19,021</td><td>4,860</td></tr><tr><td>Dairy</td><td>1,862</td><td>31,232</td><td>1,725</td><td>33,819</td><td>1,890</td><td>37,830</td></tr></table></p><p>In relation to beef, according to the CSO exports have increased from under 1,000 tonnes in 2015 to over 1,500 tonnes in 2017. Ireland was the first EU MS to secure market access to the USA for beef in January 2015 and was the first Member State (MS) to export beef to the USA. In July 2016 Ireland received approval to send Beef Intended for Grinding (BIFG), also known as manufacturing beef to the US. </p><p>CSO data is classed by CN (Combined Nomenclature) codes in line with EU requirements and data on manufacturing/ground beef is not available. However, it can be seen from the data that the majority of beef exports, around 90% in 2017, were comprised of frozen bovine boneless beef and frozen edible bovine offal. Ireland does not have market access to the USA in terms of processed beef, which may also be called manufactured beef. Therefore exports of these types of products did not occur.</p><p>The role of my Department is to open new markets and maintain existing markets for Irish food exports and overall targets are set out for agri-food exports in Foodwise 2025, in terms of an increase to &euro;19 billion by 2025. However, volume and value targets are not set on a country or commodity basis. My Department works very closely with the meat industry but once a market has been opened trade arrangements are left to individual companies and exporters and the actual trade volumes will vary depending on a range of factors such as currency flucations, global supply and demand, and local and international factors.</p></reply>

Irish agri food exports to the USA have more than doubled from around &euro;520 million (85,000 tonnes) in 2012 to &euro;1.125 billion (190,000 tonnes) in 2017.</p>  <p>  Ireland was the first EU Member State to be granted beef market access to the USA in 2015. In July 2016, my Department received approval to send Beef Intended for Grinding (BIFG), also known as manufacturing beef to the US. A total of 10 Irish plants have been approved for the export of raw intact beef to the US, of which 2 are also approved for BIFG. According to the CSO, beef exports have increased from under 1,000 tonnes in 2015 to over 1,500 tonnes in 2017. </p>  <p>  Sheepmeat exports from the EU to the US are currently banned due to the presence of TSE in certain EU Member States. Sheepmeat access to the USA will depend in the first instance on the USA lifting its TSE ban on EU Sheepmeat. The Food Safety Inspection Service of USDA visited Ireland in September 2017, primarily on a beef and pigmeat inspection, but they also visited 2 Irish sheepmeat plants. My Department submitted a sheepmeat questionnaire (SRT) in 2017 in preparation for the lifting of this ban and continues to raise this issue with US officials, both as part of the Trade Missions to the USA and with visiting US officials to Ireland. However, it is not possible to predict a timeline for sheepmeat market access to the USA.</p>  <p>  Ireland has enjoyed uninterrupted access to the US market for raw pork since 2001 and a total of 3 plants are approved for the export of raw pork to the USA. Pigmeat exports to the US have increased from &euro;8 million (4,100 tonnes) in 2012 to &euro;19.0 million (4,860 tonnes) in  2017. </p></reply>

At the end of last year my Department received a copy of the draft Report of the Certification and Accreditation Administration of the People&rsquo;s Republic of China (CNCA) inspection which had taken place in August/September 2017 to assess individual processing plants.  In early 2018, my Department responded to the draft report clarifying a number of issues and is now awaiting a response from CNCA. A draft veterinary health certificate has also been submitted to the Chinese Authorities. There is no CNCA inspection scheduled for 2018. I understand that Ireland is now in the final stages of the market access process for beef. However, it should be noted that the timelines are not within the control of my Department. </p>  <p>  In terms of pigmeat access, Ireland has had market access to China for over 10 years. China has developed into a major market for Irish pigmeat, and for the past several years it has been the second-most important market for Irish pigmeat worldwide, behind only the UK. Ireland exported over &euro;100 million of pigmeat, or around 65,000 tonnes, to China in 2017.</p>  <p>  For sheepmeat, my Department has previously made contact with the Chinese authorities in relation to opening market access and submitted a questionnaire on animal health risk factors for Irish sheepmeat products in 2014. However, my officials were informed that AQSIQ would consider only one species application at a time, and the process for beef access was already underway. </p></reply>

Once this process is complete, the data will provide the basis for the identification of eligible areas in the ANC scheme from 2019 onwards. </p>  <p>  In addition to the technical work on the biophysical criteria, the Regulation allows for a linked process of fine tuning to finalise the determination of what lands will be eligible under the new scheme. This fine tuning is based on objective criteria, with the purpose of excluding areas which are deemed to have met the thresholds for biophysical criteria but in which &lsquo;significant natural constraints&rsquo; have been overcome by investment, economic activity, normal land productivity, production methods or farming systems. The process of sourcing and anlaysing data for this process is also underway.</p>  <p>  In order to progress this work, my Department is in on-going communication with the EU Commission in relation to the accepted parameters and technical aspects of this project. Any change to the ANC scheme on foot of this process will require formal agreement with the EU Commission via an amendment of Ireland's Rural Development Programme 2014 - 2020. </p></reply>

Because the storm occurred at this time of year it proved particularly disruptive as farmers coped with challenging weather conditions alongside the normal busy workload of spring; calving and lambing and winter feeding. The key on-farm challenges revolved around preventing the freezing up of water supplies at a critical time for lactating animals, the provision of fodder and shelter to stock against the worst of the snowfall and dangerous conditions for farmyards and environs. Delayed turn-out of some stock is increasing the demand for fodder and accommodation. In this regard it should be noted that the targeted, localised scheme to provide a subsidy for long distance transport of fodder is open and available to farmers affected by fodder shortages in the West and North West of the country.</p>  <p>  Throughout this period and immediately afterwards  Department staff, together with Teagasc worked at local level to ensure that the farming community had access to the best advice on how to cope with the numerous issues thrown up by the storm. To support those in more immediate difficulties the Department of Agriculture Food and the Marine emergency phone line for animal welfare issues remained open and attended at all times. All requests for support were responded to.</p>  <p>  I would like to take this opportunity to recognise the significant assistance the farming community provided within the wider local community at this busy time as they looked in on neighbours, cleared roads and helped to restore access to more remote rural areas.</p>  <p>  At sector level my Department worked closely with all stakeholders and with industry to minimise disruption to critical activities including milk collection services. I am happy to be able to report that all major issues were resolved in the shortest possible time thanks to the coordinated efforts of farmers, industry and my own Department staff.</p>  <p>  As the storm abated and the sector slowly returned to normal it became clear that the main problem centred on damage to horticulture and other on-farm structures. Such structures will principally be insured and it is important that insurance companies respond rapidly and flexibly to the needs of their farmers customers. It is important to emphasise that public support cannot be provided for insurable risks.</p>  <p>  In order to respond where possible to the issue of structural damage I believe that it is appropriate to consider what aspects can be addressed through on-farm investment support schemes operated by my Department and I have asked my officials to examine this as a matter of urgency.</p></reply>

A-rated properties are the most energy efficient, and G-rated properties are the least energy efficient. A higher BER rating can indicate lower energy bills and higher levels of warmth and comfort. A BER is calculated through energy use for space and hot water heating, ventilation and lighting. </p>  <p>  Under S.I. No. 243 of 2012 (ENERGY PERFORMANCE OF BUILDINGS REGULATIONS) any person who is selling or letting a property must &ldquo;ensure that the energy performance indicator of the current BER certificate for the building is stated in any advertisements, where such advertisements are taken relating to the sale or letting of that building.&rdquo; The penalty for non-compliance with this regulation is a class A fine of up to &euro;5,000. </p>  <p>  There is currently no minimum BER rating that properties in the private rental sector must achieve. However, The Government's Strategy to Combat Energy Poverty 2016-2019, contains an action to examine the impact of introducing minimum thermal efficiency standards for rental properties with a view to introducing such standards post 2020.</p>  <p>  Previous research indicated that people living in rented accommodation are twice as likely to live in a home that is E, F or G rated on the Building Energy Rating (BER) scale, and spend &euro;160-&euro;419 per annum more on energy than households in a home rated with a BER of B. However there is currently under-investment in improving the energy performance of rental properties. The typical residential tenancy in Ireland is short and hence tenants do not tend to invest significant sums in the property they are living in. At the same time, landlords under-invest in energy efficiency works as the tenants are the ones who benefit from the consequent energy bill savings and in a constrained rental market there appears to be little value placed on the energy efficiency of a rented property. These diverging incentives mean that energy efficiency investment is much lower in the private rented sector than among homeowners, even though Government grant schemes such as the Better Energy Homes scheme are open to landlords.</p>  <p>  In 2015 my Department procured external experts to examine the impact of introducing minimum energy efficiency standards for rented properties for the post 2020 period. These research findings are now being updated with new data from the 2016 census which showed an increase in the number of people renting accommodation across the State. When this is complete my Department will present the findings, with a view to publishing the research and engaging in a full public consultation.</p></reply>

This management is carried out by Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI), the State Agency with statutory responsibility for inland fisheries. The management policy is based on the fact that each of Ireland&rsquo;s 147 salmon rivers, river sections, estuaries, etc., has its own genetically unique stock of salmon, which migrates to sea as juveniles and returns to the same river in adulthood to spawn and create the next generation of fish exclusive to that river.    IFI is supported in its management role by Ireland&rsquo;s Standing Scientific Committee. IFI also draws on international advice from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES).  </p>  <p>  The Atlantic salmon is a protected species under the EU Habitats Directive with which Ireland&rsquo;s current salmon management regime complies. In order to align fully with the Directive and the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organisation (NASCO) principles, harvest fisheries are now only allowed on individual river stocks which are shown to have a surplus and in estuaries where the stocks from individual rivers entering the estuary are each meeting their individual conservation limits.</p>  <p>  The conservation limit for any river is the number of adult spawning fish required to maintain a viable and sustainable salmon population. The river referred to is not open to harvest as it is not meeting its conservation limit but is above the threshold (50% of the limit) to justify catch and release angling.  This permits people to engage in and enjoy angling activity while having a negligible impact of vulnerable fish stocks and encouraging the shared responsibility to contribute to conservation and the potential rebuilding of these stocks. </p>  <p>  There are 39 rivers nationally which have catch and release status in 2018. It is considered preferable, from an angling perspective, to have a river open on this basis as opposed to the river being closed to all angling.</p>  <p>  The conservation imperative demands that current salmon stocks are not further eroded by mismanagement or inappropriate exploitation, whether via angling or commercial fisheries.</p>  <p>  IFI operates a confidential 24 hour hotline to which incidents of poaching and pollution and other activity can be reported. The number is 1890 34 74 24.  I would encourage anglers and members of the public to immediately make a report if they suspect any illegal activity.</p></reply>

Today, almost 7 out of 10 of the 2.3 million premises in Ireland have access to high speed broadband. Since this Government came into office almost 400,000 additional premises have access to high speed broadband. This will increase to nearly 8 out of 10 premises by the end of this year and by 2020, 9 out of 10 premises will have access to a high speed broadband connection. This is being achieved via a combination of commercial investment and a State led intervention.  In April 2017 I published an updated High Speed Broadband Map which is available at<i>www.broadband.gov.ie</i>. This map shows the areas targeted by commercial operators to provide high speed broadband services and the areas that will be included in the State Intervention Area under the National Broadband Plan (NBP). </p><p>The Map is colour coded and searchable by address/eircode: </p><p>- The AMBER areas represent the target areas for the proposed State led Intervention under the NBP and are the subject of an ongoing procurement process. </p><p>- The BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have plans to deliver high speed broadband services.  </p><p>- The LIGHT BLUE areas represent eir's commercial rural deployment plans to rollout high speed broadband to 300,000 premises by the end of this year as part of a Commitment Agreement signed with me in April. </p><p>Premises along the R130 from Ashbourne to Garristown fall into all of these categories. Individuals can check which category their premises falls into by going to my Department&rsquo;s website <i>www.broadband.gov.ie </i>and entering their eircode into the High Speed Broadband Map.</p><p>In April 2017, I signed a Commitment Agreement with eir in relation to its plans to provide High speed broadband to 300,000 premises in rural areas on a commercial basis. eir has committed to completing the rollout by the end of this year.  Information on eir's planned rural deployment is available at <i><i></i></i><i><font color="#0000FF">/</font></i>. A copy of the Commitment Agreement is available on my Department&rsquo;s website, <i>www.dccae.gov.ie</i><i>.</i></p><p>Quarterly updates on eir's rural deployment are published on this website. eir has passed a total of 121,000 premises as of December 2017.</p><p>My Department is in a formal procurement process to select a company who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network in the State intervention area. That procurement process is now in its final stages. </p><p>In the interim, practical initiatives will continue to be addressed through the work of the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce to address obstacles and improve connectivity in respect of existing and future mobile phone and broadband services. </p><p>Under this Taskforce, engagement between telecommunications operators and local authorities through the Broadband Officers is continuing to strengthen.  These Broadband Officers are acting as single points of contact in local authorities for their communities.  The appointment of these officers is already reaping rewards in terms of ensuring a much greater degree of consistency in engagements with operators and clearing obstacles to developing infrastructure.  There is a link to a list of these local Broadband Officers on my Department's website.</p></reply>

The design of the new scheme has included an extensive independent economic appraisal. This appraisal compared the cost of supporting a range of commercial renewable technologies, at various scales, to ensure that the new scheme delivers value for money for energy users whilst also delivering on the energy pillars of sustainability and security of supply. The assessment included analysis of the optimum financial support mechanisms for renewable technologies, in line with the 2014 EU State Aid Guidelines.    The 2014 EU State Aid Guidelines set the framework and extent of financial support options for national renewable electricity (RES-E) support schemes. In general and except for small scale and demonstration projects, RES-E support levels must be set through competitive bidding processes (renewable electricity auctions) and all new RES-E schemes should provide support in the form of a premium in addition to the market price. </p>  <p>  Following on from the RESS public consultation and review, a final design proposal will be brought to Government for approval in the coming months, including the overall costs and technologies to be supported. Subsequent to a Government decision, a formal application for State Aid clearance from the European Commission will commence. The new scheme is expected to open in 2019. </p>  <p>  At this stage no final decisions have been made as regards which technologies or scales will be supported under the new RESS. </p>  <p>  The regulation of the electricity network (including the management of the grid connection process) is a matter for the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU), which is an independent statutory body and I have no function in the matter.</p></reply>

A number of these organisations deliver broadband to their customers such as Eir, Vodafone, Virgin Media, SKY, BT, Westnet and Imagine. Other organisations operating in the energy market such as Bord G&aacute;is Energy and Electric Ireland utilise Eircodes to deliver services to their customers. Also, I understand that OpenEir and Gas Networks Ireland have integrated Eircode into their interactive online mapping tools that enables home and business owners to view the availability of fibre broadband and gas connections in their area.  </p><p>As part of the National Broadband Plan, my Department has undertaken a comprehensive analysis and mapping process of high speed broadband availability across the country. My Department developed an interactive map (available at ) which identifies locations and premises as being either served by the commercial sector (BLUE/LIGHT BLUE) or requiring State intervention (AMBER) under the NBP.  This map, finalised for procurement in April 2017, is updated quarterly using the latest version of GeoDirectory and is searchable by both address and Eircode. I am satisfied that the combination of Eircode and Ordnance Survey Ireland mapping is sufficient for current NBP requirements. </p><p>The integration of the system referred to by the Deputy is an operational matter for the various commercial organisations and not one in which I as Minister have a role.</p></reply>

Today, almost 7 out of 10 of the 2.3 million premises in Ireland have access to high speed broadband. Since this Government came into office almost 400,000 additional premises have access to high speed broadband. This will increase to nearly 8 out of 10 premises by the end of this year and by 2020, 9 out of 10 premises will have access to a high speed broadband connection. This is being achieved via a combination of commercial investment and a State led intervention.The premise referred to by the Deputy is in an AMBER area on my Department&rsquo;s High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie. It is therefore included in the State Intervention Area under the National Broadband Plan (NBP).</p><p>My Department is in a formal procurement process to select a company who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network in the State intervention area. That procurement process is now in its final stages. </p><p>I recognise the importance of availability of high speed connectivity for all premises in Ireland and fully appreciate the frustration felt by people, such as those in the townland of Tonnagh, Co Monaghan and in the premise referred to by the Deputy, who do not currently have access to this vital level of connectivity.  Delivery of the State led Intervention under the NBP will ensure that the opportunities presented by the digital economy are available to every citizen, business and community in Ireland.</p><p>In the interim, there may be some connection options available to premises in the area referred to by the Deputy. According to my Department's technical team there appears to be at least 1 fixed wireless access provider providing coverage in the area. There is also a mast located approximately 2.2 kilometres from Tonnagh. This mast is utilised by all retail mobile operators. It has clear line of sight to Tonnagh and should be capable of providing a good quality signal level and download speeds to premises.  Individuals can check with mobile operators on capability of providing 4G LTE services. </p><p>Practical initiatives will continue to be addressed through the work of the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce to address obstacles and improve connectivity in respect of existing and future mobile phone and broadband services. </p><p>Under this Taskforce, engagement between telecommunications operators and local authorities through the Broadband Officers is continuing to strengthen.  These Broadband Officers are acting as single points of contact in local authorities for their communities.  The appointment of these officers is already reaping rewards in terms of ensuring a much greater degree of consistency in engagements with operators and clearing obstacles to developing infrastructure.  There is a link to a list of these local Broadband Officers on my Department's website which is available at <i></i></p></reply>

NORA continues to maximise the level of stocks held on the island of Ireland, subject to storage availability and value for money considerations, in accordance with the Government&rsquo;s Energy Policy Government&rsquo;s Energy Policy Paper, &ldquo;Ireland&rsquo;s Transition to a Low-carbon Energy Future, 2015-2030&rdquo;.   For electricity, Ireland has a resilient diverse portfolio for power generation including traditional generation plants, renewable generation and electricity interconnection to allow for the import and export of electricity.  Gas-fired generating stations are required to hold back-up secondary fuel supplies to cover 3-5 days in the event of a gas shortage. While technically electricity cannot be stored, two electricity generating plants in particular provide electricity security of supply &ndash;Turlough Hill and Moneypoint. </p>  <p>  Turlough Hill in Wicklow is Ireland&rsquo;s only pumped storage power station. It generates up to 292MW during peak demand periods and can go from standstill to full capacity in around 70 seconds by releasing water from the upper reservoir and allowing it to flow through four turbines into the lower reservoir. During periods of lower demand, water is pumped back to the upper reservoir, ready to be used again. This helps flatten the &lsquo;demand curve&rsquo; for electricity over any given 24-hour period and so is invaluable to the grid. </p>  <p>   Moneypoint provides coal storage capacity on its site in Co Clare.  The 900MW plant can hold three months of stocks, providing secure supply of electricity for this period. However, both the Government&rsquo;s Energy Policy Paper and the Programme for Government have committed to identifying a more sustainable replacement technology for Moneypoint before 2020. </p>  <p>  In relation to gas, Ireland&rsquo;s energy security has been greatly enhanced by the addition of Corrib gas. Before this, over 90% of our gas was imported via the two interconnectors with Scotland.  </p>  <p>  In 2006 Kinsale Energy&rsquo;s Southwest Kinsale Gas Field was converted to an offshore storage facility with a storage capacity of 230 million cubic meters. However, in 2016 Kinsale Energy took the decision to close the storage facility. The last of the storage gas was withdrawn from the reservoir in March 2017.</p>  <p>   A number of private sector commercial LNG projects have been proposed in Ireland recently. The location, development and final investment decisions for these projects are ultimately the responsibility of the project promoters.</p>  <p>In line with the Programme for Government and the Government&rsquo;s Energy Policy Paper, my Department is carrying out, in conjunction with the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, Gas Networks Ireland and EirGrid, a study on Ireland&rsquo;s resilience to a long term gas disruption, which includes the possible need for gas storage and LNG. This study will inform the formulation of future policy measures to maintain the resilience of Ireland&rsquo;s gas and electricity supply.</p></reply>

The measures proposed are linked to an analysis of current and projected levels of travel demand across the region.</p>  <p>  Dublin City Council and the NTA jointly published the Dublin City Centre Transport Study in 2015 which sets out the various measures proposed for Dublin's city centre to ensure the efficient functioning of transport within the city centre. In preparing the 2015 Study, Dublin City Council and the NTA reviewed the current and future transportation needs of the City Centre, taking into account the Luas Cross City Project, the need to make the city more attractive and safer for walking and cycling and the move towards a more sustainable and accessible city for all. Those two bodies, in collaboration with Dublin Bus and TII, are progressively implementing the measures set out in that document to enable the continued development and growth of the city.</p>  <p>  In light of the NTA's responsibility in this area, I have forwarded the Deputy's question to the NTA for further reply on the information sought and issues raised. Please advise my private office if you do not receive a response within ten working days.</p></reply>

Works on those roads are funded from the Council's own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is a matter for each Council.</p>  <p>  Before the financial crisis, local authorities could apply on a regular basis for grants for Specific Improvement Grants for the strengthening, widening or realignment of rural roads, including bridges, where the proposed scheme cost generally less than &euro;5 million. However, the extent of the cutbacks in grant funding during the crisis meant this grant scheme had to be curtailed after 2013 because expenditure on maintenance/renewal was falling well short of what was required to adequately maintain the regional and local road network. </p>  <p>  The Capital Plan does provide for the gradual build up in funding for the road network but it will take some years yet to reach the level required for the adequate maintenance and renewal of the network. For this reason there is limited scope at present for funding projects under the Specific Grant Programme.  </p>  <p>  Any projects proposed by local authorities for consideration under the Specific Grant Programme are assessed by the Department on a case-by-case basis.  All projects put forward by local authorities for consideration must comply with the requirements of the Public Spending Code and my Department's Capital Appraisal Framework and it is important for local authorities to prioritise projects within their overall area of responsibility with these requirements in mind.</p></reply>

Preliminary works for the new runway were completed in late 2017 while the procurement process for the main construction works is currently underway. The new runway is expected to be operational in 2021. Work on the IAA&rsquo;s new visual control tower commenced last September and construction is expected to be completed in March 2019 to be followed by installation of specialist equipment, systems, testing and commissioning in time to facilitate operations on the second parallel runway in 2021.</p><p>In terms of the more significant committed projects in Shannon, work is currently underway by Shannon Group on an advanced technology manufacturing unit and a new office block in the Shannon Free Zone which are scheduled for completion in April and July respectively this year. I am informed that other projects are at various stages of the project appraisal lifecycle:  appraisal, planning and implementation. These include, subject to cross agency support, the construction later this year of a new wide body aircraft hangar in Shannon Airport. </p><p>The NDP also provides for continued Exchequer support for the smaller regional airports under the Regional Airport Programme. This Programme is administered on an annual basis and the airports are invited to submit their applications for capital support towards safety and security related projects at the beginning of each year. This year&rsquo;s applications are currently being assessed by my Department and, as in previous years, an announcement of the capital grant allocations for these airports will be made in due course. </p><p><b>Ports </b></p><p>The NDP details the non-Exchequer led funding being invested in our three Ports of National Significance (Tier 1) which is summarised in the table &ndash; <table><tr><th>Project</th><th>Cost</th><th>Estimated Completion Date</th></tr><tr><td>Dublin Port Company<br /><br />Alexander Basin Redevelopment   Project</td><td>&euro;230m</td><td>2022 <br /><br />Status: Under construction</td></tr><tr><td>Port of Cork Company<br /><br />Ringaskiddy Redevelopment</td><td>&euro;90m</td><td>2020 <br /><br />Status: - Contractor   appointed</td></tr><tr><td>Shannon Foynes Port Company<br /><br />Capacity Extension Works</td><td>&euro;27m</td><td>2022   <br /><br />Status: Phase 2 at   preplanning stage&ndash; Expect to go to planning April 2018</td></tr></table></p><p><b>Public Transport</b></p><p>The NDP provides a total of &euro;8.6 billion for investment in public transport projects around Ireland over the next 10 years. These projects include Metro Link, priority elements of the DART Expansion Programme and BusConnects in the GDA and Cork and Galway. In addition, there will be continued investment in sustainable transport projects including traffic management and other smarter travel projects along with new urban and cycling routes in our cities to allow transport infrastructure to function more effectively and relieve congestion.</p><p>As the National Transport Authority (NTA) is responsible for the delivery of the various projects, I have forwarded the Deputy&rsquo;s question to the NTA for a more detailed reply.</p><p><b>Roads</b></p><p>The NDP details a range of inter-urban and national road projects to be progressed over its lifetime. As the planning, design and implementation of individual road projects is a matter for Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) under the Roads Acts 1993-2015 in conjunction with the local authorities concerned, I have referred the Deputy's Question to TII for for a more detailed reply.</p><p>The NDP details the regional and local roads to be progressed over the course of the NDP as part of an estimated &euro;4.5billon investment programme. All projects bar two are expected to be completed by end 2021, the exceptions being Athy Southern Distributor Road and Killaloe Bypass/R494 Upgrade, which are expected to be completed by end 2022. The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads in its area, is a statutory function of each road authority in accordance with the provisions of section 13 of the Roads Act, 1993. Works on such roads are a matter for the relevant local authority to be funded from its own resources supplemented by State road grants. Implementation of projects included in the NDP is the responsibility of the relevant local authority. </p><p>My Department will be liaising with local authorities in relation to possible future projects for development in the post 2021 period and the appraisal requirements in relation to such projects.<b></b></p><p><b>Sports</b></p><p>The Sports Capital Programme (SCP) is the Government&rsquo;s primary method of providing support to sports clubs and organisations for capital projects. The Capital Plan provides &euro;100m for the SCP in the period to 2021. The Plan also states that the programme will be further expanded over the period 2022 &ndash; 2027. </p><p>Following the conclusion of the Budget 2018 discussions, it was agreed that this Department would also establish a new &ldquo;Large Scale Sport Infrastructure Fund&rdquo; in 2018. The Fund will be for larger projects where the proposed Government contribution exceeds the amount available under the SCP. The NDP as published includes &euro;100m for the new fund with finance available from 2019. The Department will draft the terms and conditions of the new scheme over the coming months and an announcement to include how and when organisations can apply for the funding will be made at that stage. </p><p>As part of the development of the National Sports Campus, &euro;26 million has been allocated for Phase 2 of the National Indoor Arena which comprises covered pitches and ancillary facilities, for rugby, soccer and Gaelic games. Construction is underway and this project is due for completion in 2019. </p><p>Furthermore, &euro;16 million has been allocated for the construction of a National Velodrome and Badminton Centre. Planning permission is in place and construction is to commence in 2020. This project is due for completion by 2021.</p></reply>

The DART Expansion Programme comprises of the DART Underground Tunnel and a series of projects, including the City Centre Re-signalling project, interlinked with the Tunnel but which also have benefits in and of themselves as stand-alone projects.  This series of projects will create a full metropolitan area DART network for Dublin with all the lines linked and connected. This integrated network will provide a core, high-capacity transit system and will deliver a very substantial increase in peak-hour capacity on all lines from Drogheda, Maynooth, Celbridge/Hazelhatch and Greystones.  The route for the DART Underground Tunnel will be established and protected to allow for its future delivery.</p>  <p>  The NDP also proposes to take forward a Metro Link scheme to run from Swords, via Dublin Airport to Dublin&rsquo;s south city centre (operating in tunnel under the city centre) and onwards to Sandyford using the existing Luas Green Line to ensure that growth along this corridor can be accommodated. This will provide Dublin with a high capacity, high-frequency cross-city rail corridor serving critical destinations such as Swords, Dublin Airport, Dublin City University, Ballymun, the Mater Hospital and existing destinations along the Luas Green Line to Sandyford. Metro Link will provide faster reliable journey times to and from these key destinations while offering interchange with other rail, DART Expansion, light rail and bus services. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is also aware, the NTA's Transport Strategy for the Greater Dublin Area provides the overarching framework for the planning and delivery of transport infrastructure and services for Dublin over the next two decades including those investment priorities identified in the NDP. In light of the NTA&rsquo;s responsibility in this matter, I have forwarded the Deputy&rsquo;s question to the NTA for further update.</p>  <p>  Implementation of the eight Capital Plan regional and local road improvement projects mentioned by the Deputy is the responsibility of the relevant road authority with grant support from my Department.   </p>  <p>  As it will be some years before funding under the Capital Plan builds up to the level required to maintain the regional and local road network in a steady state condition, expenditure continues to be primarily directed towards maintenance and renewal work. This means that the Capital Plan upgrade projects have to be implemented on  a phased basis as budgets allow and as projects are advanced through the project development stages by the relevant road authorities.  </p>  <p>  Two of the projects have reached construction stage - the Sallins Bypass and the upgrade of the Nangor and Adamstown roads in the vicinity of Grange Castle business park. The main design and construction elements of the Naas Bypass widening Scheme, Osberstown Interchange and Sallins Bypass Schemes are being progressed under one construction contract.  Kildare County Council is the contracting authority and these three projects are expected to be completed on a phased basis over 2019/2020.  In the case of the Nangor and Adamstown road upgrade, South Dublin County Council is the contracting authority and it is anticipated that the project will be completed in 2019. </p>  <p>  The other projects will be progressed as the necessary development consents, land acquisition and procurement are advanced and as funding can be made available by my Department.  As regards grant expenditure to date for these projects, this information is included in the Regional and Local Roads Payment and Allocations Booklets which are available in the Oireachtas library.</p>  <p>  In relation to the national road projects mentioned by the Deputy, as Minister for Transport, Tourism &amp;amp; Sport, I have responsibility for overall policy and funding in relation to the national roads programme.  The planning, design and implementation of individual road projects  is a matter for Transport Infrastructure Ireland under the Roads Acts 1993-2015 in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.  Within its capital budget, the assessment and prioritisation of individual projects is a matter in the first instance for TII in accordance with Section 19 of the Roads Act.  I have, therefore referred the Deputy's Question to TII for direct reply.

The new Unit was formally approved on 30<sup>th</sup>June 2015. An extensive consultation process was followed in order to assuage concerns raised by existing members.

This investment followed the Government approved Business Case prepared by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann who conducted an economic cost-benefit analysis of the project. This analysis took into account the economic benefits of the project arising from the time savings, safety and environmental cost savings and that also considered the challenge to capture travel demand from the private car onto the railway in the context of improvements planned to the road network and competition from the bus sector which would benefit from these improvements (that have now been delivered).</p>  <p>  The cost benefit analysis prepared by Irish Rail and submitted to Government indicated a negative Net Present Value (NPV) of minus &euro;137 million over 30 years and with a CBA ratio of 1:0.056, the value of the benefits was estimated to just 6% (or, roughly, one-twentieth) of the value of the costs. Subvention was estimated at &euro;24 per passenger per journey in year 1 (based on approximately 100,000 new rail passengers in year 1) and falling to half of this (on the basis that patronage was projected to double over the first five years of operation). </p>  <p>  In light of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann's responsibility in the issues raised by the Deputy, I am referring his question to I&Eacute; for further information.  Please advise my private office if the Deputy does not receive a response within ten working days.</p>  <p>  I would like to advise the Deputy that officials in my department are considering how best to progress the published NDP commitment in relation to an independent costing of Phase 2 of the Western Rail Corridor.</p></reply>

However, parents will have the discretion to decide how much of ECCE to avail of for their child. A decision may be made to utilise one year only of the programme for various reasons, for example, depending on the child's date of birth, parents may wish to send their child to school at 4 rather than 5 years of age. The upper age ECCE requirement is that the child must not reach 5 years and 6 months before the end of the programme year. </p>  <p>  A consultation process is about to commence with the parents of children with disabilities, and other stakeholders, regarding the age limits for ECCE. This consultation may result in changes to the scheme for all children. The process is due to conclude in June and the Minister will announce decisions re the scheme as soon as possible thereafter.</p>  <p>  This extension to ECCE from September 2018 refines the development introduced last year, whereby three intake dates were adopted, and will increase the duration of each registered child on ECCE from a current average of 61 weeks, to an entitlement to 76 weeks (two programme years). This enhancement delivers fully on a commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government that is good for children, families and Early Years providers.</p>  <p>  This new measure will address the situation where there was a wide range in the number of preschool weeks a child could avail of &ndash; between 61 and 88 weeks &ndash; and will ensure a programme that is equitable for all children.</p>  <p>  The number of entry points will revert to one at the beginning of the new programme year (September, 2018). One enrolment period at the start of the pre-school year will help streamline the administration process and will make it easier for childcare providers to operate and budget for the programme year. This will also make it simpler for parents to secure places on the ECCE programme for their children.</p></reply>

This will provide an opportunity to identify need and to focus the bulk of the &euro;58.9m funding available in 2018 on young people most in need of intervention.  Last year, I approved funding for the establishment of new youth projects and for the augmentation of a small number of existing youth services to meet new challenges arising from population increases. </p>  <p>  Each of the sixteen Education and Training Boards, including Cork ETB, was invited to nominate locations within their catchment areas for the establishment of new services and to nominate a project or service to be considered for augmentation. In total twenty-eight applications for new services were received.  Subsequently  I approved the establishment of nine new targeted youth services across the country and the expansion of a further seven to respond to new demand from increased population and needs of young people which included a new service in Mitchelstown and an augmented service in Middleton.</p>  <p>  Future development and investment in youth services will be informed by the mapping exercise completed last year which mapped youth service provision across the State. This mapping will assist the Department and the relevant ETB in developing a detailed social demographic profile in terms of both population numbers and deprivation levels.  My Department is committed to working with Cork ETB to identify need and explore ways to address this need where it emerges.</p></reply>

As all three counties were integral to the inspection it is not possible to discuss the finding relating to County Kilkenny separately. I can assure the Deputy that Tusla&rsquo;s action plan to respond to the findings of the inspection report was published at the same time,  and that this plan  has been accepted by HIQA. Tusla is tracking, monitoring and reviewing the action plan and  I understand that the first report of the quality assurance group shows good evidence of progress to date. </p>  <p>  The inspection report from HIQA on Tusla&rsquo;s child welfare and protection services in the Carlow, Kilkenny and South Tipperary area looked at the handling of referrals made to these services.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the report highlights  serious  deficits in how our child welfare and  protection system operates in the Carlow, Kilkenny and South Tipperary area. Nevertheless  I  welcome HIQA&rsquo;s inspection report as it identifies where we need to improve and, in Tusla's response, how we are to do so.</p>  <p>   The  report noted that the key problems were associated with areas which had staff vacancies, agency graduate social workers and large caseloads. Recruitment of social workers is being actively pursued but it is a highly competitive labour market.  This has resulted in a significant number of social worker recruitment but turnover of staff has meant that there was a very small net increase in the total number of social workers.</p>  <p>  Since its establishment Tusla has worked with the HSE on recruitment campaigns where it is mutually beneficial to both parties,  and this will continue. At the same time, Tusla has also established its own recruitment function, Tusla Recruit, to work on bespoke campaigns and to shorten recruitment timelines where possible.  Tusla Recruit has taken a very proactive approach with its graduate recruitment campaign in recent years and plans for its 2018 campaign, such as early engagement with students and visits to campuses in Ireland and abroad are already well advanced.</p>  <p>  Tusla has also made a public commitment to putting in place measures to improve compliance with national standards in the area of child protection and welfare, and steps have already been taken to improve the systems used in the service.  In particular, the new national practice methodology called &ldquo;Signs of Safety&rdquo; is being introduced to improve the depth and quality of the screening and assessments of referrals. </p>  <p>  The National Child Care Information System will be replacing the legacy ICT system and will be rolled out in the Carlow, Kilkenny and South Tipperary area before the end of March 2018.</p>  <p>  Relationships with the Garda&iacute; are being strengthened as a notification tracking system is in place and the Joint Working Protocol between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Tusla is being implemented.</p></reply>

It ensures that children transition into primary school with their peers and limits the age range of children beginning primary school. Limiting the diversity in age ranges in children beginning primary school education is considered generally to be in the best interest of children, in relation to peer interaction in junior infants, as well as other educational considerations. </p>  <p>  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs does its best to ensure, in so far as possible, the equitable treatment of all children and families who apply for childcare funding under the ECCE Programme.  In order to ensure objectivity and fairness it is essential that clear rules exist for the scheme and that they are applied in a fair manner. An essential component of the ECCE scheme&rsquo;s rules is an eligibility date to ensure that the scheme can be administered and budgeted for in an appropriate manner.</p></reply>

All urgent and emergency cases receive immediate attention by the local duty social work team. The majority of  unallocated cases are new referrals, however they may also  include children living with their families who had an allocated social worker, or to a child in care, where there is now a social work vacancy.</p><p>I am informed by Tusla that a case awaiting allocation may be listed as 'active on duty'. Tusla indicate that this may includes checking with professionals who see the child regularly, or visiting the child and family at home, getting additional information about the child's situation and, in some instances where a child is in care, organising a Care Plan Review and visiting the child. </p><p>I, and my officials, will continue to engage directly with the Tusla Board and Senior Management Team to monitor and  review progress in reducing the number of unallocated cases and the waiting time for the allocation of a social worker to a case assessed as requiring a social work service. </p><p>Cases awaiting allocation by area and priority level<table><tr><th>Area</th><th>High Priority</th><th>Medium Priority</th><th>Low Priority</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>DSE/WW</td><td>9</td><td>96</td><td>10</td><td>115</td></tr><tr><td>DSW/K/WW</td><td>198</td><td>412</td><td>44</td><td>654</td></tr><tr><td>DSC</td><td>0</td><td>163</td><td>139</td><td>302</td></tr><tr><td>Midlands</td><td>43</td><td>177</td><td>63</td><td>283</td></tr><tr><td>DNC</td><td>0</td><td>233</td><td>125</td><td>358</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin North</td><td>0</td><td>213</td><td>242</td><td>455</td></tr><tr><td>LH/MH</td><td>19</td><td>187</td><td>58</td><td>264</td></tr><tr><td>CN/MN</td><td>16</td><td>136</td><td>60</td><td>212</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>66</td><td>20</td><td>7</td><td>93</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>162</td><td>367</td><td>64</td><td>593</td></tr><tr><td>CW/LL/ST</td><td>7</td><td>286</td><td>61</td><td>354</td></tr><tr><td>WD/WX</td><td>68</td><td>124</td><td>26</td><td>218</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>81</td><td>297</td><td>98</td><td>476</td></tr><tr><td>SLWC</td><td>6</td><td>40</td><td>10</td><td>56</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>GY/RN</td><td>74</td><td>86</td><td>20</td><td>180</td></tr><tr><td>Mid-West</td><td>69</td><td>88</td><td>122</td><td>279</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>818</td><td>2,925</td><td>1,149</td><td>4,892</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The schemes support the provision of youth services for young people who are at risk of drugs, alcohol misuse, early school leaving, homelessness or who are living in disadvantaged communities.  The review involved an in-depth scrutiny of a complex area to do with the impact youth service provision has in young people&rsquo;s lives.  Overall, the review found that the youth programmes can provide a significant contribution to improving outcomes for young people and should be considered for on-going public funding. The review makes a number of recommendations for the future operation of the youth schemes and their development in the years ahead to ensure an evidence-based and outcomes focussed programme designed to secure the optimal outcomes for young people. </p>  <p>  The National Youth Strategy Lead Team has a specific sub-group to support implementation of the VFMPR recommendations. The single targeted youth funding programme is currently under development within my Department and is being informed by a number of ongoing activities. In 2017 my Department consulted with almost 600 stakeholders including young people, workers, managers/ boards of management, ETBs and other departments and agencies funding services for young people at risk.  This was carried out at 16 different events across the country.  My Department also held specialist consultations with 13 different target groups of difficult to reach young people. In addition, a measurement advisory group has been established and the group is undertaking a number of research activities to inform a measurement system for the single scheme. An area profiling tool is also under development. </p>  <p>  To facilitate the review&rsquo;s recommendations regarding the future development of a single targeted youth funding programme to replace the current schemes, I have approved funding allocations for the establishment of several sample projects in 2016 and 2017. These projects provide youth services in areas of need as identified by the Education and Training Boards with responsibility for those regions while also operating as pilot programmes for new scheme development. Funding was allocated for the establishment of 5 new sample projects in 2016 and 10 in 2017. Funding has also been allocated to augment 7 existing projects in 2017. The initial five 2016 projects are now operational with those approved during 2017 in various stages of formation. The sample projects are located across the country and fall within 11 ETB areas.</p>  <p>  In implementing another of the review&rsquo;s recommendations, my Department embarked on an exercise, in conjunction with Pobal and each Education and Training Board Youth Officer, to map youth service provision across the State. Data was collated in relation to project boundaries, locations of the project buildings and up-to-date contact details of youth services. Pobal, in association with Compass, compiled this data into an online map of youth services in Ireland. The map was publically released in October 2017 and is available on Pobal's website. This map was used in the 2017 sample process by my Department and the relevant Education and Training Boards as an indicator of population demographics and deprivation levels which could inform decisions in relation to funding allocations for specific areas.</p></reply>

The areas originally selected for inclusion in the programme were those which suffered the greatest population decline from 1926 to 1996, with the exception of the Cooley Peninsula which was included on the basis of the serious difficulties caused in that area by Foot and Mouth disease.  The average population loss in the original CL&Aacute;R regions over the period 1926 to 1996 was 50%.</p>  <p>  In 2006, an analysis of the 2002 Census data was carried out by the National Institute for Regional and Spatial Analysis (NIRSA) at Maynooth University and the programme was extended to include areas with an average population loss of 35% between 1926 and 2002.  Kildare was not identified as a county that had suffered an average 35% decline in its population in that period and, as a result, no areas within that county were designated as CL&Aacute;R areas.  The areas included in the 2016 and 2017 CL&Aacute;R programmes were based on the work carried out by NIRSA. </p>  <p>  I intend to launch a new call for proposals under the CL&Aacute;R programme shortly, using the same designation criteria which applied in 2016 and 2017.  I also intend to carry out a full review of CL&Aacute;R areas later this year on the basis of the 2016 Census of Population data.  The level of depopulation will continue to be a primary factor in the designation of any area as a CL&Aacute;R area.  The review will involve a detailed examination of all areas of the country, as well as stakeholder consultation.  I plan to begin the review process in the coming months with the aim of having a full and comprehensive review completed before the end of the year. </p>  <p>  The findings of the review will inform future launches of the scheme, post-2018.</p></reply>

The purpose of this payment is to assist these households with their energy costs.  The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household.  It is not intended to meet those costs in full.  Only one allowance is paid per household. The total number of recipients of fuel in Co Tipperary is 16,591.</p>  <p>  Fuel allowance applications are not processed at a central location as a stand-alone scheme.  Instead they are dealt with by the individual scheme areas &ndash; usually as part of a customer&rsquo;s application for that scheme.  Therefore, the application for Fuel Allowance is tied up with the application for the particular scheme, and it is that rather than the Fuel Allowance application that can determine time to decision.  Such times can vary considerably depending on the complexity and information requirements of the particular scheme and customer circumstances.  Accordingly, the information sought by the Deputy regarding specific waiting times from application to decision on fuel applications is not available.</p></reply>

It sets out under Strand 4, &lsquo;Measures to Support the Operation of Defined Benefit Schemes&rsquo;, that the Government is committed to advancing the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Bill 2017 to respond to the ongoing difficulties in DB schemes and to increase protections for members as well encouraging employers to ensure that schemes are well funded and managed.   </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the General Scheme of the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2017 (now the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Bill 2017), was published in May 2017 and contained a number of key measures relating to DB pension schemes.  These proposed provisions will ensure that an employer cannot &ldquo;walk away&rdquo; at short notice from the pension scheme it is supporting.  They seek a middle road between the current position where employers can abandon DB schemes and full and immediate debt on employer provisions.  The measures will act to support existing provisions in the Pensions Act and will provide for further protection for scheme members&rsquo; benefits and enhance employer responsibilities for their schemes.  </p>  <p>  These provisions are quite technical and complex.  Work to finalise them is at an advanced stage and I hope to be in position to bring forward the amendments at Committee Stage in the near future. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

These include road, rail and ferry services provided by companies such as Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, as well as Luas and services provided by over 80 private transport operators.  There are currently approx. 904,000 customers with direct eligibility with an annual allocation of &euro;90 million.  </p>  <p>  The scheme is available to all people aged over 66 living permanently in the State.  To qualify for the scheme, applicants who are under age 66 must be in receipt of a qualifying payment.  These are invalidity pension, blind pension, disability allowance, carer&rsquo;s allowance or an equivalent social security payment from a country covered by EC Regulations or one with which Ireland has a Bilateral Social Security Agreement.  </p>  <p>  There are no plans at this time to allow people in receipt of carers allowance to receive a companion free travel pass. Any such expansion would have significant budgetary implications, particularly if it was a general, rather than a targeted provision.</p>  <p>  Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme (SWA) the Department of Social Protection may award a travel supplement in any case where the circumstances of the case so warrant.  The supplement is intended to assist with ongoing or recurring travel costs that cannot be met from the client&rsquo;s own resources and are deemed to be necessary.  Every decision is based on consideration of the circumstances of the case, taking account of the nature and extent of the need and of the resources of the person concerned. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This provides them with access to the following benefits: State pension (contributory) and widow&rsquo;s, widower&rsquo;s or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s pension (contributory), guardian&rsquo;s payment (contributory), maternity benefit, adoptive benefit, paternity benefit, treatment benefit (from March 2017) and invalidity pension, which was extended to the self-employed from December 2017.</p>  <p>  This compares favourably with employees who, in general, are liable to the Class A rate of 4%.  In addition their employers are liable to PRSI at the rate of 8.6% on weekly earnings up to and including &euro;376 or at the rate of 10.85% where weekly earnings exceed &euro;376.  Accordingly the combined rate of PRSI rate paid in respect of Class A employees is 12.6% or 14.85%, depending on the level of weekly earnings. These Class A employees are entitled to the full range of social insurance benefits.   </p>  <p>The issue of extending additional social insurance benefits to the self-employed paying Class S PRSI was considered in the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance fund (SIF) as at 31 December, 2015, which was published on the 18th   October 2017.  The review, required by legislation, was carried out by independent consultants, KPMG.  It examines the projected income and expenditure of the SIF over the course of the 55 year period from 2016 to 2071.</p>  <p>  The review found that the fund currently has a modest surplus of income over expenditure. In 2016 there was a surplus of &euro;0.4 billion on expenditure of &euro;8.8 billion and receipts of &euro;9.2 billion.  However, this will reduce over the next two years and will return to a small shortfall in 2020.  The annual shortfalls are projected to increase from 2021 onwards as the ageing of the population impacts.  Projections indicate that, in the absence of further action to tackle the shortfall, the excess of expenditure over income of the fund will increase significantly over the medium to long term.  The shortfall in expenditure over income is projected to increase from &euro;0.2 billion in 2020 to &euro;3.3 billion by 2030 and to &euro;22.2 billion by 2071.  It should be noted that as self-employed workers are now eligible to apply for invalidity pension since December 2017, the cost of this introduction has been factored into the actuarial review.</p>  <p>  As part of the review the independent consultants were required to project the additional PRSI expenditure if invalidity pension and illness, jobseeker&rsquo;s and carer&rsquo;s benefits were extended to Class S self-employed workers and the PRSI contribution rates required to provide these benefits on a revenue neutral basis.</p>  <p>  The review found that the combined cost of introducing the invalidity, illness, jobseeker&rsquo;s and carer&rsquo;s benefits for Class S contributions is estimated to be &euro;118 million in 2018, rising steadily to &euro;223 million in 2020.  By 2025 the projected cost is &euro;413 million and, over the period of the review the cost would rise to &euro;1.3 billion in 2071.  These costs assume that the cost of extending invalidity pension to the self-employed builds up steeply for the first 10 years after introduction after which time the scheme is almost at maturity or a steady state. </p>  <p>  For the shorter term schemes, illness and jobseeker&rsquo;s benefits, it is estimated that they will reach maturity after 2 years.  Projected expenditure on jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit assume the same incidence rate as prevail in the employed (PRSI Class A) population. </p>  <p>  The review indicates that, where these benefits are extended to the self-employed, the Class S rate of PRSI contribution would need to increase substantially in order to ensure that the benefits are delivered in a revenue neutral manner.  It estimates that when expenditure on the additional benefits is considered over the entire projection period, PRSI rates would need to increase by 94% under a scenario of no subvention from the exchequer.  This is equivalent to an increase of the Class S contribution rate from the current 4% rate to 7.8%.</p>  <p>  This increased contribution is attributable to the costs of extending these additional benefits to PRSI Class S contributors.  It does not take account of the value to PRSI Class S contributors of access to the range of existing benefits, and in particular state pension contributory.  </p>  <p>  The consultants estimated that the typical cost of state pension (contributory) on its own is of the order of 10% to 15%, depending on other factors including rate of average earnings and date of commencing paying PRSI.  Adding in the other benefits referenced the total Class S rate of contribution to ensure revenue neutrality would be of the order of 20% per annum.</p>  <p>  The projections provided in the 2015 actuarial review are based on the system of social insurance, currently in legislation.  </p>  <p>  Extending any benefits would have financial implications for the cost of paying social insurance benefits. Such an extension would have to be considered in a Budgetary context of additional costs and how such costs could be met.  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for you.</p></reply>

The carer may work or engage in training for a maximum of 15 hours per week and still be regarded as providing full-time care and attention.</p>  <p>  Only one carer's allowance is payable in respect of any one caring situation, however two carers who are sharing care in an established pattern can be accommodated on the carer's allowance scheme. All the usual qualifying conditions for carer's allowance apply to carers availing of these arrangements.  Each carer may share the carer's allowance income support payment and the annual carer&rsquo;s support grant. A carer providing full time care on a part time basis is required under legislation to provide care for a complete week i.e. Monday to Sunday. </p>  <p>  Other financial assistance may be available to the family.  Domiciliary Care Allowance (DCA) is a monthly payment for a child aged under 16 with a severe disability, who requires ongoing care and attention, substantially over and above the care and attention usually required by a child of the same age.  It is not means tested.  The family may also claim a non means tested Carer's Support Grant, which is paid each year during the month of June.</p>  <p>  I have no plans to change the current care sharing arrangements which would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</p>  <p>  I hope that this clarifies the position for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Where applicable, these may be used towards PRSI-based social protection payments, including the State pension contributory.</p>  <p>  A policy to introduce the Total Contributions Approach (TCA) to pensions calculation was adopted by Government in the National Pensions Framework in 2010, as was the decision to base the entitlements of all new pensioners on this approach from around 2020.</p>  <p>On the 23rd   January, the Government agreed to a proposal that will allow pensioners affected by the 2012 changes in rate bands to have their pension entitlement calculated by a new interim &ldquo;Total Contributions Approach&rdquo; (TCA) which will include up to 20 years of a new HomeCaring credit.  </p>  <p>  This approach is expected to significantly benefit many people, particularly women, whose work history includes an extended period of time outside the paid workplace, while raising families or in a caring role.  It will make it easier for pensioners assessed under the current yearly average model, to qualify for a higher rate of the State Pension (contributory).  The TCA will ensure that the totality of a person&rsquo;s social insurance contributions - as opposed to the timing of them - determines their final pension outcome.  Under this new arrangement, a person who reached pension age after 1st September 2012 and has a 40 year record of paid and credited social insurance contributions, subject to a maximum of 20 years of the new HomeCaring credits, will qualify for a maximum contributory pension where they satisfy the other qualifying conditions for the scheme.  Up to 10 years of other credits, for example when unemployed or ill, may also be used, subject to the total number of credits not exceeding 20 years.  So, for example, a person might receive a maximum pension based on 20 years paid PRSI contributions, 5 years jobseeker credits, and 15 years HomeCaring Credits, over a 50 year period. Invalidity pensioners and Widows will continue to generally qualify for a full pension. </p>  <p>  For those who do not qualify for the State Pension (contributory) (SPC), there are other state pension payments available.  Notably, they may qualify for the State Pension (non-contributory) which is a means-tested payment (based on their share of household means) with a maximum payment of 95% of the SPC.  If their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an increase for a qualified adult (based on their own means), amounting up to 90% of a full rate SPC pension.  </p>  <p>  The TCA model for post-2020 pensioners has yet to be decided upon, as the design will not be finalised until after a public consultation later this year.  There are a number of factors, not just the number of years required for a full pension, which influence outcomes, and I will consider very carefully the priorities identified by stakeholders in that consultation process. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputies.</p></reply>

WFP is designed to prevent in-work poverty for low paid workers with child dependants and to offer a financial incentive to take-up employment.</p><p>There are currently almost 57,700 families with more than 129,000 children in receipt of the WFP.  The estimated spend on WFP this year is approximately &euro;431 million.</p><p>The legislative basis for the scheme provides that to qualify for WFP a person must: </p><p>a) be engaged in remunerative full-time employment as an employee which is expected to last for at least 3 months;</p><p>b) be working for a minimum of 38 hours per fortnight or 19 hours per week; and </p><p>c) have a qualified child/children who normally resides with them or is supported by them. </p><p>A couple may combine their hours of employment to meet the qualification criteria.  Furthermore, the average family income must be below a specified amount, which varies according to the number of qualified children in the family.</p><p>Elected members of local authorities (better known as &lsquo;councillors&rsquo;) are office holders.  They are not local authority employees and therefore do not qualify for WFP on foot of their role as county councillors.  However, a councillor who is otherwise engaged in remunerative full-time employment may qualify for WFP, subject to meeting the criteria outlined above.  It is also possible for the household of a County Councillor to receive a WFP payment where the spouse, civil partner or cohabitant of the County Councillor meets the qualifying criteria.I have no plans to extend the WFP to the role of officeholders, as distinct from employees.</p><p>The status of county councillors and the question of their remuneration is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Community, Planning and Local Government.

This is equivalent to a yearly average of 14, which would entitle them to a reduced state pension (contributory).  There is a gap in the person&rsquo;s social insurance record for the tax years 1966/67 to 1967/68 and from 1969/70 to 2002 inclusive. This affects their overall yearly average and, consequently, their rate of weekly pension entitlement. </p>  <p>  The person concerned is currently in receipt of state pension (non -contributory) at a higher rate.  It is therefore more financially beneficial for them to remain on their current payment. The person concerned was advised accordingly on 5 March 2018. A copy of their social insurance record upon which their state pension (contributory) was calculated was included with that decision letter. If the person concerned considers they have additional contributions or credits that have not been recorded, it is open to them to forward documentary evidence to my Department and their pension entitlement will be reviewed. </p>  <p>  Under European Union regulations the insurance records of other member states can be combined to give entitlement to a proportional or pro-rata pension.  As the person concerned   was also employed in the UK, their Irish and UK contributions can be combined to establish entitlement to a pro-rata pension. The person&rsquo;s UK record was requested on 29 January 2018. Once this has been received by my Department, their entitlement to a state pension (contributory) EU pro rata will be determined, and the person will be notified of the outcome without delay.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Government recently announced proposals that pensioners who qualified for state pension (contributory) since September 2012, and whose rate of entitlement was impacted by the 2012 rate band changes, may apply for a review to have their entitlement considered under a new Total Contribution Approach (TCA).  It will take some time to draft and pass the necessary legislation, and then develop the systems and procedures necessary to administer the new pension entitlement option.  Accordingly, it is not necessary for any person to contact the Department about their situation.  Instead, the Department expects to start issuing invitations to these pensioners from late 2018 to apply for a review under the new pension eligibility arrangements, and to notify any periods spent caring for which HomeCaring credits may be due.  Review applicants will be notified of the outcome of their review and any applicable higher rate of entitlement will be paid to them.  Such payments are expected to commence from early 2019.  Where an increase is awarded, it will be backdated to 30 March 2018.  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The TCA model being made available to them will award a maximum rate pension for those with 40 years contributions (including up to 20 years HomeCaring credits), and pro-rata payments for those with fewer contributions.  Up to 10 years ordinary credits (e.g. for Jobseekers or Illness Benefit) may also be used, subject to the total number of HomeCaring and ordinary credits not exceeding 20 years.</p>  <p>  Where a person has been in self-employment from the introduction of compulsory Class S contributions from 1988 until reaching State pension age, they may already receive a maximum rate State pension contributory, subject to meeting the general conditions for payment.  If not, they may still benefit from the new TCA arrangements, depending on their circumstances.  </p>  <p>  The main focus of this reform has been to reward those who either made contributions into the Social Insurance Fund, or to recognise the contribution of those who took time out of the workforce to raise children.  If someone made very little of either such contributions, and if their means are such that they would not qualify for a 95% state pension non-contributory (e.g. if they have substantial private or occupational pensions), they may benefit more from existing arrangements.</p>  <p>  For those who do not qualify for the State Pension (contributory) (SPC), there are other state pension payments available.  Notably, they may qualify for the State Pension (non-contributory) which is a means-tested payment (based on their share of household means) with a maximum payment of 95% of the SPC.  If their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an increase for a qualified adult (based on their own means), amounting up to 90% of a full rate SPC pension.  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The service was launched in 2015 on a &lsquo;rolling basis&rsquo; with referral numbers gradually increasing over time.  </p>  <p>  JobPath providers do not apply or recommend the application of a penalty rate of payment.  They simply advise the Department if a jobseeker is failing to attend activation meetings without good cause.  The application of penalty rates is entirely a matter for my Department and officials involved will take all relevant factors into account.</p>  <p>  In the interests of natural justice, a jobseeker who fails to participate in the activation process, whether that is provided directly by the Intreo Service or via a contracted service provider, is given both written and verbal warnings and an opportunity to comply before a reduced rate of payment is applied.  Furthermore, Jobseekers can, through co-operation with the activation service of my Department, benefit from early re-instatement of the full rate of Jobseeker&rsquo;s payment.</p>  <p>  The legislation underpinning the application of reduced rates of payment is provided for in the Social Welfare Act 2010.   All decisions on the application of reduced rates of payment are made by Deciding Officers and are based on all the available evidence and the circumstances of each case.  The Jobseeker can appeal the Deciding Officer&rsquo;s decision through the Social Welfare Appeals Office (SWAO).</p>  <p>  Reduced rates are only applied where a job seeker fails to engage as requested, and following at least two warnings, with the Department&rsquo;s employment services. </p>  <p>  Between July 2015 and December 2017, circa 141,000 jobseekers had commenced their engagement period with the service. </p>  <p>  Up to the end of December 2017, approximately 6,500 jobseekers had a penalty rate applied to their payment at some point during their engagement period with the JobPath service. The estimated breakdown per year is 63 in 2015, 1,215 in 2016 and 5,222 in 2017.</p>  <p>  To be clear, the application of penalty rates is entirely a matter for my department and officials involved will take into account all relevant factors including where appropriate non-engagement with externally provided activation services.  In this regard, while I am happy to advise the Deputy on penalty rates applied to those who have engaged with the JobPath service, the factors to be considered in applying a penalty rate precludes me from making a definitive statement that the sole context involved would have been non engagement with JobPath.</p></reply>

The service was launched in 2015 on a &lsquo;rolling basis&rsquo; with referral numbers gradually increasing over time.  </p>  <p>  There are two phases to the service.  During the first phase, of 12 months duration, a personal advisor (PA) provides practical assistance in searching, preparing for, securing and sustaining employment.  The second phase starts if the jobseeker is successful in finding work.  During this phase the PA continues to work with the jobseeker for a further period of at least three months, and up to 12 months.  In addition to the two phases jobseekers may also undertake training while with the service and this may extend the period the jobseeker is supported through the service for up to a further 6 months. The duration of the client journey therefore necessitates the requirement of a cohort based approach to reporting and the updating of individual cohort outcome data over time. </p>  <p>  My Department recently published an updated cohort based report on the performance of the service, in January 2018 (the report is available on the Departments website: www.welfare.ie)  The report details employment outcomes on a quarterly cohort basis, i.e. customers referred in Quarter 3 and 4 in 2015 and those referred in Quarter 1 and 2 in 2016.</p>  <p>  Of the 39,603 jobseekers referred to the service during this period,) 58% were over three years unemployed and a further 17% were over two years unemployed.  These groups face significant barriers when seeking to enter or return to employment in the open labour market.  The total employment outcome across all four cohorts at the time of publishing was 25%: 18% of Jobseekers who engaged with the service during this period obtained full-time employment, in addition a further 4% of clients entered part-time employment and a further 3% became self-employed.  It is important to note, that the latter two cohorts (Q1 and Q2 2016), represent 80% of the 39,603 jobseekers referred between July 2015 and June 2016, and that employment outcomes are expected to improve over time as more  jobseekers from these cohorts complete their full engagement period with the service.</p>  <p>  An initial analysis of the areas in which participants found employment suggests that some of the more popular sectors includes the construction, manufacturing, sales, clerical / administrative, food service, and customer service sectors.  While the results are very positive, these initial reports are subject to review and are based on a relatively small sample size.  With this in mind, the department is undertaking an econometric review of this strand of its activation services.  Completion of the review is provisionally scheduled for the end of Q3 2018, following which more detailed and robust statistics will be available.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

It provides part-time temporary work in local communities, as a stepping-stone back to employment. However, it is important to note that these placements are not full-time sustainable jobs and are designed to break the cycle of unemployment and maintain work readiness, thereby improving a person&rsquo;s opportunities of returning to the labour market or getting a job for the first time. The scheme commenced operation in 2011 as a response to the high level of unemployment and the large numbers on the Live Register at that time.  There are 47 Local Development Companies (LDCs), as well as &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, involved in the delivery of the T&uacute;s programme - known as Implementing bodies (IBs).   </p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that the reduction in the unemployment rate is a factor in recruitment to all programmes. Long-term unemployment is expected to fall further this year in line with the continuing forecasted fall in overall unemployment. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that given the welcome improvements in the labour market in recent years with reducing numbers of long-term unemployed on the Live Register, which is the target cohort for T&uacute;s, it is proving difficult to fill the number of places available nationwide.  However, changes were introduced recently to the selection criteria for T&uacute;s which should broaden the availability of T&uacute;s to a greater number of people on the live register. This includes an increase in the percentage of assisted referrals from 20% to 30%, as well as permitting someone who has had a break of up to 30 days on the Live Register in the past 12 months to be considered eligible for T&uacute;s selection. </p>  <p>  In the five years since the end of December 2012, there has been a 48% fall in the numbers on the Live Register who are more than 1 year unemployed.   In this context the Department is currently engaging with the Irish Local Development Network &ndash; the representative body for the IBs.</p>  <p>  The Department keeps all aspects of its activation programmes under review to ensure the best outcomes for participants and communities.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

It only includes the appeal processing times for schemes paid on a weekly basis. </p><p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions in relation to social welfare entitlements.  </p><p>All claim decisions taken by the Department&rsquo;s deciding officers are appealable to the Chief Appeals Officer.  In any year about 85% of all claims are awarded and just 1% are appealed.  Nevertheless, the Department is concerned that these cases are dealt with as quickly as possible.</p><p>Accordingly, significant efforts and resources have been devoted to reforming the appeal process in recent years.  As a result, appeal processing times in respect of all schemes improved between 2011 and 2017 from 52.5 weeks for an oral hearing in 2011 to 26.4 weeks in 2017 and from 25.1 weeks for a summary decision in 2011 to 19.8 weeks in 2017.  </p><p>The time taken to process an appeal reflects a number of factors including that the appeals process is a quasi-judicial process with appeals officers being required to decide all appeals on a &lsquo;de-novo&rsquo; basis.  In addition, appeals decisions are themselves subject to review by the higher courts and decisions have to be formally written up to quasi-judicial standards.  </p><p>Other factors that influence appeals processing times include the quality of the initial decision &ndash; in this respect the Department has changed the decisions process in respect of medical schemes, in order to provide more information to the claimant.  I expect that this will help to reduce the number of appeals over time.</p><p>In addition, a number of new appeals officers have joined the Appeals Office over the past year, to replace staff leaving on retirement.  Given the complexity of the appeals process it takes some time for new staff to be trained up and develop expertise.  This changeover in staff led to longer times to conclude appeals in 2017 and this has continued in the first two months of 2018.  However, the Chief Appeals Officer has advised that she is hopeful that processing times will improve over the course of 2018.</p><p>Finally, it should be noted that an appellant can claim supplementary welfare allowance pending the outcome of their appeal and that any favourable decisions are backdated to the original date of the claim. </p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p><p><b>Appeal Processing Times by Scheme 01 January 2018 - 28 February 2018</b><table><tr><th><div>-</div></th><th><div>Average processing times (weeks)<br /><br />Summary Decisions</div></th><th><div>Average processing <br /><br />times (weeks)<br /><br />Oral Hearings</div></th></tr><tr><td>Carers Allowance</td><td><div>23.8</div></td><td><div>27.8</div></td></tr><tr><td>Carers Benefit</td><td><div>22.4</div></td><td><div>30.8</div></td></tr><tr><td>Disability Allowance</td><td><div>20.4</div></td><td><div>25.5</div></td></tr><tr><td>Illness Benefit</td><td><div>30.5</div></td><td><div>43.3</div></td></tr><tr><td>Partial Capacity Benefit</td><td><div>26.3</div></td><td><div>22.2</div></td></tr><tr><td>Farm Assist</td><td><div>26.8</div></td><td><div>53.1</div></td></tr><tr><td>Working Family Payment</td><td><div>28.7</div></td><td><div>28.4</div></td></tr><tr><td>Invalidity Pension</td><td><div>26.5</div></td><td><div>24.6</div></td></tr><tr><td>Maternity Benefit</td><td><div>20.7</div></td><td><div>51.3</div></td></tr><tr><td>Paternity Benefit</td><td><div>29.8</div></td><td><div>-</div></td></tr><tr><td>One Parent Family Payment</td><td><div>30.5</div></td><td><div>34.9</div></td></tr><tr><td>State Pension (Contributory)</td><td><div>38.9</div></td><td><div>50.7</div></td></tr><tr><td>State Pension (Non-Contributory)</td><td><div>31.9</div></td><td><div>45.2</div></td></tr><tr><td>Occupational Injury Benefit</td><td><div>39.4</div></td><td><div>44.0</div></td></tr><tr><td>Guardian's Payment (Con)</td><td><div>36.8</div></td><td><div>-</div></td></tr><tr><td>Guardian's Payment (Non-Con)</td><td><div>4.7</div></td><td><div>-</div></td></tr><tr><td>Jobseeker's Allowance (Means)</td><td><div>30.4</div></td><td><div>37.4</div></td></tr><tr><td>Jobseeker's Allowance (Payments)</td><td><div>24.6</div></td><td><div>32.6</div></td></tr><tr><td>Back To Work Family Dividend</td><td><div>29.9</div></td><td><div>-</div></td></tr><tr><td>Jobseeker's Transitional</td><td><div>-</div></td><td><div>38.3</div></td></tr><tr><td>Pre-retirement Allowance</td><td><div>-</div></td><td><div>29.9</div></td></tr><tr><td>Jobseeker's Benefit</td><td><div>22.7</div></td><td><div>26.0</div></td></tr><tr><td>Supplementary Welfare  Allowance</td><td><div>23.8</div></td><td><div>25.5</div></td></tr><tr><td>Survivor's Pension (Contributory)</td><td><div>34.2</div></td><td><div>-</div></td></tr><tr><td>Survivor's Pension (Non-Con)</td><td><div>-</div></td><td><div>32.7</div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

Employment is central to independence and social integration and offers the best protection against poverty. This Government is committed to helping more people with disabilities to enter the workforce.  To this end recipients of disability allowance (DA) can retain a proportion of their income support payment as they move from welfare to work. </p>  <p>  DA is a means-tested payment for people with a specified disability whose income falls below certain limits. To qualify for DA a person must, among other conditions, have an injury, disease or physical or mental disability that has continued or may be expected to continue for at least one year and as a result of this disability be substantially restricted in undertaking work that would otherwise be suitable for a person of their age, experience and qualifications. </p>  <p>  The means disregard for DA is important in the context of ensuring that people with disabilities can participate in work while retaining a proportion of their social welfare payment. The current disregard provides that people with disabilities can earn up to &euro;120 per week from employment without their payment being affected while earnings between &euro;120 and &euro;350 are assessed at 50%. </p>  <p>  Currently, some 10% of DA recipients avail of this provision.  Recent Government decisions have sought to increase the number of DA recipients availing of this arrangement.  In line with the recommendations of the Make Work Pay report published last April, the Government has dispensed with the requirement that work be of a &lsquo;rehabilitative nature&rsquo; for the DA earnings disregard.  This means that a report from a doctor is no longer required before commencing work and that the focus is on capacity rather than incapacity. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, procedures have been put in place with regard to fast-tracking the reinstatement of DA to people with disabilities who have returned to work, and have subsequently had to leave their job within one year.  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

If everyone was paid the same amount or more under the new total contributions approach system as they would have got under the old one, there would be little point in such a reform, and it would add to the sustainability challenges already faced by the State pension system.  Trends show that these sustainability challenges are going to place ever-increasing burdens in the coming years on workers who fund State pensions through the PRSI system.  The proposed new TCA system strikes a balance between recognising periods outside the paid workforce while emphasising the need to maximise the paid element in the contribution conditions for pensions.</p>  <p>  The recent Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund has been used to explore the costs of various options and to inform the design of the TCA.  The TCA model for post-2020 pensioners has yet to be decided upon, as the design will not be finalised until after a public consultation later this year.  There are a number of factors, not just the number of years required for a full pension, which influence outcomes, and I will consider very carefully the priorities identified by stakeholders in that consultation process.  </p>  <p>  The interim TCA model being made available for post-2012 pensioners (up to 2019) is based on 40 years, but has very significant Home-caring provisions, much more beneficial than those in the 2010 proposals, that make it more beneficial for homemakers disadvantaged by the Yearly Average approach.  This is because the 2010 model produces significantly worse outcomes for women, particularly where they have homemaking periods prior to 1994.</p>  <p>  To take one example, a pensioner born in 1950 who reached pension age in 2016, who had 18 years PRSI contributions, a gap of 18 years raising her children when aged 24 to 42, and a yearly average of 15-19.  Under the pre-2012 Yearly Average system, she might have expected a contributory pension at 75% of the maximum rate.  Under the Post-2012 Yearly Average system, her entitlement would be 65%.  Under the proposals announced earlier this year, she will qualify for a 90% pension.  However, under the 2010 proposals, which had a 30 year base for a maximum pension, but which did not recognise home-making pre-1994, her entitlement would only be 60%.  In taking a 40 year approach for this model, I have been able to have much more generous homecaring provisions, which largely benefit women who were disadvantaged by the previous system.  It will still remain possible for others to qualify for a full rate contributory pension with 30 years of paid PRSI and 10 years of credits (e.g. from jobseeking periods), over the course of a 50 year period.  Invalidity pensioners and Widows will continue to generally qualify for a full rate pension.  Those who do not qualify for a full rate SPC on this basis will still be able to make a claim to the means-tested SPNC, which pays up to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate.</p>  <p>  Ultimately, for those retiring after 2020,  the balance between the number of years required for a full pension and the level of recognition for homecaring periods will be decided after the consultation later this year, as will any transitional elements to the final proposal.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies matters for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The maximum rate of pension is payable where a person has a yearly average of at least 48, and there are banded entitlements below that.</p>  <p>  In calculating the yearly average, the number of full-rate contributions paid and/or credited is counted up to the end of the tax/contribution year before reaching pension age (66), and this total is divided by the number of tax/contribution years in their record up to that point.  For example, if someone&rsquo;s record was from 1972, and they turned 66 on 1 July 2016, it would be the contributions they paid or were credited in the period to 31 December 2015, divided by 44 years (i.e. every year from 1972 to 2015).  Taking the subsequent period into account to calculate the yearly average could only increase their contributions by a maximum of 26 contributions, and if their yearly average was already higher than that, this would have the effect of reducing their yearly average, rather than increasing it, as the amended total would be divided by 45.  Given the fact that in most cases, this would result in a lower rather than a higher yearly average, it is to most people&rsquo;s advantage that the rule should apply as it does now.  </p>  <p>  However, the Deputy should note that all contributions can still be used to satisfy other pension conditions (notably the requirement to have a minimum of 520 contributions paid to qualify for State pension contributory). </p>  <p>  Under the forthcoming Total Contributions Approach, there will be no need for such a provision, and all reckonable contributions will be used in the calculation of entitlements.</p>  <p>  It should be remembered that PRSI does not just fund the State pension contributory and enable people to qualify for that payment, but also working age benefits before they retire.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The purpose of this payment is to assist these households with their energy costs. The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household. It is not intended to meet those costs in full. Only one allowance is paid per household. </p>  <p>  In October 2017, I introduced the option for qualified households to receive their fuel allowance payment in two lump sums - in October and in January. This allows people to buy fuel in bulk and potentially avail of special offers or discounts on the purchase of the particular fuel that meets their specific needs. </p>  <p>  In Budget 2018, I increased the duration of the fuel allowance season by one week to 27 weeks. This is clearly longer than the winter period in Ireland, and provides assistance during what are largely colder weeks, when heating costs are expected to be at their highest. The current fuel allowance season will, therefore run to the first week in April. </p>  <p>  Given the severity of the weather in recent days, last week I announced that all people in receipt of the Fuel Allowance will receive an extra payment of &euro;22.50 in respect of this week. This is to ensure our customers can be safe and warm at this time. The additional payment will be paid automatically during the week commencing 12th March and will bring Fuel Allowance payment to &euro;45 that week. The extra payment of &euro;22.50 will also be paid to those who have received the Fuel Allowance in lump sum payments. </p>  <p>  Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, exceptional needs payments may be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost which customers are unable to meet out of their own resources and this may include exceptional heating costs. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

At a technical level, reliably identifying a single employer, regardless of the details of corporate structures, requires the existence of an agreed &lsquo;unique business identifier&rsquo; (UBI). However, a UBI does not currently exist in Ireland.  The creation of such an identifier is identified as a key priority in the National Statistics Board&rsquo;s <i>A World Class Statistical System for Ireland: Strategic Priorities for Official Statistics 2015-2020</i>, and is under active consideration at whole-of-government level.</p><p>More importantly still, in terms of statistical confidentiality, even if employer-level information could readily be produced, it would not be appropriate to make public information identifying individual businesses.</p><p>Notwithstanding the above, in general we can readily produce an industry sector (&lsquo;NACE&rsquo;) breakdown of employers, similar to the breakdowns routinely published by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) in many statistical outputs.

The purpose of this payment is to assist these households with their energy costs.  The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household.  It is not intended to meet those costs in full.  Only one allowance is paid per household. </p>  <p>  The UK has a Winter Fuel Payment, which amounts to between &pound;100 and &pound;300 pounds each winter.  In addition to this amount, Cold Weather Payments may be awarded to provide help to people in meeting their additional heating costs during periods of extreme cold. Payment is made automatically when the average temperature at the weather station linked to an eligible customer&rsquo;s postcode has been recorded as, or is forecast to be, 0 degrees Celsius or below over seven consecutive days.  This payment, when it is made, amounts to &pound;25 for a seven day period of extreme cold.</p>  <p>  The introduction of a similar scheme in Ireland would result in very significant administrative and technical overheads and could also result in unfair situations where customers in one county receive the payment while customers in neighbouring counties do not.</p>  <p>  Given the severity of the weather in recent days, I announced that all people in receipt of the Fuel Allowance will receive an extra payment of &euro;22.50 in respect of last week, regardless of the temperature in their area over the previous seven consecutive days.</p>  <p>  I believe that this was the fairest and best way of ensuring that those in most need received the extra payment and therefore I have no plans to introduce a cold weather payment scheme similar to the one in the UK at this time.  If similar exceptionally severe weather occurs in the future I will of course again look at the best way of ensuring customers of my Department can feel safe and warm in their homes.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

To do this, the Government will introduce from 2020 &lsquo;Total Contributions Approach&rsquo; (TCA) for the State Pension (Contributory).  The TCA is advanced as a more logical and transparent system, where the individual&rsquo;s lifetime contribution will more closely match the benefit received.  </p>  <p>  The Roadmap also confirms that State pension payments will be formally benchmarked at 34% of average earnings and that future increases will be linked to the consumer price index and average wages.  Taken together, these measures will provide greater confidence regarding pension value over the long term.  The changes proposed in this Roadmap will enable people to plan with confidence for their retirement and be assured that the adequacy of their State pension will be protected over time. They will also introduce greater equity into the State pension system.  </p>  <p>  However the changes can only be implemented and the necessary assurances as to the maintenance of pension adequacy provided, if there is a similar level of assurance as to the funding of the system.  In other words, that social insurance contribution rates will be adjusted to ensure that there are sufficient funds available to Government to finance the payment of pensions.  </p>  <p>  Therefore, in order to bring greater certainty to the funding of the Social Insurance Fund, the Roadmap proposes the establishment of a transparent actuarial basis for the setting of Social Insurance contribution rates and commits to the publication of a consultation paper in this regard.  This process will be informed by the recently published Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund which will itself play an important role in informing overall debate on policy developments in relation to the SIF in the years ahead.  This includes the financial sustainability of the Fund given the expected demographic challenges and consideration of extending the scope of benefits for workers generally, including the self-employed.  This will provide Government with a timely and evidence-led opportunity to undertake a full review of our social insurance system and to consult with stakeholders.  </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

These proposals when developed later this year will also set out what this will mean, in practical terms, for those in receipt of the State pension (non-contributory).  I can assure the Deputy, however, that the rate of the non-contributory pension will be at least maintained, in real terms, for the duration of this Government, as set out in the Programme for Government.  </p>  <p>  Last year, a person solely dependent upon State pension (non-contributory) pension and in receipt of full secondary benefits, already received pension payments above the 34% benchmark.  The &euro;5 increase later this month will bring the weekly rate to &euro;232 (95.36% of the maximum rate of the contributory pension), with allowances and secondary benefits also available where applicable, including Fuel Allowance, Household Benefits, Living Alone Allowance, Telephone Support Allowance and Over-80 Allowances.</p>  <p>  Current poverty rates for people over 66 are much lower than among the general population, with approximately half as many at risk of poverty (8.77%), and less than a fifth as many (1.56%) experiencing consistent poverty.  This is a direct result of the success of the Government in defending the core rates of pension payments during the downturn, and the subsequent increases now that the economy has been revitalised.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Subject to finalisation of the scheme design following a public consultation, it is intended that the TCA will offer a full State pension to all people with a full record of 40 years social insurance contributions with pro-rata payments for people with less than 40 years of contributions.  People who have to take time out of the workforce to take up caring duties will be eligible to accumulate up to 20 years credits towards meeting the full 40 year contribution record.  Similarly, unemployed people and others with an entitlement will, as now, be able to get credited contributions provided that they have a minimum number of paid contributions.</p>  <p>  The model proposed in the National Pensions Framework in 2010 required 30 years of contributions, but had a cap of 10 years for credits, including Homemakers credits.  It also did not recognise home-making periods before 1994.  These factors meant that such a model would be disadvantageous to women who had significant periods outside the workforce raising children.</p>  <p>  The 40 year proposal allows for 20 years of credits, including HomeCaring Credits and crucially, removes the limitation on these HomeCaring periods before 1994 that was included in the 2010 plan.  The current proposal is far more gender balanced, and supports our policy of making the State pension adequate, sustainable and equitable.

However, I can say that I am in favour of financially incentivising retirement savings to help address a situation where the proportion of employees in Ireland with supplementary pension cover is far too low at just 35% of the private sector workforce.  This suggests that a high percentage of the working population is not saving enough, or is not saving at all, for retirement.  </p>  <p>  Tax relief is a significant cost to the State but the benefits of tax relief are not at all well understood and many have little or no understanding of how the tax system impacts pension contributions.   This is why in launching the new Automatic Enrolment system detailed in the Roadmap for Pensions Reform, to incentivise participation and mitigate the risk of member opt-out, the Government believes that any financial incentives must be effectively communicated, easily understood and appreciated.  </p>  <p>  To enhance the potential for the success of the automatic enrolment system, any State provided financial incentives should strive to give relief in a manner that supports low to middle income earners and be sufficiently attractive to encourage such earners to participate.  Incentives should also avoid complexity and be as transparent as possible.  </p>  <p>  I can confirm that the Roadmap commits to a review of the cost of funded supplementary pensions to the Exchequer.  This will inform decisions relating to financial incentives for retirement savings and underpin the development of an automatic enrolment system.  It will include an assessment of the economic and social benefits delivered and an evaluation of equity in the distribution of tax expenditure on pensions.</p>  <p>  The Roadmap also confirms that an Interdepartmental Pensions Reform and Taxation Group (chaired by the Department of Finance) will identity and progress measures to improve the harmonisation of rules to eliminate anomalies in the treatment of different retirement arrangements including taxation treatment.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Accordingly The Roadmap for Pensions Reform details a range of measures intended to support a positive ageing environment, where older people are, to the greatest extent possible, encouraged, and facilitated in working, if they wish to, beyond the &lsquo;normal&rsquo; retirement age.</p>  <p>  Ireland does not have a default age at which employees must retire and the setting of retirement age remains a matter for agreement between employers/employees and the employment contract.  The Government recognises that measures which may support longer working include encouraging employers to more closely consider the logic of, and justification for, mandatory retirement ages in employment contracts. </p>  <p>  Employers/employees and their representatives had indicated difficulty in interpreting and engaging on matters relating to retirement age in the absence of an overarching guidance or framework.  In response to these concerns, the Workplace Relations Commission has recently published a &lsquo;Code of Practice on Longer Working&rsquo;.  The code informs best practice in managing the engagement between employers and employees in the run up to retirement, including requests to work beyond what would be the normal retirement age in the employment concerned.  Following publication of this code, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission will prepare and publish further guidance material for employers on the use of fixed-term contracts beyond normal retirement age. </p>  <p>  The Government expects that these and other provisions will combine to result in greater employee flexibility to work beyond what may be considered the traditional retirement age of 65.  To ensure this is the case, the Roadmap confirms that employment practices in this area will be kept under close review in the near term.  This will include engaging with employer and employee representatives and monitoring the labour market more generally to observe changing employment practices. </p>  <p>  As the Roadmap makes clear, should it appear that these provisions are not resulting in improved flexibility for workers, the Government will examine and consider the merits of restricting the capacity to use mandatory retirement provisions relative to the State pension age.</p>  <p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

My Department proposes to implement a legislative ban on the sale or manufacture of personal care products, detergents and scouring agents containing plastic microbeads and it is intended that Heads of a Bill to ban plastic microbeads will be published later this year. </p>  <p>  Over recent years, scientists, experts and policy makers have become increasingly concerned about the levels of waste, or marine litter, winding up in our seas and oceans.  It can be found in every aspect of the marine environment and ranges in size from large objects, such as fishing nets or shipping containers, to micro- and nano-litter particles - i.e. particles of smaller than 5 mm in diameter and smaller than 0.05 mm, respectively. It is clear that this is an issue that needs to be addressed, at the very least, under the precautionary principle.  Marine litter also causes socio-economic harm, such as affecting tourism and consumer confidence in seafood.</p>  <p>  Plastic is a particular problem for the marine environment.  Due to its buoyancy, it can easily be washed down rivers, blown offshore or collected by the tide from the shore as well as being dumped or lost directly into the seas from ships and fishing boats.  It does not biodegrade and persists in the environment for a very long time.  It can breakdown into secondary microplastic particles through erosion and there is evidence that both large plastic items and microplastics are being ingested by marine fauna with undetermined consequences both for them and for those higher up the food chain who eat them, in turn. Plastics may contain toxic additives or may even absorb other toxins present in the water.  </p>  <p>  While it is considered that most marine microplastic litter is created through the erosion of larger pieces, microplastics are also entering the marine environment in other forms such as micro-fibres from artificial fabrics worn off clothes by washing, for example. However, a certain amount of marine microplastic litter is caused by plastic microbeads which are used in cosmetics, body care and cleansing products, and detergents and surface cleaning agents, entering the marine environment via wastewater discharges into rivers and estuaries. </p>  <p>  While these microbeads only represent a small fraction of the microplastic litter entering the marine environment, they are a particularly pernicious product as they are &ldquo;ready-made&rdquo; microplastics and cannot be removed once they reach it.  </p>  <p>  Microbeads could not be regarded as a major human necessity. They are often present merely for decorative purposes or are used as bulking agents in products. Also, where microbeads are used as exfoliating or scouring agents, a wide array of established safe and biodegradable organic particles or natural mineral alternatives is available.</p></reply>

The making of such a scheme is subject to the consent of the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government. No rate waiver schemes have been consented to in respect of commercial property.</p>  <p>  Some local authorities have introduced locally designed business incentive schemes which promote the use of vacant commercial property.  Such schemes rely upon Part 9 of the Local Government Act 2001 which provides that the functions of local authorities include providing grants, loans guarantees or other financial aid to promote the interests of the local community, including economic interests.  Unlike rates waiver schemes, no Ministerial sanction is required for the setting up of these schemes.</p>  <p>  Commercial rates form an important element of the funding of all local authorities.  However, the legislative basis for the levying of rates is spread over a number of enactments, some dating back to the 19th century.  Many of the provisions are outdated and not suitable for business trends in the modern era.  My Department has developed legislative proposals to modernise and consolidate the legislation governing commercial rates.  Among the measures included in the General Scheme of the Bill are provisions to allow a local authority to introduce rates alleviation schemes to support the implementation of policy objectives, including: local economic and community plans; objectives contained in Development Plans and Local Area Plans; and national planning policies.</p>  <p>  The Government last year approved the drafting of a Rates Bill. The General Scheme of the Bill is currently with the Attorney General&rsquo;s office for drafting, with a view to its introduction as soon as possible.</p></reply>

As a long term housing support, an assessment of housing need must be completed in order for a household to qualify for HAP. Any household with an identified housing need is eligible for HAP. The Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011 provide that subject to conditions, a housing authority shall deal with such an application within a period of 12 weeks.</p>  <p>  Local authorities will prioritise housing needs assessments for those in greatest need and average waiting times are significantly shorter than the statutory maximum in many areas.</p>  <p>  Under the HAP scheme, eligible households source their own accommodation in the private rented sector. My Department does not hold details on the processing times for HAP applications or payments. The earliest date a HAP payment will issue to a landlord is the date a complete and valid HAP application has been received by the local authority.  Limerick City and County Council provide a highly effective transactional shared service on behalf of all HAP local authorities. This HAP Shared Services Centre (SSC) manages all HAP related rental transactions for the tenant, local authority and landlord. Once a HAP application has been received and confirmed as valid by the relevant local authority, it is then processed by the HAP SSC. On average, HAP applications are processed by the HAP Shared Service Centre within 1 working day of receipt. Any rental payment arising for a given month will then be made to a landlord on the last Wednesday of that month.</p>  <p>  More than 33,700 households are currently in receipt of HAP support. My Department continues to keep the operation of the HAP scheme under review. In general, I am satisfied with the operation of the HAP scheme and I consider it to be a key vehicle for meeting housing need and fulfilling the ambitious programme under the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness.</p></reply>

Accordingly, it could be a number of years before the relevant development plans at national, regional and local level become properly aligned and consistent with one another.  <b></b></p><p>In this regard, it is proposed that a process of alignment between national, regional and local development plans will be provided for through amendments to the current statutory timeframes for local authority development plan reviews. Essentially, it is proposed that any reviews which have been initiated and are currently underway will be paused so that they can take account of emerging statistical and evidential input from forthcoming RSESs once these new regional strategies are in place. This alignment will not be achieved in a manageable or timely manner if current Development Plans continue to be subject to separate review at very different intervals over a rolling 6-year period.  </p><p>In order to achieve effective implementation, it is therefore proposed that City and County Development Plans be more closely aligned with the NPF and subsequent regional strategies, having regard to the early 2019 timescale for completion of the regional strategies.  </p><p>In recognition of the critical role that the local government sector will have in the ongoing implementation of the Framework, my Department is currently running a series of workshops to ensure that those local authority officials involved in planning matters are fully informed in relation to the content of the Framework as we move into the implementation phase.</p></reply>

A key principle of the HAP scheme is that eligible households source their own accommodation in the private rented sector, which best suits their needs in their area of choice. This is distinct from RAS, which is a different type of social housing support, where the tenant may not always find their own accommodation and instead are allocated a dwelling in accordance with Section 22 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009. Unlike HAP, where a RAS tenancy is ending, the local authority retains the responsibility to source further accommodation for that household.</p>  <p>  Under the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014, which provides for HAP, a household in receipt of another form of social housing support, such as accommodation provided under the RAS, will not generally be eligible for HAP. Section 45 (5) of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014 does allow for the provision of HAP where a household is currently residing in another form of social housing support, except in emergency circumstances. The ending of a RAS tenancy does not fall within the meaning of an emergency, as prescribed by that section of the legislation.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to keep the operation of the HAP scheme under review. In order to provide greater equity of options between social housing tenants, and in light of the current private rental market, my Department is currently exploring how greater flexibility of movement between allocated social housing supports and HAP could be facilitated. This may require legislative change. In general, I am satisfied with the operation of HAP and I consider it to be a key vehicle for meeting housing need and fulfilling the ambitious programme outlined under the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness.</p></reply>

Section 6 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 specifically provides that the Minister's power to issue policy directions and guidelines to housing authorities in relation to their housing functions should not be construed as enabling the Minister to exercise any power or control in relation to any individual case with which a housing authority is or may be concerned.  The Minister is, therefore, precluded from intervening in relation to individual cases.</p>  <p>  It continues to be the case under the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan, as with the previous local authority House Purchase Loan, that single applicants applying for the loan must not be earning greater than &euro;50,000 gross per annum and the combined income of joint applicants must not be greater than &euro;75,000 gross per annum.  This is to ensure the effective targeting of limited resources.  </p>  <p>  The final decision on loan approval is a matter for each local authority and its Credit Committee on a case-by-case basis.  Decisions on all housing loan applications must be made in accordance with the statutory credit policy that underpins the scheme, in order to ensure consistency of treatment for all applicants.  Loan applicants who are dissatisfied with a loan application decision of a local authority Credit Committee may appeal that decision to the local authority.  Details of the appeals process can be obtained from the relevant local authority.</p>  <p>  The option for borrowers with incomes in excess of the income limits set for the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan is to seek housing finance from a commercial lender.</p></reply>

Section 5 of these Guidelines offers advice as regards the structure and content of local area plans and sets out a range of policies that can be put in place to promote and facilitate active and healthy living patterns for local communities. </p><p>These include</p><p>- promoting walking and cycling as modes of transport,</p><p>- accessibility to public open spaces, recreational and sports facilities,</p><p>- proximity of new development to sustainable travel modes,</p><p>- provision of play areas, and</p><p>- careful consideration of the appropriateness of the location of fast-food outlets in the vicinity of schools and parks. </p><p>A practical effect of these Guidelines with regard to fast-food outlets is that consideration can be given to the appropriateness of their location in the vicinity of schools and parks, for example in newly developing areas, while at the same time taking into account wider land use considerations.</p><p>However, with regard to the many schools located in or near town centres, restriction of fast-food outlets in these kinds of situations needs to be carefully considered on a case by case basis, in view of the mix of existing uses typically found in such central urban areas.</p><p>In addition, planning policy with regard to the location of fast-food outlets needs to be considered also within the wider policy context of practical steps that can be taken to more widely promote and facilitate active and healthy living patterns, by enhancing the scope for activities such as walking, cycling and sports and active leisure pursuits and their associated facilities.</p><p>In relation to the number of local authorities that have a policy as referenced in the question, the relevant section of the Guidelines sets out a methodology to be considered and applied at local level rather than a pre-determined policy position.  Therefore, tracking and collation of specific data in relation to the existence and nature of the policies adopted in LAPs by individual local authorities in line with the Guidelines is not undertaken by my Department.</p><p>It should also be noted that senior officials from my Department participate in the cross-Departmental working group, established by the Minister for Health, to oversee implementation of the National Obesity Policy and Action Plan.</p></reply>

The Scheme is open to eligible tenants, including joint tenants, of local authority houses that are available for sale under the Scheme. To be eligible, tenants must meet certain criteria, including having a minimum reckonable income of &euro;15,000 per annum and having been in receipt of social housing support for at least one year.</p><p>The minimum reckonable income for eligibility under the scheme is determined by the relevant local authority in accordance with the detailed provisions of the Ministerial Direction issued under Sections 24(3) and (4) of the 2014 Act. In the determination of the minimum reckonable income, local authorities include income from a number of different sources and classes, such as from employment, private pensions, maintenance payments and certain social welfare payments, including pensions, where the social welfare payment is secondary to employment income. </p><p>In determining reckonable income, the income of all tenants of the house, including adult children that are joint tenants, is included, as is the income of the spouse, civil partner or other partner / co-habitant of a tenant who lives in the house with them, thus ensuring the appropriate level of discount is applied to the purchase price.</p><p>The minimum income criterion was introduced in order to ensure the sustainability of the scheme.  Applicants must demonstrate that they have an income that is long-term and sustainable in nature. This ensures that the tenant purchasing the house is in a financial position, as the owner, to maintain and insure the property for the duration of the charged period, in compliance with the conditions of the order transferring the ownership of, and responsibility for, the house from the local authority to the tenant.</p><p>The financing of any house sold under the Tenant (Incremental) Purchase Scheme is a separate matter from the eligibility criteria for the scheme.  If the tenant is deemed eligible under the scheme, he or she may fund the purchase of a house from one, or a combination, of his / her own resources or a mortgage provided by a financial institution or a local authority house purchase loan. </p><p>In line with the commitment given in Rebuilding Ireland, a review of the first 12 months of the Tenant Purchase Scheme&rsquo;s operation has been undertaken. The review has incorporated analysis of comprehensive data received from local authorities regarding the operation of the scheme during 2016 and a wide-ranging public consultation process which took place in 2017 and saw submissions received from individuals, elected representatives and organisations.</p><p>The review is now complete and a full report has been prepared setting out findings and recommendations. In finalising the report some further inter-Departmental consultation was necessary and due consideration had to be given to possible implementation arrangements. These matters are now almost completed and I expect to be in a position to publish the outcome of the review shortly.</p></reply>

These requirements are set out in 12 parts, classified as Parts A to M. The accompanying Technical Guidance Documents (TGDs) provide guidance on how owners, builders, developers and designers can achieve compliance in practice.</p><p>Part L of the regulations deals with Conservation of Fuel and Energy.  Since 2008, Part L has required a reasonable proportion of the energy consumption of a new dwelling to be provided by renewable energy with section 1.2 providing guidance on Renewable Energy Technology.  </p><p>The Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (2010/31/EU) sets requirements for Member States to ensure that by 31 December 2020, all new buildings are nearly zero energy buildings, while new buildings owned and occupied by Public Authorities, must achieve this standard by 31<sup>st</sup>December 2018. </p><p>The Directive defines a Nearly Zero Energy Building or NZEB as a building that has a very high energy performance, where the nearly zero or very low amount of energy required should be covered to a very significant extent by energy from renewable sources, including energy from renewable sources produced on-site or nearby. In 2017, this definition was incorporated into the Building Regulations 1997-2017.</p><p>In 2017, Part L was also amended to establish the NZEB standard for buildings other than dwellings, thus requiring a proportion of the energy consumption of the building to be provided by renewable energy. This applies to works commencing on or after 1 January 2019 subject to transition arrangements. TGD L - Conservation of Fuel and Energy - Buildings other than dwellings provides guidance on how to meet these requirements.  </p><p>A further review of Part L is currently underway to establish the NZEB standard for dwellings and draft documents will issue for public consultation shortly.</p></reply>

This is in recognition of the exceptional nature of activities carried out by local authorities in responding to these types of emergencies and the fact that the costs of these un-programmed activities cannot be met from within existing resources.</p>  <p>  In relation to the recent severe cold weather and snow that has caused widespread disruption in many parts of the country, my Department intends, when the response phase is concluded, to write to local authorities, including Cavan and Monaghan County Councils, inviting them to submit claims for recoupment of the exceptional costs involved in the response and clean-up.</p>  <p>  Funding for repair of public infrastructure is undertaken by the relevant Departments in line with their sectorial responsibility. It is a matter for each Government Department to liaise directly with local authorities in relation to funding of repairs and restoration being carried out through the local government system.</p></reply>

The Building Regulations apply to the design and construction of a building or to an extension or material alteration of a building. The minimum performance requirements that a building must achieve are set out in the Second Schedule to the Building Regulations. These requirements are set out in 12 parts classified as Parts A to M. Part F - Ventilation, requires that adequate means of ventilation shall be provided for people in buildings.</p>  <p>  Technical Guidance Documents (TGDs) provide technical guidance on how to comply with the building regulations in practical terms. TGD F contains guidance, compliance with which will, prima facie, indicate compliance with Part F.</p>  <p>  Under the Building Control Acts 1990 to 2014, primary responsibility for compliance with the requirements of the Building Regulations rests with the designers, builders and owners of buildings. Enforcement of the Building Regulations is a matter for the 31 local building control authorities, who have extensive powers of inspection and investigation under the Acts.</p>  <p>  The Building Regulations are subject to ongoing review in the interests of safety and the well-being of persons in the built environment and to ensure that due regard is taken of changes in construction techniques, technological progress and innovation. Directive 2010/31/EU on the Energy Performance of Buildings requires that by 31 December 2020 all new buildings are nearly zero-energy buildings. Part F - Ventilation, will shortly be reviewed to take account of changes in air permeability standards required in nearly zero energy buildings.</p></reply>

It provides that the Housing Agency, in consultation with the relevant housing authority, may make a written proposal to the Minister that an identified area be prescribed as a Rent Pressure Zone. Within one week of receipt of such a proposal, the Minister shall request the Director of the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) to furnish him, within two weeks, with a report on whether the proposed area  satisfies the criteria specified in subsection 24A(4) for designation as a Rent Pressure Zone.</p><p>The criteria to be satisfied by an area under section 24A(4) of the Residential Tenancies Acts for designation as a Rent Pressure Zone are as follows:</p><p>(a) the information relating to the area, as determined by reference to the information used to compile each quarterly RTB Rent Index report, shows that the annual rate of increase in the average amount of rent for that area is more than 7% in each of at least 4 of the 6 quarters, preceding the period immediately prior to the date of the Housing Agency's proposal. </p><p>(b) the average rent for the area in the last quarter, as determined by reference to the information used to compile the RTB Rent Index, is above the average national rent (commonly referred to as the Rent Index national standardised rent) in the last quarter.</p><p>The Housing Agency will continue to monitor the rental market and may recommend further areas for designation. Where, following the procedures set out in the Act, it is found at a future date that additional areas meet the criteria, they will be considered for designation as Rent Pressure Zones.  </p><p>The RTB's news page link in relation to its Rent Index -  - provides access to the most recent RTB Rent Index quarterly report (for Q3 2017) and summarises its key findings. Information is also provided as part of the RTB's education and awareness campaign relating to Rent Pressure Zones. </p><p>Table 9 in the RTB Rent Index report illustrates the recent rent changes at Local Electoral Area (LEA) level.

The Department discharges this remit in the context of the language planning process, as set out under the Gaeltacht Act, which represents a key component in support of the overarching implementation of the Government&rsquo;s 20-Year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010-2030.</p><p>In support of this objective my Department directly implements a range of measures, programmes, schemes and initiatives directed at supporting the Irish language as a vibrant community and household language in Gaeltacht regions. The Department also supports a range of Gaeltacht-based organisations engaged in language support activities, all of which positively impact on Gaeltacht communities.</p><p>In addition to direct funding within Gaeltacht communities, the Department  funds and works closely with &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta as the regional development agency for the Gaeltacht which is tasked inter alia with supporting and developing industry and enterprise in Gaeltacht regions as well as with the implementation of a number of schemes aimed specifically at reducing the impact of social exclusion. These schemes include the Leader Programme, the Community Enterprise Scheme, the Rural Social Scheme and the Scheme of Grants to Community Development Groups.  Further details regarding the implementation and funding of these schemes are available in the organisation's Annual Report and Accounts at <i>.</i></p><p>Notwithstanding the fact that the issues raised by the Deputy in his question are not uniquely confined to Gaeltacht regions and that they do not form part of my Department&rsquo;s direct area of responsibility, it is my view that an indirect impact of my Department's operations and those of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta can have a positive impact in relation to the issues of loneliness and social isolation in Gaeltacht regions.</p></reply>

A new conservation management plan currently being developed  for the state-owned lands at the Hill of Tara will identify objectively areas in need of attention, including actions to support sustainable visitor access and necessary conservation interventions to ensure the sites are preserved for future generations. A new management plan has also been prepared for Br&uacute; na B&oacute;inne and helps identify priorities for future investment at this World Heritage inscribed site, where under my Department&rsquo;s strategic partnership with F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the Office of Public Works, there is considerable government investment earmarked for revitalised visitor facilities, including at the main visitor centre. </p></reply>
