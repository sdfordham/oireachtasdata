Once these animal certification requirements are met, dogs, including greyhounds, may be exported internationally. Exporters are also required to comply with the provisions of Council Regulation (EC) No 1 of 2005 on the protection of animals during transport.</p>  <p>   I am aware that a very small number of greyhounds have been exported to Macau in the past two months.  I understand that Bord na gCon, which is responsible for the governance, regulation and development of the greyhound industry in the Republic of Ireland and the wellbeing of greyhounds, has developed a Code of Practice in relation to the welfare of greyhounds which sets out specific standards that all individuals engaged in the care and management of registered greyhounds are expected to meet.  The Code emphasises that owners and keepers must take full responsibility for the physical and social well-being of greyhounds in line with best welfare practice.  Oversight mechanisms in place regarding greyhound exports include inter-agency co-operation, co-operation with fellow members of International Greyhound Forums and intelligence/information which is received from Welfare Officers during the course of investigations carried out under the Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2011.  Where any breaches of welfare standards are identified under the Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2011, Bord na gCon takes stringent actions and prosecutions ensue in accordance with the Act.</p>  <p>  Officials of my Department have recently met with Bord na gCon and the welfare members of the International Greyhound Forum (represented by the ISPCA and the Dogs Trust) to consider the issues surrounding the export of greyhounds.  Bord na gCon advises all owners involved in the export of greyhounds to only export to destinations with high animal welfare standards and that provide the expected levels of greyhound care and management as defined in the Code and I strongly endorse this view.  I should point out, however, that international trade takes place in a legally complex environment, and that national legislation is not legally binding on activities which take place outside the State.</p>  <p>  In conclusion, I should say that, following the decision of certain airlines not to transport greyhounds, it is unlikely that the trade in greyhounds to Macau will continue.</p></reply>

There is no intention on the part of the negotiators in the European Commission to in any way endanger or undermine the comprehensive food safety and public health standards that are implemented in the EU in the context of negotiating the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership.</p>  <p>  A number of key issues in this regard arise in relation to food standards, hormone treated beef and GMOs. All of these arose in the recent negotiations with Canada for a Free Trade Agreement and were resolved, and I believe they will also be capable of being resolved in TTIP.</p>  <p>  We have made the point, and I am confident that it is shared by the European Commission and other Member States, that the principle of equivalence must continue to apply so that, even where food production processes in the EU and US are not identical, they will provide equivalent guarantees regarding the standards of production.  This principle is already enshrined under the World Trade Organisation Agreement on Agriculture, and is also recognised by both sides as the basis for a TTIP agreement.</p>  <p>  Equally, it is important that both the EU and United States retain the policy space to restrict certain practices and processes on social and ethical grounds, and this is also recognised, in principle, by both sides. For example, the EU Commission has made it clear that it will not allow the importation of hormone treated meat into the EU, and this is well understood by the US side.  In relation to GMOs, there is a well-established assessment and approval process in place in the EU that restricts that marketing of GMOs to those products that have been formally approved.  This should not change under a TTIP agreement.</p></reply>

The Paris Agreement, which seeks to limit global temperature increases to less than 2 degrees Celsius, and to pursue 1.5 degrees, addresses this specific point in Article 2 of that Agreement.  There is a clear link with what was agreed in Paris and the UN Sustainable Development Goal two, which is to <i>&ldquo;End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture.&quot; </i></p><p>The Food Wise 2025 strategy aims to grow the Irish agri-food sector in an economic, environmental and socially sustainable manner, building on our strengths in the production of safe, healthy and nutritious food. Ireland is already one of the EU&rsquo;s most efficient producers of milk and beef, in terms of carbon footprint per unit of output. Under Food Wise we are implementing measures to drive down the carbon intensity of our food production even further, resulting in both economic returns and environmental sustainability.</p><p>Food Wise 2025 includes clear and comprehensive commitments to managing the projected growth in the Irish agrifood sector in a sustainable way.  The guiding principle underpinning this projected growth is that environmental protection and economic competitiveness will be considered as equal and complementary, one will not be achieved at the expense of the other.</p><p>Food Wise provides a framework for the agrisector to engage with the national mitigation plan and for the development of a common vision of transition to a low carbon future. There is a strong commitment in Food Wise 2025 to measure and monitor the sustainability credentials of the sector.  As part of the implementation of Food Wise, an Environmental Sustainability Committee has been established. This implementation process will include evaluation and assessment of the delivery of sustainability and mitigation actions.</p></reply>

Food Wise includes more than 400 specific recommendations, spread across the cross-cutting themes of sustainability, innovation, human capital, market development and competitiveness; as well as specific sectoral recommendations.</p><p>Food security is defined by the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) as: <i>&ldquo;a situation that exists when all people, at all times, have physical, social and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life&rdquo;.</i>At national level, food security is addressed through a range of Government policies providing social protection and supports for low income, disadvantaged and vulnerable groups.  At international level, Ireland&rsquo;s development aid programme has a strong focus on food and nutrition, including through funding from my own Department to the UN FAO and WFP (World Food Programme). </p><p>Food Wise aims to grow the Irish agrifood sector in an economic, environmental and socially sustainable manner, building on our strengths in the production of safe, healthy and nutritious food. Ireland is already one of the EU&rsquo;s most efficient producers of milk and beef, in terms of carbon footprint per unit of output. But under Food Wise we are implementing measures to drive down the carbon intensity of our food production even further, resulting in both economic returns and environmental sustainability. In that regard I am satisfied that the strategy reflects food security considerations.</p><p>In terms of alternative sources of protein, Ireland&rsquo;s agriculture is largely livestock based and, clearly, if we are to build on our strengths, this must be the focus of our objectives on food security.  However we are developing our seafood industry and our tillage sector. In that regard, tillage accounts for 7% of agricultural land, and the opportunity to further significantly expand tillage production is limited by soil type and conditions.  There is a support scheme in place to encourage production of protein crops under Pillar I of CAP. </p><p>The ambition that Ireland should be a global leader in sustainable food production, building on our natural advantages, is one that I hope is shared by all sides of the House, and Food Wise is a blueprint for how this ambition can be realised.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-06-08a.21.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016060800051#WRA02000"><p>The prospect of a UK vote to leave the EU presents potentially very significant challenges from a trade perspective, and that is especially true for the Irish agrifood sector.  I mentioned earlier that the UK is by far our largest trading partner, with CSO figures indicating that exports of agricultural products in 2015 were worth &euro;5.1 billion and imports &euro;3.8 billion. ESRI and Teagasc reports have highlighted the disproportionate impact that a Brexit is likely to have on the agrifood sector.</p>  <p>  My Department has therefore been giving careful consideration to the potential impact, looking at the areas in which the greatest risks are likely to arise and on which we will need to focus if exit negotiations are to commence in the coming months.  Although it is still too early to predict the outcome with any certainty, the main areas in which impacts are foreseen are in relation to tariffs and trade, the EU budget, regulations and standards, and customs controls and certification.  I would comment briefly again on these areas as follows:  </p>  <p>  -  On tariffs and trade arrangements, including the future direction of UK trade policy, it is clear that potential differences in tariffs could restrict trade in both directions and affect traditional supply practices, particularly for raw materials.  Preferential agreements already in place with third countries could require adjustment to take account of a UK withdrawal.  A further issue that could arise is the freedom of the UK to negotiate trade agreements with other third countries.  This could present a competitiveness challenge for third country suppliers, such as Ireland. However, negotiating such agreements could be a lengthy process.</p>  <p>  -  On the EU budget, a Brexit would result in the loss of the UK contribution to the EU budget, which currently accounts for some 5-10% of the budget.  This could have implications on future spending decisions within an already tight EU budgetary framework, which could place additional pressure on CAP funding in future years, given that it accounts for some 37% of the EU budget.  </p>  <p>  -  On regulations and standards, while this may not have an immediate impact in the event of a Brexit, potential differences could arise over time if the UK takes a different approach to the EU, for example in areas such as origin labelling.  This would be a significant issue in terms of additional costs, possible disruption of supply patterns and consumer preferences.</p>  <p>  -  On customs controls and certification, it is likely that difficulties and additional costs would emerge.  It would be expected, as a matter of course, that a UK exit from the EU could see the return of border controls, together with customs and administrative procedures.  This undoubtedly would lead to additional administrative costs.  Also of concern is that a UK exit would give rise to ongoing certification requirements, which would have significant resource requirements within my Department and significant cost implications for the agrifood industry.</p>  <p>  Finally, the possibility of a Brexit also raises issues for the fisheries sector, particularly in the context of the management and sharing of a large number of different fish stocks that we currently share with the UK and other Member States under the Common Fisheries Policy Framework.</p>  <p>  Overall, it is in Ireland&rsquo;s interests for the UK to remain in the EU.  However, I and my Department are continuing to reflect on these matters so that we are prepared, if the UK decision is to exit, to establish our priorities for the negotiations in the agrifood and fisheries sectors, and to engage in these negotiations at an early date. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-06-08a.24.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016060800051#WRA02300"><p>Lawful hunting of an animal is permitted under the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013. However, the Act prohibits the hunting of animals which have been released in an injured, mutilated or exhausted condition.  In addition, Section 25 of the Act provides for the establishment of codes of practice and for the adoption of codes published by other persons for the purposes of providing practical guidance relating to any aspect of the Act, including fox hunting.  The Irish Masters of Foxhounds Association has a detailed code of conduct in place in respect of the hunting of foxes.  This code places responsibility on member packs to ensure that the highest standards of animal welfare and good behaviour are maintained at all times.  My Department has engaged with the hunting associations with a view to adopting codes under Section 25 of the Act in order to ensure that those who participate in hunting will continue to honour their obligations to maintain the highest standards of behaviour at all times.</p>  <p>  I am fully committed to promoting good practices that respect the welfare of all animals and my Department devotes considerable resources to protecting animal welfare and in dealing with breaches of animal welfare legislation. Under the Act, on summary conviction, a person can receive a fine of up to &euro;10,000 and, on indictment, &euro;250,000 and/or imprisonment up to 5 years.  There are fixed penalty payments for lesser offences.  The Act provides the framework within which the welfare of animals can be safeguarded and I am hopeful that the substantial and significantly increased levels of penalties for offences of animal cruelty provided for under the Act will act as a deterrent to animal welfare abuses.</p>  <p>  In view of the foregoing, I do not plan to prohibit the hunting of foxes.</p></reply>

This was on the understanding that the full amount of the levy was paid to the Commission by the Member State in 2015.  Ireland was one of the few Member States to implement this scheme and make it available to our farmers. </p>  <p>  As part of the discussions in the run-up to the March Council of Agriculture Ministers, Ireland proposed a further deferral of the payment to 2017 and 2018, to ease the financial burden on liable farmers in 2016. I also raised the matter with Commissioner Phil Hogan, in our recent bilateral meeting, as well as at the recent Council of Ministers meeting and encouraged him to reflect again on whether a legal basis could be found to facilitate a further deferral in super levy repayments for farmers. </p>  <p>  However the European Commission advised that the legal basis for the Regulations under-pinning the scheme are no longer in existence and therefore further amendments were not possible. While Ireland has again raised the matter with the Commission, we understand that the view of its legal services remains that there is no legal basis for any adjustment to the timelines provided for in the relevant regulations. </p>  <p>  Ireland has already raised the question of an increase in intervention prices at EU level.  It is clear at this point, however, that there is no prospect of securing the agreement of a qualified majority of member states, or the EU Commission, to such an increase. </p>  <p>  However, I very much welcome the announcement by Commissioner Phil Hogan of his intention to increase the flat rate ceiling for SMP intervention buying-in up to 350,000 tonnes, following my recent meeting with him.  SMP Intervention is key EU support tool for dairy markets and is badly needed in this extended period of downward price volatility in the dairy sector. Intervention helps to put a floor under prices and this extension will be of particular benefit for Irish producers through the peak production period.  Other measures agreed at EU level include Aids to Private Storage for Cheese and a targeted direct aid scheme of &euro;13.7 million for Irish farmers, which was matched by national funds. </p>  <p>  I can assure the deputy that I will continue to engage with the EU Commission and with other Member States to ensure that market support measures are deployed and extended as necessary.</p></reply>

At this meeting he provided me with an overview of the company.</p>  <p>  Coillte Teoranta was established as a private commercial company under the Forestry Act, 1988 and , while day-to-day operational matters are the responsibility of the company, the meeting was an opportunity for the CEO to brief me about its structure , and the businesses in which the company is engaged.</p>  <p>  As regards recent and ongoing developments, I was advised of Coillte&rsquo;s disposal of its telecommunications masts and equipment locations in August 2015, and the progress on the development of the Smartply plant in Belview Port, outside Waterford city, which is one of the company&rsquo;s panel board businesses.</p>  <p>  We discussed the implementation of the Government Decision of June 2014 in relation to the formation of a joint venture with Bord na M&oacute;na in four named business areas and I noted the considerable progress achieved to date on the projects involved.</p>  <p>  The CEO also gave me an indication of the company&rsquo;s financial performance in 2015 and advised that a motion in relation to the payment of a final dividend of &euro;1 million would be before the company&rsquo;s AGM scheduled for the following Thursday (26 May 2016). The proposed payment of &euro;1 million was in addition to the interim dividend of &euro;4 million already paid by Coillte to its shareholders in December 2015.  I advised Coillte that I was looking forward to receiving a draft dividend policy from the company in the near future for consideration by my Department, with the assistance of NewERA.  The possible implications of Brexit on the company&rsquo;s trading and finances were also discussed.</p>  <p>  As regards the company&rsquo;s plan for the future, the CEO also gave me an overview of their proposed future strategy for the company to 2025. In this context, the current restructuring of the company, as required under the Government Decision of 2013, was covered. I understand that the restructuring involves the adoption of a decentralised structure with 3 autonomous business divisions and transition to a Lean Centre with the objective of achieving significant overhead cost reductions.</p>  <p>  I found the meeting to be very informative as it added to my understanding of the company&rsquo;s businesses and activities and provided me with an insight as to the proposed strategic development of the company and ongoing challenges.  My Department meet with Coillte on a regular basis as does NewERA on behalf of both Shareholders.  There is no specific schedule for meetings between Coillte and I but I would propose to meet them on a regular basis or as the need arises in relation to specific issues.</p></reply>

The recruitment process, including engagement of a recruitment agency, preparation of the job specification and the ultimate selection of the successful candidate for the position, was accordingly a matter for the company and the Board.</p><p>However, in making their selection, the Board is likely to have had regard to the terms of recent Government Decisions in relation to Coillte and their implementation.  These Decisions required <i>inter alia </i>that Coillte undertake a restructuring of the company and to work with Bord na M&oacute;na towards a partial merger of their businesses, focusing on the areas of overlap between the two companies by way of a joint venture between the two companies to manage their common business activities in biomass, wind energy, shared services, and recreation and tourism.</p><p>With reference to the appointment by Coillte of Mr. Fergal Leamy as its Chief Executive with effect from 13 April, 2015, I note that Coillte considered that the breadth of Mr. Leamy&rsquo;s experience in relevant sectors would be a significant asset to the future development of Coillte and that they regarded that his record of transforming and growing businesses and managing a diverse portfolio of assets as exceptional.</p><p>It should be noted that one of the principal objects of Coillte, as stated in the Forestry Act 1988, is to carry on the business of forestry and related activities on a commercial basis and in accordance with efficient silvicultural practices.  However, in addition to its commercial activities, Coillte also provides a range of recreational opportunities for the general public continuing the long tradition of open access to the State owned forests and land.</p><p>Coillte is cognisant of its role in relation to the provision of public goods. I note, for example, that the Chairman of Coillte, in his Statement in the Coillte Annual Report 2015, referring to the company&rsquo;s financial performance in 2015, advised that a strong financial foundation is vital for the company to achieve their ambitious growth plans for the business as well as continuing to deliver social dividends - notably nature conservation, recreation and carbon sequestration - that have local and global impacts.</p><p>I do not consider that the growth of the company in order to achieve an increased commercial return to the shareholders and State and the continued provision of public goods such as recreational access to be mutually exclusive. I was therefore pleased to note the statement in the recent Annual Report that Coillte will continue to deliver world class environmental and social benefits to the people who enjoy their forests today and for generations to come. </p></reply>

Food Wise includes more than 400 specific recommendations, spread across the cross-cutting themes of sustainability, innovation, human capital, market development and competitiveness; as well as specific sectoral recommendations.</p><p>If these recommendations are implemented, the expert committee which drew up the Food Wise 2025 Strategy believes that the following growth projections are achievable by 2025: increasing the value of agrifood exports by 85% to &euro;19 billion; increasing value added in the sector by 70% to in excess of &euro;13 billion; and increasing the value of primary production by 65% to almost &euro;10 billion. With regard to employment, Food Wise foresees the creation of 23,000 additional jobs in the agrifood sector all along the supply chain from primary production to high value added product development. Realising these growth projections will be challenging, but I am confident that they can be achieved. </p><p>The Government is strongly committed to the implementation of the Food Wise strategy.  I will chair the fifth meeting of the High Level Implementation Committee, including senior officials from relevant Departments and State agencies, next week. </p><p>As a small open economy which exports the vast bulk of its main agricultural commodities, Ireland will always feel the effects of volatility on world markets.  However, there are measures in place to help Irish farmers through these periods.  I believe that moving up the value chain where possible, in terms of the type of products sold and how they are produced, is an important insulation against volatility.  The Food Wise strategy for the sector contains detailed recommendations aimed at improving value added and productivity at farm and food industry level through a focus on sustainability, efficiency, knowledge transfer and innovation.</p><p>Direct payments estimated by Teagasc at an average of over &euro;17,000 per farm in 2015, provide a valuable source of farm income support and act as a hedge against price volatility.</p><p>With regard to farm borrowings, like my predecessor, I will have regular meetings with the CEOs of the main banks, who are all aware of price volatility issues, and are planning accordingly in terms of managing their farm loan books.  My Department has also engaged actively with other financial institutions with regard to the development of innovative new lending products for the sector; and is preparing to procure an ex-ante evaluation for the introduction of Financial Instruments under the Rural Development Programme.</p><p>My Department will continue to engage with the Department of Finance on key agritaxation policy objectives, including responses to income and price volatility.</p><p>While there are no specific risk management tools included in the Rural Development Programme, risk management is one of the topics <font color="#0A0A0A">covered by Knowledge Transfer Groups</font>. An<font color="#0A0A0A">imal disease risks are covered by the Targeted Animal Health and Welfare Advisory measure.</font></p><p>Fixed price contracts are increasingly becoming a feature of the producer/processor relationship in the dairy sector, with numerous milk purchasers offering such contracts, which provide producers with the opportunity to lock in prices over the medium term, taking costs of production into account.  Such relationships are a welcome development in terms of their potential to mitigate volatility. </p></reply>

My understanding is that this is a documentary about the use of different natural resources, including fish stocks, in three different Atlantic Communities in Ireland, Norway and Canada.</p>  <p>  With regard to fish stocks and their use as a natural resource I would make the point that in Ireland, fish quotas are a public resource and are managed directly by the Minister following regular detailed consultation with industry representatives. </p>  <p>  There has been pressure over the years to try and force a privatisation of fish quotas through the imposition of what is known as an Individual Transferable Quota or ITQ system. Ireland has successfully resisted this and I am determined that our fish resources will continue to be managed for the overall public good.</p>  <p>  I would also like to reference the wider world in which we operate, namely the new Common Fisheries Policy (CFP).  This policy provides a framework for the long term sustainability of fish stocks around our shores and the continued economic viability of our fishing fleet and fish processing industry while supporting our families and communities that depend on the sea for their livelihood.</p>  <p>  Among the key elements of the new CFP is the setting of fishing levels on the basis of MSY (Maximum Sustainable Yield). This should lead over time to healthy fish stocks, higher quotas for both Irish and EU fishermen and result in more sustainable fishing patterns.  The CFP specifically calls for the progressive restoration and maintenance of populations of fish stocks above biomass levels capable of producing MSY.  I am committed to the ambitious objective of achieving MSY by 2020 at the latest. In line with the CFP, I consider that for some stocks we will need to phase in delivering MSY if its immediate application seriously jeopardises the social and economic sustainability of the fishing fleet. </p>  <p>  My overarching goal as Minister responsible for our fishing industry is to ensure a sustainable, profitable and self reliant industry that protects and enhances the social and economic fabric of rural coastal communities dependent on the seafood sector.  These objectives must however be balanced with the need to safeguard fish stocks for future generations. This will ensure that families dependent on fishing can look forward to being part of a vibrant, productive and resilient Irish fishing industry and can expect to continue to achieve a reasonable return for their efforts and investment.</p></reply>

The BDGP was launched on 5 May 2015 and forms a part of Ireland&rsquo;s Rural Development Programme that runs from 2014 to 2020.  The programme has funding of &euro;300 million euro over its lifespan and builds on previous investment in suckler farming through schemes such as the nationally funded Beef Data Programme and the Beef Genomics Scheme. It should be remembered that suckler farming is the only sector in the RDP with its own targeted RDP scheme.</p>  <p>  The principal objective of this scheme is to encourage the introduction of higher genetic merit animals into the National beef herd. This will reduce the greenhouse gas intensity of beef production in Ireland by improving production efficiency on suckler farms. My Department received 29,780 applications, having extended the closing date by an additional week to 5 June 2015. </p>  <p>  Approval letters were issued to scheme participants last August. At the same time a detailed ICBF report on all applicants&rsquo; herd profiles was sent. Approximately 4,562 herds have withdrawn from the scheme, though some of these have subsequently asked to re-enter. Withdrawals from a scheme such as this are, of course, not unusual, particularly when one considers the simple application procedure and the high volume of applicants.</p>  <p>  The EU Regulations governing the administration of this programme require that full and comprehensive administrative checks, including in some cases on farm inspections, be completed before any payments issue . In order to be eligible for a payment in respect of the 2015 scheme year, applicants must have submitted at least 60% of the required survey data and completed 9 0% of the required genomic sampling and must also have passed the required administration checks and any on farm inspections . Payments commenced on target in December and currently over 21,500 farmers have been paid a total of &euro;39.2 million. Payments are continuing on an ongoing basis as compliance with the 2015 programme requirements is verified. Officials in my Department are actively engaging with the remaining farmers who have not yet completed the required level of 2015 requirements in order to maximise the programme participation rates.   </p>  <p>  In order to be eligible for payment in 2016 participants must complete the required data notifications, carry out the required genotyping and also participate in the general BDGP Training and complete a carbon navigator with a trained advisor. The 2016 budget for the programme is &euro;52 million. This will provide both for payment of the outstanding 2015 cases and also for payment to those farmers that verify compliance with the 2016 scheme requirements later this year. </p></reply>

The scheme design was agreed in advance with the co-ops and farm organisations here.</p>  <p>  As part of the discussions in the run-up to the March Council of Agriculture Ministers, Ireland proposed a further deferral of the payment to 2017 and 2018, to ease the financial burden on liable farmers in 2016.

While Ireland has again raised the matter with the Commission, we understand that the view of its legal services remains that there is no legal basis for any adjustment to the timelines provided for in the relevant regulations.</p>  <p>  I would like to reassure the Deputy that I am fully aware of the pressures on dairy farmers right now and I am committed to working with all players in the sector to address these issues and ensure that we have a sustainable dairy sector going forward.  As one of the proposers of the Dairy Forum my goal is to ensure that it continues to work constructively as a vehicle for addressing issues of concern to farmers and others in the sector.  The Forum has come forward with some good initiatives for farmers already, including an initiative on improving cash flow planning at farm level, which will be rolled out shortly.  My plan is to convene the forum to examine current market issues with all relevant stakeholders in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

Stock advice is available online in the Shellfish Stocks and Fisheries Review, prepared by the Marine Institute (MI) and an Bord Iascaigh Mhara (BIM).  According to the 2012 Review, some 1,700 boats, approximately three quarters of the Irish fleet, participated in the fishery between April and October 2012 on all Irish coasts.  The most recent stock advice from the Shellfish Stocks and Fisheries Review 2012 noted that the egg production level for the stock is estimated to be below generally accepted limit reference points. A number of conservation measures apply to lobster at present, including:</p>  <p>- The Lobster (Conservation of Stocks) Regulations 2014 (S.I. 591 of 2014) provide legal protection for lobsters v-notched under an incentivised National Lobster V-Notching Programme which provides financial support for fishermen engaged in conservation practice of v-notching live lobsters and returning them to sea to contribute to the reproductive capacity of the stock;   </p>  <p>- A national maximum landing size for lobster of 127mm, which took effect from 1 January 2015 in the aforementioned national regulations ;   </p>  <p>- An increase in grant aid to fishermen for the voluntary v-notching of lobsters from the existing rate of 55% to a new maximum of 75 % of the market price;   </p>  <p>- Transitional arrangements that provide fishermen with grant aid of up to 80 % of the market price for v-notching oversize lobsters and returning them alive to sea during the first two years of the maximum landing size measure;   </p>  <p>- EU regulations prohibiting the landing of lobsters of less than 87mm in carapace length.</p>  <p>  Article 11 of Regulation (EU) No 508/2014 sets out ineligible operations under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) including &ldquo;direct restocking, unless explicitly provided for as a conservation measure by a Union legal act or in the case of experimental restocking&rdquo;   </p>  <p>  The focus of the national management measures has been to improve the management of the fishing activity affecting the stock with the aim of achieving sustainability and taking account of scientific advice; improved management in an extensive fishery such as lobster can have a more significant economic effect compared to other measures.  Preliminary feedback from the changes to the v-notching scheme in particular has been positive and I anticipate that future reviews of this fishery will recommend further options that can be explored in partnership with appropriate stakeholders.</p>  <p>  The National Inshore Fisheries Forum (NIFF) was established specifically to give inshore fishermen a voice in policy making and decisions on inshore fisheries management and to work with the Department and the marine agencies in developing robust, scientifically sound measures to support sustainable fisheries into the future.  I look forward to working with the NIFF on proposals for lobster and other sea-fishing activities that the inshore sector identifies as priorities for both policy development and, where eligible, for appropriate funding under the EMFF Operational Programme.</p></reply>

Following inspection, it was established that 27 of the horses were not identified in accordance with equine identification legislation and the lands on which the horses were kept were not registered as equine premises as required by national legislation.  The equines referred to were seized pursuant to the European Communities (Identification of Equidae) Regulations 2016 (S.I. 62 of 2016), which provides that equines may be seized where an authorised officer had reasonable grounds for believing that an offence was being committed under this legislation.  The horses were transported from Kilkenny city to a secure Pound in accordance with national transport legislation designed to ensure the safe transport of horses.</p><p>Following the presentation of proof of ownership and evidence of equine premises registration, the Department agreed to return the two identified horses to their owners.  On 17 April one of the 2 identified equines gave birth to a foal which subsequently died. On 18 April the mare was euthanised by a veterinary practitioner on welfare grounds due to her deteriorating health<i>.</i>I am satisfied that no action taken by the Department contributed to these events.  Arrangements for the return of the mare to the owner had been in train for some time previously but this was delayed pending the identification of a suitable registered equine premises.  The second identified horse was returned on 25 May to an equine premises registered holding which had recently been nominated by its owner.  The 27 horses that were not identified in accordance with equine identification legislation remain in the care of the state and are subject to ongoing court proceedings.</p><p>As the Deputy is aware, the horse meat issues which were uncovered in 2013 highlighted the importance of the proper identification of equine animals to the protection of the integrity of the food chain.  In this regard, it is essential that equine animals are identified in accordance with legislation in order to ensure that only those animals that are eligible to be slaughtered for human consumption are included in the food chain. In terms of protecting equine health and welfare and the integrity of the food chain information, it is important that all equine owners comply fully with equine identification and equine premises legislation. </p></reply>

When finalised shortly there will be some 6,000 successful applicants under the 2015 National Reserve.  As all of the National Reserve funding has been utilised, there is no funding available to cover the operation of a 2016 National Reserve.</p>  <p>  For 2016 the only source of funding available to the National Reserve will be from &lsquo;clawback&rsquo; on the sale of entitlements without land and indications are that the level of funds that will arise from &lsquo;clawback&rsquo; during the 2016 scheme year will be minimal.  The Regulations also provide that Member States may apply a linear cut to the value of all farmers&rsquo; entitlements in order to provide funding for the National Reserve.</p>  <p>  The operation of a National Reserve for 2016 would require the re-opening of the 2016 Basic Payment Scheme for applications as, under EU Regulation, applicants to the National Reserve must also submit a valid Basic Payment Scheme application for the year in which they submit the National Reserve application.  As the closing date for Basic Payment Scheme applications has now passed, farmers have finalised arrangements regarding the declaration of land for the 2016 scheme year which would have implications for potential National Reserve applicants.  The reopening of Basic Payment Scheme applications at this stage would likely delay the processing of such applications for 2016, with the consequent potential for delay in payments.  Furthermore at this stage many young farmers may have entered arrangements to lease in entitlements in 2016 in order to avail of the Greening payment and Young Farmers&rsquo; Scheme payment.</p>  <p>  From 2017 onwards the National Reserve will be replenished from unused entitlements, as EU Regulations governing the scheme provide that entitlements that are unused for 2 consecutive years are surrendered to the National Reserve.  While I am very supportive of the provision of a National Reserve, decisions in relation to the Reserve for 2017 will be considered once the position on potential funding arising from unused entitlements and &lsquo;clawback&rsquo; has been established.</p></reply>

GLAS is a voluntary scheme under which farmers are compensated for the income forgone and the cost incurred in complying.  The scheme is designed to specifically target environmental priorities.</p><p>Access to the scheme is therefore by means of three Tiers, which will allow the most pressing environmental priorities to be addressed in order of importance, but also provides for a broad approach to delivering environmental benefits across all farming systems.  My Department has generated a profile of each farm in the country identifying the environmental attributes at farm level.</p><p>This structure is designed to ensure the targeted and prioritised delivery of environmental benefits drawing from the extensive preparatory analysis underlying the RDP.</p><p>There is an internal hierarchy within GLAS of &lsquo;Assets over Actions&rsquo;. For example, in the case of Tier 1, expenditure will be targeted at the Priority Environmental Assets (PEAs) first before accepting intake from farmers adopting the Priority Environmental Actions<i>.</i></p><p>In Tier 1, all farmers with PEAs get first priority access to the Scheme in year one and subsequent years. If any of the following PEAs are applicable to the holding, they must be chosen and the relevant actions planned :</p><p>- Farmland Habitat (private Natura sites) </p><p>- Farmland Birds (Twite, Breeding Waders, Chough, Geese/swans, Corncrake, Grey Partridge, Hen Harrier)</p><p>- Commonages</p><p>- High Status Water Area</p><p>- Rare Breeds</p><p>In the absence of any of the listed Priority Environmental Assets, a farmer (whether beef, sheep or dairy) with a whole farm stocking-rate exceeding 140kg Livestock Manure Nitrogen <font color="#FF0000"> </font>per hectare produced on the holding, or any farmer with more than 30 hectare of arable crops, will be considered under Tier 1 if at <i>least one</i>of the following four mandatory actions is adopted: </p><p><i>Mandatory actions for farms with &amp;gt;140 kg Livestock Manure Nitrogen per hectare</i></p><p>- Low Emission Slurry Spreading Or</p><p>- Wild Bird Cover (grassland farms only)</p><p><i>Mandatory actions for farms with &amp;gt;30 ha or arable crops</i></p><p>- Catch Crops Or</p><p>- Minimum Tillage</p><p>Registered Organic farmers will qualify for priority access to the scheme under Tier 1, by selecting actions appropriate to the farm.</p><p>Under Tier 2 farmers, who do not have Priority Environmental Assets but whose lands include a Vulnerable Water Area, may apply for access to the scheme.  In such cases, the appropriate actions relevant to Vulnerable Water Areas must be selected.  In the absence of a Vulnerable Water Area, an applicant may still qualify for Tier 2 access provided that one of the following actions are chosen and planned for:</p><p>- Low Emission Slurry Spreading</p><p>- Minimum Tillage</p><p>- Catch Crops</p><p>- Wild Bird Cover (grassland farms only).</p><p>Tier 3<b></b>provides a mechanism by which farmers can apply to join the scheme by committing to a series of general environmental actions but, as indicated by my predecessor when Tranche 2 of the scheme was launched, applications under this Tier were over-subscribed and farmers had been urged to present the highest standard environmental plans under GLAS 2, and to adopt actions that would promote them from Tier 3 to a higher tier, thereby significantly increasing the chance of selection.  Over 80% of applicants in this second tranche of GLAS opted to do so, and with the funding available were approved.</p><p>The overall target for GLAS is to attract 50,000 farmers into the scheme.  I am pleased to confirm that some 38,000 farmers have been approved into the first two Tranches of GLAS, 26,500 in GLAS 1 and 11,500 in GLAS 2, while ensuring adequate provisions are available for Tranche 3 of the scheme.</p><p>The criteria for selection will be applied to all applications across all farming systems and it is not my intention to seek an amendment of the RDP to prioritise farmers with privately owned hills where no priority environmental asset has been identified.</p></reply>

Irish agriculture is characterised by low levels of insecticide use.  In 2013 a partial ban on neonicotinoid insecticides was introduced in the EU due to concerns about possible impacts on pollinators.  My Department has fully implemented the Commission decision in relation to these compounds.</p>  <p>  Intensive research is ongoing worldwide to quantify impacts of field-level exposure to neonicotinoids and to determine and understand impacts on honeybees, bumblebees and solitary bee species.  The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) is currently undertaking a new assessment of the risks posed by neonicotinoids to take account of all relevant information that has become available since 2013.  This assessment is expected to be completed by the end of January 2017 and will provide the scientific basis for a further Commission proposal expected next year.   </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to evaluate pesticides based on robust scientific evidence, ensuring the availability of products to support sustainable agricultural production and recognising the need to find a sustainable balance between the protection of pollinators and agricultural production. </p>  <p>  With regard to monitoring bee populations, it should be noted there are 98 different species of bees present in Ireland. These comprise of one managed species, the honeybee, and 97 wild species which include 20 species of bumblebees.  The best indicator of changes in the wild bee population is Ireland&rsquo;s Bumble Bee Monitoring Scheme.  Indeed Ireland was the first country in the world to develop a national bumble bee monitoring scheme and a number of other countries have since followed our lead. Since Ireland&rsquo;s Bumble Bee Monitoring Scheme commenced in 2012 the research has identified that there has been no significant decline in bumble bee numbers. </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s National Apiculture Programme is a research programme co-funded by my Department and the European Commission. In recent years it has been lead by researchers based in University of Limerick working in conjunction with Teagasc and NUI Maynooth.  As part of the National Apiculture Programme the State has been monitoring over-winter honeybee colony losses each year since the winter of 2008-2009. Over this period annual Irish overwinter losses have ranged from 13% in some years to as high as 37% in 2012/2013. The Irish weather has a strong influence on colony strength.  The exceptionally wet summer in 2012 followed by the prolonged cold weather in early 2013 which resulted in a very late Spring proved a detrimental combination for Irish bees.  Indeed the impact of the weather that year is supported by the fact that for the preceding and the following year&rsquo;s beekeepers only experienced 13% over-winter losses. </p></reply>

The Roadmap to Ratification, which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website, sets out the substantial legislative agenda required for ratification.  We are on track to ratify the Convention within 6 months.</p><p>Considerable progress has already been made to overcome barriers to Ireland&rsquo;s ratification.  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 was signed into law on 30 December 2015, and is a comprehensive reform of the law on decision-making capacity.  The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill 2015 was passed by the Seanad on 26 January this year.  When enacted, the Bill will reform Section 5 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 to facilitate the full participation in family life of persons with intellectual disabilities and the full expression of their human rights.  Achieving the necessary balance between those rights and ensuring appropriate protection is crucial.<b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p><p>Work is also under way on drawing up an Equality/Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill to progress miscellaneous legislative amendments necessary to proceed to ratification. It is intended that the Bill will address issues such as the Convention's requirements in relation to reasonable accommodation and deprivation of liberty, as well as removing archaic references in existing legislation relating to mental health.  I intend to publish the General Scheme of the Equality/Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill shortly.</p></reply>

In such a scenario the land border will become an external border of the European Union, and the European Union or the United Kingdom could decide that they wished to restore border controls.  Withdrawal from the EU also raises issues in respect of a whole range of police and judicial cooperation EU instruments including the European Arrest Warrant which are vital to cross border security.</p>  <p>  In the event of a vote to leave the Union there will be a period of negotiations to agree the terms of the withdrawal. It is impossible to predict the outcome of these negotiations should they arise.  However it is clear that any changes could potentially have a most serious impact on cross border police cooperation and for the citizens of both countries who have enjoyed free movement since the foundation of the Irish State.  It would be our intention to try and maintain the existing arrangements regarding the Common Travel Area and police and judicial cooperation but this will be dependent on the positions adopted by the UK and the other 26 EU member states.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-06-08a.94.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016060800053#WRC00400"><p>The Deputy will be aware that I recently announced a range of additional measures to tackle organised crime.  These include the drafting of new legislation to further target the proceeds of crime and to strengthen the powers of the Criminal Assets Bureau.  In addition I intend to bring forward proposals to enhance and update the legislative framework for the lawful interception of communications and for covert electronic surveillance, to combat the threats from serious and organised crime and terrorism.</p>  <p>  The Commissioner has also announced the establishment of a special crime Task Force, in cooperation with other agencies including the Revenue Commissioners and Department of Social Protection.  The purpose of the Task Force will be to focus relentlessly on persons involved in gangland activities.</p>  <p>  As the Taoiseach announced, a separate task force will be set up in close consultation with community groups in the north inner city to identify the best means of tackling the various long-term problems to which the Deputy refers, including social exclusion, drugs, education and employment."</p>  <p>  I have consistently made clear that we would fund whatever measures were needed for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to best tackle the critical and unprecedented challenges they currently face.  I was glad to secure substantial additional funding today of &euro;55 million for the remainder of 2016.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that statutory provision in relation to young offenders is set out in the Children Act 2001 (as amended).  Accordingly, where a young person under the age of 18 comes into conflict with the law, the principles of the Act apply.  A key principle in the Children Act relating to young offenders is that detention should be a last resort. In support of this principle, the legislation facilitates the incremental application of a series of measures, ranging from diversion in the first instance through community based sanctions, to detention.</p>  <p>  The operation of the above statutory framework is substantially supported by the significant investment by my Department in community based programmes which are directed at diverting young people from further involvement in criminal or anti-social behaviour.  These youth justice community programmes proceed on the basis of evidence that diversion programmes in the form of high quality preventative intervention can do more to reduce crime than more costly custodial sanctions.  In 2016,  just under &euro;17 million has been allocated by my Department to the Irish Youth Justice Service (IYJS) to administer Garda Youth Diversion Projects (GYDPs), Young Persons Probation Projects (YPPs) and a number of other youth diversion community-based projects.</p>  <p>  The evidence indicates that Diversion Projects are a sound investment.  The GYDPs tackle behaviours such as impulsiveness which are associated with the bulk of youth crime; for example public order offending and minor theft.  The GYDPs have a critical role to play in reducing youth crime.  Their role is to prevent or 'divert' young people from the onset of repeat or serious offending, including potential future involvement in gangland crime, and they do this very effectively and efficiently.  The Annual Reports of the Committee appointed to monitor the effectiveness of the Diversion Programme provide an overview of youth crime in the particular year in question.  As such, the reports include details of, inter alia, the number of incidents and individual children and young people referred to the Diversion Programme and the outcomes of such referrals.  The reports also include details in relation to the resources deployed by the Garda Commissioner to support the operation of the Programme.  Arrangements in relation to the publication of the 2014 Report of the Monitoring Committee are currently being finalised.  In its 2014 Report the Committee reports that 9,991 children and young people were referred to the Diversion Programme.  This compares with 10,420 children and young people referred in 2013 and continues the downward trend in the number of children and young people referred to the Programme in recent years.</p>  <p>  The officials from my Department assigned to the Irish Youth Justice Service (IYJS), in partnership with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, are responsible for the management of the GYDPs and in partnership with the Probation Service in the case of YPPs.  Through quantitative and qualitative analysis each GYDP, in conjunction with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, develops a youth crime profile of the catchment area and of the young people who live there so that services are targeted effectively.  The focussed targeting of young people in this way is complemented by the application of a risk assessment to identify the needs of the young people referred to the projects.  This assists each project to focus on the continued development of targeted evidence based intervention and planning, leading to improved outcomes for the young people coming to the attention of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that five GYDPs and two YPPs operate in the Dublin north inner city area and almost &euro;900,000 is being provided this year to support these important initiatives.  The GYDP projects in the area provided support and services to over 140 young people who were referred in 2015.</p>  <p>  Of course there are very real challenges in confronting violent criminals, but we should not lose sight of the fact that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has in the past successfully faced down criminal gangs who believed they were above the law.  Major investigations are underway in relation to recent shooting incidents, and I have made it clear to the Garda Commissioner that all necessary financial resources will continue to be made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to support them in facing down the threat from criminal gangs.</p></reply>

The purpose of these Protocols is to enhance police cooperation aimed at improving public safety throughout Ireland, disrupting criminal activity and enhancing the policing capability of both police services on the island of Ireland.

I am assured by the Garda Commissioner that the allocation of Garda&iacute; is continually monitored and reviewed taking into account all relevant factors including crime trends, demographics, and security assessments relating to the area in question so as to ensure optimal use is made of Garda human resources.</p><p>The area mentioned by the Deputy is patrolled by members assigned to the Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR) North Central Division.  I have been informed that the number of Garda&iacute; assigned to the DMR North Central Division on the 31 March 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 598.  Of these, 251 members were assigned to Store Street, 161 in Bridewell and 186 in Mountjoy.  The reduction in numbers cited by the Deputy relates to the period since September 2009 at which time 730 members were assigned to the Division concerned.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, when the financial crisis hit, the Government of the time introduced a moratorium on recruitment and the four year National Recovery Plan, published in 2010, envisaged a steady reduction in Garda numbers.  Thankfully, in a recovering economy, we were able to reopen the Garda College in September 2014, and a total of 700 Garda trainees have been recruited with a further 450 planned to be recruited during the remainder of this year.  So far 463 of the new Garda trainees have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream uniform duties nationwide.  Another 76 will attest on the 7 July with 150 more to attest in November.  I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that 38 newly attested Garda&iacute; have been assigned to the DMR North Central Garda Division to date.</p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  Key to achieving this goal is the commitment in the Programme for Government, &quot;A Programme for a Partnership Government&quot; to continue the ongoing accelerated Garda recruitment programme with a view to increasing Garda numbers to 15,000.  Taking account of projected retirements, the current rate of recruitment will bring Garda numbers to around the 13,000 mark this year.  We must, I believe, endeavour to make more rapid progress than this to reach our target of 15,000 and I am engaging with my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, in relation to increasing the planned annual intake this year and in coming years<b><font color="#000080">.</font></b></p><p>In relation to DMR North Central it is important to note that the work of local Garda&iacute; is augmented when necessary by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation (NBCI), the Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB) and the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB).  In addition, at the request of the Commissioner earlier this year, the Government moved decisively to strengthen Garda resources to deal with gang-related crime in the Dublin area.  Funding was approved for the establishment of a dedicated Armed Support Unit for the Dublin Metropolitan Region given the identified need to enhance armed support capability in Dublin and to free up the resources of the Emergency Response Unit.  The Dublin Armed Support Unit is, as a matter of priority, in the process of being set up and trained and I understand that it will have a complement of some fifty-five Garda members.  Steps are also being taken to ensure that the Unit is fully equipped and to upgrade the equipment available to the Emergency Response Unit and the Special Detective Unit.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, after discussions with my Government colleagues, on Tuesday 31 May I announced a range of additional measures to tackle organised crime including the strengthening of the powers of the Criminal Assets Bureau, new legislation to target proceeds of crime and the setting up of a new Special Crime Taskforce that will focus relentlessly on persons involved in gangland activities.  I am also meeting with counterparts from Belgium, the Netherlands and Spain this week to discuss the transnational dimension to this organised criminal activity.</p><p>The Government has consistently made clear that we would fund whatever measures were needed for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to best tackle the critical and unprecedented challenges they currently face.  In this regard I was pleased to announce today that I have secured Government approval for substantial additional funding to be provided to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  An additional allocation of &euro;55 million will be made available for the remainder of 2016 including &euro;5 million previously announced in February.  These additional monies are made available based on information from Garda management regarding the level of funding required to maintain the necessary policing response to the current situation on an ongoing basis including concentrated policing targeting gang related crime.</p></reply>

The application fee, stipulated at &euro;175, is payable on application for a certificate of naturalisation and a certification fee is payable on the issue of a certificate of naturalisation.  The standard certification fee is set at &euro;950, while a reduced fee of &euro;200 applies in the case of an application made on behalf of a minor or in certain cases where the application is made by a widow, widower or surviving civil partner of an Irish citizen.  In the case of recognised refugees and stateless persons the certification fee is nil.</p>  <p>  The standard fees payable by an applicant are designed to reflect the effort and cost involved in processing applications for a certificate of naturalisation.

As outlined in my response to Parliamentary Question Number 54 of 26 May 2016 every effort is made to source interpreters when required by the courts.  However, this cannot always be guaranteed as sign language interpreting and, in particular, Irish sign language interpreting is a very specialised skill.  Despite the best efforts of Courts Service staff, an interpreter may not always be available at short notice and, in these instances, a case is generally put back to a later date to allow more time to arrange a sign language interpreter.</p><p>As the Deputy will also be aware, my Department is currently progressing a three-phase consultation process with a view to developing a new Disability Inclusion Strategy.  Phase 2, which focused on agreeing high-level objectives for the Strategy, was completed at the end of 2015.  Phase 3 will involve agreeing specific actions with timescales to deliver on each of the high-level objectives.  This will commence shortly and I expect to have a set of draft actions for the Strategy for publication shortly.  The consultations on this draft will include consideration by the National Disability Strategy Steering Group and, as with Phase 2, a series of regional consultation meetings.  The Strategy will then be revised as necessary and submitted to Government for final approval.</p><p>  Issues in relation to the Deaf Community have featured strongly in the consultation process to date and I intend that the new Disability Inclusion Strategy will respond credibly to the issues raised, including making a real difference in relation to facilitating the use of Irish Sign Language and ensuring that public bodies provide Irish Sign Language users with Irish Sign Language interpretation when availing of their statutory services.</p></reply>

There are very practical advantages to having such expertise located in one dedicated unit with the requisite authority to act on a national basis, particularly in a relatively small jurisdiction such as ours.</p>  <p>  To achieve nationwide coverage, the Criminal Assets Bureau has for some considerable time maintained a presence in each of the Garda Divisions through the operation of the Divisional Assets Profiler Programme.</p>  <p>  Under this Programme asset profilers are providing a criminal asset profiling service across the Garda Divisions in relation to persons or suspects operating within the area, with particular reference to those involved in serious and organised crime.  The Bureau utilises the local knowledge supplied to it by the asset profilers which allows the Bureau to target the proceeds of crime in local communities.  They also assist the Bureau with preparatory groundwork in advance of a full investigation and have recourse to the expertise and advice of the Bureau.</p>  <p>  As at end April 2016 the number of trained Garda Asset Profilers is 200 plus 15 Revenue Customs and 3 Social Protection trained asset profilers making a total of 218 operating throughout the country.</p></reply>

The Joint Irish Prison Service and Probation Service Strategy, 2015-2017 sets out how the two services will work together with their statutory, voluntary and community sector partners to provide a multi-agency approach to offender management and rehabilitation from pre- to post-imprisonment.</p>  <p>  Insofar as young adult offenders are concerned, the Probation Service has adopted a holistic response to a number of categories of young adult offenders, working closely with the Irish Prison Service. This includes some offenders aged up to and including 21 years who are subject to Probation Service supervision. </p>  <p>  In working with these young adults the Probation Service:-</p>  <p>  1.  Completes pre-sanction reports to the Courts to assess the level of risk and need of offenders;</p>  <p>  2.  Provides probation supervision in the community to offenders to reduce their level of offending behaviour;</p>  <p>  3.  Funds, and works closely with, a variety of Community Based Organisations to address offenders' criminogenic factors to reduce offending behaviour.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may also be familiar with the Report of the Penal Policy Review Group which was published in September 2014.  The Review Group conducted a wide ranging strategic review of penal policy taking into account relevant work already completed in the jurisdiction and elsewhere, the rights of those convicted of crimes and the perspective of those who are victims of crime and the interests of society in general.  </p>  <p>  The Review Group&rsquo;s Report contains 43 recommendations, one of which is that a programme similar to the Youth Diversion Programme be introduced for young people above the age of 18 years with an initial focus on 18 to 21 year olds.  In this regard, the Review Group recommended that the relevant Departments and agencies, including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, should immediately consult in relation to the most appropriate and effective means of targeting this group within the context of current and future resources.  The Irish Youth Justice Service is currently engaged with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to the recommendation having regard to the experience of the existing Diversion Programme for persons under eighteen years of age.  The Deputy might wish to note that the existing Diversion Programme is currently the subject of a comprehensive review by a group established by the Garda Commissioner.  The outcome of this review will assist the Irish Youth Justice Service with its detailed consideration of the Penal Policy Review Group's recommendation.</p>  <p>  I can also inform the Deputy that I have established a Penal Policy Implementation Oversight Group charged with overseeing work on the Penal Review Group recommendations, including the above. The Group is chaired by Dr. Mary Rogan, Associate Professor, School of Law, Trinity College who was a member of the Review Group.  I expect to receive a report from this group shortly setting out the state of implementation, which I intend to publish, and will take stock at that point of the progress being made in examining all of the recommendations made by the Penal Policy Review Group.</p></reply>

These programmes offer purposeful activity to those in custody while serving their sentences and encouraging them to lead law abiding lives on release.  These programmes are available in all prisons and all persons in custody are eligible to use the services. Each prison also has fully equipped gymnasium that prisoners access on a structured basis. </p><p>In addition a total of 24 dedicated Integrated Sentence Management Coordinators are operational in all prisons and open centres since March 2015.  The allocation of dedicated staff in each establishment greatly enhances the effectiveness of the sentence management system and facilitates the growing numbers of prisoners participating in the process.  A review of the Integrated Sentence Management process is currently underway.</p><p>The Department of Education and Skills provides an allocation of 220 whole time teacher equivalents in partnership with the Irish Prison Service through the Education and Training Boards (ETB). The focus is on providing education which is quality assured, student centred and facilitates lifelong learning through helping those in custody to cope with their sentence, achieve personal development and prepare for life after release. A broad and flexible curriculum is provided which ranges from basic literacy classes and peer led tutoring to Open University. There is an increasing focus on QQI (formerly FETAC) accreditation as the modular structure is suitable to the needs of students in prison.</p><p>The Irish Prison Service has also been expanding the number of accredited courses and opportunities available to prisoners in Work Training in recent years. Enhanced partnership arrangements with accrediting bodies such as City and Guilds, the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA), and the Guild of Launders and Cleaners and the centralising of coordination and quality assurance arrangements have enabled the Irish Prison Service to extend the number of available courses and activities with certification.</p><p>The guiding principles which underpin the prisons' work and training service are to make available work, work-training and other purposeful activities to those in custody.  Training activities are chosen to give as much variety as possible and also to give opportunities for those in prison to acquire practical accredited skills which will help them secure employment on release.</p><p>With regard to prisoner accommodation I am advised by the Irish Prison Service that as of the 12<sup>th</sup>February 2016, 98% of all prisoners have 24-hour access to toilet facilities. The number slopping out has decreased from 1,003 at the end of 2010 to just 56 on 7 April 2016, (Limerick 32 and Portlaoise 24).</p><p>I am advised by the Irish Prison Service that construction of a new wing at Limerick prison is planned to commence in the first quarter of next year. The Irish Prison Service has also recently finalised a business case for the construction of a replacement for the E-Block at Portlaoise prison. Subject to the necessary approvals and the availability of finance it is hoped to commence construction works there in mid-2017. When these developments are complete the practice of slopping out will have been completely eradicated from all of the prison estate.</p><p>I am further advised that the Irish Prison Service has included a specific strategic action which is exclusively aimed at prisoner support in its' Strategic Plan for 2016-2018, which I will be publishing later this month.</p></reply>

However, the Irish Prison Service Recidivism study for 2009 shows that 2,304 persons out of a total of 7,509 that were released in that year went on to re-offend within the first 6 months of release. As well as offences committed after expiration of sentence,<b></b>this figure also includes offences committed before their official release date and this would take account of crimes committed while on early release, day release, and compassionate release. It also includes offences committed while in custody such as assaults and possession of mobile phones.</p><p>These figures were produced in partnership with the Central Statistics Office using a combination of Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Irish Prison Service records, based on the Irish Crime Classification System (ICCS). The study, which was published in December 2015, looked at the available data up to the end of 2012 to take account of the time to make a conviction and a broader 3 year analysis of recidivism.</p><p>In the joint Probation Service/Irish Prison Service Women's Strategy 2014 - 2016, An Effective Response to Women Who Offend, published in 2014, the Irish Prison Service made a commitment to explore the development of an open centre/open conditions for women assessed as low risk of re-offending.</p><p>This commitment was acknowledged in the Report on the Strategic Review of Penal Policy who also recommended that a greater focus on step down facilities, supported accommodation, use of more community based open conditions for female offenders and the provision of an open centre for women.  </p><p>A joint Irish Prison Service/Probation Service working group considered an open centre for women and decided to recommend, rather than developing an open centre for women, that a more practical and cost effective way to address the deficit is to pursue step down facilities for women.</p><p>In this regard, I have given approval to the Heads of the Irish Prison Service and Probation Service to proceed to scope the possibilities for the development of step down units for female offenders and female ex-offenders.</p></reply>

To obtain a Primary Medical Certificate, an applicant must be permanently and severely disabled within the terms of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994 and satisfy one of the following conditions:</p><p>-  be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs;</p><p>-  be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs;</p><p>-  be without both hands or without both arms;</p><p>-  be without one or both legs;</p><p>-  be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg;</p><p>-  have the medical condition of dwarfism and have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs. </p><p>The Senior Medical Officer for the relevant local Health Service Executive administrative area makes a professional clinical determination as to whether an individual applicant satisfies the medical criteria. A successful applicant is provided with a Primary Medical Certificate, which is required under the Regulations to claim the reliefs provided for in the Regulations. An unsuccessful applicant can appeal the decision of the Senior Medical Officer to the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal, which makes a new clinical determination in respect of the individual. The Regulations mandate that the Medical Board of Appeal is independent in the exercise of its functions to ensure the integrity of its clinical determinations. After six months a citizen can reapply if there is a deterioration in their condition. </p><p>The six qualifying criteria are necessarily precise and specific to this Scheme. </p><p>The Scheme represents a significant tax expenditure. Between the Vehicle Registration Tax and VAT foregone, and the repayment of excise on fuel used by members of the Scheme, the Scheme represented a cost of &euro;50.3 million to the Exchequer in 2015, an increase from &euro;48.6 million in 2014. These figures do not include the revenue foregone to the Local Government Fund in the respect of the relief from Motor Tax provided to members of the Scheme.  </p><p>Given the scale and scope of the Scheme, I have no plans to expand the medical criteria beyond the six currently provided for in the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994.</p></reply>

The zero rate of VAT cannot be applied to any goods or services unless the zero rate applied to those goods and services on and from 1 January 1991.  </p></reply>

Its goal is to increase the provision of funding to SMEs at a lower cost and on more flexible terms than has been available in recent times in the Irish Market. The SBCI channels its funds through lending partners known as on-lenders. The SBCI currently has three bank and three non-bank on-lending partners. </p><p>The SBCI publishes results biannually. To the end of December 2015, The SBCI has lent just under &euro;172 million to circa 4,600 SMEs.

As the proposal is aimed at targeting the affordability of homes from the position of the purchasers, I do not believe such a VAT amendment would be of assistance.  As an alternative, and as I stated at the Oireachtas Committee on Housing recently, I have asked my Department to examine an approach through the income tax system, perhaps similar to the Home Renovation Incentive, in which relief could be provided to home purchasers.  </p>  <p>  It should also be noted that section 266A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides for refunds of deposit interest retention tax (DIRT) to first-time buyers who purchase or self-build a property for occupation as their home. The property must be purchased or self-built between 14 October 2014 and 31 December 2017. A first-time buyer who has either individually or jointly with any other person previously purchased or built a property is not eligible for a DIRT refund. The amount of the refund is capped at the DIRT paid on savings of up to a maximum of 20% of the purchase price or, in the case of a self-built property, up to 20% of the market value of the completed property. </p></reply>

However, the cost of the claims for tax relief on health expenses, which includes medical and dental expenses, in 2014 (the most recent tax year for which data are currently available), is estimated to be in the order of &euro;146 million. Figures in relation to previous tax years are available on the Revenue Commissioners' statistics webpage at  www.revenue.ie/en/about/statistics/index.html. This information can be found under the heading Cost of Tax Expenditures (Credits, Allowances and Reliefs), at www.revenue.ie/en/about/statistics/costs-expenditures.html. Updates will be published on Commissioners' website in due course.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, routine dental treatment such as the extraction, scaling and filling of teeth and the provision and repairing of artificial teeth or dentures is currently excluded from the relief. As a result, information on expenses in relation to routine dental treatment is not required to be returned to Revenue. As Revenue have no data on the treatment cost or potential number of claims it is not possible to provide the estimated cost the Deputy requested.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may however be aware that the State already provides some support to those who require dental treatment through the schemes detailed below:</p>  <p>  (i) Treatment Benefits from the Department of Social Protection. It is my understanding that this scheme is available to insured workers and retired people who have the required number of PRSI contributions. The benefit under this scheme provides for an oral examination for a qualifying individual once per calendar year.</p>  <p>  (ii) The Dental Treatment Services Scheme (DTSS) provides access to dental treatment for adult medical card holders (over 16 years of age). A free oral examination every calendar year and free emergency dental treatment for relief of pain and sepsis are available to all eligible patients. This includes 2 fillings per annum and all extractions. </p>  <p>  The DTSS provides treatment for periodontal/gum disease in cases where care is especially warranted. This includes clients who are pregnant, have diabetes or immuno-compromising conditions, or require relevant surgical procedures such as cardiac surgery and joint replacements. Approval for periodontal treatment may be given by the local Principal Dental Surgeon for these and other high risk or special needs groups.</p>  <p>  Further information in relation to these two schemes is available from my colleagues, the Minister for Social Protection and the Minister for Health respectively. </p>  <p>  The restriction of the Treatment Benefit scheme as it relates to dental treatment in 2010 was expected to lead to savings of &euro;37.5 million. To provide tax relief for routine dental treatment would serve to negate some of the savings achieved from that policy change. Given the existing supports available, particularly for those on low incomes through their access via the medical card, I am not predisposed to expanding the tax relief available for health expenses to include expenses associated with routine dental treatment. However, I will have the Deputy's suggestion examined and will consider it as part of my deliberations for the next Budget.</p></reply>

In this paper the Bank outlined that these include higher costs from credit losses; higher funding costs; higher levels of capital resulting from regulatory changes; higher required capital per euro of risk given the severe loss experience in the crisis; higher operating cost per euro of loans given falling balance sheets and the fixed cost base that comes with the infrastructure requirements of large retail banks.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank has informed me that it does require that all mortgages are advertised and sold in accordance with the requirements of financial services legislation (including Central Bank Codes), and that consumers who choose a given mortgage product (or to switch to a new product) are treated in accordance with these requirements in the context of the product they have chosen. The related Central Bank work is evidenced most recently by the commencement of its examination of tracker related issues.</p>  <p>  I have been advised by the Central Bank that it is also currently in the final stages of considering responses to a public consultation on a number of measures to increase the level of transparency of variable rate mortgages of the nature referenced in the question and, thereby, facilitating consumer choices (see "Protections for Variable Rate Mortgage Holders" (CP98) which is available at: www.centralbank.ie/regulation/poldocs/consultation-papers/Documents/CP98/CP98%20Consultation%20on%20Increased%20Protections%20for%20Variable%20Rate%20Mortgage%20Holders.pdf).</p>  <p>  Finally, the Central Bank has carried out research, which showed the scope for borrowers to save money by switching mortgages and the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission has launched a mortgage switching tool for consumers to compare rates charged across institutions.  The Central Bank has advised that it plans further research on switching in 2016.</p>  <p>  In the present environment, where we are seeing lenders reduce rates and introduce offers specifically targeted at the switcher market, I have encouraged borrowers to contact their bank to see what is available to them in their circumstances or consider moving to another bank, where possible, if the offer is not satisfactory. </p></reply>

These changes included an increase in the amount that can be raised by a company in a 12 month period from &euro;2.5 million to &euro;5 million and an increase in the lifetime limit per company from &euro;10 million to &euro;15 million. The EII is generally available to all micro, small and medium-sized companies. The maximum relief available to an investor is 40% (the top rate of income tax) of the amount invested, subject to a maximum investment amount of &euro;150,000 per annum per investor.</p>  <p>  In contrast, the UK Seed Enterprise Scheme (SEIS) is targeted specifically at Start-Ups and permits a company to raise a maximum of &pound;150,000 in total. While an investor can claim tax relief at a rate of 50% on their investment, the maximum investment permitted per annum is &pound;100,000. Relief from CGT on any increase in the value of the shares is also provided in certain circumstances.</p>  <p>  Recent statistics provided to me by the Revenue Commissioners indicate that the level of investments made under EII has increased significantly in recent years. In 2015, companies raised over &euro;80 million through EII and more than three quarters of that funding was raised by micro-enterprises. The overall level of funding raised increased by almost 30% in a single year. Therefore, I am not convinced that the provision of additional incentives would be appropriate at the current time. My officials will however, analyse the level of job creation among firms availing of EII in advance of Budget 2017. Should any change be warranted, it will be considered as part of my preparations for the Budget and the Finance Bill.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may also be aware that as part of Budget 2016, I announced the introduction of a revised CGT entrepreneur relief, which allows for a reduced 20% rate of CGT to be paid on the disposal of qualifying business assets up to a lifetime limit of &euro;1 million of qualifying gains with effect from 1 January 2016.

Ongoing contributions to Revenue- approved pension schemes and personal pension plans are exempt from income tax (within limits) while the investment growth of such schemes and plans are also tax exempt. Retirement benefits are taxable at drawdown at normal retirement age with the exception of the permissible tax-free retirement lump sum.  </p>  <p>  These concessionary tax treatments are not available to other savings arrangements. This is because pre-retirement access to the benefits from pension schemes or plans is generally not permitted, as these arrangements (and the associated tax reliefs on contributions and pension fund growth) are designed to facilitate long term savings based on the principle that the benefits will be locked away to help fund an adequate income in retirement. </p>  <p>  The point at which pension savings can be accessed varies according to the type of savings vehicle and, in the case of occupational schemes, the schemes particular rules. It may be worth noting, however, that in many cases it is possible to access pension savings before the age of 65 and in some cases they can in fact be accessed from age 50. It can also be possible to access savings early on grounds of ill health. I do not currently have any plans to extend the range of circumstances in which pension savings can be accessed early.</p></reply>

Over the past 15 years, Ireland has increased its engagement with Asia, and particularly China, the world's second largest economy, in a broad number of areas.  Bilateral trade has grown in significance and, in 2014, Ireland's total trade with China was worth over &euro;8 billion. Ireland's priorities relate to bilateral trade and investment, particularly: higher education; agrifood; tourism; and aviation-financing sectors.</p>  <p>   While there was extensive cross-departmental discussion between the Departments of Finance and Foreign Affairs and Trade regarding Ireland's interest in the AIIB, no external advisers were involved, consulted or paid.</p>  <p>  As the process of Ireland's application for membership is still ongoing, Ireland's potential share and voting rights in the AIIB remain subject to future negotiations with the Bank following consideration between the existing founding members of the AIIB and the AIIB itself.  This is also the case for other applicant countries.  The potential share and voting rights which emerge out of the engagement with the AIIB will be subject to subsequent consideration by the Government.</p>  <p>  Nevertheless, based on an assumption about the level and cost of a shareholding that might apply in Ireland's case, a provisional, initial calculation has been undertaken which estimates that Ireland's membership of the AIIB could result in a charge of some &euro;50m on the Exchequer based on projected annual payments of &euro;10m per annum for five years.  This estimate is based on an assumption that the shareholding costs would be calculated on the same basis as our IMF shareholding and it would be comparable to countries with a similar-sized economy.</p></reply>

The Directive also gave a discretion to Member States to further regulate foreign currency mortgage loans, but the general view arising from the consultation process was that no further regulation of such loans should be made at this time and, therefore, I decided not to avail of that discretion when transposing Regulations.  However, that will not preclude the adoption of such further regulatory measures on foreign currency mortgages at a future point if considered appropriate, provided that it would be consistent with the provisions of the Mortgage Credit Directive and EU law more generally.</p><p>It is accepted that these new provisions will impose some additional regulatory requirements on Irish banks who provide foreign currency mortgage loans, but this will also need to be considered against the additional protections which will now apply to consumers who enter into such agreements.  While it is a commercial matter for individual lenders to decide on the type and nature of credit it wishes to offer to consumers in general or in any individual case, I would nevertheless expect that lenders should be in a position to adjust their systems and practices to take on board evolving legal and regulatory developments in the mortgage area, including those as set out in the Mortgage Credit Directive, which have a primary objective of increasing the protections available to consumer mortgage borrowers.</p></reply>

It uses a network of lending partners known as 'on lenders' to make its funds available to eligible businesses. The SBCI commenced lending via its initial on lending partners in March 2015.  To the end of December 2015, in the first 10 months of its operation, the SBCI has ensured that almost &euro;172 million has been lent to c. 4,600 SMEs with broad coverage across various business sectors and in all regions of the country.</p>  <p>  The current on lending partners of the SBCI are: AIB, Bank of Ireland, Ulster Bank, Finance Ireland, First Citizen and Merrion Fleet Management. In the first instance, SMEs apply to one of these six on lenders who carry out a credit approval assessment on the loan applications. Where a loan application does not meet the credit underwriting requirements of the on lender, the SBCI is not advised of the application or its outcome. Consequently, it is therefore not possible to report on applications refused at this point in the process.</p>  <p>  If a loan application meets the on lender's credit underwriting requirements it will also be assessed, by the on lender, to examine whether or not it meets the SBCI's eligibility requirements.</p>  <p>   The three main criteria for SBCI eligibility are:</p>  <p>  1.  That the activity of the borrower is eligible for SBCI funding</p>  <p>  2.  That the borrower is an eligible SME under the EU definition of an SME</p>  <p>  3.  That the borrower is eligible under EU State Aid rules</p>  <p>  If the on lender considers that the application meets the above eligibility requirements it is submitted to the SBCI. The SBCI will then review the application to ensure that its eligibility criteria are met.  In a small number of cases, the SBCI has refused applications on eligibility grounds. To the end of May 2016, the SBCI has refused a total of 23 applications submitted to it by on lenders. These refusals were for various eligibility reasons and represent c.0.3% of the total applications received by the SBCI since its inception.  As the number of refusals is low, it is not possible to provide a regional breakdown as to do so may potentially identify the SMEs involved.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that, even where a borrower does not meet the SBCI's criteria, it is open to the on lender to provide the loan using its usual funding sources.</p></reply>

Where a credit union wishes to provide services to its members, in addition to the services that are provided for under the 1997 Act, an application may be made to the Central Bank for approval to provide such additional services in accordance with the provisions set out in sections 48 to 51 of the 1997 Act.</p>  <p>  Both this Government and the Central Bank are supportive of credit unions developing additional services. The Central Bank informs me that is open to working with credit unions to ensure that prudent and appropriate development of the business model can be facilitated within the regulatory framework. The development of debit card services is a matter for the Registry of Credit Unions and applications for such a service must be approved by the Central Bank.</p>  <p>  I have further been informed by the Central Bank that it has been clear in its engagement with credit unions and other stakeholders seeking to offer debit cards, that this service must be supported by the appropriate payment account service. Consequently, a full payment account service has recently been developed by the Registry of Credit Unions to allow eligible credit unions to offer these accounts and associated payment instruments such as debit cards. The service is subject to formal application and approval as an additional service under sections 48 to 51 of the 1997 Act.

The Directive was proposed by the European Commission in January 2016 and includes six significant corporate tax anti-avoidance measures.  Three of the measures derive from the non-binding elements of the OECD BEPS process, with the remaining three measures coming from the European Commission's previous Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCCTB) Directive.</p>  <p>  Ireland has been at the forefront of BEPS implementation and I have been very clear that I support the intention of this proposed Directive to tackle base erosion and profit shifting.  Ireland has engaged constructively in the negotiation of the Directive, while seeking to protect Ireland's long-term interests in key areas.  At the May ECOFIN meeting, while stating my support for the Directive, along with a number of other Ministers, I highlighted that further work was needed before it could be agreed.  My officials and I will continue to engage with the Presidency, the Commission and other Member States to try and reach an agreement which is acceptable to all Member States and ambitious in targeting base erosion and profit shifting.</p>  <p>  The OECD carried out a significant volume of public consultation on the BEPS reports and a large number of Irish stakeholders engaged in this processes.  My Department also carried out a public consultation on the potential Irish impact of the BEPS proposals during 2014. The Revenue Commissioners are closely involved in this work at every stage to provide expert technical input.  My Department also engages widely with a range of stakeholders on an ongoing basis on international tax issues.</p></reply>

The reality is that dealing comprehensively with this issue will only take place as part of a more general programme to address the major housing and homelessness issue, and the new Government has appointed a specific Minister for Housing with a commitment to develop an Action Plan for Housing within 100 days. The D&aacute;il has also established a Committee on Housing and Homelessness to review the implications of these problems and to make recommendations in that regard.  My Department has made a submission to this Committee specifically in relation to the issue of Student Accommodation.</p><p>In relation to student accommodation, the report, Student Accommodation: Demand &amp;amp; Supply, which was published last year by the Minister for Education and Skills sets out clearly that the demand for student accommodation outstrips supply in certain areas and will continue to do so in the coming years.</p><p>The full report can be accessed at <i>f</i></p><p>There are 13 useful recommendations in this report some of which include capital financing, tax considerations and planning issues, as well as support for the rent-a-room scheme.  Specifically in relation to Taxation, one of the recommendations contained in the Report is that consideration should be given to tax measures to develop on-campus accommodation for HEIs.</p><p>The previous Minister for Education and Skills introduced two immediate actions to begin this work.</p><p>Firstly, funding was provided by the HEA to the Union of Students' (USI) in Ireland to progress short-term solutions for students in need of accommodation.  This funding will allow USI to develop their homes.usi.ie website, to communicate more effectively to student and homeowners, and to carry out research into this important issue.</p><p>Secondly, the establishment of an inter-departmental steering group to examine the recommendations contained in the HEA Report and to provide a coordinating mechanism to ensure that the higher education institutions have access to information on new potential funding and delivery models.</p><p>In addition to this, I should point out that a number of our Higher Education Institutions have Student Accommodation projects ongoing, or in the pipeline, with a number of additional on-campus Student Accommodation bed-spaces to come online from September 2016.  Maynooth University have 296 new on-campus bed spaces, and UCD have 350 new on-campus bed spaces, which are due to come on stream in Autumn 2016.</p><p>In addition to this six other Higher Education Institutions are currently engaged in, or going through the planning phases for student accommodation projects, namely National University of Ireland Galway, Trinity College Dublin, University of Limerick, Dublin City University, University College Cork and Dublin Institute of Technology.</p><p>Finally, my Department is also examining other potential options for funding projects in conjunction with relevant stakeholders.</p></reply>

These changes were incorporated into the Teaching Council's Policy Paper on the Continuum of Teacher Education, which set the criteria for providers of initial teacher education.</p>  <p>  A revision to the registration regulations was required to provide for the recognition of graduates of the 59 reconceptualised programmes of initial teacher education which are accredited by the Council as qualifying persons to teach in Ireland. Following significant stakeholder engagement, revised regulations were drawn up by the Teaching Council.</p>  <p>  The revised regulations also give effect to changes made in the Teaching Council (Amendment) Act 2015, such as the placing of the garda vetting of new teachers on a statutory footing. They provide for persons currently registered with the Council under Regulation 3 on the basis of holding a level 8 Montessori qualification and allow for the registration of persons who obtain a level 8 Montessori qualification, where the course is commenced on or before 1 October 2016 and the qualification is obtained before the end of 2021.</p>  <p>  The regulations were recently provided to my Department for my consent and approval.</p>  <p>  The Deputy should note that my Department has no plans to change the current position whereby teachers who are registered with a level 8 Montessori qualification under Regulation 3 (or its equivalent in the new regulations) who are eligible for employment as teachers of pupils with special education needs in recognised mainstream primary schools and special schools.</p>  <p>  The Deputy refers also to the Supplementary Special National Panel. The position is that, since the end of the 2012/13 school year, this Panel is being phased out and no new applications are being accepted. This decision by my Department reflects the wider availability of primary teachers who are qualified to work in all settings, which was not the case when this panel was originally set up.</p>  <p>  I note also the reference to probation and Droichead. Since 2012, the Teaching Council has responsibility for determining policy, procedures and criteria for the induction and probation of newly qualified teachers. Droichead which is the enhanced model of induction for Newly Qualified Teachers (NQTs) developed by the Council is being phased in at present and will be the only recognised route of induction for all new teachers from September 2018. In the meantime, NQTs in mainstream settings may complete probation through external evaluation conducted by my Department's inspectors. However, completion of the induction/probation process in special education settings can only be achieved through the Droichead process.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-06-08a.329.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016060800058#WRH01000"><p>Recent years have seen an increase in the number of SNAs from 10,575 posts in 2011, to 12,040 to June 2016. In the same period the number of children accessing SNA support has grown from approximately 22,000 to some 30,000 by the end of 2015.</p>  <p>  The increase in SNA numbers has been supported by a very significant increase in the Budget for SNAs, rising from &euro;332 million in 2011 to &euro;402 million by the end of 2015.</p>  <p>  This is a higher level of Special Needs Assistant (SNA) support than ever before, which ensures that children with special educational needs can continue to participate in education and be supported in a manner appropriate to their needs.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), is responsible for allocating a quantum of Special Needs Assistant (SNA) support for each school annually taking into account the assessed care needs of children qualifying for SNA support enrolled in the school. Where children have significant care needs whereby they may need additional support to be able to attend school, the NCSE may make an allocation of SNA support to the school to assist that child.</p>  <p>  The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support, which is set out in my Department's Circular 0030/2014.</p>  <p>  In accordance with Circular 0030/14, SNAs are provided specifically to assist schools to cater for pupils with disabilities, who have additional and significant care needs, in an educational context and where the nature of these care needs have been outlined in medical and other professional reports as being so significant that a pupil will require additional adult assistance in order to be able to attend school and to participate in education.</p>  <p>  While consideration of professional reports is an integral part of determining the extent of supports to be provided for pupils with special educational needs, responsibility for deciding on the quantum of educational supports and resources to be allocated to schools to support individual pupils, rests with the NCSE.</p>  <p>  For a child to require or qualify for access to SNA support, a child must have an assessed disability. The care needs outlined must be of such significance that they are beyond that which would normally be expected to be provided to a child by the child's class teacher, support teacher, or other school teachers, or beyond the level of assistance which could be offered to the student by his/ or her fellow pupils in school. The care needs must also be those beyond which could normally be provided for by alternative supportive approaches or modifications of the classroom environment, teaching approaches and/or assistive technology or specialist equipment.</p>  <p>  The type of significant care needs that pupils may have can be varied, depending on the nature or level of the disability or sensory impairment that a child may have. Given the variety of medical conditions that children may suffer from, it is not possible to list all of the care needs that may arise. However, Circular 0030/14 outlines the primary care needs which would be considered significant &ndash; and which might require SNA support.</p></reply>

This resource was allocated in accordance with pupil enrolment. 42% of second-level schools at the time were allocated at least 22 hours per week in respect of guidance (22 hours being the equivalent of one teaching post) while the remainder of the schools were allocated between 8 and 17 hours of guidance per week.</p><p>Since September 2012 at post primary level guidance provision is now being organised by school management from within the staffing schedule allocation. Guidance is a whole school activity and schools have autonomy on how best to prioritise their available resources to meet the requirements in relation to guidance and the provision of an appropriate range of subjects to students. This operates at local school level.</p><p>The current budget provides an improved staffing allocation to second level schools for the purpose of enhancing guidance provision. This improvement takes effect from next September. It brings the basis of allocation from 19:1 to 18.7:1 for the 2016/17 school year. This improvement of 0.3 in PTR allocation is a restoration of 50% of the teaching resources that were removed when the allocation of guidance posts was brought within quota.</p><p>Restoring the guidance counsellor allocation to 100% will require an additional 300 teaching posts at an estimated cost of &euro;19m per annum.</p><p>The delivery of the 50% restoration through a change in the staffing schedule will allow each school to determine how best to allocate the additional resources to meet the guidance needs of the school. The circular issued earlier this year by my Department outlining the allocation of teaching resources clearly stated that this additional resource is to complement existing resources in order to best meet the guidance needs of the school in line with the school's guidance plan.</p><p>It is important to note that in previous changes to guidance counselling allocations in 2012, as a consequence of the Budget adjustment which had to be made at the time, all 195 DEIS schools were effectively sheltered from these changes as a result of the more favourable staffing schedule of 18.25:1. This was a 0.75 point improvement compared to the current PTR of 19:1 that applies in non-fee-paying second-level schools.</p><p>That was a very important protection for the cohort of our schools in DEIS most in need of support. DEIS schools will also further benefit from the 0.3 improvement to the staffing schedule which will give them an enhanced allocation on the basis of 17.95:1 in respect of the 2016/17 school year.</p><p>The new National Skills Strategy provides for a review of the full range of guidance services, tools and careers information available to students and adults. The review will map future priorities and make recommendations for improvements.</p><p>The recruitment and appointment of teachers to fill teaching posts (including guidance positions) is a matter for the individual school authority, subject to procedures agreed under Section 24(3) of the Education Act 1998 (as amended by the Education (Amendment) Act 2012). The deployment of teaching staff in the school, the range of subjects offered and ultimately the quality of teaching and learning are in the first instance a matter for the school management authorities.</p><p>In the next Budget I will consider the best approach to further meeting commitments in the Programme for Government.</p></reply>

My Department uses a Geographical Information System to identify the areas under increased demographic pressure nationwide. The system uses data from the Central Statistics Office, Ordnance Survey Ireland, the Department of Social Protection and information from my own Department's databases. With this information, nationwide demographic exercises are carried out to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary levels.</p>  <p>  When it is decided that a new school is required to meet demographic needs in an area, the Department runs a separate patronage process to decide who will operate the school. It is open to all patrons and prospective patrons to apply for patronage of the school under this process and the level of parental preference for each patron is key to decisions in relation to the outcome of the process.</p>  <p>  With regard to the decision on the patronage of the new school which will open this September to serve the Drumcondra/Marino Dublin 1 area, my Department assessed the applications received from the prospective patrons, including examining the parental preferences received in the applications to ensure they represented children living within the school planning area which will be served by this school, and prepared a report for the consideration of the New Schools Establishment Group (NSEG) who then submitted their report with recommendations to me for consideration and final decision. The patronage assessment report which is published on my Department website, while indicating substantial support for an Irish medium school, reflects nearly twice as many valid preferences for an Educate Together school in this area.</p>  <p>  I accepted the recommendation of the NSEG and the patronage of the new school remains as announced. The NSEG did note the strong level of demand for Irish medium education in the area referred to by the Deputies and recommended that this should be kept under ongoing review in the context of future demographic exercises.</p>  <p>  My Department is focused on ensuring that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking school places in that area. My officials are keeping the changing demographics in the Drumcondra/Marino/Dublin 1 area under review to take into account updated child benefit data and to take into account the impact of ongoing and planned capacity increases in this and adjacent school planning areas.</p>  <p>  For the Deputies' information my Department has received a letter of appeal from An Foras P&aacute;tr&uacute;nachta and a direct reply will issue shortly.</p></reply>

This related to successful applicants under Categories 1 and 2, Gas and Electrical works. </p><p>  I wish to confirm that applications for the provision of a car park are assessed under Category 10 of the SWS in accordance with the prioritisation criteria outlined in the Circular Letter accompanying the Scheme.  Valid SWS applications from schools in respect of Categories 3 to 10 that were not reached under this round will, subject to the overall availability of funding, qualify to be assessed under future rounds of the Scheme.  If this arises, the terms and conditions of the scheme as outlined in Circular Letter (0055/2015) which may be accessed on my Department's website, will continue to apply when allocating funding to such projects. </p><p>  In the meantime, the school may use its minor works grant, which all primary schools received last November, to carry out the works in full or on a phased basis as that grant permits if the school considers them to be a priority. </p></reply>

The GIS uses data from the Central Statistics Office, Ordnance Survey Ireland, the Department of Social Protection and my Department's school enrolment databases.  With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises at primary and post primary levels to determine where additional school accommodation is needed. </p><p>  In relation to the school planning areas in County Wexford, the demographic analyses showed that these areas are experiencing demographic growth, however, not to such an extent that would currently warrant new school provision.  These areas, including the Wexford Town school planning area, are being kept under ongoing review by my Department to take account of updated enrolment data and also the impact of existing and planned capacity increases to existing schools in the school planning areas. </p><p>  In relation to the Wexford Town school planning area, my Department analysed the pre-enrolment lists of students seeking places in First Year in September 2016 from the 12 post-primary schools in the Wexford Town and the four adjacent school planning areas of Enniscorthy, Adamstown, Kilmuckridge and Bridgetown.  This analysis showed that there was a large amount of duplication of applications with students applying to a number of schools in these areas and the intake patterns showed that a significant proportion of students are not attending the post-primary school in their area but rather travelling out of the smaller school planning areas into the Wexford Town schools. </p><p>  The provisional 2015/16 post-primary enrolment figures in the Wexford Town schools indicate that actual enrolments are broadly in line with the projected enrolments based on the demographic data. In the five post-primary schools in the Wexford Town school planning area, total enrolments are projected to grow over the next six years, peaking in 2021/22, after which enrolment numbers are projected to drop back to below current levels. </p><p>  As part of my Department's School Capital Investment Programme, a number of building projects in Wexford schools are being progressed, including Loreto Secondary School and Wexford CBS, both located in Wexford Town, which will provide for increased capacity in the area.  The increase in accommodation planned for the Wexford Town area should be adequate to cater for the projected increase in enrolments.</p></reply>

As part of its remit the Unit is working to identify and collect information on what data the Department collects, shares, develops, uses, analyses, evaluates, manages and governs.  This work is intended to identify data issues and gaps that need to be addressed and opportunities and challenges to improving their effective use.</p><p>  Differing legislative, policy and institutional frameworks North and South present significant challenges in achieving an overall coordinated and cohesive approach to data gathering and compatibility on an all-island basis.  In addition, the two Education Departments on the island are governed by the provisions of the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement that designate cross-border co-operation in education in four specific areas: educational underachievement; teacher qualifications; special educational needs; and school youth and teacher exchanges.  Within this framework, my Department will continue to explore with the Department of Education NI the potential for developing and enhancing cooperation in areas of mutual benefit, including joint approaches to information gathering, sharing and exchange of best practice. </p></reply>

In general, the Department's policy is to integrate children with special educational needs into the mainstream school system wherever possible.

The enrolment policy must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.  Parents can choose which school to apply to and where the school has places available the pupil should be admitted.  However, in schools where there are more applicants than places available a selection process may be necessary.  This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.  However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</p><p>  Section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 provides for an appeal by a parent or guardian to the Secretary General of my Department, or in the case of an Educational Training Board (ETB) school to the ETB in the first instance, where a Board of Management of a school, or a person acting on behalf of the Board, refuses to enrol a student in a school, expels a student or suspends a student for 20 or more days in any school year.</p><p>  The Educational Welfare Service of the Child and Family Agency (EWS) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child. The EWS can be contacted at 01-8738700.</p><p>  My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking school places in the area.  My Department uses a Geographical Information System to identify the areas under increased demographic pressure nationwide.  The system uses data from the Central Statistics Office, Ordnance Survey Ireland, the Department of Social Protection and information from the Department's own databases.  With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and at post-primary level.  In relation to the area referred to by the Deputy, I can advise that my Department has no plans to establish a new school in the area.</p><p>  In 2015, the Department agreed to a request from the Patron for a change to fully vertical co-educational status for three other schools in the area in question.  The Patron indicated that there was no demand for a change in status from the school referred to by the Deputy.  The Patron also indicated that the trend of declining enrolments in the area will be kept under review.  The decision by the Patron to reorganise the primary schools in the parish in question first arose in 2009 because of concerns at local level regarding declining enrolments.  </p></reply>

Following significant stakeholder engagement, revised regulations were drawn up by the Teaching Council.</p><p>  The revised regulations also give effect to changes made in the Teaching Council (Amendment) Act 2015, such as the placing of the Garda vetting of new teachers on a statutory footing.  They provide for persons currently registered with the Council under Regulation 3 on the basis of holding a level 8 Montessori qualification and allow for the registration of persons who obtain a level 8 Montessori qualification, where the course is commenced on or before 1 October 2016 and the qualification is obtained before the end of 2021.</p><p>  The regulations were recently provided to my Department for my consent and approval.</p><p>  The Deputy should note that my Department has no plans to change the current position whereby teachers who are registered with a level 8 Montessori qualification under Regulation 3 (or its equivalent in the new regulations) are eligible for employment as teachers of pupils with special education needs in recognised mainstream primary schools and special schools.</p></reply>

Legal advice indicates that the EPSEN Act, as it is currently constituted, may not be implemented on a phased, or age cohort, basis.</p><p>  The NCSE has published a Plan for the Implementation of the EPSEN Act.  This report, which was published in 2006, made recommendations which suggested that additional investment over a period of years of up to &euro;235 million per annum, across the education and health sectors, would be required to fully implement the EPSEN Act.  The estimate of costs did not identify those costs which related only to the introduction of Individual Education Plans.</p><p>  My Department's opinion is that the level of investment required could be significantly greater than that envisaged in the NCSE report.  However, a total estimate of this amount has not been quantified.</p><p>  Revised estimates of the amount of additional expenditure required to fully implement remaining sectors of the EPSEN Act have not recently been conducted.  The level of additional expenditure required would have to take into account annual demographic growth and service developments in the area of special educational needs, pricing adjustments and salary cost differentials on an ongoing basis.</p><p>  Estimates would also have to be made as to the number of pupils who might qualify for the statutory service provisions envisaged by the EPSEN Act.</p><p>  At present, all schools are encouraged to use Education Plans through training support and guidance.  Schools use a range of different education plans, such as Student Support files, Personal Pupil Plans, or Individual Education Plans.  As these education plans are prepared and retained in schools, my Department does not have details of who many such support plans are presently in place, or the number of different types of education plans used.  However, my Departments Inspectorate's advice is that the majority of schools are now using some form of individual education planning for children with special needs.</p><p>  While awaiting the full implementation of the EPSEN Act, the NCSE has published a number of policy advice papers which make recommendations aimed at developing a better or more effective alternative to the current resource allocation model, and which aims to move the system towards ultimate implementation of the EPSEN Act.</p><p>  It is therefore intended to bring into effect many of the good ideas contained in the EPSEN Act, on a non-statutory basis initially, through policy developments across a range of areas, in conjunction with NCSE policy advice.</p><p>  Under the Programme for a Partnership Government I have also committed to consulting with stakeholders to see how best to progress sections of the EPSEN Act that were introduced on a non-statutory basis.</p></reply>

All post primary schools receive at least 100mbts connectivity through a programme undertaken jointly between the Department of Communications Energy and Natural Resources (now the Department of Communications, Climate Change and Natural Resources) and my Department.  That programme is now fully funded and operated by this Department.</p><p>  Through the Schools Broadband Access Programme, the Department provides for the supply of internet connectivity for all recognised primary schools.  A framework involving 14 providers was put in place in 2012 which has ensured improved solutions are available to primary schools.  The most recent draw down off the framework last September saw approximately 90% of school connections retendered, with over 1,100 schools awarded connections of 30Mbit/s or greater.  Approximately 400 of these connections have been installed to date and the remainder will be installed in the coming months.</p><p>  While broadband provision is awarded to every school, there are a very small number of schools where we are still seeking a suitable service owing primarily to their geographical location and the availability of broadband.  These school are currently with the relevant broadband providers to investigate solutions and put in place the service.  There are also a small number of schools who choose not to participate in the schools broadband scheme.</p><p>  Under the current programme the Department continually reviews the availability of services and upgrades schools where the opportunity arises, within the parameters of the programme and in compliance with procurement and contractual obligations</p><p>  However, the need to improve broadband connectivity to primary schools is recognised in the new Digital Strategy for Schools and the Department will collaborate with the Department of Communications, Climate Change and Natural Resources to address this as a priority action.  Work on the implementation of the Strategy is now underway.</p></reply>

At that time, a cost estimate will be possible taking into account that the outlay for replacing a prefab with a permanent building will vary from school to school depending on site conditions, planning conditions and other site specific costs.

The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring.  Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximize positive outcomes for these pupils.  NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties.  Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process.  Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment.</p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.  It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention. </p>  <p>  I would advise if there are concerns in relation to the educational development of any student that these should be raised, in the first instance, with the Principal of the school he/she is attending, with a view to the Principal discussing the situation with the assigned NEPS psychologist.</p></reply>

It has increased by 10% in the past two years. </p><p>  This funding provides for a range of supports and services, including additional learning and resource teaching support.</p><p>  There are currently over 11,800 Learning Support and Resource Teacher posts in mainstream primary and post primary schools, providing additional teaching support to pupils with special educational needs. </p><p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has allocated 6,832 Resource Teaching posts to mainstream schools this year, which is an increase of 29% over the numbers allocated since 2011, which was 5265 posts.</p><p>  A total of 7452 resource teaching posts is available to the NCSE to allocate to schools for the coming 2016/17 school year, which is an increase of over 600 posts on the current years allocation, and an increase of 41% over the numbers allocated since 2011, which was 5265 posts.</p><p>  The NCSE invited all schools to make applications for resource teaching support, for the 2016/17 school year, by 29th February. The NCSE advised all schools, on 28th April, 2016, of their allocations for resource teaching support for September 2016. </p><p>  7015 posts were allocated to schools at that time Details of these allocations are available at www.ncse.ie.  The remainder of the 7452 available are available for allocation by the NCSE to meet demand from further valid applications which may be received to September 2016.  It is expected that the remaining posts will be sufficient to meet this demand.</p><p>  As the allocation process for 2016/17 is ongoing, it is not possible at this point to state how many resource teachers will be allocated in advance of the roll out of the proposed new allocation model.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that a pilot of the model has been taking place across a number of schools in advance of implementation in the school system generally. </p><p>  The pilot has been developed in order to test the model and to allow for the practical effect of the application of the new model in the 47 pilot schools to be evaluated.</p><p>  A review of the pilot has now commenced.  This review will allow us to take into account the learning experiences of schools, principals, pupils and the views of parents over the course of the pilot.  </p><p>On conclusion of the review a decision will be taken on the time frame for the full implementation of the proposed new allocation model. </p></reply>

The number of SNA posts available for allocation to schools has increased from 10,575 posts in 2011, to 12,040 to June 2016.  In the same period the number of children accessing SNA support has grown from approximately 22,000 to some 30,000 by the end of 2015. </p>  <p>  The increase in SNA numbers has also been supported by a very significant increase in the Budget for SNAs, rising from &euro;332 million in 2011 to &euro;402 million by the end of 2015.  </p>  <p>  This has provided for a higher level of SNA support than ever before, which ensures that children with special educational needs can continue to participate in education and be supported in a manner appropriate to their needs.</p>  <p>  However, it is also incumbent upon us to continue to review the scheme in order to ensure that the scheme is meeting its objectives to support children with special needs in schools, in the intended manner. </p>  <p>  A Value for Money and Policy Review of the SNA scheme was completed and published in 2011. This report is available at my Department's website www.education.ie. The report includes details of the extensive consultations which took place with stakeholders during the course of this review.</p>  <p>  Following the publication of the this Value for Money Review, in order to provide greater clarity to parents and schools in relation to the SNA scheme, as recommended by the review, my Department issued DES Circular 30/2014 in relation to the SNA scheme. Consultations also took place with stakeholders in relation to the publication of this Circular.  This Circular is also available on my Departments website.</p>  <p>  As part of its decision to provide further additional SNA posts in July 2015, the then Government requested that a further review of the scheme should be undertaken.  The review, took the form of a Focussed Policy Assessment (FPA). </p>  <p>  The FPA was designed to review the extent to which the scheme continues to meet its objectives and the extent to which resources are being utilised effectively and efficiently, in line with guidelines underpinning the scheme. </p>  <p>  This FPA forms part of the Department of Education and Skills (DES) commitment to the Public Spending Code (PSC) and evidence informed policy making.</p>  <p>  Work on the FPA has now concluded and the Draft Report will now be considered by my Department.  When this process has concluded the Report will be published and next steps will be considered.

However, I must point out that, under the Universities Act 1997, universities in Ireland are autonomous institutions and therefore have responsibility for the day to day management of their own affairs, including issues relating to admissions.  Accordingly, the entry requirements for third level education courses are determined by individual higher education institutions.  The Central Applications Office (CAO) administer the processing of applications on behalf of the higher education institutions and my Department does not have any role or function in relation to this.  However, I can provide you with the following information in relation to the matter raised.</p><p>The Irish Universities Association has developed a revised model for converting A-level grades to Leaving Certificate points for the purposes of entry to universities here from 2016.  This adjustment will favour A Level students, given the desire of Irish universities to attract more applications from Northern Ireland, and the UK generally, and given that only small numbers of Northern Irish students sit four A Level subjects.</p><p>Following a detailed statistical analysis, involving detailed analysis of GCE and A Level participation rates and performances across the UK and in Northern Ireland, and conducted in cooperation with the CCEA in Belfast, it has been agreed that the revised model will increase the points for an A* grade from 150 to 180, for an A from 135 to 150, and make further adjustments to other grades.  This will remove a significant disincentive for students who sit only 3 A Level exams, which meant they could not realistically compete for many of the more high-demand courses in Irish universities, and will apply from 2016.  The revised model resulting from this work can be found at:</p><p>.</p><p>Because the points for A* have been increased from 150 points to 180 points under the new model, it is necessary to cap the possible points achievable for a fourth subject at 60 points.  This is to ensure that the total points which it is possible to achieve is 600 points, which is the maximum which can be achieved by those sitting the Irish Leaving Certificate, or by students presenting with four A* A Levels under the previous model.  In developing this model, the universities have endeavoured to ensure equality of opportunity for all applicants, whether they apply with an Irish Leaving Certificate or with a school leaving qualification from the UK or any other EU country.</p><p>If you require any further information in relation to this matter you should address your query directly to the Irish Universities Association who will be able to assist you in this regard.</p></reply>

It requires that, in order to be eligible to receive the qualified rate of pay and allowances, a person on their first appointment to teaching must be registered with the Teaching Council and appropriately qualified for that position.  This was introduced for the purpose of ensuring quality and promoting professional standards in teaching and this goal has been strongly supported by the teacher unions.</p>  <p>  The second measure was taken as part of Budget 2011.  The last Government applied a reduction in the pay of new entrants to the public service.  In the case of new teachers, a reduction of 10% was applied to pay and certain allowances and all new teachers were required to start on the first point of the scale rather than the third point as had previously been the case for most teachers.  The new pay rates applied to all teachers who were new appointees or who became qualified on or after 1 January 2011.</p>  <p>  In 2012 a public service-wide review of allowances was also carried out by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and, pending its outcome, the payment of qualification allowances was suspended with effect from 1 February 2012.  As a result of the review, the Government abolished qualification allowances with effect from that date and a new salary scale was created with a starting point equivalent to the fourth point of the previous scale for all entrants to teaching.  This reduced the impact of the ending of the qualification allowances and ensured a broad consistency across the public service.</p>  <p>  The effect of the above measures with regard to salary for teachers is explained below.</p>  <p>  1. A person first appointed to an Oireachtas funded teaching post before 1 January 2011 whose date of first qualified Oireachtas funded teaching service is&ndash;</p>  <p>  (a) before 5 December 2011, will be paid on the pre-2011 qualified pay scale and the qualification allowances applicable to that scale,</p>  <p>  (b) between 5 December 2011 and 28 April 2013, will be paid on pre-2011 pay scale and qualification allowances applicable to that scale subject to the maximum value of the honours primary degree allowance applicable to that scale, or</p>  <p>  (c) on or after 29 April 2013, will be paid on the 1 February 2012 pay scale with no qualification allowances.</p>  <p>  2. A person first appointed to an Oireachtas funded teaching post between 1 January 2011 and 31 January 2012, whose date of first qualified Oireachtas funded teaching service is&ndash;</p>  <p>  (a) before 5 December 2011, will be paid on the 1 January 2011 qualified pay scale and the qualification allowances applicable to that scale,</p>  <p>  (b) between 5 December 2011 and 28 April 2013, will be paid on the 1 January 2011 pay scale and qualification allowances applicable to that scale subject to the maximum value of the honours primary degree allowance applicable to that scale, or</p>  <p>  (c) on or after 29 April 2013, will be paid on the 1 February 2012 pay scale with no qualification allowances.</p>  <p>  3. A person first appointed to an Oireachtas funded teaching post on or after 1 February 2012 whose date of first qualified Oireachtas funded teaching service is on or after that date will be paid on the 1 February 2012 pay scale with no qualification allowances.</p>  <p>  According to the records available within my Department, the person referred to by the Deputy was first appointed to an Oireachtas funded post on the 16th April 2007 with Co. Louth VEC.  He was subsequently appointed to an Oireachtas funded post within a post primary school on my Department's post primary payroll on the 12th September 2007 and he was employed as an unqualified substitute teacher.  In order to be eligible to receive the qualified rate of pay in a post primary school on my Department's post primary payroll the employee must have the relevant qualifications which include a degree and a higher diploma in education.  The person referred to by the Deputy qualified as a post primary teacher in 2013 and he is registered with the Teaching Council since the 11th October 2013.  His first qualified appointment to an Oireachtas funded teaching post on the post primary sector is 07th March 2014.  As this date is later than 29th April 2013, and as set out at number 1(c) above, he is entitled to be placed on the 1st February 2012 pay scale with no qualification allowances.</p>  <p>  Unqualified service in the post primary sector, prior to completing the Higher Diploma in Education, is not eligible for consideration when assigning a teacher to the relevant pay scale.  In relation to his employment with the VEC /ETB, if he was employed in a qualified capacity by the VEC/ETB, his previous service may be considered when assessing the entry scale.  He should  apply to the appropriate ETB authority for a statement setting out the capacity in which he was employed, the period of time, the scale point he was placed on and submit the information to the Post Primary Payroll Section of my Department for review.</p>  <p>  The Single Public Service Pension Scheme (SPS) was introduced in January 2013 for all new teaching appointees and for staff re-entering service after a break of six months or greater.  The teacher in question was not paid on my Department's payrolls for a period in excess of 6 months in the 2012 /2013 school year and he was placed in the new scheme on his appointment.  If he worked in any other public service body during that period and did not have a break of 6 months or more from public service employment, he should submit documentation to that effect to the Post Primary Payroll Section of my Department so that his pension scheme membership can be reviewed and amended if appropriate.</p></reply>

The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.</p>  <p>  This year, 12,040 SNAs are available for allocation to primary and secondary schools, to the end of the 2015/16 school year, which is an increase of almost 14% in the number of posts available since 2011.  In the same period the number of children accessing SNA support has grown from approximately 22,000 to some 30,000 by the end of 2015.</p>  <p>  The increase in SNA numbers has been supported by a very significant increase in the Budget for SNAs, rising from &euro;332 million in 2011 to &euro;402 million by the end of 2015.</p>  <p>  This is a higher level of SNA support than ever before, and has ensured that all children with special educational needs who qualify for access to SNA support, in accordance with the terms of my Departments criteria, as set out in DES Circular 30/2014, have been able to access such support.</p>  <p>  Separately, the NCSE allocates resource teaching hours to schools for children who have been assessed within the low incidence, or more complex, category of special need.  Budget 2016 made additional provision, increasing the number from 6705 at the end of 2015 to 6852 at the end of June 2016, which is an increase of 29% over the numbers allocated since 2011. Provision has been made for 7452 posts to the end of 2016.</p>  <p>  This additional provision has meant that resource teaching allocations have been provided to schools in respect of all children who have qualified for resource teaching support, in accordance with the terms of my Departments criteria which are set out in DES Circular 02/05.</p>  <p>  All schools were asked to apply for Resource Teaching and SNA support for the 2016/17 school year by 29th February, 2016.  The NCSE continues to accept applications in recognition that enrolments may not have been completed or where assessments were not completed.  The NCSE will consider these applications and make further allocations to schools in respect of valid applications which have been received to September.</p>  <p>  The NCSE advised schools of their resource teaching allocations for the 2016/17 school year in May of this year and will advise all schools of their allocations for SNA support for 2016/17 as soon as possible in advance of the coming school year.</p>  <p>  Details of the manner in which a school or parent may appeal the level of SNA or resource teaching allocation which has been made to support a child in school, to the NCSE, is set out on the NCSE website.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy's question relates to the resource hours and SNA support provision for a particular school I have referred this question to the NCSE for their consideration and direct reply to the Deputy.</p></reply>

The reality is that dealing comprehensively with this issue will only take place as part of a more general programme to address the major housing and homelessness issue, and the new Government has appointed a specific Minister for Housing with a commitment to develop an Action Plan for Housing within 100 days.  The D&aacute;il has also established a Committee on Housing and Homelessness to review the implications of these problems and to make recommendations in that regard.  My Department has made a submission to this Committee specifically in relation to the issue of Student Accommodation.</p><p>In relation to student accommodation, the report, Student Accommodation: Demand &amp;amp; Supply, which was published last year by the Minister for Education and Skills sets out clearly that the demand for student accommodation outstrips supply in certain areas and will continue to do so in the coming years.</p><p>The full report can be accessed at:</p><p>.</p><p>There are 13 useful recommendations in this report some of which include capital financing, tax considerations and planning issues, as well as support for the rent-a-room scheme.  Specifically in relation to Taxation, one of the recommendations contained in the Report is that consideration should be given to tax measures to develop on-campus accommodation for HEIs.</p><p>The previous Minister for Education and Skills introduced two immediate actions to begin this work.</p><p>Firstly, funding was provided by the HEA to the Union of Students' (USI) in Ireland to progress short-term solutions for students in need of accommodation.  This funding will allow USI to develop their homes.usi.ie website, to communicate more effectively to student and homeowners, and to carry out research into this important issue.</p><p>Secondly, the establishment of an inter-departmental steering group to examine the recommendations contained in the HEA Report and to provide a coordinating mechanism to ensure that the higher education institutions have access to information on new potential funding and delivery models.</p><p>In addition to this, I should point out that a number of our Higher Education Institutions have Student Accommodation projects ongoing, or in the pipeline, with a number of additional on-campus Student Accommodation bed-spaces to come online from September 2016.  Maynooth University have 296 new on-campus bed spaces, and UCD have 350 new on-campus bed spaces, which are due to come on stream in Autumn 2016.</p><p>In addition to this six other Higher Education Institutions are currently engaged in, or going through the planning phases for student accommodation projects, namely National University of Ireland Galway, Trinity College Dublin, University of Limerick, Dublin City University, University College Cork and Dublin Institute of Technology.  </p><p>My Department is also examining other potential options for funding projects in conjunction with relevant stakeholders.</p><p>Given the similar nature of the UCD Students' Union proposal to that advanced by the USI, it would appear that the appropriate next line of communication for UCD Students' Union would be for them to discuss their proposal directly with the USI.</p></reply>

It is open to all patrons and prospective patrons to apply under this process and parental demand is key to this process.</p><p>The Department uses a Geographical Information System to identify the areas under increased demographic pressure nationwide.  The system uses data from the Central Statistics Office, Ordnance Survey Ireland, the Department of Social Protection and information from my Department's own databases.  With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level.</p><p>With regard to the decision on the patronage for the Drumcondra/Marino area my Department assessed the applications received and prepared a report for the consideration of the New Schools Establishment Group (NSEG) who then submitted their report with recommendations to me for consideration and final decision.  The patronage assessment report which is published on my Department website, while indicating substantial support for an Irish medium school, reflects nearly twice as many valid preferences for an Educate Together school in this area.  I accepted their recommendation and patronage will remain as announced.  The NSEG did note the strong level of demand for Irish medium education in the Drumcondra/Marino area and recommended that this should be kept under review in the context of future demographic exercises.</p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, my Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places due to demographic pressures.

Legal advice indicates that the EPSEN Act, as it is currently constituted, may not be implemented on a phased, or age cohort, basis.</p>  <p>  The NCSE has published a Plan for the Implementation of the EPSEN Act.  This report, which was published in 2006, made recommendations which suggested that additional investment over a period of years of up to &euro;235m per annum, across the education and health sectors, would be required to fully implement the EPSEN Act.  The estimate of costs did not desegregate costs which related only to the introduction of Individual Education Plans.</p>  <p>  My Department's opinion is that the level of investment required could be significantly greater than that envisaged in the NCSE report.  However, a total estimate of this amount has not been quantified.</p>  <p>  Revised estimates of the amount of additional expenditure required to fully implement remaining sectors of the EPSEN Act have not recently been conducted.  The level of additional expenditure required would have to take into account annual demographic growth and service developments in the area of special educational needs, pricing adjustments and salary cost differentials on an ongoing basis.</p>  <p>  Estimates would also have to be made as to the number of pupils who might qualify for the statutory service provisions envisaged by the EPSEN Act.</p>  <p>  While awaiting the full implementation of the EPSEN Act, the NCSE has published a number of policy advice papers which make recommendations aimed at developing a better or more effective alternative to the current resource allocation model, and which aims to move the system towards ultimate implementation of the EPSEN Act.</p>  <p>  It is therefore intended to bring into effect many of the good ideas contained in the EPSEN Act, on a non-statutory basis initially, through policy developments across a range of areas, in conjunction with NCSE policy advice.  In such circumstances, I do not propose, at present, to carry out a full recosting exercise for the implementation of the statutory provision of the EPSEN Act.</p>  <p>  Under the Programme for a Partnership Government I have also committed to consulting with stakeholders to see how best to progress sections of the EPSEN Act that were introduced on a non-statutory basis.</p></reply>

Much, however, will depend in this regard on the location and distribution of the additional pupil numbers. </p><p>  The announcement on 29 September 2015 of Building on Recovery: Infrastructure and Capital investment 2016-2021 specifies an investment of &euro;4 billion to the Education sector through direct Exchequer provision and the PPP programme.  In excess of &euro;3 billion of the investment is in respect of the schools sector. </p><p>  Last November, a new programme of over 300 major school building projects for the period 2016 to 2021 was announced.  Details are available on my Department's website.  These projects, together with approvals under the devolved Additional Accommodation Scheme, are designed to meet the increases in pupil numbers that will arise in both the primary and post-primary school sectors.</p></reply>

Government waste policy supports managing waste as a national resource, and the benefits of this approach, as part of the transition to a circular economy , are increasingly being recognised across Europe.  If Ireland can continue to progress up the value chain of the waste hierarchy, i.e. prepare for reuse, recycle and recover waste within the State, more opportunities in green waste technologies and previously untapped subsectors of waste recovery are likely to emerge.  It is estimated that 2,100 jobs could be created directly through the complete domestic processing of recyclables and bio-waste alone. </p></reply>

My Department undertook to consider new approaches to the Seniors Alert Scheme in 2014 and arising from this, it was decided that the scheme be managed by Pobal, given that organisation&rsquo;s significant experience delivering programmes on behalf of Government. </p>  <p>  Pobal completed an open tender for the supply of the alarm equipment and a panel of preferred suppliers was identified.  This national tender was broken down into 10 regional lots to ensure that smaller alarm suppliers were not disadvantaged due to excessively large lot sizes.  A panel of regional suppliers was contracted to provide the equipment within specified regional areas while maintaining the benefits of local service provision.  The management and administration of the Scheme transferred from my Department to Pobal on 7 September 2015.   </p>  <p>  This new approach has reduced the administrative burden for the many hundreds of community and voluntary groups registered under the Scheme, who provide an excellent service for the elderly, and enables the groups to concentrate on the main purpose of the Scheme, namely, to support and interact with the elderly in the local community.   </p>  <p>  The new arrangements will allow my Department to concentrate on developing and improving the Scheme.

The Commissioner for Valuation has sole responsibility for all valuation matters.   The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority.</p>  <p>  It is important to acknowledge that commercial rates, as a local tax, and the rating system generally are deeply embedded in the local government system.   A large body of case law is well established and local authorities and ratepayers are, in the main, very familiar with, and generally accepting of, the operation and practice of the rating system.  Rates are also a stable source of financing for local government which is not affected unduly by short-term changes in economic circumstances.   </p>  <p>  Under the provisions of the Local Government (Rates) Act 1970, a rating authority may make and carry out a scheme, providing for the waiver by the authority of all or a portion of commercial rates due by ratepayers in respect of a specified class or classes of property.  The making of such a scheme is subject to my consent as Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  No rate waiver schemes have been consented to in respect of commercial property. </p>  <p>  I am aware of the continued need to restrain costs on businesses.  My Department has in recent years requested local authorities to exercise restraint in setting, and where possible to reduce, ARVs and they have responded positively in this regard.  The national average ARV decreased each year from 2010 to 2014; 2015 and 2016 are not directly comparable with previous years due to local authority mergers and the necessity to harmonise rates across new local authority areas.   </p></reply>

In total, 110,000 new social housing units are targeted for delivery with 35,000 new units to be delivered by local authorities and approved housing bodies, and 75,000 households to be supported mainly through the Housing Assistance Payment Scheme. </p><p>Overall funding of &euro;761.4 million was expended on the delivery of social housing services in 2015.  This comprised &euro;636.3 million Exchequer funding and &euro;125.1 million which local authorities self-funded from Local Property Tax receipts.  This funding facilitated the delivery of over 13,000 social housing units in 2015, the first full year of implementation of the <i>Social Housing Strategy</i><i>2020</i>.  This represents an 86% increase in unit delivery above 2014.</p><p>A full report on actions delivered under the Strategy in 2015 can be found in the <i>Social Housing Output in 2015</i>report.  The report, which was published on 26 January 2016, in collaboration with the Housing Agency, is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link:. </p><p>With regard to funding provision for social housing services for 2016, the combined capital and current allocation will result in an Exchequer investment of almost &euro;821 million across a range of housing programmes, being implemented by both local authorities and approved housing bodies.  In addition, local authorities will self-fund a range of housing services from Local Property Tax receipts to the value of over &euro;112 million , bringing the total social housing provision in 2016 to &euro;933 million.</p><p>Importantly, with capital project announcements in May and July 2015, and in January 2016, local authorities and approved housing bodies now have a strong pipeline of construction, turnkey and acquisition projects, which will deliver some 3,900 homes, with approved budget costs of some &euro;680 million. </p><p>My Department works closely with all local authorities in relation to their overall resource requirements, including staffing, to ensure their capacity and preparedness for delivery of the ambitious targets set under the Strategy.  To this end, my Department has sanctioned 440 local authority posts in order to meet the goals of the <i>Social Housing Strategy 2020</i>.<i></i></p><p>Housing is an absolute priority for this Government, as evidenced by the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government</i>, which is available at the following link:-<i>, </i>which includes a commitment to the preparation and publication of an &lsquo;Action Plan for Housing&rsquo;.

The Action Plan will be delivery focused, and will include specific measures to increase and expedite the delivery of social housing units, building on the considerable work already carried out or underway in my Department.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-06-08a.620.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016060800064#WRO00400"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 266 and 271 together.  </p><p>I understand from initial inquiries that Irish Water has two Memoranda of Understanding (MOU) with Northern Ireland Water (NIW).  The first of these is a knowledge sharing agreement on issues such as asset standards, specifications and research etc.  The second MOU with NIW is on a joint INTERREG funding application which is targeting two cross-Border projects.  One of these is for wastewater infrastructure which will benefit shared waters &ndash; Lough Foyle and Carlingford Lough.  The second is for a catchment management project on cross-Border catchments which should positively impact on quality of water abstracted for drinking water production.  Further inquiries are being made with other bodies under my Department&rsquo;s aegis and I will communicate directly with the Deputy, if further MOUs are identified. </p><p>My Department&rsquo;s role in relation to North-South co-operation arises mainly in relation to the operation of the North South Ministerial Council (NSMC), established under the Good Friday Agreement.  Building on the good co-operation to date across a broad range of environmental areas, including air quality, cross-Border waste management and environmental protection, recent discussions have explored the potential for even greater collaboration on climate issues and water quality, including water and sewerage services.</p><p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Northern Ireland Environmental Agency (NIEA) both belong to a five-agencies group (EPA, NIEA, Scottish EPA, EA(UK) and Natural Resources Wales) that meet to discuss matters of mutual interest across the UK and Ireland.  This informal network fosters collaboration across a wide range of areas including waste management, water protection and management, environmental licensing and enforcement, radon, emergency preparedness, air quality monitoring and protection, environmental strategy, research, state of the environment reporting, IT systems development and geographic information systems.  There have been particularly close contacts between the EPA and NIEA in the areas of water management and waste management for many years, and these have helped ensure good collaboration and co-operation between the two jurisdictions, when having to deal with cross-Border issues of mutual interest. </p><p>My Department draws on all relevant data available to support cross-Border co-operation.  There are many sources of data concerning activity and needs on the island including the Central Statistics Office and the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency, and the EPA.  Furthermore, in order to inform the development and implementation of policy measures in both jurisdictions, a number of studies have been initiated under the auspices of the NSMC on, for example, Policy Options to Reduce Emissions from &lsquo;Smoky&rsquo; Coal and Other Residential Solid Fuels, and a study on the environmental impacts of Unconventional Gas Exploration and Extraction in Ireland, including fracking technology. </p><p>In addition to work under the NSMC, my Department co-operates with a range of bodies in Northern Ireland, including on marine and planning matters.  In relation to marine environment and planning issues, each jurisdiction is responsible for the collection of its own data.  However, there is both an obligation and a willingness to work together on a transboundary basis on these issues.  That co-operation includes the sharing of data and information with each other on an all-island and Celtic Seas basis to underpin better decision making.  Strategic planning in relation to territorial development is informed by strategies for Northern Ireland and Ireland through the Regional Development Strategy 2035 and the National Spatial Strategy 2002-2020, respectively.  Strategic development issues, opportunities and challenges in relation to spatial planning are frequently shared in both the Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland jurisdictions.  To facilitate practical co-operation, the Department of Regional Development in Northern Ireland and my Department developed a framework for collaboration on spatial strategies on the Island of Ireland.  The Framework sets out the approach to be taken both by the Northern Ireland Assembly and the Irish Government in co-operating in the implementation of their respective spatial strategies. </p><p>Opportunities for further MOUs and greater collaboration on data collection and data sharing, including associated funding requirements, will be addressed on a case-by-case basis.</p><p>I look forward to continued co-operation with the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs on matters of mutual interest particularly through the North South Ministerial Council, as referenced in the recent <i>Programme for Partnership Government</i>.</p></reply>

Part V units are excluded from the Tenant (Incremental) Purchase Scheme to ensure that units delivered under this mechanism will remain available for people in need of social housing support and that the original policy goals of the legislation are not eroded over time.  The continued development of mixed tenure communities remains very important in promoting social integration.</p><p>The new Scheme is in the early stages of implementation and my Department is monitoring its operation in consultation with housing authorities.  In line with the commitment in the new <i>Programme for a Partnership Government </i>to make the scheme more attractive for social housing tenants and to raise new funds for housing development, I intend to undertake a review of the scheme following the first 12 months of operation.  I will bring forward any changes to the terms and conditions of the scheme which are considered necessary based on the evidence gathered at that stage. </p></reply>

The aim of the review was to assess the nature and level of the challenges which are currently facing the existing Producer Responsibility Agreements, as well as the forthcoming challenges that are expected to arise in the management of various waste streams.  My Department also completed a consultation process with stakeholders on this issue.  </p><p>As part of this review, my Department sought a wider examination of issues within the packaging sphere, including consideration of a package levy and a &ldquo;bring back&rdquo; scheme for waste, including glass.  The review was asked to consider:-</p><p>(i) an economic analysis of the possible effects of a packaging levy, </p><p>(ii) options on how a possible packaging levy might operate, </p><p>(iii) possible alternatives to a packaging levy which would yield corresponding reductions in packaging,</p><p>(iv) how a packaging levy might work in tandem with and affect the operation of the compliance schemes, and </p><p>(v) an examination of packaging reduction initiatives such as deposit and refund and reverse vending.</p><p>The review report did not recommend the introduction of a Deposit and Refund scheme as to establish such a scheme was considered inappropriate, in view of the operation of the existing packaging scheme (operated by Repak), and policies concerning household waste collection, plus the high administrative costs of introducing such a system.</p><p>In addition, the review did not recommend the introduction of a packaging levy.  The main reason for this decision was that the introduction of a packaging levy was likely to generate a number of regulatory costs to business and the public sector with few identifiable benefits, given Ireland&rsquo;s very successful packaging recovery and recycling performance to date. </p><p>The review report is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link:.</p></reply>

The information contained in these reports is provided by housing authorities and is produced through the Pathway Accommodation &amp;amp; Support System (PASS) - the national information and management system for homeless services that are overseen by housing authorities.  The most recent report confirms that 4,068 adult individuals used State-funded emergency accommodation nationally during a week in April 2016.  These monthly reports are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: </p><p>Homelessness is a complex phenomenon which is usually the result of a number of inter-related issues, often including complex personal problems, mental health, addiction, relationship breakdown, family issues, domestic violence, financial loss, economic insecurity, rent arrears, tenancy issues, anti-social behaviour, the vulnerability of migrants, etc.  The myriad of issues contributing to homelessness mean that it is of limited value to attempt to classify incidence of homeless presentation to a single causative factor.  It is generally accepted that the supply shortage across the housing sector, which in turn is a result of the economic collapse and the associated contraction in the construction sector, has been a driving force behind the increased number of families and individuals presenting as homelessness in recent times. </p><p>Research commissioned by the Housing Agency, <i>Family Experiences of Pathways into Homelessness</i>, which was published in August last year, found that each of the families interviewed as part of the representative sample for the research had reported some level of difficulty maintaining accommodation in the private rented sector, citing issues such as accessibility, rent increases and affordability and tenure security.  Other reasons for homelessness were also cited in association, such as relationship breakdown, family issues, domestic violence, anti-social behaviour, etc.  This research also found that 20% of the representative sample had previous experiences of homelessness.

In general, the mortgage must be in negative equity with some cases of positive equity considered on a case by case basis.  The household must also be deemed eligible for social housing.</p>  <p>  Once a case comes within the criteria and the householder has provided consent to the lender to share information, the Housing Agency seeks an AHB to complete the transaction and prepares a submission to my Department for funding approval.</p>  <p>  Under the terms of the scheme, before a property can be sold to the AHB, it must be valued independently and the lender and the AHB must agree a price.  The price will be based on several factors, including the market valuation of the property and the cost of any necessary repairs.  If the lender and the AHB cannot agree a price, the arrangement will not go ahead and the process will be terminated.  In relation to the specific case raised, I understand that no AHB is prepared to purchase the property on the basis of the combined cost of the sale price proposed by the lender, and the cost of repairs that would be required to the property in order to meet the required standards.  Therefore I understand this case has proceeded as far as possible in the MTR scheme and has been terminated.</p>  <p>  It will be a matter for the borrower to discuss with their lender if there are other options available to resolve their mortgage arrears situation.  I would urge communication with the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service (MABS) that now has a dedicated confidential, free, and independent mortgage arrears service.</p></reply>

A number of specific measures have been, and will continue to be, introduced to reduce the amount of waste generated in the State and to increase the segregation of waste which cannot be prevented in line with Government policy.  The introduction of pay-by-weight charges for the collection of household waste is one such measure.</p><p>The legislation requires that the collector will charge for each kilogramme of waste collected.  The Government has set a <i>minimum</i>mandatory fee per kilogramme for the different types of household waste: 11 cent for black bin (residual waste), 6 cent for brown bin (food/organic waste) and I have decided that a zero cent <i>minimum</i>fee per kilogramme should be set for green bins (recyclate).  The collector may also charge a service fee, which will typically cover staff, collection, administrative and back office, capital and overhead costs.</p><p>Given that the charging systems are moving to a more standardised format across the country, householders should be able to more easily compare the charges of different providers under the new system and choose the option that suits them best or is most cost effective.</p><p>I understand that a few waste collectors have already released details of their prices under pay by weight.  I expect that we will have a fuller picture of the fees being charged in the coming days as more collectors release their charging details in the period leading up to 1 July, 2016.</p><p>In an open market, it has been, and will continue to be , a matter for the collector to set charges at the level they consider to be competitive, in compliance with the requirements of the legislation.  Excessive pricing by individual companies will offer the opportunity for rival operators to provide their services at a cheaper price.</p><p>There is an opportunity for customers to minimise their waste costs by preventing waste and segregating waste through using the food waste and recyclable waste bins properly which will reduce the per kilogramme element of the charge to the household.  In this regard, a pay-by-weight awareness campaign, launched on 18 May 2016, is being rolled out at national, regional and local levels and will give valuable advice to householders on minimising their waste management costs under pay-by-weight charging.</p></reply>

This grant has not ceased or been curtailed in any way.</p>  <p>  The grant is paid automatically to people in receipt of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Carer&rsquo;s Benefit, and Domiciliary Care Allowance.  Other people who are not in receipt of a social welfare payment but who are providing full time care and attention are also eligible and can apply for the grant to a stand-alone CSG section.  The stand-alone grant is not subject to a means test.  The grant is paid annually on the first Thursday in June and I am pleased to inform you that automatic payments commenced last week and it is expected that in excess of 90,000 grants will be paid in 2016 at an estimated cost of &euro;157.6 million. </p>  <p>  The name was changed from the Respite Care Grant to the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant in Budget 2016 to ensure that carers are empowered to use the grant in a manner that suits their individual circumstances, which may include providing for a respite from their caring duties.  During the economic crisis this payment had been reduced by &euro;325, in Budget 2013, in order to protect the core weekly welfare payments which people receive, including disability payments, pensions and Carer&rsquo;s Allowance.  The amount of the CSG was also increased to &euro;1,700.</p>  <p>  Total Expenditure on grants to carers (Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Carer&rsquo;s Benefit, Domiciliary Care Allowance and Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant) increased from just under &euro;752 million in 2010 to over &euro;877 million in 2015.  This represents an increase of &euro;125 million or 16.6 %.

Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension, all contributions paid or credited over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement.  Since 1961, when contributory pensions were introduced, the average contributions test has been used in calculating pension entitlement.  Once over 16 years of age, the date a person enters into insurable employment is the date used for averaging purposes.</p>  <p>  The homemaker's scheme makes qualification for a higher rate of State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme, which was introduced in and took effect from 1994, allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age (or caring for incapacitated people over that age) to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes, subject to the standard qualifying conditions for State pension contributory also being satisfied.  This has the effect of increasing the yearly average of the pensioner, which is used to set the rate of their pension.</p>  <p>  Work has commenced to replace the &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; system with a &lsquo;total contributions approach&rsquo; where the number of contributions recorded over a work life will more closely reflect the rate of pension payment received.  It is expected that the total contributions approach to pension qualification will replace the current average contributions test for State pension (contributory) for new pensioners from 2020.  This is a very significant reform with considerable legislative, administrative, and technical aspects to be addressed in its implementation.  When proposals are agreed, legislation will be brought forward to underpin the necessary changes.</p>  <p>  I believe that it is important that the changes be announced well in advance of introduction to enable those workers affected to include the new factors into their retirement planning.  This new method will provide greater benefit for some, but not all, future pensioners than they would have had under the current system.</p>  <p>  It is worth noting that the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund in 2012 confirmed that the Fund provides better value to female rather than male contributors.  This is due to the distributive nature of the Fund.  For example, those with a yearly average of only 20 contributions (38% of the maximum) may qualify for 85% of the maximum rate.</p>  <p>  It should also be noted that, where people cannot qualify for a full rate contributory pension as a result of an intermittent PRSI record, the social protection system provides alternative methods of supporting such people in old age.  For example, if a person&rsquo;s spouse has a contributory pension, that person may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension, which by default is paid directly to them.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State Pension (non-contributory), amounting up to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate.</p></reply>

The PTJI scheme is intended as a stepping stone to full-time work. It allows certain long-term unemployed people to take up part-time work and get a special weekly allowance instead of their jobseeker's payment. A person is not placed on PTJI by the Department. They secure the part-time work themselves and then contact their local Intreo Centre in order to apply to participate in the PTJI scheme.</p>  <p>  On 6 January 2016, a rent supplement review was carried out which showed the combined weekly income of the person, less income disregards, less supplementary welfare rate for a couple and with the addition of the minimum rent supplement contribution yielded a weekly available contribution of &euro;197.25 per week towards the rent. The rent charged equated to &euro;115.30 per week and therefore their weekly available contribution exceeded that of the rent thus giving a nil entitlement to rent supplement.</p>  <p>  A further review carried out on 26 February 2016 confirmed that the person&rsquo;s available financial contribution still exceeded the weekly rent and that there was no entitlement to rent supplement. It remains open for the person concerned to submit an appeal against this decision to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.</p>  <p>  A Designated Person administers supplementary welfare allowance including exceptional needs payments (ENP's). An ENP covers essential, once-off exceptional spending that one could not reasonably be expected to meet out of weekly income. ENP's cannot be used to replace another social welfare payment in this case rent supplement.</p>  <p>   In line with other EU and OECD jurisdictions where such measures are common, reduced rates for younger jobseeker's allowance recipients were first introduced in 2009 and extended in subsequent Budgets. A weekly jobseeker's allowance rate of &euro;100 applies to jobseekers aged 18-24 and a weekly rate of &euro;144 applies to jobseekers who are 25 years of age.</p>  <p>   It is not discriminatory but rather a targeted measure aimed at protecting young people from welfare dependency by incentivising them to avail of education and training opportunities.  If a jobseeker in receipt of the reduced jobseeker's allowance rate participates on an education or training programme they will receive a higher weekly payment of &euro;160.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the deputy.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-06-08a.712.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016060800065#WRP05200"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 296, 301, 337 and 338 together.</p>  <p>  My Department provides two main options for payment methods for its customers: payments direct to customer accounts in financial institutions or payments in cash at post offices.</p>  <p>  Specifically in respect of cash payments at Post Offices, in 2015 my department made over 38 million such payments in cash at a cost of &euro;54 million.  These welfare payments through post offices are across all of the department&rsquo;s major schemes: state pension, jobseekers, one parent family payments, widow/ers or survivors pensions, carers payments, disability payments and child benefit.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that my department is not undertaking any measures which seek to actively influence customer choice in the manner of payment away from cash payments at the Post Office.</p>  <p>  I want to emphasise that for the vast majority of my department&rsquo;s schemes the department&rsquo;s customers are given the choice of what payment method they wish to receive their social welfare payment.  The vast majority of new customers choose to have payments made directly into their accounts in financial institutions which reflects a societal trend towards payment by electronic funds transfer.  For example, 83% of new Child Benefit customers and 70% of new State Pension customers chose this option in 2015.</p>  <p>  Many of my department&rsquo;s customers are in employment. My department&rsquo;s focus must be on our customers and to this end my department&rsquo;s policy is to make payments to in-work customers directly to accounts rather than customers being inconvenienced by two separate payment methods.</p>  <p>  My department has a cohort of jobseeker customers who are classified as casual jobseekers.  These are in-work customers who can claim a jobseeker's payment for 2 to 3 days per week or who work week on/week-off.  These customers were paid by cheque each week.</p>  <p>  Those customers were paid by cheque due to the changing nature of their  work/claiming patterns and the short turn-around time to issue payments.  It is important to note that they were not paid via post offices under the department&rsquo;s existing cash payments contract with An Post.</p>  <p>  My department has developed its payment capacity in respect of changing work and claiming patterns and is offering payments direct to accounts in financial institutions for casual Jobseeker customers thereby increasing customer convenience.  This is in line with wider departmental policy where the focus is on ensuring that in-work customers are paid by the most convenient method possible.</p>  <p>  My department has written to all of these casual jobseekers offering the option of a payment to an account. The vast majority have responded and opted for payment to an account.</p>  <p>  If customers wish to continue to be paid by cheque they can make their preference known to their local social welfare office which handles their claim.</p>  <p>  The recent &ldquo;Kerr Report&rdquo; sets out the challenges that An Post and Postmasters face as they seek to ensure that the post office network remains relevant in the context of the inexorable shift towards electronic payments.</p>  <p>  My Department will support the introduction by An Post of a standard bank account through the provision of seed funding to help start the initiative.</p>  <p>  My department is engaging as appropriate with the Departments of Communications, Climate Change and Natural Resources and Public, Expenditure and Reform in addressing the recommendations of the report.</p></reply>

T&uacute;s was introduced in 2011 to provide work opportunities in the community for those who are unemployed for more than a year.  JobPath is a new approach to employment activation to support long-term unemployed people and those most at risk of becoming long-term unemployed to secure and sustain full time employment.</p>  <p>  In general, it is not possible for clients to participate in two activation schemes at the same time and my Department does not facilitate or encourage jobseekers to leave one scheme early in order to take up a place on another scheme.  This approach is particularly relevant in the case of JobPath whereby contracted providers are paid on the basis of outcomes.  It is important that the service providers have the opportunity and the time to help the jobseeker secure and sustain full-time employment.</p></reply>

Furthermore, the average family income must be below a specified amount which varies according to the number of qualified children in the family.</p><p>The &ldquo;hours worked&rdquo; eligibility criterion has been reduced significantly since the introduction of the scheme in 1984, from 30 hours per week to 19 hours per week in 1996.  Further reducing the &ldquo;hours worked&rdquo; requirement would have potentially significant expenditure implications.</p><p>For low income workers with less than the minimum hours of employment for FIS and working on a casual basis up to and including 3 days per week, jobseeker's schemes provide in-work income support through daily disregards and tapered withdrawal of payments.</p><p>The current number of families who are working between 15-18 hours and are earning below the relevant FIS thresholds is currently unknown.</p><p>Reducing the numbers of hours worked required to access FIS from 19 to 15 could have a number of behavioural effects including: reduce incentive to increase part-time hours; result in recipients on the minimum 19 hours threshold reducing their hours of work; and reduction in the &quot;hours worked&quot; criteria might attract new recipients currently on higher wages above the FIS threshold, who might decide to reduce their hours in order to qualify.</p><p>Under EU regulations FIS is defined as a family benefit and is exportable in cases where the claimant is working in Ireland but where the children are living abroad.  My Department hasno way of predicting with any degree of accuracy the potential in-flow from this category.</p><p>Therefore, my Department has no way of accurately estimating the cost of reducing the numbers of hours worked required to access FIS from 19 to 15 hours.</p></reply>

Companies were simply not hiring because they couldn&rsquo;t afford to recruit, and in many cases insisted on a minimum level of experience.  But large numbers of new jobseekers and people who lost their jobs in the recession couldn&rsquo;t get the relevant workplace experience they needed to get a first or a new job.</p>  <p>  That crisis is now over, the economy is growing and employers are hiring again.  The labour market has changed and new graduates and other jobseekers are once again finding work.  These changed circumstances mean that it is now timely to consider whether or not a state sponsored internship/work experience scheme is still required and if so what form such an internship/work experience scheme should take.  While I acknowledge that JobBridge has been a very successful scheme and served a very useful purpose during the period of recession I am mindful of the criticisms that have been made of the scheme and I intend to replace it later this year with a scheme that is better suited to the changed economic circumstances.</p>  <p>  JobBridge is currently the subject on an external, independent evaluation and I will use the outcome of this evaluation, due to be produced in September this year, as the basis for determining what changes should be made to improve outcomes for Jobseekers and value for money for the State.</p>  <p>  Any costs related to the replacement of the JobBridge scheme will be dependent on the nature of the scheme that is implemented in its place.  Such costs are not known at this time therefore no projected savings can be calculated.</p></reply>

It provides employers with two levels of payment: &euro;7,500 and &euro;10,000.  The &euro;7,500 is paid primarily to those who are 12 months or more on the live register with the higher grant paid in respect of those who have been unemployed for more than 24 months.  The incentive is paid in monthly instalments over a two year period provided the employment is maintained.</p>  <p>  The full year cost of the jobsplus incentive to support 1,000 employees who were unemployed for between 12 and 24 months is &euro;3.75m.  The full year cost of the jobsplus incentive to support 1,000 employees who were unemployed for longer than 24 months is &euro;5m.</p>  <p>  The full year cost of the jobseekers payment for 1,000 customers is estimated at &euro;10.2m., therefore the estimated net savings of moving 1,000 customers who were unemployed for between 12 and 24 months utilising the jobsplus incentive would be in the order of &euro;6.45m.  The net savings of moving 1,000 customers who were unemployed for longer than 24 months would be in the order of &euro;5.2m.</p>  <p>  The above costings do not include the additional income that arises for the Exchequer from payment of income tax, PRSI and USC from employment or the additional cost from employees who may have an entitlement to receive family income supplement (FIS) or the back to work family dividend.</p></reply>

The geographic areas are as follows:</p><p>Seetec &ndash; West; Midlands North; North East; North West, Dublin Central; Dublin North; Dublin South.</p><p>Turas Nua &ndash; Cork Central; South East; Mid-Leinster, Mid-West; South West; Midlands South.</p><p>34,307 jobseekers have been referred to JobPath as follows (to 6 June 2016): <table><tr><th>Division</th><th>Group 1 - (12 months LTU)</th><th>Group 2 - (1/ 2 years LTU)</th><th>Group 3 - (2/ 3 years LTU)</th><th>Group 4 - (3 + years LTU)</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>Dublin Central</td><td></td><td>559</td><td>430</td><td>1,500</td><td>2,489</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin North</td><td></td><td>345</td><td>186</td><td>671</td><td>1,202</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin South</td><td></td><td>352</td><td>255</td><td>587</td><td>1,194</td></tr><tr><td>Midlands North</td><td></td><td>700</td><td>530</td><td>1,735</td><td>2,965</td></tr><tr><td>North East</td><td></td><td>683</td><td>558</td><td>1,646</td><td>2,887</td></tr><tr><td>North West</td><td></td><td>358</td><td>382</td><td>1,350</td><td>2,090</td></tr><tr><td>West</td><td>40</td><td>738</td><td>594</td><td>1,589</td><td>2,961</td></tr><tr><td>Cork Central</td><td></td><td>754</td><td>493</td><td>2,090</td><td>3,337</td></tr><tr><td>Mid Leinster</td><td>32</td><td>1,126</td><td>667</td><td>2,175</td><td>4,000</td></tr><tr><td>Mid-West</td><td>39</td><td>869</td><td>539</td><td>1,936</td><td>3,383</td></tr><tr><td>Midlands South</td><td></td><td>624</td><td>478</td><td>1,595</td><td>2,697</td></tr><tr><td>South East</td><td>27</td><td>964</td><td>607</td><td>2,008</td><td>3,606</td></tr><tr><td>South West</td><td>1</td><td>384</td><td>301</td><td>810</td><td>1,496</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>139</td><td>8,456</td><td>6,020</td><td>19,692</td><td>34,307</td></tr></table></p><p>LTU = Long Term Unemployed</p><p>For the purpose of JobPath selection, jobseekers are divided into the following groups:</p><p>1. Clients becoming long-term unemployed i.e. passing 12 months</p><p>2. Clients who have been unemployed for 1-2 years</p><p>3. Clients who have been unemployed for 2-3 years</p><p>4. Clients who have been unemployed for more than 3 years</p><p>5. Newly unemployed clients who are assessed by the Department to be at a high risk of becoming long term unemployed</p><p>6. Clients who, although in part-time employment, have been in receipt of a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment for more than 12 months.</p><p>The Department began referring long term unemployed jobseekers from referral groups 2 - 4 and recently started referring from group 1.  Referrals from the remaining groups have not yet commenced.  Within the above groups selection for JobPath is on a random basis.  It is not possible to provide the duration of unemployment, other than by reference to the referral groups, within the time available to answer the question.</p><p>Clients receive support for 52 weeks but this period may continue for up to 130 weeks e.g. where a person engages in further education/training (for up to 26 weeks) and receives &ldquo;in work&rdquo; support (for up to 52 weeks).  The roll-out of JobPath commenced in July 2015 on a &ldquo;soft-launch&rdquo; basis.  To date no one has completed their engagement with the JobPath service.  Detailed analyses of JobPath data will be published later this year.  As indicated in &ldquo;Pathways to Work 2016 &ndash; 2020&rdquo; the Department intends to publish performance statistics of contracted providers including JobPath, LES and Job Clubs from Q3 2016.</p><p>JobPath is a payment by results model and all initial costs are borne by the companies.  JobPath is so structured that the companies will not be able to fully recover their costs until they place sufficient numbers of jobseekers into sustainable jobs.  It is not intended to publish the individual payments to the JobPath companies as these are commercially sensitive and to do so would place the State at a disadvantage both in terms of the contracts now in place and any future procurement that may be undertaken.</p><p>Departmental records indicate that, as at mid-May, some 350 clients referred to the JobPath service have seen sanctioned.  It is not possible to provide a breakdown of this information on a geographic basis within the time available to answer the question.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Participants are provided with a range of training and development supports including online modules, career advice, CV preparation and interview skills.  Clients spend a year on JobPath.  If during this time, they are placed into a job they will continue to receive in-work support for at least three months and up to twelve months to help them to maintain their employment and/or progress to full-time employment.  This support is particularly important in the case of long-term unemployed jobseekers who have been out of the work-place for a long time.  Participants on JobPath retain their social welfare entitlement and continue to be subject to the eligibility criteria for their jobseeker&rsquo;s payment.  If they are successful in gaining part-time or casual work (up to and including 3 days per week), they may still receive a jobseeker's payment for the other days of unemployment during that week if they satisfy the conditions for that payment namely:</p><p>1. Be capable of work.</p><p>2. Be available for and genuinely seeking work.</p><p>3. Satisfy the means test.</p><p>4. Meet the habitual residence condition.</p><p>In this case, the jobseeker must continue to be available for full-time employment.</p><p>All decisions regarding a person&rsquo;s welfare entitlements are made by deciding officers of the Department.  A JobPath company cannot make any decisions regarding a person&rsquo;s welfare entitlements; however the JobPath company will continue to support the jobseeker to address barriers (through training, etc.) and to progress towards full-time employment.</p><p>If the Deputy would like to provide the jobseeker&rsquo;s details, I will arrange for an official from my Department to discuss the issue with the individual concerned.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The current participation patterns have been in place since CE commenced in 1994.  In general a person must be12 months or more in receipt of a qualifying social welfare payment to be eligible for 1 year on CE.  If a person is 3 years or more in receipt of a qualifying payment social welfare payment, and over 35 years, they are eligible for 3 consecutive year&rsquo;s participation on CE.</p>  <p>  The CE budget allocation for 2016 is &euro;376.5m and it allows for 23,752 participants and 1,375 supervisory staff.  The effect of extending participation time limits on CE would be to decrease the number of places available rather than increase the cost.  The current eligibility rules and maximum durations allowed for participants are strictly enforced to allow the maximum number of people to benefit from the opportunity of a CE placement.</p>  <p>  The Department keeps the eligibility criteria for Community Employment (CE) places under on-going review to ensure that they are effective in targeting long-term unemployed jobseekers and other specific disadvantaged groups.</p></reply>

Recipients of these payments qualify for credits where they have at least one paid contribution in the previous two years or have had credited contributions in that period.  Credits are also awarded to workers who take unpaid carer&rsquo;s leave from work.</p>  <p>  Credits protect social insurance entitlements by bridging gaps in an employee&rsquo;s social insurance record, where they are not in a position to pay PRSI, such as during periods spent caring.  In combination with paid PRSI contributions, credits assist employees in qualifying for short-term schemes and enhance the level of benefit for long-term schemes.</p>  <p>  In addition, all carers, including those who do not qualify for a payment or for credits, may qualify for the homemaker scheme.  The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme is designed to help homemakers and carers qualify for state pension (contributory).  Years spent caring on a full-time basis are disregarded when calculating the state pension (contributory) rate of payment.</p>  <p>  Through the award of credits and the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme, the social insurance system already gives significant recognition of the service provided by carers.  Awarding paid contributions would be contrary to the principle that entitlement to social insurance benefits, as a right, is directly linked to the actual payment of PRSI contributions on income and to do so would have cost implications.</p>  <p>  My priority is to make progress on the commitment in our Programme regarding the level of support for carers.</p></reply>

The importance of their contribution is reflected in the range of significant supports provided by my Department to support carers in their caring role and ameliorate the financial burden of caring - indeed it is worth pointing out that the income supports that carers receive from my Department are among the highest rates in Europe.</p>  <p>  The income supports for carers from my Department include carer&rsquo;s benefit (CB), carers allowance (CA) (including half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance), carer&rsquo;s support grant (CSG), domiciliary care allowance (DCA), household benefits package ( HBP )(to carers residing with the recipient of care), and the free travel scheme.</p>  <p>  CA is a means tested payment for people who are providing full-time care and attention to a person who needs it.

In general a person must be12 months or more in receipt of a qualifying social welfare payment to be eligible for 1 year on CE.  If a person is 3 years or more in receipt of a qualifying payment social welfare payment, and over 35 years, they are eligible for 3 consecutive years participation on CE.</p>  <p>  Participants who are eligible for 1 year on CE may have their participation extended into a second consecutive year under certain circumstances but this extension is limited to a maximum of 10% of these places on a particular scheme.</p>  <p>  An individual's cumulative lifetime participation on CE is limited to 3 years (156 weeks) for persons under 55 years of age, or 6 years (312 weeks) for persons of 55 years of age up to State Pension age.</p>  <p>  The Department keeps the eligibility criteria for Community Employment (CE) places under on-going review to ensure that they are effective in targeting long-term unemployed jobseekers and other specific disadvantaged groups.  The eligibility rules and maximum durations allowed for participants are strictly enforced to ensure the benefit of CE is available to the widest possible number of jobseekers.</p>  <p>  With the ongoing welcome reductions in the live register I will be considering how best all work programmes, including CE, meet the needs of people remaining on the live register and others dependent on social welfare, in particular the long term unemployed and those most distant from the labour market.  In any consideration of the scheme, it will be important also to be cognisant of the valuable community and voluntary services delivered to local communities.</p></reply>

This income has been for many years treated in the same manner as earnings from employment for PRSI purposes, and accordingly is subject to Class A PRSI.  Therefore participants on CE schemes, similar to other private sector employees who pay Class A, can establish entitlement to the full range of short term benefits including jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit, illness benefit, and maternity benefit and to long term benefits including State pension (contributory).Budget 2016 introduced the tapered PRSI Credit to address a significant issue with the manner in which charging PRSI impacts those on lower weekly earnings.</p><p>Previously Class A employees became liable to pay PRSI on all earnings, once weekly earnings exceeded &euro;352.01.  This created a &ldquo;step effect&rdquo; as net income reduced immediately by the full 4% PRSI charge applied to all earnings.  This meant that a &euro;0.01 increase in weekly earnings of &euro;352 attracted a weekly PRSI charge of &euro;14.08.</p><p>The introduction of the PRSI Credit addressed the &ldquo;step effect&rdquo; by reducing the actual amount of PRSI charged, for those earning between &euro;352.01 and &euro;424 in a week.  At weekly earnings of &euro;352.01 the maximum PRSI Credit of &euro;12 reduces the PRSI charge payable from &euro;14.08 to &euro;2.08.</p><p>As gross earnings increase, the PRSI Credit is withdrawn on a tapered basis.  This ensures that the amount of PRSI actually charged will increase in a progressive manner as gross earnings increase.  At gross weekly earnings of &euro;424.00, the tapering of the Credit has exhausted and the PRSI charge at 4% applies.</p><p>It is estimated that the introduction of the PRSI Credit will benefit 88,369 employments, including those on CE schemes.  The benefit for individual employees depends on the level of their weekly earnings.  The following table details the extent of weekly gains, at different income bands:<table><tr><th>Weekly Income band</th><th>Range of Weekly Gains</th></tr><tr><td>352-&amp;lt;355</td><td>&euro;11.50 - &euro;12.00</td></tr><tr><td>355-&amp;lt;360</td><td>&euro;10.67 - &euro;11.50</td></tr><tr><td>360-&amp;lt;365</td><td>&euro;9.84 - &euro;10.67</td></tr><tr><td>365-&amp;lt;370</td><td>&euro;9.00 - &euro;9.84</td></tr><tr><td>370-&amp;lt;375</td><td>&euro;8.17 - &euro;9.00</td></tr><tr><td>375-&amp;lt;380</td><td>&euro;7.34 - &euro;8.17</td></tr><tr><td>380-&amp;lt;385</td><td>&euro;6.50 - &euro;7.34</td></tr><tr><td>385-&amp;lt;390</td><td>&euro;5.67 - &euro;6.50</td></tr><tr><td>390-&amp;lt;395</td><td>&euro;4.84 - &euro;5.67</td></tr><tr><td>395-&amp;lt;400</td><td>&euro;4.00 - &euro;4.84</td></tr><tr><td>400-&amp;lt;405</td><td>&euro;3.17 - &euro;4.00</td></tr><tr><td>405-&amp;lt;410</td><td>&euro;2.34 - &euro;3.17</td></tr><tr><td>410-&amp;lt;415</td><td>&euro;1.50 - &euro;2.34</td></tr><tr><td>415-&amp;lt;420</td><td>&euro;0.67 - &euro;1.50</td></tr><tr><td>420-&amp;lt;424</td><td>0.00 - &euro;0.67</td></tr></table></p><p>The potential advantage to the CE participant outside of the financial impact as outlined above in taking up a CE place is access to funding for education and training and the opportunity to pursue a major award on the National Framework of Qualifications.

This will be the first Plenary meeting of the Council since the elections on both sides of the border.  I would expect that, in addition to providing an opportunity for the Government and the new Northern Ireland Executive to discuss North/South co-operation in the months ahead, the agenda will include the usual discussions on economic and financial matters, co-operation on EU matters, review of existing NSMC work programmes and a range of other issues.</p><p>Considerable preparatory work is done in advance of NSMC meetings including preparation of meeting papers and following up on decisions of previous NSMC meetings.  Following the Plenary meeting which took place in Armagh on 11 December 2015, much work has been done in regard to the implementation of the commitments for targeted investment in cross-border economic infrastructure which are set out in Section E of the November 2015 Fresh Start Agreement.</p><p>As agreed under the Fresh Start Agreement, a report on those commitments including the A5, reviews of the Narrow Water Bridge and Ulster Canal projects, the North West Gateway Initiative and on opportunities to source further investment for all-island infrastructure projects for mutual benefit has been prepared for consideration at the next NSMC Plenary meeting.  Preparation of the report has involved Senior Officials from relevant Departments, North and South, meeting on a number of occasions since November 2015 to review and to maintain a strategic overview of economic and infrastructural investment, with particular regard to the projects and commitments set out in the Fresh Start Agreement  <i>.</i>This Agreement also contained a commitment to establish a North West Development Fund to support the North West Gateway Initiative work of Donegal County Council and Derry City and Strabane District Council.  Through the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Government has allocated &euro;2.5 million towards the establishment of the Fund.  The Northern Ireland Executive is working on the modalities of its matching funding.</p><p>At the NSMC meetings that I have attended the focus of Ministers has been on identifying  priorities for North South co-operation in their respective areas of responsibility, particularly as regards assisting economic recovery, job creation, the best use of public funds and the most effective delivery of services for citizens across the island.  The Government is committed in the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government</i>to continue to advance North South cooperation, particularly through cross-border bodies and the North South Ministerial Council and to harness the potential of the Stormont House Agreement to develop new areas of cooperation in areas such as trade, health, and tourism.  I expect therefore that the forthcoming NSMC Plenary will provide a very useful opportunity for the Government to engage with the new Northern Ireland Executive on these matters.</p></reply>

I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Mr Yildirim on his appointment and to wish him well during his tenure, which comes at a time when Turkey faces many challenges, both internally and internationally, not least in relation to the migration crisis and  the implementation of the EU-Turkey deal in that regard. </p>  <p>  Turkey is also working towards membership of the EU and we encourage them on that path, and in carrying out the reforms necessary to fulfil the conditions set out in the acquis.

In March 2015, the European Council took the decision to link the duration of the sanctions to the complete implementation of the Minsk Agreements.  Given the lack of progress in this regard, the sanctions were renewed twice, in June 2015 and again last December, when they were extended to 31 July 2016.</p>  <p>  The European Union continues to support diplomatic efforts to secure full implementation of the Minsk Agreements.  The Minsk agreements offer the only basis for a stable and lasting political resolution to the conflict in Eastern Ukraine.  The key elements of the agreements remain far from implementation.  These include the maintenance of a full and comprehensive ceasefire, withdrawal of all heavy weapons, free and fair elections in separatist controlled regions under Ukrainian law with monitoring by the OSCE, withdrawal of all foreign troops and equipment, and full Ukrainian control over its border with Russia.</p></reply>

Economic investment and growth cannot flourish where conflict and instability persist.  Likewise, equitable economic opportunity, good governance and human rights compliant application of the rule of law, where the military are subordinate to an elected civil democratic power, are the best guarantors of a secure environment.</p>  <p>  Assisting partner countries to promote good governance, equitable economic development and peace and stability are at the heart of the EU&rsquo;s Comprehensive Approach. </p>  <p>  The December 2013 European Council emphasised the importance of supporting partner countries and regional organisations, through providing training, advice, equipment and resources where appropriate, so that they can increasingly prevent or manage crises by themselves.</p>  <p>  To maximise coherence between the Union&rsquo;s and Member States&rsquo; actions in this area the European Commission and the European External Action Service (EEAS) published a Joint Communication on Capacity Building in Support of Security and Development (CBSD) in April 2015.  The policy approach for implementation of CBSD set out in the Communication was endorsed by the European Council in June 2015.  Efforts are now focussing on putting the concept into effect on the basis of an implementation plan prepared jointly by the European Commission and the EEAS.</p>  <p>  Ireland has been engaged in discussions at EU level on CBSD for several years Work is currently focussed on the legal and financial aspects of the initiative and on lessons learned from the implementation of pilot projects in the area.  No decision has been made on how the initiative will be financed and the European Commission is still considering options in this area for both short and medium term funding.</p>  <p>  To assist in the decision making process the EEAS undertook an online public consultation over the past two months.  It is hoped that further proposals regarding financing will be presented to Council later this month.  We will carefully consider proposals for financing CBSD when they are published.</p></reply>

For example: applicants for renewal through Passport Express are advised of a projected turnaround time of 15 working days, while first time applicants are advised to allow for at least 20 working days due to the additional anti-fraud measures which  may arise.  Security issues can also arise where a passport has been reported lost, damaged or stolen.</p><p>The Passport Office endeavours to process passport applications as quickly as possible.  This year, demand has been extremely high for a sustained period of months.  This corresponds to the Central Statistics Office (CSO) data which indicates that the total number of overseas trips made by Irish residents during the period January to March 2016 increased by 13.1% over the same period last year. The trend is positive in economic terms and it points to a vibrant travel industry but it has resulted in pressures on the Passport Service due to the exceptional increase in the number of applications received.</p><p>To respond to the seasonal spike in demand and the more general increase in applications a total of 233 Temporary Clerical Officers have been recruited so far this year.  This is an increase of 62 officers on last year.  Furthermore, processing work has been redistributed across passport offices and staff re-deployed from other areas of the Department as needed.  The Passport Service will continue to closely monitor the situation to ensure the effective deployment of staff resources at all times.</p><p>As of 3 June correctly completed renewal applications submitted via Passport Express are being processed within 12/13 working days (applicants are advised to allow at least 15 working days) and first-time passport applications are taking 20/21 working days (applicants are advised to allow at least 20 working days).</p><p>Applications from outside the jurisdiction can take longer.  Northern Ireland Passport Express renewal applications are processed within 21/22 working days and first-time Northern Ireland Passport Express applications are taking 23 working days.</p><p>Applicants travelling in three weeks or less should make an appointment to attend the Passport Office in Dublin or Cork in person.  Appointments can be made online using <i><font color="#2F2F2F">www.passportappointments.ie.</font></i>People with urgent travel within three days can use the Rapid Renewal Service at the Dublin Passport Office.  Appointment slots for this service become available online from 12.30 pm the day before.</p><p>Updated turnaround times are notified on the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade website at www.dfa.ie every Friday.</p><p>I recently circulated a comprehensive guidance note to Deputies and I would ask the Deputy to assist in informing members of the public about the need for citizens to check their passport validity before booking holidays or business travel and to apply at least six weeks in advance of travel to ensure that passports arrive in good time.  Applicants with no immediate travel plans or who are travelling in three weeks or more should submit their application through the An Post Passport Express Service.  The Passport Express channel is the cheapest and most convenient option for applicants and is available at post offices nationwide.</p><p>As previously advised, from 29 March this year first time adult applicants, as well as applicants who are replacing lost/stolen passports issued prior to 1 January 2005, are required to present their Public Services Card when submitting an application.  Public Services Cards are issued on the basis of a face-to-face registration process at the offices of the Department of Social Protection.</p><p>Passport Services are a key priority for me and my Department and are kept under constant review.</p></reply>

There are however many sources of data concerning socio-economic activity and issues on the island, including the Central Statistics Office (CSO) and the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA), the North South Implementation Bodies and indeed the various Departments who have sectoral responsibilities in the relevant specific areas.

This case is currently being investigated by the Brazilian authorities and, notwithstanding the appalling nature of the reported incident, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the specific circumstances of an ongoing investigation.</p>  <p>  As is the case in many other countries, violence against women remains a serious problem in Brazil.  In recent years, the Brazilian authorities have enacted a variety of legislative measures and social policies to tackle this problem and provide a structured response to assist female victims of violence. </p>  <p>  The &ldquo;Maria da Penha&rdquo; law, which was enacted in Brazil in 2006, is the principal legal instrument in relation to violence against women.  It establishes dedicated judicial and police supports to deal with violence against women, urgent protective legal measures for victims of domestic violence, and a reinforcement of the social services in this area.  The law also provides for educational measures such as the inclusion of gender equality in the school curriculum.</p>  <p>  In addition to the legal framework, in 2013 the Brazilian government introduced the &lsquo;Mulher, Viver sem Viol&ecirc;ncia&rsquo; (Women, to Live without Violence) programme to streamline and target the public services available to female victims of violence.  The programme also aimed to reduce the trauma experienced by victims of engaging with the legal system.  Measures included the establishment of dedicated women&rsquo;s centres offering access to a range of integrated legal, police and psychosocial services, as well as childcare and assistance in establishing financial independence.  To date, ten such centres have been established throughout Brazil.</p>  <p>  In addition to government campaigns to raise awareness of the problem of gender-based violence, a &ldquo;180&rdquo; Freephone service has been made available throughout Brazil, which facilitates women to report crimes and provides information as to victims&rsquo; rights and legal procedures.</p>  <p>  Our Embassy in Brasilia will continue to monitor developments in relation to this specific case and on the wider issue of gender-based violence in Brazil.</p></reply>

Where flood defences are constructed to provide protection to areas which have previously been subject to flooding, the insurance industry has made clear its position that the defences should be designed and constructed to protect against a flood event with an Annual Exceedance Probability (AEP) of 1% (commonly referred to as a 100-year flood event).  OPW flood defence schemes are generally designed and constructed to protect against a 1% AEP flood event for fluvial flood events and 0.5% AEP flood event for tidal floods.  OPW provides detailed background and technical information on its completed flood defence schemes to Insurance Ireland (II), and II members have committed to take all this information into account when assessing exposure to flood risk within these areas.  To date, OPW has provided data on 16 completed flood relief schemes to II.  II has stated, based on the results of a survey of its members, that flood cover is provided in approximately 98% of household policies nationally.  In areas protected by fixed flood defences provided by OPW (12 of the 16 schemes), 89% of policies include flood cover.  In the four schemes where demountable defences are used, 78% of policies include flood cover.  In total, 83% of policies in areas benefitting from OPW flood defences include cover against flood risk.</p>  <p>  Local authorities may carry out flood mitigation works using their own resources.  The OPW operates a Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme whose purpose is to provide funding to Local Authorities to undertake minor flood mitigation works or studies to address localised flooding and coastal protection problems within their administrative areas.  This scheme generally applies to relatively straightforward cases where a solution can be readily identified and achieved in a short time frame.</p>  <p>  Flood mitigation works carried out by local authorities are not generally designed to protect against a 1% AEP flood event, the desired standard set out in the Memorandum of Understanding.  OPW generally would not have detailed technical and design information on projects carried out by the local authorities.  For these reasons, there are no plans to include local authority flood mitigation works in the scope of the Memorandum of Understanding.</p>  <p>  The subject of insurance against the risk of flooding is one of the matters which will be addressed in the forthcoming report to Government from the Inter-Departmental Flood Policy Co-Ordination Group.</p></reply>

The Association therefore has no role in the internal workings of member schemes nor any influence or jurisdiction over them.  Furthermore, representatives on the Ombudsman Association Executive Committee are elected democratically by the relevant members of the Association.  I have been advised that in this instance, the person in question was elected at the AGM of the Association by Complaint Handler and Associate Members from both Ireland and the UK.  Given that this is an independent Association, my Department cannot comment on appointments made.</p></reply>

I can assure the Deputy that I will be engaging with my colleagues in Government and with the Oireachtas to seek to advance this commitment in the context of the forthcoming estimates and budgetary processes.</p><p>The figures quoted from the Council of Europe are from a project called Compendium-Cultural Policies and Trends in Europe.  I understand that many European counties are not included in the figures, including ten EU member states.  The data for the Compendium project are provided by independent researchers and it is not a standardised system for collection of statistics.</p><p>I further understand that the Compendium itself warns that data provided by the researchers are not comparable across countries because each researcher includes different elements in the definition of culture and these elements are reflected in the figures for public expenditure.  Figures can also include some, or all, of national, regional or local expenditure.</p><p>The issue of a definition of culture and of capturing public expenditure on culture is one which was discussed in the public consultation process that was held for the purpose of developing Ireland's first National Cultural Policy, <i>Culture 2025.</i>This will be reflected in the draft policy document which I intend to submit to Government for consideration in the coming weeks.  As I have stated previously, this first such policy will be a living document and will form the basis of an on-going dialogue with all who are interested in cultural policy.  I look forward to consideration of <i>Culture 2025</i>by the Oireachtas following its publication and would very much welcome the adoption of an all-party approach in this matter.</p><p>Expenditure on the arts in Ireland comes from multiple sources, both public and private.  I understand that the CSO does not produce national statistics that capture the totality of this expenditure as a percentage of GDP.

To this end, Ireland has identified 430 sites for protection as special areas of conservation under the Habitats Directive and 154 sites for protection as special protection areas under the Birds Directive.</p><p>The matter of further designations being required has arisen for a number of reasons. A review of each Member State's contribution to the special area of conservation network was carried out in stages by the European Commission from 2000, which involved experts contracted by the Commission, independent scientific experts and representatives of Member States. Where such reviews indicated particular habitats and species for which the Member State was considered insufficient in terms of designation, further survey work and designations were required. There have also been judgements made by the Court of Justice of the European Union requiring further designations or extensions to existing designations in Ireland. For example, Ireland's 148 raised and blanket bog natural heritage areas were designated as part of proceedings in relation to the implementation of the Environment Impact Assessment Directive in Ireland.</p><p>Legal protections, consistent with those set out in the relevant EU and national legislation, such as the requirement to obtain consent for certain activities, have applied to these sites since initially proposed for designation. Ireland's planning and environmental legislation have operated under these designations since the time the sites were first advertised for designation.</p><p>In advance of the designation of a site, my Department writes to all identified land owners with a legal interest in the site, outlining the intention to designate the site, the appeals process and how to get further information. Public notices in relation to the proposed designation are placed in the media. Government Departments, public authorities, State and semi-State agencies, and bodies representing environmental, farming and business interests are also notified directly.</p><p>Since it began, the Designated Areas Appeals Advisory Board has received 990 appeals against the proposed designation of sites. Some 271 have progressed to a full oral hearing, with a recommendation made to the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht. In the remaining cases, 254 appeals remain to be heard and the remainder were either withdrawn or resolved with my Department without the Board's involvement. In 27 cases, the Minister either accepted the Board's recommendation in part or rejected the recommendation. In all other cases, the recommendation was accepted in full.</p><p>The 27 cases occurred in the following years: <table><tr><th>Year</th><th>No of cases</th></tr><tr><td>2003</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>2006</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>2007</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>2008</td><td>14</td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>4</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Reflecting this, the Contract of Employment also agreed between the parties at the time states that: 'The NCHD shall not be required to work for more than 24 consecutive hours on-site'.</p>  <p>  This position is not at variance with the Working Time Directive. The Settlement Agreement states that it,  the Collective Agreement and the Contract of Employment for NCHDs are subject to the provisions of the Working Time Directive. The Collective Agreement also states that where the daily rest period of 11 hours provided for in the Directive and Irish transposing legislation is not provided the compensatory rest provisions set out in the Legislation shall apply. The compensatory rest provisions in the Directive are specifically designed for activities involving the need for continuity of service. The relevant article of the Directive specifically states that it encompasses hospital care and the activities of doctors in training. These provisions ensure that doctors are entitled to equivalent periods of rest to any foregone while on duty.</p>  <p>  My Department is engaging constructively with the EU Commission in relation to progressing and achieving full compliance with the EWTD in respect of  non-consultant hospital doctors.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-06-08a.986.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016060800071#WRV04300"><p>The immunisation programme in Ireland is based on the advice of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC). NIAC is a committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland comprising of experts in a number of specialties including infectious diseases, paediatrics and public health. The committee's recommendations are informed by public health advice and international best practice.  In 2009, NIAC recommended HPV vaccination for all 12 year old girls, and in September 2010, the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in the first year of second level schools. The HPV vaccine protects girls from developing cervical cancer when they are adults. It is available free of charge from the HSE for all girls in 1st year of secondary school and over 200,000 girls have received the vaccine since its introduction.</p>  <p>  In Ireland, the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) is the regulatory authority for medicines in Ireland and is the appropriate authority to which possible adverse reactions to medicinal products should be reported. In November 2015, the European Medicines Agency completed a detailed scientific review of the HPV vaccine.  The review which the HPRA participated in, specifically focused on rare reports of two conditions, complex regional pain syndrome and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome associated with heart rate increase.  The outcome of the review which was carried out by the EMA Pharmacovigilance and Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) found no evidence of a causal link between the vaccine and the two conditions examined. The European Medicines Agency has advised healthcare professionals that available data does not warrant any change to the use of HPV vaccines as there are no new safety concerns regarding HPV vaccines. Healthcare professionals should therefore continue using the vaccines in accordance with the current product information. On 12 January 2016, the European Commission endorsed the conclusion of the European Medicines Agency stating that there is no need to change the way HPV vaccines are used or to amend the product information.  This final outcome by the Commission is now binding in all member states.</p>  <p>  I am aware of claims of an association between HPV vaccination and a number of symptoms experienced by a group of young women.  It appears that some girls first suffered symptoms around the time they received the HPV vaccine, and understandably some parents have connected the vaccine to their daughter&rsquo;s condition. Anyone who is suffering ill health is eligible to seek medical attention, and to access appropriate health and social care services, irrespective of the cause of their symptoms. The individual nature of the needs of some children may require access to specialist services which can be accessed through their GP.</p></reply>

One successful candidate will commence work in early July. An additional five individuals have been offered posts and are currently in the process of appointment.

In the interim period until the newly-recruited radiographers have taken up their posts, the Hospital Group is progressing a range of options, including staff overtime and outsourcing in order to ensure service continuity for patients. </p>  <p>  It is also important to note that major developments are ongoing and planned for Galway University Hospitals.

Under the Medicinal Products (Prescription and Control of Supply) Regulations, it is prohibited for a person to supply a prescription medicine except in accordance with a prescription, and the supply must be made from a registered pharmacy by or under the personal supervision of a registered pharmacist.  A person who contravenes these Regulations is guilty of an offence.</p>  <p>  In addition, medicines which have a high potential to be misused are controlled under the Misuse of Drugs Acts.  A person who has in his possession a prescription medicine containing a controlled drug under the Misuse of Drugs legislation for the purpose of selling or supplying it, is guilty of an offence under that legislation.  A Bill to amend the Misuse of Drugs Act to bring a number of new substances, including certain prescription medicines, under the scope of that legislation is currently being drafted and it is the intention to publish it before the House rises for the summer.</p>  <p>  Regulations will also be made to introduce substantial additional controls on certain prescription drugs being traded illicitly, such as benzodiazepines and z-drugs medicines. The planned measures include introducing import and export controls, tighter prescribing and dispensing controls as well as an offence of possession, thereby assisting the law enforcement roles of Customs and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  The Health Product Regulatory Authority which is the competent authority in Ireland for human medicines, Revenue&rsquo;s Customs service and an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na work closely to prevent the unauthorised flow of illegal medicinal products into and out of the State.  The enforcement of the law relating to the sale of drugs, including prescription drugs, continues to be a priority in the Government&rsquo;s commitment to tackling the issue of drug misuse in this jurisdiction.</p></reply>

The Report&rsquo;s recommendations on reducing demand for antimicrobials, improving global surveillance of drug resistance and antimicrobial consumption in humans and animals are in line with the World Health Organisation&rsquo;s Global Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance, which Ireland supports.</p>  <p>  Ireland, through membership of the World Health Organisation, is part of the international effort aimed at tackling the global public health threat of AMR, which requires action across human and animal health sectors, agriculture and the wider environment.</p>  <p>  In May 2015, at the WHO 68th  World Health Assembly the final WHO Global Action Plan was endorsed.  It sets out five strategic objectives: </p>  <p>  (1)  to improve awareness and understanding of antimicrobial resistance;</p>  <p>  (2)  to strengthen knowledge through surveillance and research; </p>  <p>  (3)  to reduce the incidence of infection;</p>  <p>  (4)  to optimise the use of antimicrobial agents; and </p>  <p>  (5)  develop the economic case for sustainable investment that takes account of the needs of all countries, and increase investment in new medicines, diagnostic tools, vaccines and other interventions. </p>  <p>  Through adoption of the Global Action Plan, governments committed to have in place, by May 2017, a national action plan on antimicrobial resistance that is aligned with the global action plan. This national plan needs to cover the use of antimicrobial medicines in animal health and agriculture, as well as for human health. WHO will work with countries to support the development and implementation of their national plans, and will report progress to the World Health Assembly in 2017.</p>  <p>  In recognition of the serious and increasing threat of antimicrobial resistance and the requirement for a &lsquo;whole of Government&rsquo; approach to health issues, the Department of Health&rsquo;s Chief Medical Officer (CMO) and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine&rsquo;s Chief Veterinary Officer (CVO) established, with Ministerial approval, a high level National Interdepartmental AMR Consultative Committee to address this issue.

While most bacteria are effectively killed by antibiotics, certain types of bacteria possess the capacity to develop resistance to certain antibiotics whereby they are less effective and in the worst case scenario, no longer work against bacterial infections. The spread of these resistant strains is further increased, however, through poor hygiene practices and increased global travel and trade. There are also increasing concerns about the potential for spread of antimicrobial resistance in food and environmental pollution with antimicrobials e.g. through water contamination and agricultural run-off.</p><p>In Ireland AMR in key clinically important bacteria known to cause potentially serious infections, such as bloodstream infection, (BSI) has been systematically monitored over the past decade by Irish microbiology laboratories serving all acute hospitals. There has been almost complete reporting of AMR data on BSI to the Health Service Executive's Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) where data is analysed and reported back directly to participating laboratories and hospitals on a quarterly basis.  HPSC also published reports on the latest available national BSI AMR surveillance data and hospital level AMR surveillance data on its website <i>at: </i></p><p><i>htp://www.hpsc.ie/A-Z/MicrobiologyAntimicrobialResistance/InfectionControlandHAI/Surveillance/HPSCSurveillance/</i>and<i></i>.</p><p>The prevention and control of healthcare associated infections (HCAIs) and AMR continues to be a significant, long-standing patient safety and public health priority for the Department of Health.  A wide range of initiatives has been put in place in the Irish health system over several years in response to the rising incidence of AMRs. These include:</p><p>- improved surveillance of infections and prescribing;</p><p>- infection prevention and control processes; </p><p>- antimicrobial stewardship initiatives; </p><p>- public and professional awareness raising, with a significant emphasis on the education and training of healthcare professionals; </p><p>- currently reviewing and updating of National Clinical Effectiveness Committee (NCEC) national Guidelines on MRSA (2013) and Clostridium <i>difficile</i>(2014) for healthcare professionals; </p><p>- currently reviewing and updating of HIQA's National Standards for the Prevention and Control of Healthcare Associated Infections (HCAIs) (2009).</p><p>Ireland also fully supports the World Health Organisation (WHO) Global Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance and through the Interdepartmental AMR Consultative Committee, established and co-chaired by the Chief Medical Officer of this Department and the Chief Veterinary Officer of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and endorsed by both respective Ministers, is addressing the WHO's requirement for all countries to have in place an Intersectoral co-ordinating Mechanism to develop a national action plan against AMR to encompass both the human and animal sectors, agriculture and the wider environment.  The Committee was launched on European Antibiotic Awareness Day in November 2014 and has a clear role and mandate across the human and animal health sectors.  Committee membership consists of representatives of both Departments and of the relevant HSE and veterinary specialist agencies, including other relevant bodies with a remit across the two sectors; membership is representative of major stakeholders. The Committee meets bi-annually and its most recent meeting took place on 13 April 2016.</p><p>A key action for the Committee's work during 2016 is the development of Ireland's AMR national action plan in order to have in place, by May 2017, a national action plan on AMR that is aligned with the WHO's Global Action Plan. This plan will cover the use of antimicrobial medicines in animal health and agriculture, as well as for human health. The WHO is working with countries to support the development and implementation of their national plans, and will report progress to the World Health Assembly in 2017. </p><p>Ireland is fully committed to and engaged in addressing resolution of the problem of AMR and will continue to collaborate at international, EU and national levels to this end.  Ireland also supports and has actively engaged on the European Commission's Draft Council Conclusions on AMR which will be presented for adoption to the Ministerial meeting of EPSCO (Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs) on 17th June 2016; this document will call on Member States and the European Commission to develop a new and comprehensive EU Action Plan on AMR. </p></reply>

The key purpose of the Regulations is to ensure the continued availability of the type of broad hospital cover traditionally held as a minimum by the insured population and to ensure that individuals do not significantly under-insure. </p>  <p>  In June 2010, the Minister for Health asked the Health Insurance Authority (HIA) to consult with stakeholders in relation to minimum benefits to be provided by insurers. In July 2010, the Authority published its Consultation Paper and interested parties were invited to make submissions. The Authority subsequently submitted a report to the Minister which considered the costs, benefits and impacts of various different options for Minimum Benefits, having regard to the submissions received.</p>  <p>  Earlier this year my Department requested the HIA to review the 2010 report, taking account of the current health insurance market and significant developments which have taken place in recent years. The HIA has recently provided my Department with a short analysis paper to inform the Department&rsquo;s decision making.

Under the scheme, insurers receive risk equalisation and hospital utilisation credits to compensate for the additional cost of insuring older and less healthy members, which are funded by stamp duty levies payable by insurers in respect of each insured life covered. </p>  <p>  Risk equalisation credits are paid on the basis of age, gender and type of cover. Since 1 March 2016 the hospital utilisation credits paid to insurers have been expanded to include all day case admissions to hospital, in addition to the existing utilisation credit payable for all overnight stays. This enhancement to the scheme increases the support provided for less healthy people of all ages. It also supports the provision of clinically appropriate treatment on a day case basis.</p>  <p>  I support in principle the introduction of a refined health status measure for risk equalisation based on diagnosis-related groups (DRGs). The introduction of a DRG-based health status measure will target support more accurately in respect of less healthy insured members of all ages and will facilitate a better understanding of the extent to which differences in claims costs between insurers are driven by differences in the underlying risk profile of their members. Both consumers and efficient insurers will benefit from a more robust system of risk equalisation. In 2014 the Health Insurance Authority prepared a report which set out the necessary steps, time frames and additional resource requirements for incorporating DRGs into the Risk Equalisation Scheme. My Department will publish a redacted version of the report on its website this week.</p>  <p>  A key requirement is collection of and access to the necessary data from both public and private hospitals.  A DRG system has been operational in Irish public hospitals for over 20 years which groups all inpatient and daycase activity for each hospital into DRGs which are clinically similar and require similar health resources. Using DRG data for risk equalisation will require the collection and coding of all hospital activity data for both public and private hospitals under the Hospital Inpatient Enquiry (HIPE) system overseen by the Healthcare Pricing Office (HPO) of the HSE. In April 2015 my Department asked insurers to submit proposals on how best to progress this matter and to encourage private hospitals to begin collecting this data.</p>  <p>  As part of the Government&rsquo;s Health Reform Program one of the priorities for my Department and the HSE (including the HPO) is the roll out of Activity Based Funding (ABF) in line with the Government&rsquo;s policy and the ABF Implementation Plan 2015-2017.  This entails switching to ABF funding for inpatients and daycases for public patients in public hospitals and the development of a classification system for outpatients.  As indicated in the Plan, the roll out of ABF will take a number of years to implement.  The use of HIPE in relation to other policy developments will have to be considered in light of resources available and the priorities I have outlined in relation to the ABF Program.</p></reply>

The Institute of Public Health was established in 1997 as a North-South Body to promote cooperation on public health between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The Institute works to strengthen public health intelligence, build public health capacity and contribute to policy development.  The Institute is jointly funded by the Irish and Northern Ireland administrations.

Opportunities may exist for further cooperation in areas such as organ donation and transplantation, trauma services, emergency aeromedical services and genomics.  As well as benefiting patients through provision of easier access to treatment, such developments afford significant opportunity for the collation of both clinical and demographic information which can inform future health policy and development.</p></reply>

Currently, nine of the 14 designated professions have registration boards and registers have been established for seven of them.</p>  <p>  Psychotherapists and counsellors are not currently regulated under the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005. However, the Act provides that the Minister for Health may, by regulation, designate a health and social care profession not already designated if he or she considers that it is appropriate and in the public interest to do so and if specified criteria have been met.</p>  <p>  Grandfathering of existing practitioners with minimum qualifications to be specified by regulation is provided for under the Act.</p>  <p>  In accordance with the Act, the Health and Social Care Professionals Council has been consulted on the question of regulating counsellors and psychotherapists. Its detailed report on the matter is being examined carefully in the Department of Health with a view to deciding the next steps in the coming months. These steps will, I envisage, include a wider round of consultation involving the various professional bodies and other interested parties.</p>  <p>  The regulation of a new profession under the Act involves a consultation process and the making of a number of statutory instruments by the Minister for Health and by the relevant registration board.  I envisage that, subject to the outcome of consultations, the statutory phase to regulate counsellors and psychotherapists under the Act will begin later this year or early next year with the submission of draft designation regulations to the Houses of the Oireachtas for their approval.  Thereafter, I expect that the registration board should be constituted and operating during 2017.  By the end of 2018, or early 2019, the board should be in a position to make the various bye-laws to allow it to accept applications for registration.  In parallel, the regulations to protect titles and to prescribe the qualifications to be required of existing practitioners would be drafted and enacted.</p>  <p>  While the profession or professions of counsellor and psychotherapist are not specifically designated under the 2005 Act, counsellors and psychotherapists are subject to legislation similar to other practitioners including consumer legislation, competition, contract and criminal law. There are also various regulatory controls on many counsellors and psychotherapists operating in Ireland.</p>  <p>  The profession of psychologist, for example, is a designated profession under the 2005 Act which means that those psychologists who are counsellors and/or psychotherapists will begin to be regulated when the Psychologists Registration Board, which is due to be established later this year, opens its register. </p>  <p>  Psychiatrists, some of whom practice psychotherapy, are regulated under the Medical Practitioners Act 2007. Also, counsellors/therapists working in the publicly funded health sector are required to have minimum qualifications set by the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004.</p></reply>

Such eligibility to practise does not however confer automatic recognition of qualifications in another Member State. In the case of the health and social care professions, including psychology, the Directive provides for an assessment on a case-by-case basis of the formal qualifications and professional experience of an applicant against the qualifications required to practise in the host Member State i.e. Ireland. </p>  <p>  Due to the case-by-case nature of the assessment process and the need to examine an applicant&rsquo;s individual professional experience, applications can take considerable time to process.  For this reason, my Department's website advises that persons should not seek employment in their professional capacity in the public health sector unless and until their qualifications have been recognised. The Directive provides that a final decision must be communicated to the applicant within 4 months of submission of a complete application.  A decision in the case raised by Deputy Collins is due on 18 June, 2016. </p></reply>

There has been a considerable increase in demand for care in our health system in recent years.  In order to effectively manage waiting lists, those patients waiting longest must be prioritised, once emergency and urgent cases have been dealt with.  The Programme for a Partnership Government (PfPG) emphasises the need for sustained commitment to improving waiting times for patients, with a particular focus on those patients waiting longest. </p>  <p>  No scheme currently exists to commission treatment at individual patient level within the Republic of Ireland for persons resident here. The Health Service Executive does, however, operate the EU Directive on Patients' Rights in Cross Border Healthcare in Ireland.  Under the Directive, patients are entitled to have costs of cross-border healthcare services reimbursed if the healthcare service in question is among the benefits to which they are entitled in their Member State of affiliation.  The HSE is proactive in advising potential users of the Scheme that reimbursement will be at the cost of the treatment availed of abroad or the cost of providing the healthcare in Ireland, whichever is the lesser. Information on the Scheme, and its administration, is available from the National Contact Point of the HSE, details of which are on the HSE website.  The NCP is happy to advise patients of the reimbursement rate that will apply to the assessment/treatment being accessed.  The HSE endeavours to reimburse the cost of treatment incurred or the cost of providing such healthcare in the State, which ever is the lesser, to the applicant within 30 days of receipt of a claim for reimbursement, in line with Prompt Payment Legislation.</p>  <p>  The 2016 HSE Service Plan undertakes to maintain 2015 levels of service in respect of scheduled care and to continue to address waiting times as part of the regular performance and accountability process.  Currently, 94% of patients wait less than the maximum waiting time of 15 months for inpatient, daycase or outpatient procedures, with c. 60% of patients waiting less than 6 months for their required care.  With regard to the PfPG commitment to provide &euro;15 million in funding to the NTPF in 2017, the Department will engage with the National Treatment Purchase Fund and the HSE to deliver on this commitment.  As outlined in the Programme, this initiative will commence in 2017 and focus on those patients waiting longest. The PfPG also contains a commitment to continued investment of &euro;50 million per year to address waiting lists.</p></reply>

Each of these cases is the subject of a review.  I would like to stress the importance of patient  confidentiality and sensitivity to the families&rsquo; needs. </p>  <p>  One review has been completed and the report handed over to the family, however they indicated that they did not wish to see the report published.  Two of the reports are at an advanced stage, while the fourth review has commenced recently.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the results of all reviews will be conveyed to the families first and their right to confidentiality will be maintained throughout the review process and after report production.  The completion of these reviews is also important in order that any learning is embedded in our maternity services as swiftly as possible.</p>  <p>  I would like to assure the Deputy that the safety and quality of maternity services is a priority for the Department.  Since December 2015, each maternity hospital has been publishing a monthly Maternity Patient Safety Statement as recommended by the Chief Medical Officer's Portlaoise Perinatal Report of 2014.  The recent publication of Ireland&rsquo;s first Maternity Strategy demonstrates a new and enhanced focus on maternity care at both policy and service delivery level.  It provides a roadmap for how we can improve maternity and neonatal care in the years ahead ensuring that it is safe, standardised and of high quality.  This creates significant opportunity to build and develop the services we provide for women and babies over the next ten years.  My Department is working with the HSE to ensure its full implementation.</p></reply>

Recruitment can also take place in areas of critical care and emergency services.  </p>  <p>  The HSE has continuously increased staffing levels since the beginning of 2015.  By the end of April this year, overall health service employee numbers had increased by over 6,000 whole time equivalents since the start of last year, with an extra 1,600 WTEs in the first four months of 2016 alone.  The vast majority of these employees are in front line positions.  Numbers in the Medical and Dental category increased by almost 600 WTEs or 6.5% since the start of 2015 while nursing figures rose by over 1,700 or 5% during the same timeframe.</p>  <p>  It is this government&rsquo;s intention to continue to grow the health budget as the economy improves and to obtain further resources to deliver the level of service that we all want to provide to our patients.</p></reply>

The commitment is outlined in the Programme for Partnership Government, which is guided by two principles: equality of opportunity and improving the quality of life for people with disabilities.

This protocol sets out three options.</p>  <p>- Does a State Agency require the property?</p>  <p>- Open market sale, subject to favourable market conditions.</p>  <p>- Community/voluntary use will be considered only if points 1 and 2 above do not materialise.</p>  <p>  Any proposals for the property in question to must be considered in the context of the capital funding available to Health and the Government's Reform Plan relating to the State's property asset use and management. In this context, I must advise you that the Health Service Executive is required to obtain value for money when disposing of surplus property assets.  These proceeds will be re-invested in delivering much needed health care infrastructure.  As there will always be more projects than can be funded by the Exchequer facilities which support the delivery of core health services must be prioritised within the context of the overall capital envelope available to us.  Given the limited funding available and our health infrastructure needs, priority for funding must be based on verified service needs and all capital funding must be directed to supporting these core services. The HSE is concentrating on applying the limited funding available for capital works in the most effective way possible to meet health care needs now and in the future.</p>  <p>  In addition consideration must be given to the Government's Reform Plan which sets out commitments relating to property asset use and management.  These commitments include ensuring that optimal value for money is achieved in the management of the State's property portfolio.  The development and implementation of the Property Management Delivery Plan has been one of the outcomes of the reform process.  This plan aims to improve the planning and management of the public service property portfolio by improving co-ordination of strategies and activities, processes for strategic planning, projects and property management, standards for accommodation fit-out and data capture, accountability for decision making and deployment of resources. </p>  <p>  The HSE must retain some lands to accommodate future services.  Considerable work is required in advance of any decisions.</p>  <p>  The HSE has been requested to reply directly to you as regards its plans for the property in question.

In 2016, it is proposed to advance the following development priorities from the additional funding: continued development of counselling services across both primary and secondary care including the provision of three new Jigsaw mental health services in Cork, Dublin city centre and Limerick; the continued development of Community Mental Health teams; improved 24/7 response and Liaison Services; Psychiatry of Later Life; Perinatal Mental Health, and two new mental health clinical programmes, specifically ADHD in Adults and Children and Dual Diagnosis of those with Mental Illness and Substance Misuse.  </p><p>The HSE has the ability to recruit where funding exists to facilitate that recruitment; for example in the case of funded replacement posts or where additional funding has been allocated for new positions under the HSE service plan.

In 2015, the National Service Plan Budget for mental health was &euro;791 million and the outturn was &euro;785 million. The &euro;826 million budget for mental health in the 2016 National Service Plan therefore represents an increase of &euro;41 million or 5.2% over the 2015 outturn.  The 2016 budget includes &euro;35 million in heldback funding for new developments.</p>  <p>  The &euro;35m allocation for mental health will fund new service developments.  The HSE National Service Plan 2016 identifies priorities for allocation of the &euro;35 million, including the continued development of early intervention and counselling services across both primary and secondary care; the provision of new Jigsaw mental health services in Cork, Dublin City Centre and Limerick; the continued development of Community Mental Health teams; improved 24/7 response and Liaison Services; services for Psychiatry of Later Life; Perinatal Mental Health, and two new mental health clinical programmes, specifically for ADHD in Adults and Children, and for Dual Diagnosis of those with Mental Illness and Substance Misuse.  The Department of Health is currently examining proposals from the HSE relating to the development of these specific enhanced priority services, as well as proposals for the ongoing development of a range of existing and new specialist mental health services.  It is expected that a decision on the release of the 2016 development funding will be made shortly.</p>  <p>  Staff recruitment is a key element of these developments.  I am informed that, as staff recruitment takes time, the 2016 HSE National Service Plan envisages that time-related savings of approximately &euro;12m from the mental health development funding will be used, on a once-off basis, to maintain services in home care and transitional care beds, and for vaccine procurement.  The detailed use of all development funding is currently being examined and will be the subject of decisions shortly.</p></reply>

Regulations were made in 1971, 1973 and 1975 specifying the conditions covered by the LTI Scheme, which are as follows: acute leukaemia; mental handicap; cerebral palsy; mental illness (in a person under 16); cystic fibrosis; multiple sclerosis; diabetes insipidus; muscular dystrophies; diabetes mellitus; parkinsonism; epilepsy; phenylketonuria; haemophilia; spina bifida; hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide. There are no plans to extend the list of conditions covered by the LTI Scheme.</p>  <p>  Under the Drugs Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;144 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</p>  <p>  Under the provisions of the Health Acts, medical cards are provided to persons who are unable, without undue hardship, to arrange health services for themselves and their dependants. In the assessment process, the HSE can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.</p></reply>

The implementation programme includes the provision of dementia-specific intensive homecare packages, dementia-specific resources for GPs and primary care teams, and measures to raise public awareness, address stigma and promote the inclusion and involvement of people with dementia in society. The HSE has established a National Office for Dementia to coordinate the implementation of the Strategy. </p>  <p>  The Strategy clearly distinguishes between actions that can be progressed within current resources and those which will require additional resources to implement. Section 8 of the Strategy, which is devoted to research and information systems , acknowledges the need for better evidence in relation to dementia, including, inter alia, improved estimates of prevalence across all care settings, diagnostic rates, sub-types and clinical outcomes for people with dementia. The following actions are outlined:  </p>  <p>  - The HSE will ensure that data from the Single Assessment Tool is factored into research to inform dementia care in Ireland;</p>  <p>  - The HSE will take measures to ensure appropriate recording and coding of dementia in primary care and the development of practice-based dementia registers; and</p>  <p>  - Hospitals will take measures to encourage better recording and coding of a primary or secondary diagnosis of dementia in hospital records and charts to ensure that admissions, re-admissions, lengths of stay and discharge for people with dementia are captured on HIPE (Hospital In-Patient Enquiry).</p>  <p>  It is anticipated that actions in all of these areas together with the planned development of the Electronic Health Care Record will lead to better information on dementia patients in primary, secondary and long term care.</p></reply>

Both schemes remain closed.</p><p>However, the Government also decided that monthly payments will continue to be made by the Health Service Executive to 4,700 people who were in receipt of the Mobility Allowance at the time the scheme closed, on the basis that this would prevent hardship and, on an interim basis, alleviate stress, anxiety and uncertainty among a vulnerable group in society.</p><p>The Government decided that the detailed preparatory work required for a new Transport Support Scheme and associated statutory provisions should be progressed by the Minister for Health.  The Department is seeking a solution which would best meet the aim of supporting people with severe disabilities who require additional income to contribute towards the cost of their mobility needs, while remaining within the available budget and satisfying all legal and equality concerns.</p><p>Work is ongoing on the policy proposals to be brought to Government for the drafting of primary legislation for a new scheme.  The proposals seek to ensure that:</p><p>-There is a firm statutory basis to the scheme's operation;</p><p>-There is transparency and equity in the eligibility criteria attaching to scheme;</p><p>-Resources are targeted at those with the greatest needs; and</p><p>-The scheme is capable of being costed and it is affordable on its introduction and on an ongoing basis.</p><p>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the Programme for Partnership Government acknowledges the ongoing drafting of primary legislation for a new Transport Support Scheme.</p></reply>

Aquaculture enterprises that have not been licensed in compliance with EU law could not receive EU co-funded aid or other aid and the licensing decision in relation to those enterprises cannot be pre judged.  The EU Commission has confirmed this position to the industry at the EU Operational Programme Monitoring Committee.  The Operational Programme also specifies that supports for productive investments in aquaculture will be available only to sites that are fully licensed in compliance with the Habitats and Birds Directives.  This provision affects only aquaculture sites located in Natura 2000 areas.</p>  <p>  In January 2016, Minister Coveney announced the launch of two dedicated EMFF support schemes for the aquaculture sector.  A Knowledge Gateway Scheme is providing grants of up to &euro;200,000 to aquaculture enterprises for projects relating to innovation, animal welfare and disease management, training and advisory services.  A Sustainable Aquaculture Scheme is providing grants of up to &euro;500,000 to aquaculture enterprises for capital investments in their sites.  Last month, I was delighted to announce grants under these two schemes to 12 aquaculture enterprises and I expect to announce further grants as the year progresses.</p>  <p>  I fully realise that aquaculture sites located in Natura 2000 areas where licensing decisions have yet to be made in accordance with the EU Habitats and Birds Directives are not in a position to access supports for productive investments pending a determination of their aquaculture and foreshore licence applications and in particular pending completion of the required Habitats Directive Appropriate Assessments.  My Department is engaged in an extensive process with the Marine Institute and National Parks and Wildlife Service to complete those Appropriate Assessments.  The Appropriate Assessment process has now been completed in respect of sixteen bays and my Department is progressing licence determinations having regard to the conclusions of those assessments and other relevant factors as required under law.  The &euro;30 million EMFF funds are available for the full period of the EMFF OP and I expect that as licence determinations are made, these funds will be fully invested by the sector.</p></reply>

Significant works in this year&rsquo;s capital programme include the West wharf upgrade, Harbour Office Upgrade and Harbour Road re-surfacing. </p>  <p>  Also included in this years&rsquo; programme is a &euro;160,000 project to design a breakwater in Dunmore East.  It is envisaged that a new breakwater would protect the existing harbour, and provide a safer haven for fishing and leisure vessels alike.  My Department advertised for Consultants on eTenders on 17th April 2016.  The tender deadline was extended to 23rd May following a request from one of the consultants.  The tenders are being assessed at present. </p>  <p>  The intention is that a consultant will be appointed in the coming weeks to advance the design.  The consultancy work is to examine various breakwater options to give protection to the present harbour. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, all developments in the six Fishery Harbour Centres, including a possible future breakwater project, at Dunmore East Fishery Harbour Centre will be considered under future Capital Programmes on the basis of available exchequer funding and competing priorities. </p></reply>

The issues addressed by the Committee were in the main subject of a special report of the Comptroller and Auditor General (special report no. 82) in April 2014.</p>  <p>  My Department has accepted the recommendations of the Committee&rsquo;s report.  The report itself acknowledged the strategic importance of the Fishery Harbour Centres which are owned and managed by my Department under Statute.  The fact that 84% of all fish landings into the State are landed into the six Fishery Harbour Centres emphasises how critical this infrastructure is for the ongoing development and management of our Seafood Sector.</p>  <p>  The report also noted that improvements have taken place in the management of the FHCs since the Department took over responsibility for them in October 2007.</p>  <p>  My Department has over recent years substantially restructured its administrative staffing, structures, procedures and operational management of the harbours and I am confident these changes will continue to generate improvements in the functioning and management of the harbours.  This revised structure serves to provide a clear segregation of the Department&rsquo;s Fishery Harbour Centres control and development responsibilities as enshrined under the Fishery Harbour Centres Act, 1968.</p>  <p>  A Fishery Harbour Centre Management Committee, at Principal Officer Level has been established.  The Management Committee comprises representation from the Sea Fisheries Administration Division, the Marine Engineering Division and the Accounts Division of the Department.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department have met with Enterprise Ireland, most recently on 20 January 2016, to discuss potential cooperation opportunities by making vacant Harbour properties available to facilitate the delivery of suitable Enterprise Ireland projects.  These meetings are now a normal part of operations and it is intended for the next meeting to take place in July. </p>  <p>  The majority of Fishery Harbour Centre (FHC) properties are leased to a variety of public and private sector tenants which support the FHCs&rsquo; role as working fishery harbours in addition to a broad range of other marine and leisure activities.  My Department is working closely with the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office to regularise existing complex legacy property arrangements, and to gain vacant possession of other properties with a view to making them available by means of Public Tender.  Reviews of the FHCs&rsquo; property portfolio (213 properties) take place on an ongoing basis in relation to maximising returns to the Fishery Harbour Centre Fund.  Six vacant FHC properties were put out to public tender in 2015/2016 and leases have now been signed for four properties. </p></reply>

Regulation 1760/2000 of the European Parliament and Council and Regulation 1825/2000 of the Commission made provision for the compulsory labelling of beef marketed in the Community, including animals imported into Ireland for slaughter.  Under these rules, food business operators are required to label fresh, frozen or minced beef with details of the slaughterhouse and de-boning hall in which the animal was processed as well as the country in which it was born, reared and slaughtered.</p>  <p>  Last year my predecessor signed into law a Statutory Instrument No 113 of 2015, to give effect to new European Regulations extending mandatory country of origin labelling to meat from sheep, pigs, poultry and goats.  This requires labelling with the Member State or third country of rearing and the Member State or third country of slaughter for these meats.  The term &lsquo;Origin&rsquo; can only be used where the country/member state of birth is the same as the country of rearing and slaughter.</p>  <p>  My Department is liaising with the Department of Health with a view to extending the legislation to include &ldquo;loose meats&rdquo; e.g. meat cuts that are sold through butcher counters.</p></reply>

Both the sectoral and plenary meetings usually take place bi-annually.</p>  <p>  Apart from the agreed areas of co-operation both sides use the opportunity to discuss other areas of mutual concern/interest.  For example the issue of farm safety is of huge importance to both jurisdictions and one where there is on-going significant sharing of information with a view to reducing the incidence of injury and fatalities on farms.  In this regard a North/South Farm Safety Group (NSFSG) was established and it was agreed that as well as meeting bi-annually to discuss areas of collaboration and to develop joint initiatives to increase farm safety awareness, there was agreement to share intelligence on farm safety such as research material and grant scheme development specifications.  In addition a very successful All Island Farm Safety Conference took place in November 2015 which was jointly hosted by the Irish Health and Safety Authority and the Health and Safety Executive Northern Ireland.</p></reply>

EU Regulations governing the administration of these schemes require that full and comprehensive administrative checks, including in some cases on farm inspections, be completed before any payments issue.</p>  <p>  The application of the person named was selected for a Cross- Compliance inspection.  This inspection identified non-compliance under the Good Agricultural and Environmental Conditions   (GAEC) requirements in that hedgerows, which are a designated landscape feature, had been removed and no replacement hedge had been planted.  It was noted that sod ditches had also been removed, as sod ditches/earthen banks are not a concern for cross compliance, they do not have to be replaced.  However, where hedgerows are growing on top of them the requirement is that the hedgerow must be replaced.  This resulted in an overall penalty of 5% being applied against the 2014 Direct Schemes payments.</p>  <p>  The person named was notified of this decision on 3 September 2014.  The person named requested a review of this decision and this request was examined by the District Inspector who upheld the inspection findings.  The persons named were notified of the outcome on 18 January 2016.  The person named was also notified of their right to appeal to the independent Agriculture Appeals Office within three months.  I understand that no such request has as yet been received by that office.</p>  <p>  A further Cross Compliance inspection was carried out on the holding of the person named in 2015.  It was identified that the hedgerows had still not been replaced and a further 5% penalty was applied, however due to the previous non-compliance in 2014 the penalty was increased to 15% as required under the regulations relating to re-occurrence/repetition.  The person named was notified of this outcome on 22 January 2016.  The person named was also notified of the right to seek a review of this decision.  To date no request for a review has been received by my Department. In the event that the person named is dissatisfied with the outcome of any such review the decision can be appealed to the independent Agriculture Appeals Office, within three months.</p>  <p>  The delay in replying to the initial queries raised by the Deputy is regretted.

The dairy production system has the joint lowest carbon footprint in the EU.  Environmentally sustainable development of the agri-food sector remains a priority for my Department and an independent Environmental Analysis (including a Strategic Environmental Assessment and an Appropriate Assessment) was prepared in parallel with the development of the current ten year Food Wise 2025 strategy.</p>  <p> The focus of Food Wise 2025 is to build on Food Harvest 2020, with continued growth in the value of Irish agri-food including dairy production.  While this is likely to mean some increase in dairy numbers, it is not expected that there will be a significant increase in overall cattle numbers.</p>  <p>  The Environmental Analysis has identified any potential significant environmental impacts associated with implementation of Food Wise, and a large number of recommendations in this regard are contained in Food Wise itself as well as in the Environmental Analysis.  Amongst these recommendations are:</p>  <p>  - the establishment of a sustainability sub-committee to monitor any environmental impacts during the implementation phase.  This committee, with membership from key Government Departments, the EPA, Teagasc, the Marine Institute and academia, will (inter alia) carefully monitor total livestock numbers and any implications for greenhouse gas emissions.</p>  <p>  - the commissioning of further work on the development of cost effective greenhouse gas mitigation measures.</p>  <p>  The extent of the challenge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, in line with our EU commitments, is clearly understood by Government, as reflected in the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that Ireland is on course to comply with the annual targets under the 2009 EU Effort Sharing Decision in the first half of the 2013-2020 compliance period.  However, there will be a significant compliance challenge in the years 2016-2020 which will be addressed in the National Mitigation Plan, currently being prepared by all relevant sectors including my Department.</p>  <p>  Ireland is engaged in intensive discussions, in a whole of Government approach, with the European Commission to highlight the importance of ensuring a coherent approach to the twin challenges of food security and increasing global demand for food with EU climate ambition.  An important step forward in this regard was taken at the October 2014 European Council.  The recent Paris agreement further recognises the fundamental priority of safeguarding food production.</p></reply>

Once these animal certification requirements are met, dogs, including greyhounds, may be exported internationally. Exporters are also required to comply with the provisions of Council Regulation (EC) No 1 of 2005 on the protection of animals during transport.</p>  <p>  I am aware that a very small number of greyhounds have been exported to Macau in the past two months.  I understand that Bord na gCon, which is responsible for the governance, regulation and development of the greyhound industry in the Republic of Ireland and the well-being of greyhounds, has developed a Code of Practice in relation to the welfare of greyhounds which sets out specific standards that all individuals engaged in the care and management of registered greyhounds are expected to meet.  The Code emphasises that owners and keepers must take full responsibility for the physical and social well-being of greyhounds in line with best welfare practice.

All farmers have the option of lodging their applications online themselves or through an authorised agent.  Online application involves a range of advantages for farmers, which help to ensure the continued efficient and effective delivery of these vital payments.  Additional advantages for online applicants in 2016 included the implementation of preliminary checks.  Under this provision, online applicants are informed, within a specified time frame, of a number of common land errors (over-claims, dual claims and overlaps) and given the opportunity to avoid area penalties as would have applied in previous years.</p>  <p>  Since the introduction of online applications in 2007 my Department has worked closely with both farmers and authorised agents to make the online system more user friendly.  New features have been introduced including the online updating of maps, view payments, respond to queries online and much more.  In 2016, over 101,000 farmers have applied online for the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS).</p>  <p>  My Department recognises the challenges faced by certain applicants, including those who are not familiar with the use of the technology that is required, or who may have difficulty in accessing the online system to lodge BPS applications.  Accordingly, my Department put in place a comprehensive system of support for online applicants in 2016, including:</p>  <p>  - a dedicated helpdesk,</p>  <p>  - one to one assistance for applicants lodging on-line applications at a number of regional locations in the spring of this year, and</p>  <p>  - a similar service at its offices in Portlaoise for several weeks in advance of the closing date.</p>  <p>  The position with regard to the receipt of BPS applications is subject to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 809/2014 which sets out specific requirements with regard to geo-spatial (online) aid applications for the BPS.  The regulation sets out that Member States shall provide for geo-spatial (online) applications, and that 75% of beneficiaries in 2017 and all beneficiaries in 2018 must apply online.  My Department has already reached the 2017 target in 2016. </p>  <p>  My Department is committed to continuing to provide targeted supports to applicants as the process continues to ensure access to the BPS is not impeded and that regulatory requirements are met.</p></reply>

The UK is by far our largest single trading partner, with CSO figures indicating that exports of agricultural products in 2015 were worth &euro;5.1 billion and imports worth &euro;3.8 billion.  Recent reports by the ESRI and Teagasc have highlighted the disproportionate impact a Brexit could have on the agri-food sector.</p>  <p>  My Department has therefore been giving careful consideration to the potential impact, looking at the areas in which the greatest risks are likely to arise and on which we will need to focus, should exit negotiations commence in the coming months.  Impacts are foreseen in areas relating to tariffs and trade, the EU budget, regulations and standards, and customs controls and certification.</p>  <p>  For tariffs and trade arrangements, including the future direction of UK trade policy, it is clear that potential differences in tariffs could restrict trade in both directions and affect traditional supply practices, particularly for raw materials.  Preferential agreements already in place with third countries could require adjustment to take account of a UK withdrawal.  A further issue that could arise is the freedom of the UK to negotiate with other third countries.  This could present a competitiveness challenge for third country suppliers, such as Ireland.  However, negotiating such agreements could be a lengthy process.</p>  <p>  As a net contributor to the EU budget, a UK exit will result in a loss of the UK contribution to the EU budget of between 5% and 10%, with possible consequential implications for CAP spending in the years ahead.</p>  <p>  While an immediate impact is not foreseen on regulations and standards, potential differences could arise if the UK takes a different path to the EU, for example, in areas such as origin labelling.</p>  <p>  Customs controls and certification issues are also likely to re-emerge, which will undoubtedly lead to additional administrative costs.</p>  <p>  I and my Department are continuing to reflect on these matters so that, should the UK decide to leave, we are prepared to establish our priorities for the negotiations in the agri-food sector and to engage in these negotiations at the earliest possible date.  My Department is also in ongoing consultation with our Government colleagues to ensure there is a coherent, whole-of-Government approach to the issue.</p></reply>

However, my Department plays a vital role in the enforcement and oversight of this legislation under service contract to the Food Safety Authority of Ireland.</p><p>The safety and traceability of food placed on the market is the primary responsibility of the food business operators (FBOs).  The role of National Competent Agencies is to confirm compliance with this requirement.  This is done by inspecting establishments and auditing the food safety management systems which operators have in place. These controls are applied at different stages in the food supply chain.<b></b>Regulation (EC) No. 178 of 2002 sets out the general principles and requirements of EU food law and stipulates that FBOs must, at all stages of production, processing and distribution within their business, ensure food law requirements are satisfied.  As regards traceability, the regulations require that FBOs have systems in place to identify any person who supplies the business with a food, and a system to identify other businesses to which their product has been supplied forward.  This is known as the &lsquo;one step forward, one step backward&rsquo; traceability system.  There are additional requirements for certain fishery and aquaculture products under the Control Regulation (Council Regulation EU No 1224/2009 establishing a community control system for ensuring compliance with the rules of the Common Fisheries Policy and Commission Implementing Regulation No 404/2011) from first sale to subsequent stages of production, processing and distribution up to the point of retail. </p><p>My Department has a permanent veterinary presence at all slaughter plants it approves.  Controls at plants only engaged in secondary processing are carried out at a frequency determined by an annual risk assessment.  An annual audit of imported products is conducted in each Department-approved plant, including checks on physical identity, labelling and documentary checks for product originating in EU Member States and third countries.  Labelling and documentary checks are routinely conducted by the Department.</p><p>The import of products of animal origin from third countries is governed by a robust legislative framework laid down at EU level, controlled by Member States in the first instance and audited by the European Commission&rsquo;s Directorate General for Health and Food Safety (formerly called FVO) to ensure compliance with all relevant food safety standards.  The legislation establishes health and supervisory requirements designed to ensure imported products meet standards equivalent to those required for production and trade between Member States.  Border Inspection Posts are also operated by my Department.  Import control procedures on products of animal and fish origin are extremely prescriptive and strictly audited by the Directorate General for Health and Food Safety to ensure compliance and inspection finding reports are available on that website.</p></reply>

Last year alone, the value of Irish food and drink exports reached &euro;10.8 billion.  I am cognisant therefore of the need to continue to support the development of the industry, based on an international reputation for producing high-quality food to excellent safety standards.  Food Wise 2025 provides the framework for the development of the industry over the next decade, and I intend to work with all of the stakeholders and through the High Level Implementation Committee to ensure that the objectives we have set ourselves are achieved.  In relation to trade agreements, I think the imperative must at all times be to push hard to make progress in areas where Ireland has offensive interests, and to strongly defend those areas where threats may arise.  Taking TTIP as an example, Ireland has both offensive and defensive interests.  We see worthwhile opportunities in the US for cheese, powdered milks and sports products, and further opportunities for branded packaged butter, if we can remove some regulatory barriers.  Prepared consumer foods and fish could also benefit from trade liberalisation.   </p>  <p>  Beef is a unique sector in that we have both offensive and defensive interests.  In the long term, any significant increase in beef imports to the EU could have adverse effects on the Irish industry.  That was confirmed by a number of recent studies and is an issue we have raised strongly with the European Commission.  We therefore have legitimate concerns about the size, composition and administration of any beef quota offered to the US. </p>  <p>  We should also seek a significant EU quota for beef to the US as part of any TTIP agreement.  Following the re-opening of the market, Irish beef exports now fall under a 65,000-tonne quota for &lsquo;other countries&rsquo; on a first come, first served basis.  This is mainly filled by Latin American countries.  When we get access for manufacturing beef we would stand to benefit greatly from a specific EU import quota in the US, and this can only be achieved through TTIP. </p>  <p>  I have also been very active in recent months in highlighting the potentially very damaging impact of a MERCOSUR deal on the European agriculture sector, and on the beef sector in particular.  Ireland played a leading role in raising concerns with the Commission about the potentially very severe impact that a MERCOSUR deal would have on the Irish and EU agriculture sector, and in particular on the beef sector.  The Commission responded by excluding a beef TRQ from the offer made on 11 May.  While this is a welcome development, there is a need for continued vigilance in relation to the conduct of these trade negotiations.  I will continue to insist that further detailed analysis is undertaken in order to fully assess the cumulative impact of beef quota concessions granted under other free trade agreements. I will also ensure the timing and content of any beef TRQ offer is handled appropriately, and in a manner that safeguards the interests of the Irish and European beef sector in particular.</p></reply>

In this context, it is worthwhile to note that a major revamp of the European Union Animal Health Law (AHL) was agreed by the Council and the European Parliament earlier this year.  The new AHL provides for the adoption of a single and simplified regulatory framework for animal health by putting greater focus on preventative measures, disease surveillance, controls and research in order to reduce the incidence of animal diseases and minimise the impact of outbreaks when they occur.  It sets out the basic principles of animal health including rules for movements of animals, animal products and products of animal origin and disease control and eradication measures.  It also lays down conditions for early detection and disease notification.  Some 40 existing EU directives and regulations will be superseded when the AHL is implemented.</p>  <p>  With regard to Ireland, the position is that the livestock sector contributes very substantially to economic development and growth in exports.  FoodWise 2025 envisages a further significant expansion in agricultural output, primarily based on animal production over the next 10 years.  In view of this and, having regard to the fact that animal health is a major factor in on-farm productivity and profitability, it is essential that all stakeholders involved in the livestock sector collaborate to ensure, insofar as possible, compliance with the highest animal health standards.  In this context, I plan to launch a consultation process in the coming weeks on the development of a new Farmed Animal Health Strategy framework for Ireland.  I look forward to the outcome of this process.</p></reply>

This new Programme will be the principal source of public investment in our seafood sector up to at least 2020.</p>  <p>  Through FoodWise, Harvesting Our Ocean Wealth, the National Strategic Plan for Sustainable Aquaculture Development and this new EMFF Operational Programme, I am targeting growth of the seafood industry to &euro;1 billion in sales by 2020, with growth in employment of 3,000 extra jobs.</p>  <p>  Seafood is widely recognised as a high-growth area of our economy.  Indeed, aquaculture and seafood processing are also recognised as potential high-growth sectors at EU level and globally.  The new EMFF Operational Programme will be a key element in achievement of the growth potential of our seafood sector.  It will provide the capital to assist seafood enterprises to sustainably grow their production, add value to our seafood exports and create much needed employment in our coastal communities.</p>  <p>  The Government has made available almost &euro;30 million over the course of the EMFF OP for sustainable development of aquaculture, with &euro;33 million available for investment in marketing and processing of seafood, &euro;67 million for investment in fisheries and &euro;12 million for investment in economic development of fishing communities.</p>  <p>  Following on from the launch of the EMFF OP, I was delighted to announce in May the award of &euro;4.3 million in EMFF grant aid to 51 seafood enterprises that will be the catalyst for &euro;21 million in total investment by these enterprises. Some &euro;3.4 million of that grant aid was awarded to 27 enterprises under the Seafood Capital Investment Scheme.  These particular investments alone are projected to create 316 jobs by 2019 and additional sales of &euro;77 million by 2019.

The Food Wise strategy for the sector contains detailed recommendations aimed at improving value added and productivity at farm and food industry level through a focus on sustainability, efficiency, knowledge transfer and innovation.</p><p>Direct payments estimated by Teagasc at an average of over &euro;17,000 per farm in 2015, provide a valuable source of farm income support and act as a hedge against price volatility.</p><p>With regard to farm borrowings, like my predecessor, I will have regular meetings with the CEOs of the main banks, who are all aware of price volatility issues, and are planning accordingly in terms of managing their farm loan books.

In addition to economic benefits, it will add to the social capital of communities throughout the country, as it has done for generations.</p>  <p>  The overriding objective of HRI&rsquo;s strategic plan however is that by 2020 the industry will be delivering an economic return to the Irish economy significantly beyond the existing levels (current return to the economy is &euro;1.1 Billion).</p>  <p>  I am looking forward to meeting the Chairman and the CEO of Horse Racing Ireland in the near future to discuss the ambitious targets set out in this document.

Evidence suggests that the sector can have a significant impact on local economies as businesses are typically owner managed and may be closely linked to local farms.  The FoodWise 2025 strategy recognises the value of this sector and its potential for development and employment. It recommends actions to help the artisan sector to realise its potential, including festival markets, a pipeline for new entrants to the Artisan Food Market at Bloom, promoting meet the buyer opportunities, delivery of small business specific consumer and market insights and programmes to assist producers to extend their business reach. Bloom 2016 is taking place over a 5 day period from Thursday 2nd to Monday 6th June. The Food Markets are an established feature. With over 100 artisan and fresh food producers involved, it is a true showcase for the finest local foods Ireland has to offer. The market stalls are run by the producers, which provides a unique opportunity for visitors to learn first-hand about the products on offer and how best to prepare them. </p>  <p>  A number of artisan businesses have to date participated in successful programmes such as Food Academy (developed by Bord Bia, Local Enterprise Offices and Musgraves/Supervalu) and Food Works (developed by Bord Bia, Teagasc and Enterprise Ireland) which have generated new business. </p>  <p>  Within the artisan sector, the farmhouse cheese sector includes over 50 cheese-makers producing more than 150 types of cheese valued at over &euro;12 million per annum at farm gate level. My Department is supporting a three year programme managed by Bord Bia under the EU Promotion Scheme to promote and increase awareness of farmhouse cheese. It is projected that with the overall increase in milk production following the abolition of milk quotas, farmhouse and specialty cheese output could increase to just over 4,500 tonnes per annum worth around &euro;33m without requiring significant additional capital expenditure. </p>  <p>  My Department is also supporting the UCC Diploma in Speciality Food Production, a food science and food business course for food producers, potential start-ups and those interested in developing businesses and/or promoting the artisan sector. More than 180 students have graduated to date, many of whom are successfully running small businesses in the artisan and speciality food sector in Ireland. My Department will be continuing to provide bursaries for the Diploma students over the next 4 years.   </p>  <p>  Growth prospects for the sector are positive overall, driven by increased consumer interest in the provenance of food, environmental concerns, health and a desire to support the local economy.</p></reply>

These twin imperatives informed Ireland&rsquo;s approach to the negotiations in 2012 and 2013, and they continue to inform the process by which the various elements of CAP reform are now being delivered.  Taking the direct payments system as an example, the Deputy may recall that Ireland proposed an alternative approach to the redistribution of direct payments than that originally advocated by the European Commission, precisely because we wanted to ensure that the direct payments system could be made fairer and more equitable while at the same time ensuring that the level of transfer of payments between farmers was not of a scale that might jeopardise our objectives for the development of the sector. We now have a system which satisfies these two requirements. Last year&rsquo;s payments under the Basic Payment and other schemes represented the start of a process that, by 2019, will see a considerable shift in the balance of payments from those previously receiving very high rates per hectare to those previously receiving much lower rates of payment. I believe that this not only makes the direct payments system fairer, but also ensures that it continues to provide support and income stability that will allow farmers to respond to the demands of the market. As such, it also provides a vital tool to help us achieve the objectives outlined in the Food Wise 2025 strategy.   </p>  <p>  Significant steps have also been taken to encourage the participation of young farmers in agriculture, which is vital in terms of securing the critical role that farm families play in the development of the sector. In addition to receiving a top-up of direct payments, young farmers are prioritised in the allocation of payment entitlements from the national reserve. These direct payments measures are further complemented by supports under the 2014-2020 Rural Development Programme where, for example, enhanced support for capital investment by young farmers has been made available under the TAMS schemes. </p>  <p>  More generally under Pillar 2 of the CAP, I am focussed on the socio-economic development of our farms and of our rural areas so that all farm families have an opportunity to realise their potential. Schemes for improving sustainability (such as GLAS and the Beef Data and Genomics Programme) and competitiveness (such as TAMS) are complemented by continued strong support for disadvantaged areas (now known as Areas of Natural Constraint). I believe this combination provides a vital range of supports that will allow farm families to continue to benefit from the CAP in an equitable manner while supporting their development over the coming years.</p></reply>

Applications for funding from animal welfare organisations are assessed by my Department and awards made on the basis of certain criteria, including the level and type of assistance provided by the organisation in the delivery of care and welfare services to animals and the level of funding raised by organisations from other sources to support welfare activities.I accept that organisations in the voluntary sector face challenges in raising funds and many rely on support of volunteers to assist in the delivery of services. This is one of the reasons why financial assistance is being provided by my Department. Since December 2010, the organisation in question has been awarded funding amounting to almost &euro;42,000, including &euro;10,000 allocated in December last to support its work over the coming year. I am satisfied that this represents a reasonable level of support having regard to the current budgetary constraints. </p><p>Payments of this kind by my Department are made on an <i>ex gratia</i>basis and it is not possible for the Department to increase the funding already provided last December. It is therefore imperative that the organisation concerned seeks to maximise funding from other sources to support their welfare activities and should not develop an expectation of, or reliance upon, repeat funding from this Department in order to sustain its activities into the future.</p><p>The scheme for 2017 will be advertised shortly and an application form will be forwarded to the organisation concerned in due course.</p></reply>

As one of the proposers of the Dairy Forum my goal is to ensure that it continues to work constructively as a vehicle for addressing issues of concern to farmers and others in the sector. The Forum has come forward with some good initiatives for farmers already, including an initiative on improving cashflow planning at farm level, which will be rolled out shortly.  The price of milk and dairy commodities is determined by a range of factors, including supply and demand at international level. Food commodity markets including dairy markets have been characterised by significant levels of volatility for a number of years and this trend has continued throughout 2015 and into 2016. Factors contributing to this global price volatility include the Russian Ban and the softening of Chinese demand on one side, coupled with increased production among key global producers, including the EU on the supply side. The longer term demographic and demand perspectives remain positive, but there is no doubt that 2016 will continue to be a challenging year.   </p>  <p>  Dealing with price volatility is a major challenge for the sector. The Single Farm Payment provides some measure of income stability, and EU market support measures will have a role to play. These measures are not enough on their own, however. The sector needs to look at measures to reduce costs on farms, and at the development of new tools, including fixed price contracts, futures markets and more flexible financing arrangements for farmers. I expect all of the stakeholders in the sector, including processors and banks, to play an active role in the development of such instruments.</p>  <p>  I very much welcome the EU Presidency conclusions on a package of support measures to address challenges in the dairy and pigmeat sectors agreed in Brussels at Council in March. This follows on from an earlier package of measures agreed in September of last year and takes account of the ongoing difficulties in the sector.   </p>  <p>  In relation to Direct Payments I have asked the Commission to make the maximum possible provision for advance payment of the &euro;1.2 billion in direct payments to Irish farmers. I believe that this would be a particularly useful measure to improve cash flow for farm families at this time.   </p>  <p>  I also believe that we should seek EU funding for further direct targeted aid for dairy farmers. I acknowledge that finding these funds within the EU budget will be a real challenge but in the very difficult circumstances in which our farm families now find themselves I am determined to exert the maximum pressure on this point.   </p>  <p>  The package previously announced includes a number of proposals by Ireland to the Commission in advance of Council, in particular the doubling of the intervention ceiling for skimmed milk powder and butter. This extra allocation has been utilised in the interim and recently Commissioner Hogan has indicated the Commission&rsquo;s willingness to further increase this threshold to 350,000 tonnes. SMP intervention is the key EU support tool for dairy markets and helps to put a floor under prices in this extended period of downward price volatility. This extension will be particularly welcomed by Irish producers in the context of Irish dairy production patterns in the dairy sector which peak during the current period.   </p>  <p>  In terms of input costs at farm level, Ireland has called on the Commission to consider temporarily suspending EU import tariffs on fertilisers. I understand that the Commission is examining this request at present. At national level, I will continue to support the work of Teagasc, the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation and Animal Health Ireland to increase on farm efficiency and reduce input costs. The EU Presidency conclusions also refer to the possibility of advance payments under CAP, as was done in 2015. In addition my Department recently paid &euro;26.4m in direct aid to dairy farmers, co-funded by the exchequer and the EU, to assist with liquidity and cash-flow issues on dairy farms.</p>  <p>  I also welcome the proposal for the European Investment Bank (EIB) and member states to work together with the Commission on the feasibility of an EU export credit tool. My Department will continue to engage with the Irish banking system to ensure there is a full appreciation of the temporary impact of downward price volatility on farm enterprises which are financially sound in the medium term. </p>  <p>  It remains clear that we need to deal urgently and effectively with this temporary problem. We must ensure that EU farmers are protected from the worst impacts of low commodity prices in an appropriate way, but remain well placed to avail of emerging opportunities when markets recover.  Ireland is strongly positioned as a competitive producer of dairy, and while conditions are extremely difficult at present, Irish dairy farmers will be well placed to avail of the opportunity presented by market recovery in due course.</p></reply>

However my Department liaises with the main banks on access to finance for the agri-food sector and, in cooperation with other State bodies, continues to explore new and more competitive sources of funding for the sector. For example, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland introduced an &lsquo;Agriculture Investment Loans&rsquo; product last year, which has been very well subscribed. Also, my Department is currently preparing to procure an ex-ante evaluation for the introduction of &lsquo;Financial Instruments&rsquo; under the Rural Development Programme.  All of the banks consider the sector to be vitally important and have specialised offerings to farmers and there continues to be a significant take-up of these funds. Data from the Central Bank shows that the &lsquo;primary industries&rsquo; sector (consisting of primary agriculture, forestry and fishing) continues to be a significant component of new Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) lending, accounting for &euro;734m or 21% of all new loans in 2015. Primary agriculture accounted for &euro;649m or 19% of the total. </p>  <p>  In context of current market difficulties, it is envisaged that some farmers will experience cash flow problems in the short to medium term. One of the initiatives recently agreed by the Dairy Forum (comprising farm organisations, co-ops and processors, the Department and its agencies, as well as the banking sector) is a programme of cash flow and financial management training and advice for dairy farmers. In collaboration with Teagasc, my Department has agreed a three part programme:</p>  <p>  - The publication of a booklet entitled &lsquo;Cash Flow &amp;amp; Financial Management on Dairy Farms&rsquo;, which will issue to all dairy farmers shortly.</p>  <p>  - Cash flow training to be incorporated in an upcoming programme of dairy farm walks in each of the Teagasc regions, where advisors will be on hand for one-to-one consultations and referrals.</p>  <p>  - The development of a standardised 15-20 minute cash flow training module that can be delivered to dairy farmers at any stakeholder meetings held by Dairy Forum participants.</p>  <p>  This programme will run in conjunction with the existing Teagasc &lsquo;Get Farm Financially Fit&rsquo; engagement. </p>  <p>In addition I have scheduled a programme of meetings with the CEOs of the main banks to discuss liquidity and access to credit issues later this month and intend to engage with them on their plans for dealing with the current difficulties over the short to medium term.   </p>  <p>  My Department is also discussing with various stakeholders, including the farm organisations, any other options there may be to assist liquidity problems. I also welcome other innovative initiatives in this regard such as those introduced by Glanbia recently.   </p>  <p>  I am fully aware of the pressures on farmers right now and I am committed to working with all players in the sector, both at national and EU level, to address these issues.</p></reply>

The Programme for a Partnership Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.  This is being achieved through private investment by commercial telecommunications companies and through a State intervention in areas where commercial investment is not forthcoming.</p><p>The High Speed Broadband Map 2020, which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie shows the extent of the State Intervention area, which is the subject of procurement.  The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have plans to deliver high speed broadband services.  The Department continues to monitor the commercial deployment plans in the BLUE area where commercial operators have committed to providing services, to ensure that those services are delivered. </p><p>The areas marked AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the target areas for the State Intervention.</p><p>Members of the public can view whether their premises are in the BLUE or AMBER area by accessing the High Speed Broadband Map and entering their Eircode.  The map provides information on a county by county basis with a breakdown of coverage across the townlands in every county including County Longford.</p><p>My Department continues to actively monitor the deployment plans  in the BLUE area where commercial operators have committed to providing services, to ensure those services are delivered.  I would encourage consumers and business owners  to contact my Department at broadband@dcenr.gov.ie where specific problems arise in relation to provision by commercial operators of High Speed Broadband services in the BLUE area.</p><p>There are over 750,000 premises in the AMBER area, and these are the focus of the procurement process, which formally commenced in December 2015 with the publication of the Pre-Qualification Questionnaire ('PQQ') and Project Information Memorandum.  The procurement takes the form of a competitive dialogue which is complex and involves several steps:</p><p><b>- Step 1:</b>Publication of the Pre-qualification Questionnaire &ndash; this step was launched on 22 December 2015</p><p><b>- Step 2:</b>The responses by telecoms operators to Step 1 are received.  - Five responses were received to this stage of the process, by the deadline of 31 March (which was extended by one month, from 29 February to 31 March at the request of bidders).  These responses are currently being evaluated and will result in a list of qualifying bidders being invited to dialogue with the Department;</p><p><b>- Step 3:</b>The commencement of detailed technical and financial negotiations with qualified bidders (Invitation to Participate in Dialogue).  This is scheduled to commence within the next month and will take a number of months;</p><p><b>- Step 4</b>: Following the detailed negotiations outlined in Step 3, bidders submit draft bids for further dialogue;</p><p><b>- Step 5</b>: Bidders will then submit final, formal tenders for evaluation;</p><p><b>- Step 6:</b>The formal tenders submitted by bidders will be evaluated;</p><p><b>- Step 7:</b>Preferred bidder or bidders are identified;</p><p><b>- Step 8:</b>A contract or contracts will be awarded.</p><p>The timing of each stage of the procurement is dependent on a number of factors including the number of bidders short-listed and the complexities that may be encountered during the dialogue process.  Bidders will need several months to prepare their draft bids and their final formal bids and to get the relevant shareholder and funding approvals at these stages of the process.  It is expected that contract(s) will be awarded in June 2017. </p><p>As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and/or high demand.  This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network rollout plan.  A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Regional Development, Rural Affairs, Arts and the Gaeltacht.  A detailed rollout plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place.</p><p>In parallel with the procurement process, and in line with the Programme for a Partnership Government, my colleague, Minister Heather Humphreys will lead on the establishment of county or regional broadband taskforces, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices, LEADER Groups and other relevant agencies to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once contract(s) have been awarded.</p></reply>

The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have plans to deliver high speed broadband services.  The areas marked AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the target areas for the State Intervention.  The map provides information on a county by county basis with a breakdown of coverage across the townlands in every county including County Limerick. </p><p>Based on information provided by commercial operators, significant parts of Marine Cove and Foynes will be covered by commercial operators with any remaining premises being part of the State Intervention.  Members of the public can view whether their premises in  Limerick are in the BLUE or AMBER area by accessing the High Speed Broadband Map and entering their Eircode.</p><p>My Department continues to actively monitor the deployment plans in the BLUE area where commercial operators have committed to providing services, to ensure those services are delivered.  I would encourage consumers and business owners  to contact my Department at broadband@dcenr.gov.ie where specific problems arise in relation to provision by commercial operators of High Speed Broadband services in the BLUE area.</p><p>Over 750,000 premises are the focus of the procurement process, which formally commenced in December 2015 with the publication of the Pre-Qualification Questionnaire ( 'PQQ') and Project Information Memorandum.  Five responses were received from prospective bidders to this stage of the competitive procurement process by the deadline of 31 March 2016.  The five responses are being assessed in line with the criteria set down by the Department with a view to shortlisting the qualified bidders to proceed to the next stage of procurement.  </p><p>The second stage in the procurement process will be a formal invitation to Participate in Dialogue (ITPD) to short-listed bidders.  I expect that my Department will move to this stage in the next month.  The third stage of the procurement process involves the issue of final tender documentation which follows the dialogue process.  Following the submission of final tenders by bidders, a winning bidder(s) will be selected for the contract which will comprise one or two lots as set out in the NBP Intervention Strategy.  The Department will then enter into formal contract negotiations with the winning bidder(s).  It is expected that contract(s) will be awarded by June 2017.</p><p>As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best roll-out strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and/or high demand.  This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network roll-out plan.  A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Regional Development, Rural Affairs, Arts and the Gaeltacht.  A detailed roll-out plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place.</p><p>The Programme for a Partnership Government commits also to measures to assist in the roll-out of the network once a contract is awarded.  In this regard, Minister Humphreys will lead on the establishment of county or regional broadband taskforces, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices, LEADER Groups and other relevant agencies to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded.</p></reply>

With regard to Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann, a range of energy efficiency measures, including eco-driving, bus and network priority programmes and fleet replacement, have delivered significant fuel savings.  Irish Rail has also introduced a range of measures, including train configuration changes and traction control software on the DART network.   The DART electric rail system has been in operation from Greystones to Howth and Portmarnock since 1983,and was extended to Malahide in 2000.  A further expansion of the DART is planned as far as Balbriggan on the Northern line, Maynooth on the Sligo Line and Hazelhatch on the Kildare line.  We are also committed to the further development of electric fuelled public transport, particularly along the high demand routes in the GDA, e.g. the completion of the Luas Cross City project expanding the electrified LUAS network and planning for new Metro North, construction of which is due to commence in 2021.</p></reply>

In addition Councils can also provide monies from their own resources towards LIS.   The Community Involvement Scheme (CIS) also remains in place in 2016 on the basis that local authorities may set aside 7.5% of their Restoration Improvement and Restoration Maintenance grants for CIS schemes if they so wish.  </p>  <p>  The Programme for a Partnership Government provides that, as the economy recovers, the Government will promote increased funding for Community Improvement Schemes and Local Improvement Schemes, on an annual basis. A major objective for the new Government will be to prioritise new investment in local and regional road maintenance and improvements, and CIS and LIS funding will be promoted in that context.</p></reply>

Works on those roads are funded from the Council's own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority. In January this year, my predecessor announced the 2016 regional and local road allocations, including an allocation of &euro;15.9 million for Tipperary County Council.  Grants for remedial works on bridges are made under my Department's Bridge Rehabilitation Grant scheme.  Local authorities submit a list of bridges in order of priority for consideration for funding. Ardfinnan Bridge was placed some way down the list in Tipperary County Council's application.  Taking into account the overall amount of funding available a grant allocation of &euro;60,000 was made in respect of Ardfinnan Bridge with a view to facilitating progress on initial remedial works at this bridge.  It is a matter for the local authority to select, prioritise and agree its regional and local road work programme each year.

Normally, an applicant is expected to appear in person at a National Driver Licence Service (NDLS) office to renew their driving licence.  However, applicants for renewal who are temporarily overseas for work or study purposes may already apply by post, under regulations in effect since summer of 2014.  These postal applications should be made directly to the NDLS.  There is no involvement of Irish embassies or consulates in the process, nor do I see any need for such involvement.   I understand that the NDLS is developing an online driving licence application facility, which will be available in 2017.  This will be of great assistance to applicants within Ireland as well as those temporarily overseas when their licences come up for renewal.</p></reply>

Under that regulatory framework the core requirement, with a small number of limited exemptions, is that the carriage of passengers for reward in a public place in any mechanically propelled vehicle with nine or less seats (including the driver's seat) is permitted only in a licensed vehicle driven by a licensed driver. The underlying policy which governs this is a concern for passenger safety and a concern for passenger protection in relation to pricing. The rationale for taxi regulation is to ensure that passengers have a safe vehicle for their journey, with appropriate insurance in place, driven by a driver who has been vetted by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and, in the case of taxis, with a pre-established and verified charging system. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Government's policy is to ensure a high level of standards and professionalism in the industry for both the customer and the industry itself.</p>  <p>  I recently met the National Transport Authority for a briefing on the areas under its remit, which includes taxi regulation, and I intend to give further consideration to the range of issues relating to the regulation of the taxi industry in Ireland in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

I have no role regarding the legal framework for insurance regulation, or for the regulation of insurance companies, which are matters for my colleagues, the Minister for Finance, and the Central Bank, respectively.</p>  <p>  While I am, of course, concerned with recent trends towards increasing motor insurance costs, motor insurance is provided by private companies in an open and competitive market, and pricing is a matter for the industry. </p>  <p>  It is advisable for people seeking motor insurance to shop around as the costs can vary dramatically.  Some insurers and brokers specialise in certain areas, for example young drivers or vintage vehicles.</p>  <p>  Insurance Ireland operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries or difficulties in relation to obtaining insurance.  If a person is unable to obtain a quotation for motor insurance, or feels that the premium proposed is so excessive that it amounts to a refusal to provide insurance, they should contact Insurance Ireland, 5 Harbourmaster Place, IFSC, Dublin 1, Tel: 01 6761820, emailiis@insuranceireland.eu quoting the Declined Cases Agreement.  This Agreement exists to facilitate motorists to meet their obligation to have third party liability motor insurance.</p></reply>

It contains 119 time-bound actions to be implemented by 2017 targeted at improving employment growth and enterprise development in the region as a whole, by leveraging collaboration within public sector organisations, and between the public and private sector, across the counties of Longford, Westmeath, Offaly and Laois.  The plan is focused on the specific needs and strengths of the region, with actions targeted at sectors of potential competitive advantage such as <font color="#2F2F2F">manufacturing, tourism, food and energy.</font></p><p>Since the first National Action Plan for Jobs was launched in 2012 jobs have grown in the Midland region by 12,600.  The Midlands Action Plan for Jobs targets further employment growth of between 11,400 and 17,100 additional jobs by 2020.</p><p>Since the Plan was launched, focus has been on putting in place a comprehensive implementation structure.  A Regional Implementation Committee was established last year, composed of key stakeholders in the region who work in concert with Enterprise Champions - nominated senior private sector representatives - to oversee and monitor progress.  This committee held its first meeting on March 2nd 2016, and will hold a further meeting in the coming weeks to review and assess progress on delivery of the Plan&rsquo;s actions.  The first Progress Report on the implementation of the Plan, covering the period to end-June 2016, will be completed and published in Q3 2016.</p><p>Key actions in the plan to be delivered over the period 2015-2017 include: Establishing a Midlands Manufacturing Technologies Campus; developing new cycling, walking and other recreational trails along the waterways of the region; developing a Regional Energy Hub; establishing new incubator spaces for entrepreneurs; attracting at least 25 additional multinational investment projects to the region by 2019; building two advance facilities for Athlone, and appointing an IDA Regional Manager for the Midlands.</p><p>Investment of up to &euro;250 million was announced in February 2015, to be provided over five years to support and maximise the impact of all Regional Action Plans, including &euro;150 million for a property investment programme by IDA Ireland. </p><p>A further sum of up to &euro;100 million will be made available over the period through three competitive calls administered by Enterprise Ireland.  These calls are being targeted at innovative and collaborative approaches to support job creation across the regions.</p><p>On June 1st of this year an initial allocation of &euro;5m in competitive funding for local and regional initiatives was announced under two of these calls; the LEO Competitive Fund and the Community Enterprise Initiative.  Among the successful projects are the Midlands Engineering Cluster Programme, which will create new synergy between engineering enterprises, educational institutions, and government agencies in the region; the enhancement of the Junction Business Innovation Centre in Tullamore through recruitment of a Business Development Manager; and the Midlands &lsquo;One to Two&rsquo; Growth Initiative, which will assist solo entrepreneurs in the region in attaining employer status.</p><p>In addition, the Midlands Regional Skills Forum, which includes among other organisations the Longford and Westmeath Education and Training Boards and Longford Chamber, has been established to connect education providers with employers to build the skills of the region.</p></reply>

The work of InterTrade Ireland (ITI) is especially important in this context.  ITI, which is jointly funded and overseen by my Department and the Department for the Economy in Belfast, provides a range of enterprise development initiatives and programmes to support commerce both in and between North and South.  Our two administrations also work together in other ways, including through ongoing cooperation between Enterprise Ireland and its Northern Ireland counterpart agency Invest Northern Ireland on areas of mutual interest.</p>  <p>  Over recent years, a range of projects under the enterprise development strand of the INTERREG IVA Programme (2009-2015) have had a particularly positive impact on developing small businesses in the region.  My Department co-funded this strand, under which a total of 28 individual projects have been initiated.  I now look forward to the roll out of the successor Programme for the period up to 2020, which will support research and innovation initiatives and hopefully help to foster further growth and economic development in the cross-border areas.</p>  <p>  My Department has not carried out a cost benefit analysis to which the Deputy refers.  Developing new economic structures such as this would represent a significant policy development and requires careful consideration.  We should also bear in mind that any new structures would need the full agreement of the authorities both here and in Northern Ireland.  The need to avoid duplication with the work of other existing bodies and mechanisms is also important. </p>  <p>  I would also mention that the North East/ North West Action Plan for Jobs, launched on 30 November last, aims to deliver 28,000 extra jobs in the counties of Sligo, Leitrim, Donegal, Louth, Monaghan, and Cavan by 2020. Key targets in service of this overall goal are to achieve an increase of at least 25% in the number of start-ups in the region; a 25% improvement in the survival rate of new businesses; an increase in the number of IDA investments in the region by 30-40% up to 2019; and an increase of 300 to 500 in the numbers of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta supported jobs in the North West.  Sectors targeted as part of the plan include traditionally strong sectors for the region like agri-food, manufacturing/engineering and tourism, as well as areas targeted for future growth like digital payments, cleantech and creative services. </p>  <p>  Since the Plan was launched on 30 November last, focus has moved to putting in place a comprehensive implementation structure.  A Regional Implementation Committee has been established, composed of key stakeholders in the region who will work in concert with Enterprise Champions - nominated senior private sector representatives - to oversee and monitor progress.  This team will meet twice each year to review progress on the delivery of the Plan&rsquo;s actions.  The first Progress Report on the implementation of the North East/ North West Action Plan for Jobs will be completed in Q3 2016.</p></reply>

There is also close collaboration between EI, INI and InterTrade Ireland (ITI) on the specific cross border programmes which are operated by ITI.</p>  <p>  In relation to IDA Ireland, it cooperates with INI on appropriate regional and all-island economic development.  An example of this cooperation was the jointly developed North West Business Technology Zone, which capitalised on the combined strengths of Letterkenny and Derry City as an economic corridor through the development of compatible infrastructure and property solutions.  Where appropriate, IDA Ireland and INI also cooperate on company visits where both jurisdictions are being considered by foreign companies.  </p>  <p>  Science Foundation Ireland signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Department of Education &amp;amp; Learning in Northern Ireland in respect of its Investigators Programme in 2014.

For the first time, the Agency aims to increase the level of investment by between 30% to 40% in each region.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s commitment to countrywide job creation is further illustrated by the Regional Action Plan for Jobs initiative.  This initiative saw eight plans published throughout 2015 and 2016, which identified a range of actions aimed at supporting each region to achieve its economic potential and raise employment levels.</p>  <p>  These new regional initiatives are already producing results.  In 2015, IDA Ireland client companies created 18,983 jobs across a range of sectors, with every region posting net job gains. Moreover, 53% of those jobs are outside of Dublin, compared to 49% in 2014.</p>  <p>  Employment in IDA Ireland client companies is now at the highest level in its 67-year history, with 187,056 people now employed in companies supported by the Agency.  Of these, 59% (109,812) are employed outside of Dublin.</p>  <p>  As part of the Regional Action Plans, IDA Ireland is set to invest &euro;150 million over five years in property solutions designed to allow it to create opportunities to win additional projects for all regions.  This will include the construction of nine new advance facilities around the country.  This is a positive development for attracting Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) into regional locations.  It will provide access to modern property solutions which, when combined with a strong local talent pool and existing FDI cluster, will give these locations an enhanced proposition to offer international investors.</p></reply>

Their aim is to promote entrepreneurship, foster business start-ups and develop existing micro and small businesses to drive job creation and to provide accessible high quality supports for their clients&rsquo; business ideas.</p><p>Under the terms of the Service Level Agreement between Enterprise Ireland and each Local Authority, the LEOs are required to produce annual Local Enterprise Development Plans (LEDPs) setting out clearly what the LEO intends to deliver over the following 12 months.  The Plans identify and prioritise the key enterprise sectors and entrepreneurial capacity challenges that need to be targeted in each LEOs&rsquo; functional area. </p><p>Based on the Annual Employment Survey, overall in 2015, LEO clients created a total of 7,122 new jobs (full- and part-time) in gross terms; taking into account losses, there was a net increase of 3,533 all jobs (full- and part-time).  At the end of 2015, total direct employment among 6,573 LEO client companies stood at 32,592 (of which 23,641 were full-time and 8,951 were part-time).</p><p>In addition to direct financial assistance, the LEOs supported an even wider cohort of entrepreneurs and small businesses in 2015 through:</p><p>-  1,896 training programmes involving 27,185 participants;</p><p>-  provision of one-to-one mentoring support to 8,175 participants;</p><p>-  399 referrals to Micro Finance Ireland of which 200 were approved; and</p><p>-  promoting the Trading Online Voucher Scheme with almost 1,700 businesses participating.</p><p>In 2015, the LEOs provided a range of development supports aimed at building company capacity and performance among the micro-enterprise sector; in 2015 they paid out direct financial assistance to 984 business projects (against a target of 900), to the value of &euro;10m.  Of these, 400 were priming grants for start-up companies.</p><p>On the basis of the same allocation for 2016, the LEOs have again targeted the approval of a total of 900 projects to be funded and an overall total of 1,500 full time equivalent jobs associated with this direct financial support funding for the year.  (The delivery of these jobs will be spread over 2016 and the coming years and will be supplemented by increased employment by companies that received LEO financial supports in previous years).</p><p>In addition, last week I announced further capital funding investment in the LEOs under the LEO Competitive Fund this year.  As part of this scheme, an initial allocation of &euro;2m is being made to support 16 collaborative job creation initiatives at local and regional level in support of the Regional Action Plans for Jobs.  A further call for proposals later this year will aim to support more such initiatives to strengthen job creation in each region.</p><p>At regional level, the Regional Action Plans for Jobs (RAPs) aim to ramp up job creation by empowering the range of public and private interests, including Local Authorities, to deliver new job creation initiatives.  The LEOs are a key player in many of the specific actions in the plans and the above competitive funds will enable them to deliver on their commitments under the RAPs.<table><tr><th>Region</th><th>Published Regional APJ targets by 2020</th></tr><tr><td>North East/North West</td><td>28,000</td></tr><tr><td>Midland</td><td>14,000</td></tr><tr><td>West</td><td>25,000</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>66,000</td></tr><tr><td>Mid-East</td><td>25,000</td></tr><tr><td>Mid-West</td><td>23,000</td></tr><tr><td>South-East</td><td>25,000</td></tr><tr><td>South-West</td><td>40,000</td></tr><tr><td>State Total</td><td>246,000</td></tr></table></p></reply>

In addition to data collected in the Offices and Agencies of my Department, key elements of data collection take place through a Surveys Unit in the Department and collaboratively with the Central Statistics Office under a Memorandum of Understanding.I am satisfied that my Department follows best practice when collecting data and that it has robust procedures in place to ensure that all data that it collects, whether as a statutory requirement or otherwise, is accurate and complete. </p><p>The National Competitiveness Council, in their 2015 report, noted that the availability of accurate, timely and relevant data is essential to develop an evidence base, conduct analysis, and formulate policy recommendations. My Department considers the development of data and other statistical and measurement issues on an ongoing basis and my officials are currently engaged in work with the CSO and other Departments and Agencies on the development of improved data across a range of issues including productivity and housing affordability. Officials from my Department attend the Enterprise Statistics Liaison Group convened by the Central Statistics Office. The Enterprise Statistics Group assesses the needs and priorities of key national users of business and enterprise statistics.</p><p>Two other recent reports have highlighted areas where better data should be available. A report by the University of Limerick (UL) into the prevalence of zero hour contracts and low hour contracts identified limitations in existing data in these areas. UL made a recommendation as to how this might be addressed in the future, which is being considered in the context of the broader policy response to the UL study.</p><p>The Low Pay Commission in its report last July made reference to 'significant gaps in the data which would ideally be available to assist in coming to a recommendation on the level of the minimum wage'. In this context, the cessation by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) of the National Employment Survey a number of years ago has particularly constrained the data available and its timeliness with regard to earnings. The reintroduction of this survey by the CSO as soon as finances permit would be welcomed.  </p><p>Comprehensive data on Northern Ireland business and economic issues is compiled by bodies such as the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency and their Department for the Economy, and such information is made openly available In addition, <i>Intertrade Ireland,</i>the cross border body which is co-funded by my Department, had published a wide range of data from various sources, which is of direct relevance to cross border business and economic issues. I do not consider it appropriate that my Department would get involved in collecting data relating specifically to Northern Ireland matters. </p><p>My Department, and the agencies under its aegis, share data with their Northern Ireland counterparts in instances where this can bring about mutual benefits. For example the Health and Safety Authority shares information and research on farm safety trends with the Health and Safety Executive of Northern Ireland in order to help address major workplace health and safety risks in the agriculture sector.</p></reply>

The general consumer protection legislation for which my Department has responsibility does not contain provisions on the form to be taken by payment invoices. The need for such provisions has not arisen to date as it is in the interest of businesses to facilitate payment by customers by providing that payments can be made in a number of different ways. In the case of certain regulated sectors, such as energy and household waste collection, service providers are required to have customer charters intended to safeguard the interests of users of the services.    As stated in my reply to Parliamentary Question Number 613 of 24 May 2016, the Customer Charter for Household Waste Collection constitutes the Sixth Schedule to the Waste Management Collection (Permit) Regulations 2007 (S.I. No. 820 of 2007) enacted by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government as amended most recently by the Waste Management (Collection Permit) (Amendment) Regulations 2015 (S.I. No. 197 of 2015) and the Waste Management (Collection Permit) (Amendment) Regulations 2016 (S.I. No. 24 of 2016). This Customer Charter requires service providers to provide &lsquo;the highest standards in the provision of waste management services to their customers&rsquo; in respect of general customer service; communication with customers; pricing, charging mechanisms and access to account information; and complaint procedures and dispute resolution. Matters relating to the billing and payment practices of companies engaged in household waste collection would accordingly be most appropriately dealt in my view through the Customer Charter for the sector.</p></reply>

A visual search for these providers can be carried out via Pobal Maps at maps.pobal.ie, which received a major update yesterday, June 7th.  Alternatively, each of the 30 City/County Childcare Committees (CCCs) maintains lists of providers in their respective areas.  A list of CCC contacts is available on my Department's website, , and links are also available through Early Childhood Ireland's website.</p><p>In response to the expansion of ECCE announced in Budget 2016, and to support the development of capacity in the sector, my Department has initiated a number of actions.  The Department made detailed information available to the CCCs at the beginning of this year indicating the number of children, by every electoral division across the country, who would be eligible for an ECCE place in September 2016, January 2017 and April 2017.  My Department continues to work closely with the CCCs to match this data against reported capacity in the sector to meet the increase in demand.  My Department is working with the CCCs on the development of action plans for areas where a shortfall in supply may be identified. </p><p>In Budget 2016 my predecessor, Minister James Reilly, announced the opportunity for private childcare providers to participate in the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme for the first time - this was to ensure that families eligible for CCS but living in an area with no community/not-for-profit childcare service could access subsidised childcare.  A number of private childcare providers are now contracting with my Department and will be participating in the Community Childcare Subvention (Private) (CCSP) programme.  My Department has recently (June 2nd, 2016), announced the re-opening of the contract process for CCS Private providers, and this will remain open until 1 August 2016.  I intend to take further steps to promote registration of private providers in this scheme shortly. </p><p>In addition, my Department announced the introduction of an Early Years Capital Programme earlier this year with total funding of &euro;4 million available.  This funding was targeted at early years pre-school providers, both community and private, that are making alterations to their services to accommodate increased numbers of children.  The maximum grant available under this programme is &euro;10,000.  The closing date for applications was 8 April, 2016 and I hope to announce the successful applicants in the coming weeks. </p><p>In relation to the use of public buildings such as schools to provide childcare, The Programme for Government indicates that community groups and private providers will be invited to tender to use school facilities - outside school hours - for childcare purposes.  A cross-Departmental group has now been established to consider how best to implement this commitment, and this group met for the first time last week. Officials from my Department and the Department of Education and Skills have been tasked with the development of a joint proposal for my consideration and the consideration of my colleague in Government, Minister Richard Bruton.</p></reply>

From September 2016, children who are over the age of 4 years and 8 months at the beginning of the relevant preschool year, will not be eligible to avail of the ECCE programme.  The only exception to this rule is an exemption on the grounds of disability or special needs, the criteria for which are set out below.  The age range for eligibility for children enrolling for the programme in September 2016 is 1 January 2012 to the 31 August 2013.</p><p>Exemptions to this rule can currently be made in the event that a child has been diagnosed as having a special/additional need.  Current policy requires that any request for an exemption from ECCE eligibility criteria must be supported by a medical assessment report from the HSE/medical specialist specifying the child's special need and diagnosis.  At present, this requirement is necessary to maintain a clear and standard basis for applying exemptions and is not intended to undermine the view of a parent or teacher in relation to a child's need.  </p><p>The following specialist/ medical reports are accepted as supporting documentation when applying for an exemption under the ECCE programme:</p><p>Speech and Language Therapist</p><p>Occupational Therapist</p><p>Senior Psychologist</p><p>Physiotherapist</p><p>Paediatrician </p><p>Neurologist</p><p>Psychiatrist</p><p>Psychotherapist</p><p>Cardiologist</p><p>Oncologist</p><p>Opthalmologist</p><p>Otolaryngologist (ENT specialist)</p><p>Gastroenterologist</p><p>My understanding is that the above is not an exhaustive list and a report from a medical practitioner or healthcare professional who is qualified to diagnose a disability is acceptable.</p><p>In November 2015, my predecessor Dr. James Reilly, launched a new model to support children  with a disability to fully participate in the ECCE programme.  Work in relation to the detailed development and implementation of this model is well advanced, with a view to introducing the model from September 2016 onward.  The new Access and Inclusion Model (AIM) will not focus on medical diagnosis but rather on the developmental level of children with a disability, their functional ability, their strengths and their needs.  On this basis, my Department intends to review the current process for providing exemptions to ECCE eligibility criteria, i.e. a medical-based assessment.  However, this review will need to build on the current work in relation to the development of the new model of supports and will take some time to complete.</p></reply>

The assessment of a person suitable to adopt as per section 34 of the Adoption Act 2010 states that an adoption order shall not be made unless the Authority is satisfied that the applicant is a suitable person to have rights and duties in respect of the child, is of good moral character, in good health and of an age that he or she has a reasonable expectation of being capable throughout the child&rsquo;s childhood of fulfilling his or her parental duties in respect of the child.  In addition, the applicant needs to demonstrate an ability to promote and support the child&rsquo;s development and well being, providing the necessary health, social, educational and other interventions for the child, and valuing and supporting the child needs in relation to his or her identity and ethnic religious and cultural background.  The assessment includes ensuring that the applicant has adequate means to support the child.</p>  <p>  Section 22 of the Adoption Act 2010, provides that the Child and Family Agency may contribute towards the expenses incurred by a person in connection with an application to adopt.  I am advised by the Child and Family Agency that this may occur when dealing with the issue of dispensing with consent.  Section 26 of the Act provides that an adoption order cannot be granted unless consent has been given by a child&rsquo;s mother, a guardian or person having charge of the child.  In cases where the mother cannot give consent or is unwilling to do so and it is deemed that adoption is in the child&rsquo;s best interest, the case will be referred to the High Court where the dispensing of the mothers consent will be considered.  These cases are often associated with children in long term care who are being adopted by their foster carers.  In such cases the Agency may meet the High Court costs if the applicants, as identified through the assessment do not have the means to meet these costs.  The Agency may also meet the cost of supplementary assessments such as DNA testing in order to determine parentage and/or psychological tests where the costs cannot be met by the person required to undergo the assessment.</p></reply>

These children are cared for by staff who deserve to have a safe working environment.  </p>  <p>  In recent years it has been Government policy to end the practice of detaining children in adult prison facilities.  In moving towards this goal a series of developments have been put in place.  These have included a substantial capital development to provide new and modern facilities at Oberstown, measures to integrate and standardise procedures on the Campus, legislative reform under the Children (Amendment) Act 2015 and the first programme of staff recruitment in over ten years.  I acknowledge the contribution of the staff and managers in Oberstown on the progress that has been made in this area. </p>  <p>  I understand that the issues of staff safety and training supports are currently the subject of discussion between Oberstown management and staff representatives at the Workplace Relations Commission, following the industrial action which took place on Tuesday 31 May.  </p>  <p>  In Oberstown, there is an emphasis on training in behaviour management programmes that de-escalate and, where possible, avoid crises involving the behaviour of children. I condemn any and all incidents resulting in assault and injury to staff.  There is no acceptable level of violent behaviour in a children detention school.  I am advised that children are assessed daily for all forms of risk and in the light of such assessments the residential care plans for children are reviewed accordingly.  The Oberstown Campus has in place a published bespoke behaviour management policy which has been developed in conjunction with the Crisis Prevention Institute of Wisconsin, USA.  Policies and procedures are continually reviewed from a safety perspective.  Unfortunately, the risk of injury cannot be excluded completely given the nature of a children detention school.  A specific employee assistance programme is in place to assist members of staff on foot of any such incident where required. Staff are fully supported where incidents have to be investigated by the Garda authorities.</p>  <p>  I welcome the fact that the engagement between Oberstown management and staff is now taking place at the Workplace Relations Commission and understand that industrial action has been suspended during this process.  I intend to continue to monitor the progress of these discussions, in conjunction with the Oberstown board of management.</p></reply>

It sets out 163 key policy commitments, and outlines five national outcomes we seek to achieve for all children and young people:</p><p>1. Active and healthy with physical and mental wellbeing</p><p>2.  Achieving full potential in all areas of learning and development</p><p>3.  Safe and protected from harm</p><p>4.  Economic security and opportunity</p><p>5.  Connected, respected and contributing to their world.</p><p>While not explicitly mentioned in the <i>Programme for </i>Government, the Government remains fully committed to continuing the implementation of <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures.</i>The role of my Department is to lead this implementation on behalf of government.</p><p>Effective implementation is ensured by the robust whole of government implementation infrastructure.  These structures include the Children and Young People&rsquo;s Policy Consortium, which has overall responsibility for cross government implementation and oversight, the Sponsors Group, which brings together the Departments with responsibility for the five national outcomes and the Implementation Team in my Department, which supports the process.</p><p>The Advisory Council for <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures </i>brings together key members of the community and voluntary sector as well as independent experts and individuals with experience working with and for children and young people, ensuring that they are actively involved in the implementation process.</p><p>An implementation plan for <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures </i>covering 2014-2017 was developed, including actions under each of the 163 commitments from across government, as well as details on cross-sectoral priorities.  The first annual report on implementation was published in June 2015.  Both the implementation plan and annual report are available to the public on my Department&rsquo;s website.  Work on the second annual report is ongoing in my Department.</p><p>The <i>National Youth Strategy (2015-2020),</i>published last October was developed in close consultation with statutory youth interests and the voluntary youth organisations and services that work with young people.</p><p>The strategy sets out Government&rsquo;s aims for young people, aged 10 to 24 years, aligned with the five national outcomes in <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures. </i>The Strategy identifies some fifty priority actions to be delivered by Government departments, state agencies and by others, including the voluntary youth services over 2015 to 2017.  They include actions to address issues which are a high priority for young people themselves.  Priorities include: reform of the youth funding programmes in line with the recommendations in the <i>Value for Money and Policy Review of Youth Programmes </i>to ensure improved outcomes for young people, opportunities for those young people furthest from the labour market through measures such as the <i>Youth Employability Initiative</i>and the <i>National Strategy on Children and Young People&rsquo;s Participation in Decision-making.</i></p><p>My Department is in the process of setting up a <i>National Youth Strategy (2015-2020)</i>lead team to support the coordination, progression and monitoring of its implementation.  The structures established by my Department under <i>Better Outcomes Brighter Futures,</i>will oversee the roll out of its implementation.</p><p>I am pleased to advise the Deputy that Budget 2016 provided an additional &euro;1.1m in current youth funding to my Department bringing the total allocation for the youth services to &euro;51m in 2016.  Scouting Ireland has been allocated &euro;834,607 in 2016, an increase of more than &euro;20,000 on their 2015 allocation.</p><p>In addition, Scouting Ireland has been allocated some &euro;200,000 in 2016 for the &lsquo;Operation Lelievlet&rsquo; programme.  This programme, which is funded under the <i>Dormant Accounts Disbursement Scheme</i>links a direct employment/training initiatives for disadvantaged youth in areas of Limerick with the development of Scouting in marginalised communities and the development of recreational facilities on the Shannon for more young people.  Operation Lelievlet is built on a partnership between Scouting Ireland and local agencies, including Limerick City Build and Limerick City Council.</p></reply>

The elements of the Children Act relating to the operation of the Garda Youth Diversion Programme, matters relating to criminal proceedings against children, criminal law issues and the operation of the Children Court under the Act come within the remit of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality.  The operation of the children detention school system under Part 10 of the Act is under the remit of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  The Irish Youth Justice Service, based in my Department and staffed by officials working on an interagency basis from both Departments concerned, oversee the operation of the Act, youth crime policy and all relevant projects and programmes.  A Youth Justice Action Plan was agreed in 2014 for the period up to 2018 and this is implemented by the Irish Youth Justice Service in conjunction with all relevant agencies, including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Probation Service, the Oberstown Detention Campus, the Irish Prison Service and Tusla, the Child and Family Agency.  The aim of the Action Plan is to create a safer society by working in partnership to reduce youth offending through appropriate interventions and linkages to services.</p>  <p>  The Deputy's question refers to the recent report issued by the Jesuit Centre for Faith and Justice, entitled "Developing Inside - Transforming prison for young adults".  This report makes a range of recommendations in relation to the operation of prison and custodial regimes for young adults in the age range of 18 - 24 years.  These recommendations include assigning responsibility for this age cohort to the Irish Youth Justice Service, achieving a significant reduction in the number imprisoned, accommodating such persons in separate facilities from older prisoners, ending the use of restricted prison regimes and enhanced training for prison staff.  All of these recommendations have implications for the operation of the adult prison system and some of them have implications for the wider criminal justice system, which is under the remit of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality.</p>  <p>  While the Irish Youth Justice Service is based in my Department, I must inform the Deputy that my political priority in this field must continue to be the ending of the practice of detaining children in adult prison facilities.  A programme of investment in the Oberstown campus, combined with necessary legal and operational reforms, has been underway in recent years to this end.  It is my aim to assign responsibility for 17 year old boys who are serving a sentence of detention to the Oberstown campus at the earliest date possible this year, subject to the progress of a recruitment programme which is ongoing at present.  This will end the practice of detaining children in adult prison facilities, which has been called for since at least the 1980s.</p></reply>

The Irish Youth Justice Service, based in my Department and staffed by officials from my Department and the Department of Justice and Equality, oversee the operation of the Act and all relevant policies and programmes.</p>  <p>  There is significant investment in community based programmes which are directed at diverting young people from further involvement in criminal or anti-social behaviour.  In 2016, just under &euro;17 million has been allocated by the Department of Justice and Equality to the Irish Youth Justice Service to administer Garda Youth Diversion Projects, Young Persons Probation Projects and a number of other youth diversion community-based projects.  These projects also benefit from support under the European Social Fund.</p>  <p>  In addition to Garda Youth Diversion Projects, there are 109 communities supported through the Family and Community Services Resource Centre Programme (FRC programme) which is operated by Tusla, the Child and Family Agency and which provides services and supports to local communities.  Tusla provides core funding to its established network of 107 Centres nationwide, and two outreach Centres.  Tusla is providing funding of approximately &euro;13m this year.  The primary role of the Family and Community Services Resource Centre Programme has been, and will continue to be, prevention and early intervention.  The main the role of Tusla is to provide family support, the same way as it does for families in the general community, by providing  guidance and parenting supports through its locally based services such as the provision of parenting programmes.  The Centres emphasise the involvement of local communities in tackling the problems they face, and creating successful partnerships between voluntary and statutory agencies at community level.  Family Resource Centres involve people from marginalised groups and areas of disadvantage at all levels of the organisation.</p>  <p>  The Educational Welfare Services of Tusla, the Child and Family Agency operate under the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000, which emphasises the promotion of school attendance, participation and retention.  The statutory and school support services of the Child and Family Agency's Educational Welfare Services work together collaboratively and cohesively with schools and other relevant services to secure better educational outcomes for children and young people.</p>  <p>  Schools are obliged by law under the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000 to submit reports on school attendance to the Educational Welfare Services of the Child and Family Agency.</p></reply>

As of the 31st March 2016, there were 6,405 children in care.  Of these 93% were in foster care, with 4,162 in general foster care and 1,790 in foster care with relatives.</p><p>As the majority of children in care are in foster care family settings in the community, indicators of stability of the placement and participation in education are useful in monitoring the performance of Tusla in relation to overall welfare.  Figures from Tusla show that at the end of December 2014, 14% of children had been in care less than a year, with 48% in care for between 1 to 5 years and 38% had been in care for longer than 5 years.</p><p>A care order, in the case of emergency, interim or full care orders, can only be issued by a member of the judiciary sitting in the District Court, which may be part of a special sitting as the Children Court, as indicated in the Child Care Act 1991.  In the case of special care orders, an application must be made to the High Court.  Decisions on the variation or discharge of a care order are also a matter for the relevant Court and lie outside the powers of Tusla.  If a person is unhappy with a care order then an appeal can be lodged with the Courts, which, normally, in the case of an order from the District Court is to be lodged within 14 days of the order being made.  Under the Act, it is possible for a child to be placed with Tusla in care on a voluntary basis but this is not a care order and can be rescinded by the parent or guardian at any time.</p><p>Information on admissions to care, and the legal reasons for being in care, is available on an annual basis and is reported in the Annual Review of Adequacy which is published by Tusla.  Such data for 2015 is currently going through extensive validation and is not yet ready for publication.  Table 1 shows the number of admissions to care both voluntarily and under a Court ordered care order for 2012, 2013 and 2014.  It should be noted that the number of admissions does not equate to the number of children admitted to care, as some children can be readmitted to care throughout the year.</p><p><b>Table 1: Legal Reasons for Admissions to Care</b><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Total Admitted into Care </th><th>No. admitted under an Emergency Care Order</th><th>No. admitted under an Interim Care Order</th><th>No. admitted under a Care Order</th><th>No. admitted under a Detention Order of the High Court</th><th>No. admitted under Another Court Order</th><th>No. of Voluntary admissions into care </th></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>1,632</td><td>163</td><td>198</td><td>280</td><td>1</td><td>62</td><td>928</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>1,896</td><td>255</td><td>280</td><td>98</td><td>2</td><td>42</td><td>1,219</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>2,070</td><td>261</td><td>281</td><td>123</td><td>0</td><td>94</td><td>1,311</td></tr></table></p><p>I have also included Table 2 for the Deputy's information.

The objective of this grant application was to seek funding to support the implementation of previous Atlantic funded work in the area of Prevention, Partnership and Family Support.  In particular the grant provides the means through which Tusla is able to provide intensive implementation of a nationwide programme to enhance area based approaches to PPFS and a national practice model for all agencies working with children, young people and families.  The AP grant is designed to enable Tusla to build better intra agency and inter agency capacity to implement key practice and process changes to ensure Tusla's prevention and early intervention system is operating effectively and delivering a high quality, standardised and nationally consistent service to children and families.</p>  <p>  The Galway University Foundation (NUIG) is the recipient of the Atlantic Philanthropies funding in the first instance which is then allocated to Tusla in instalments over the life of the grant (2015 - 2018) against an agreed national programme.  The majority of the AP funding received is spent within Tusla on items such as staff training on the PPFS programme.  In 2015 the funding was also partly utilised by Tusla to commission work from EPIC (Development of Children's Fora ); IFCA ( Development of Peer Support groups ); Investing in Children (Quality Assurance in Participatory Practice) and Keenaghan Collaborative (Development of National Train the Trainers programme in Participatory Practice with Children and Young People).  In 2016 Tusla will continue to commission this work as outlined.  In addition in 2016 Tusla will commission work from Dr. Carmel Corrigan (Development of National Children's Charter) and Quality Matters (Development of the provision of support to carers).  Furthermore a small seed funding grant will be made available to each of the seventeen areas to support initiatives in Participation &amp;amp; Parenting.  This is at an early stage and the recipients have not yet been selected.</p></reply>

Given the narrow focus of the role of the Army Pensions Board the question of entering into a Memorandum of Understanding with any body in Northern Ireland does not arise.</p></reply>

Government Departments and other Public Bodies, including Westmeath County Council, have been invited to declare any interest in acquiring the property.  To date no interest has been identified.   As the Barracks is no longer required for military purposes the current financial and administrative burden resulting from the retention of the Barracks cannot be sustained.  The disposal of the property by public auction will be actively progressed in keeping with the Government&rsquo;s policy and recent practice to dispose of surplus property no longer required for military purposes.</p>  <p>  Having regard to progressing disposal of the property and in this context its potential future use contributing to the positive development of Mullingar, my Department remains open to viable proposals to these ends.  However, having regard to the local community and development interest, I would suggest that any local groups should engage with Westmeath County Council to explore such opportunities.</p></reply>

It is also to contribute to State ceremonial events. </p>  <p>  In terms of RDF training units in rural areas, as the Deputy may be aware, the re-organisation of the RDF was a key element of the response to the findings of the Value for Money Review of the RDF published in late 2012.  The central recommendation provided for retention of the RDF with 4,000 personnel spread countrywide to be based in barracks and in 16 other locations.  As part of the subsequent re-organisation, all RDF units were disestablished and amalgamated with PDF units.  The retention of all previous locations was not a viable or sustainable option.  The re-organisation offered significant advantages in terms of training and development of RDF personnel with PDF units having Reserve components rather than the previous parallel Reserve organisation structure.  Reserve units are supported by their parent PDF unit and the 16 units outside of PDF installations are supported by dedicated full time PDF personnel.  At the time of the re-organisation, every effort was made to minimise the requirement for personnel to relocate and to facilitate members in their preferred or local areas. </p>  <p>  The RDF remains significantly under-strength and the ongoing challenge is to recruit and train sufficient personnel to meet the establishment figure.  This challenge affects all elements of the RDF and is not confined to rural areas.  Recruitment to the RDF is ongoing.  While recruitment remains a key challenge, the retention of members is also a key requirement in order to maintain strength levels.  The implementation of measures set out in the White Paper 2015 will provide opportunities for certain members of the RDF to undertake duties.  I am of the view that this, and other initiatives outlined in the White Paper will be a key motivating factor in encouraging more people to join the RDF as well as making it more attractive for current members to stay.</p></reply>
