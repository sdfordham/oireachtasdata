PorterShed in Galway and The Mill in Drogheda benefitted from the funding.  Two projects from Donegal also benefitted from the funding in 2016.</p><p>The Funds were set up to boost job creation by encouraging &lsquo;bottom up&rsquo; collaborative projects between private and public organisations e.g. providing incubation space, innovation hubs, mentoring entrepreneurs, start-up accelerator programmes, supporting industry clusters within and between local and regional areas as well as local driven initiatives.</p><p>As part of the Action Plan for Jobs 2017, my Department, through Enterprise Ireland, has committed to support the Regional Action Plans for Jobs and provide investment of up to &euro;60m over the period to 2020.</p><p>A Regional Competitive Funding Initiative administered by Enterprise Ireland will be launched shortly.  The overarching aim is to drive balanced regional enterprise development throughout the country.</p><p>My plan over the coming months and years is to work in support of organisations that come forward with good projects to boost enterprise and job creation in their regions. </p><p>So I would urge private and public organisations from Donegal to apply.</p><p>Applications for funding will be invited through a public call for submission of projects.  This will be announced in the National Press over the coming weeks. </p></reply>

The quality of these roles is partly reflected by remuneration levels.  In 2016, the average salary in IDA client positions was &euro;51,237, an increase of over &euro;2,000 per year from 2015.  This is significantly above the national average annual earnings of &euro;45,075 in 2015.  These salary levels are sustained by the high value jobs which we target in a diverse range of key sectors including international financial services, technology, life sciences and engineering. </p>  <p>  We should remember as well that jobs created by foreign direct investment drive other economic activity in the State.  It is estimated that every ten positions created by an IDA client company support a further seven jobs elsewhere in the economy.  When these jobs are included, the total employment impact of IDA Ireland clients extends to approximately 340,000 people.</p>  <p>  As regard the terms and conditions of FDI-related employment, all companies operating in Ireland, whether domestic or overseas, are subject to a range of employment-related legislation.  This legislative framework provides certainty for the country&rsquo;s labour market and ensures that workers are treated fairly under the law.</p></reply>

In this respect, work has progressed well on developing a policy response to the Programme for Government commitment to tackle the increased casualisation of work and to strengthen the regulation of precarious employment.  I intend to include protections aimed particularly at low-paid, more vulnerable workers.  Our proposals will address the issue of employees on low hour contracts who consistently work more hours each week but whose contracts do not reflect the reality of their hours worked.  The proposals will also seek to ensure that employees are better informed about the nature of their employment arrangements and their core terms at an early stage in their employment.</p>  <p>  The policy response is being informed by the University of Limerick study on zero hour contracts and low hour contracts as well as the extensive material and practical examples provided by respondents to the public consultation conducted by my Department.</p>  <p>  Developing policy proposals in this area is a complex matter.  A balance needs to be found between protecting the rights of employees and avoiding unintended consequences on business which may negatively affect the competitiveness of the Irish economy. </p>  <p>  My Department is currently engaged with ICTU and Ibec to secure broad agreement before proposals are finalised.  This work is being progressed as expeditiously as possible and is nearing conclusion. </p>  <p>  The intention is to submit our proposals to Government in Q1 2017 for consideration and approval to draft a Bill giving effect to those proposals.  I envisage that the proposed legislation would, subject to Government approval, be published as a matter of priority once a Bill is drafted.  </p></reply>

All licence applications are considered having regard to these measures.  Sanctions can include arms embargoes and various restrictive measures including prohibitions on the provision of targeted goods and services.  My Department considers all arms embargos and trade sanctions when considering export licence applications, however there are currently no such sanctions in place in respect of Saudi Arabia.</p>  <p>  My Department is responsible for controls on the export of dual-use and military items from Ireland.  Proposed exports of military and dual-use products to Saudi Arabia, as with all other destinations, are considered on a case-by-case basis.  The concept of presumption of denial is not provided for in Irish or EU Legislation.  My Department has safeguards built into the licensing system which enable robust checks and cross-checks to ensure, as far as possible, that the item to be exported will be used by the stated end &ndash;user for the stated end-use, and will not be used for illicit purposes.     </p>  <p>  My officials are in regular contact with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on export licensing issues.  They consult with that Department in respect of all military export licence applications and all dual-use export licence applications involving Saudi Arabia.  My officials seek observations on any foreign policy concerns that may arise in respect of a proposed export; such factors are subject to review in the light of developments in a given region.  Any observations which may arise from this examination are considered in the final assessment of any licence application.</p>  <p>  My Department may refuse an export licence, following consultation with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and other EU and international export licensing authorities as appropriate. </p>  <p>  Between 2014 and 2016 my Department issued 132 export licences to the value of &euro;125m, in respect of Saudi Arabia. 123 of these export licence with a value of &euro;101m were in respect of ICT products, with 9 export licences with a value of &euro;24m related to equipment used in industry. </p>  <p>   </p></reply>

The Plan does not deal with actions on a county by county basis but does contain a strong focus on developing the regions.</p>  <p>  Its objectives include the creation of an additional 200,000 jobs by 2020, including 135,000 outside of Dublin; reduction of the State unemployment rate to 6%; and at a regional level, having an additional 10% to 15% at work in each region, and closing their unemployment rates to within 1% of the State average. </p>  <p>  Action Plan for Jobs 2017 includes a series of collaborative actions aimed at stimulating regional growth, including the progression, monitoring and support of the eight Regional Action Plans for Jobs, which aims to realise the national Action Plan&rsquo;s regional employment targets.</p>  <p>  The Regional Action Plan for the North East/North West region aims to support the creation of 28,000 jobs across Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim, Cavan, Monaghan, and Louth by 2020.  The first Progress Report was published in December and shows strong progress to date, with 5,600 more people in employment across the region since the start of 2015. </p>  <p>  Sectors targeted as part of the plan include traditionally strong sectors for the region like agri-food, manufacturing/engineering and tourism, including active promotion of the tourism potential of the Lakelands Region, which includes Cavan and Monaghan. </p>  <p>  The Local Authorities, LEOs, and other key public and private sector stakeholders in Cavan and Monaghan have been strongly involved in, and are key drivers of, the North East/North West Action Plan for Jobs.</p></reply>

That is why, since the result of the referendum on 23 June, I have engaged extensively with the Agency to assess and determine its additional funding requirements. </p>  <p>  This process has led to further financial support being allocated to the IDA.  As part of Budget 2017, the Agency received a &euro;15 million increase in capital funding to support its grant and property programmes.  This was in addition to a higher pay allocation of &euro;750,000 which will allow for the recruitment of nine new Brexit-related personnel.  In September 2016 the Government also provided an extra &euro;500,000 to the IDA in order to strengthen its global communications capacity. </p>  <p>  These additional resources are already helping IDA Ireland to better manage the opportunities and challenges associated with Brexit.  We should not forget, however, that we are facing stiff global competition for all new FDI, whether Brexit-related or not. I will, therefore, continue to keep the Agency&rsquo;s financial situation and requirements under review. </p></reply>

Information on visits to specific locations within counties - whether in Tipperary or anywhere else -  can unfortunately not be disclosed in order to safeguard the confidentiality of the client concerned.  This has long been the approach of IDA Ireland, given that the public release of particular details about individual visits could also lead to unnecessary speculation about investors and potential disappointment if a new project does not come to fruition.  It is also the case that many multinational businesses specifically request that details of their site visits are not released.</p>  <p>  It should be remembered that the decision by a company as to where to locate can be influenced by a number of factors.  These include access to qualified talent, proximity to transport hubs, and the ready supply of suitable property.  While IDA Ireland actively encourages its clients to locate or expand in regional locations, ultimately the final decision always rests with the company concerned.   </p></reply>

This year&rsquo;s plan is at the core of the government&rsquo;s response to the huge challenge these pose for businesses - to make sure our enterprise base is resilient in the face of changes to come.</p>  <p>  Since the Brexit result was announced, I have attended many events on a daily basis at which I engage with stakeholders and listen to their views about challenges and opportunities that it will bring.  I have also met with a wide range of representative organisations, including IBEC, ICTU, ISME, the Small Firms Association, the Irish Exporters Association, the American Chamber of Commerce Ireland, the Dublin Chamber of Commerce, and the Irish Farmers Association.</p>  <p>  I welcome the analyses and reports published by representative organisations identifying challenges for their sectors.  These are important inputs to the Government's considerations. </p>  <p>  I have had discussions about the impacts of Brexit at the Retailers Forum which I chair and it is a regular item for discussion at the Regional Action Plan for Jobs implementation Committees.</p>  <p>  In addition, my Department held a major stakeholder engagement event in Carrick-on-Shannon on 30 January to hear the views of all stakeholders. </p>  <p>  My officials have also met a range of organisations and individual firms and relayed their concerns to me. </p>  <p>  I am very aware of the importance of monitoring developments that effect Irish enterprise and ensuring we have coherent responses being developed. This is reflected my Department&rsquo;s production of a suite of enterprise sector briefs.  These briefs, which draw on up-to-date information sources and the expertise of key players, provide a synopsis of the current state-of-play in a number of enterprise sectors that are key to Ireland&rsquo;s economic fabric.  They provide a commentary on opportunities for growth and priority actions needed.  The reports will be updated on a rolling basis and will be continue to take account of all related developments, including Brexit.  </p>  <p>  Assessment of the impact of Brexit on all aspects of society, including enterprise, is being coordinated by the Department of An Taoiseach.  Within my Department, a risk assessment of the potential impacts of Brexit across policy areas has been conducted and has fed into the national level assessment.  </p>  <p>  In terms of research, there have been a number of studies published which set out the potential impacts of Brexit, including sectoral assessments (e.g. tourism, agri-food).  Many of these are listed on the merrionstreet.ie website.  With regard to sectoral impact specifically, my Department is currently scoping and undertaking research to examine the implications for the most exposed enterprise sectors - in terms of trading and economic relationships - of the UK being outside of the European Single Market and Customs Union.  This research will inform a more indepth assessment of the way in which Brexit will affect individual sectors of the economy, and enterprises operating within them.  It is planned that the pilot study will be completed by the end of Q1.  </p>  <p>  My Department is also funding analysis through InterTrade Ireland on the North-South trade implications of Brexit.  This project will provide an understanding of the impact of different trade and tariff regimes which might be imposed following Brexit.  I am aware also of sectoral-level assessments being conducted by Bord Bia and the Department of Finance of the food and international financial services sectors respectively.</p></reply>

That is why there has already been extensive engagement at home and abroad &ndash; across both Ministerial and Agency levels &ndash; with the industry about new investment in Ireland.  The European Financial Forum, which was held in Dublin on 24 January, was also a helpful and timely opportunity to remind international financial services providers about the benefits of doing business in Ireland.</p>  <p>  Our focus now is converting the interest shown to date by new investors into new projects here.  Both the IDA and the Government will continue to work hard with that goal in mind.  The IDA has also recently launched a new global communications campaign, called "Right Place, Right Time", which will help target decision-makers in key locations.</p>  <p>  While I am confident about the potential to create new financial services related jobs in Ireland, we do need to be realistic about what is achievable.  Competition for all new such investment remains intense and we should not expect tens of thousands of jobs to be created here by default.  </p></reply>

The website contains an Information Guide on Mental Health and Wellbeing in the Workplace and links to various external resources such as Aware and the Samaritans, amongst others.  It contains webcasts and presentations on topics relevant to mental health and general wellbeing which Civil Servants can access at any time.  The service is also available as a resource for managers to provide advice and support when dealing with staff members who may experience mental health or wellbeing issues.  The HR Unit of my Department ensures that our staff are made aware of the supports available form the CSEAS both generally as well as in response to individual cases that are brought to our attention either by Line Managers or individual staff members.  The Service operates on a confidential basis.</p>  <p>  The Civil Service Occupational Health Department, often referred to as the Office of the Chief Medical Officer, advises the Department in relation to workplace health issues.  The Office has ongoing engagement with Civil Servants who are absent from work and has a primary role in assisting workplace rehabilitation of employees who experience ill health.  The HR Unit of the Department liaises closely with the Service on individual cases.</p>  <p>  The Code of Practice on the Employment of Persons with a Disability in the Civil Service sets out the principles, actions and responsibilities of different persons throughout the various stages of the career of a person with a disability.  Under the Code, all Department&rsquo;s must appoint a Disability Liaison Officer (DLO) and the DLO within my Department, in consultation with the Personnel Officer/HR Manager, arranges for the provision of supports or accommodations that are deemed reasonable to support the employment of a person with a disability. </p>  <p>  The Health and Safety Unit of my Department monitors and maintains staff safety, including safe systems and organisation of work, at it's various workplace locations, in accordance with the provisions of the Safety Health and Welfare at Work Act, 2005.  My Department also provides free health check services to staff from time to time, including thematic talks, seminars and webinars. </p>  <p>  Finally, my Department participated in a study carried out by Senator Marie Louise O'Donnell on how the Civil Service deals with the dying, death and bereavement amongst its members.  The report, entitled "Finite Lives", published in 2015, offered a number of recommendations aimed at increasing supports within Departments.  These included, the drawing up of a bereavement policy, training, and further research into the area.  Also, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has recently published a revised circular on bereavement leave (Circular 1 of 2017) which increases the amount of bereavement leave available in certain cases.  My Department is considering its own policies in place in respect of bereavement in light of the recent circular and the recommendations in the Report. </p></reply>

Almost 190,000 more people are at work today than in 2012 when the first Plan was launched.  Over the past year employment has grown in all regions. 72% of all jobs created in the past year were created outside Dublin. </p>  <p>  The success of the Regional Action Plans for Jobs is crucial to the Government in meeting the Government&rsquo;s ambition to help create 200,000 additional jobs by 2020, including 135,000 outside Dublin. </p>  <p>  The first Progress Reports prepared by the 8 Regional Action Plan Implementation Committees have been published.  While at an early stage, the reports show that good progress is being made in the implementation of the Regional APJs.  All regions are on target to meet or exceed the job targets to be delivered by 2020. </p>  <p>  In 2016, almost two thirds of new jobs created by Enterprise Ireland supported companies, and over half of those created by IDA supported companies, were outside Dublin.  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s strategy for 2017-2020 aims to create a further 60,000 jobs, while sustaining existing ones; IDA will continue to target a minimum increase in investment of 30% to 40% in each region outside Dublin to 2019.</p>  <p>  To support the regional jobs agenda, I have ensured that additional funds will be made available through the enterprise development agencies out to 2020.  In June 2016, I announced an initial allocation of &euro;5m in competitive funding for 48 local and regional initiatives under two of these calls. All regions benefitted under this initiative.</p>  <p>  My Department and Enterprise Ireland are finalising plans for a further regional funding initiative of up to &euro;60m to support collaborative approaches to grow and sustain jobs across the regions.</p>  <p>  Additional funding of &euro;150m is being made available to the IDA to support its Regional Property Programme and drive job creation in the multi-national sector.</p>  <p>  My colleague Minister Coveney&rsquo;s draft planning strategy Ireland 2040, calls for the need to replace the concept of balanced regional development with the idea of effective regional development - playing to strengths rather than assuming that a single model suits all areas.  The Regional Action Plan initiative is aligned with this approach, working with regional stakeholders to identify and develop each region&rsquo;s own sectoral strengths and areas of economic opportunity.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-02-09a.103.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017020900063#WRB02300"><p>Under Irish law there is a distinct separation of function between the valuation of rateable property and the setting and collection of commercial rates.  The amount of rates payable by a ratepayer in any calendar year is a product of the valuation set by the Commissioner of Valuation, multiplied by the Annual Rate on Valuation (ARV) decided annually by the elected members of each local authority.  The Commissioner of Valuation is independent in carrying out his functions under the Valuation Acts and I as Minister for Justice and Equality have no role in this regard.  As the Deputy will be aware, the annual setting of the ARV is a reserved function of the elected members of each local authority and the Commissioner of Valuation has no function in that regard.</p>  <p>  Having a modern valuation base is very important for the levying of commercial rates on a fair and equitable basis across all commercial sectors, including units selling petrol.  This has been the policy of successive Governments for many years and is the express purpose of the National Revaluation Programme now being rolled out by the Valuation Office.  The revaluation provisions in the Valuation Acts 2001 to 2015 provide for the revaluation of all rateable property within each rating authority area in order to reflect changes in value due to economic factors, differential movements in property values or other external factors such as infrastructural changes in the vicinity of a property and changes in the local business environment.  The National Revaluation Programme is the first revaluation of all rating authority areas in over 150 years, and is being conducted across the country on a phased basis.  This is a welcome development which is long overdue and on which considerable progress has been made. Revaluation is an important instrument in redressing historical anomalies in relation to commercial rates for both urban and rural properties and between particular classes of property within a local authority area.  I am advised by the Commissioner of Valuation that the general outcome of the revaluations conducted to date by the Valuation Office has been that about 60% of ratepayers have had their liability for rates reduced following a revaluation and about 40% had an increase, a pattern that is expected to be replicated elsewhere as the programme advances.</p>  <p>  The current phase of the revaluation programme (known as "REVAL 2017") covers the revaluation of all rateable properties in counties Longford, Leitrim, Roscommon, Westmeath, Offaly, Kildare, Sligo, Carlow and Kilkenny where a revaluation is being undertaken for the first time since the nineteenth century.  It also includes the second revaluation of South Dublin County Council area. Revaluation in these counties is expected to be completed in September 2017 and become effective for rating purposes from 2018 onwards.  The Commissioner's intention is to then extend the revaluation programme to other counties.</p>  <p>  Following revaluation, there is a much closer and uniform relationship between contemporary rental values of all rateable properties in a local authority area and their respective commercial rates liabilities.  In essence, the exercise aims to ensure that each ratepayer bears a fair share of the rates burden relative to the modern rental value of the property that they occupy.  This applies to service stations and retail fuel outlets as it does to hotels, retail outlets, industrial units and all other categories of property.  A key element of revaluation is to remove anomalies in the system where they exist and establish fair and equitable relativities between the various property classifications.  Having regard to the revaluations conducted to date, it would be expected that many small businesses in rural Ireland will see their rates liability decrease following a revaluation.</p>  <p>  The basic premise under valuation legislation is that all buildings and lands used or developed for any purpose, including constructions affixed thereto, are rateable unless expressly exempted under Schedule 4 of the Valuation Act 2001, as amended. I am informed that the Valuation Office values service stations and retail fuel outlets by reference to their turnover and throughput and their rates liability should, accordingly, take account of the trading circumstances of the particular service station, whether rural or urban, as referred to by the Deputy.</p>  <p>  While acknowledging the important contribution which service stations with associated retail outlets make to the rural economy, there are no plans for special treatment of such stations under the Valuation Acts, which maintain the long-standing position that all property occupied and used for commercial enterprises are liable for rates. </p>  <p>  Pending the revaluation of all of the commercial properties in a local authority area, revisions of the valuation of individual properties will continue to be carried out by the Valuation Office.  The revision process provides for the updating of valuations on the existing valuation list so that new properties can be valued and added to the list, improved and extended properties can have their valuations updated and properties that have been demolished in whole or in part can have their valuations amended or struck out as appropriate.</p>  <p>  There is an extensive system of redress available to those ratepayers who are dissatisfied with the proposed valuations or with any particular on the certificate relating to their property.  In this regard, a dissatisfied person can make representations to the Valuation Office within 40 days of the date of issue of the certificate.  The Valuation Office will consider the representations and may or may not change the proposed valuation depending on the circumstances of each individual property.  If any ratepayer is still dissatisfied with the final valuation to be placed on their property following consideration of the representations, they have a right to lodge a formal appeal with the Valuation Tribunal, which is an independent statutory body established for the purpose of hearing appeals against decisions of the Commissioner of Valuation.</p></reply>

The role of INIS must be understood in the broader context of the English language (ELT) sector in Ireland more generally, and my Department's responsibility in relation to the immigration status of non-EEA nationals.</p><p>The sector, which predominantly operates in the commercial sphere, recruits students from a wide range of international markets with a particular focus on recruitment from within the EEA.  English language programmes are targeted at juvenile (which make up the majority of seasonal English language students each year) and adult students.  Programmes of varying duration are on offer, including short intensive programmes usually less than three months, and longer examination-focused programmes of six or more months duration.  The sector is not structured in a way that reflects the immigration and border control arrangements in the State and, as such, straddles all categories of international students both European and further afield.</p><p>In addition to EEA persons, who do not require permission from the immigration services to be in the State, for non-EEA nationals, registration information is recorded on the basis of the individual student and not the educational institution.  Also, only persons intending to remain in the State longer than ninety days are obliged to register their presence with the immigration authorities and this obligation applies only to non-EEA nationals over sixteen years of age.  Accordingly, the specific information sought by the Deputy is not available.  </p><p>In 2015 the Government introduced revised arrangements as regards student immigration.  In particular, educational providers intending to recruit non-EEA international students to programmes longer than ninety (90) days duration must be listed on the Interim List of Eligible Programmes ILEP.  The list is only open to those offering English language (of 25 weeks or more) and higher education programmes (leading to a recognised award by an Irish awarding body) and providers are prohibited from recruiting non-EEA international students to other categories of programme.  As part of the process of being listed on the ILEP, providers must submit a clear capacity statement setting out the maximum number of students that can be accommodated within their existing physical teaching resources. </p><p>A table sets out the top ten English language providers in order of their stated maximum capacity.  It is important to bear in mind that this table only relates to those providers seeking to recruit non-EEA international students to programmes of at least twenty five weeks duration.  It would not be unusual for such providers to offer programmes to both EU/EEA international students and non-EEA students and the maximum capacity statement applies to both categories and not just non-EEA capacity. <table><tr><th>Rank</th><th>ELT Provider</th><th>Maximum Capacity</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>IBAT</td><td>1,500</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>English Studio</td><td>1,368</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Griffith College (Cork Dublin and Limerick Campuses)</td><td>1,320</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Delphin</td><td>960</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>SEDA</td><td>900</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Grafton College</td><td>840</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Atlantic Language</td><td>768</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>Emerald</td><td>754</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>Swan Training</td><td>720</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>Active Language Learning</td><td>660</td></tr></table></p><p>As outlined above, it is not possible to provide the Deputy with a breakdown of each nationality group in each institution.  However, the table lists the top ten nationalities of all non-EEA international students currently registered with the immigration authorities across all programmes eligible for listing on the ILEP.  <table><tr><th>Rank</th><th>Nationality</th><th>Number Registered</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Brazil</td><td>9,225</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>China</td><td>3,127</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>USA</td><td>2,578</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>India</td><td>2,151</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Malaysia</td><td>1,587</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Saudi Arabia</td><td>1,151</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Canada</td><td>956</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>South Korea</td><td>868</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>Mexico</td><td>853</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>Pakistan</td><td>597</td></tr></table></p></reply>

This proposal constitutes a development of the border provisions of the Schengen acquis in which Ireland does not take part, in accordance with Council Decision 2002/192/EC.  Ireland is not bound by the Regulation or subject to its application.  When the amendments are introduced, Irish citizens will be subject to the same checks entering the Schengen Area as other European Union citizens.</p>  <p>  Ireland continues to progress a broad series of initiatives to strengthen border security.  For instance, since November 2016 an automated connection to INTERPOL&rsquo;s Lost and Stolen Travel Documents database was rolled out to all international airports and seaports.  In the first eight weeks of operating systematic checks against this Database over 700,000 documents were searched, with a number of people having been refused entry to Ireland on the basis of an alert on the system having been triggered.</p>  <p>  Later this year the Irish immigration authorities will begin to process Advance Passenger Information on flights into the State from outside the EU and preparations are also underway to implement the EU Directive on Passenger Name Records (PNR).  These systems will provide further protection for our borders against crime, terrorism and illegal immigration threats.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to providing An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with the necessary resources to enhance their connectivity to a range of EU and other international resources and significant work is ongoing in this regard.  This includes connecting to the Schengen Information System (SIS II), participating in other EU measures such as PRUM, and Interpol information-sharing resources relevant to countering security threats.</p>  <p>  Regarding the specific Regulation, Brexit does not impact on this as both Ireland and the UK are currently outside Schengen and this is not expected to change.  I should point out that in the context of 'Brexit' while it is not possible at this juncture to say what arrangements will apply between the UK and the EU, particularly in respect of the movement of EU citizens (as this will ultimately be a matter that will feature within the negotiation process that will take place following the UK's formal notification to the European Council that it intends to leave), what I can make clear is that, while we will continue to maintain and enhance cooperation with the UK in relation to general immigration and border enforcement, Ireland of course remains a committed member of the European Union and will continue to uphold the right of free movement for all EU citizens after the UK leaves the Union.</p></reply>

It is up to each adult to decide if they wish to attend this programme but attendance is strongly encouraged and participation levels are good.  Persons over 16 years may also attend  the adult programme but 16 - 17 year olds generally prefer to attend the local Community Schools with the other teenagers.  Transport and childcare, where available, is provided to enable the adult residents in the Emergency Reception and Orientation Centres to attend the programme.</p>  <p>  In exceptional circumstances where the arrival of refugees from the country of refuge is delayed, for example where an expectant mother cannot travel for the safety of her unborn child, that family may not receive the full orientation programme while resident in the centre.  Such refugees prefer to move to the community when housing is available rather than remain in the reception centre for the purposes of continuing the initial orientation and training programme.  The Education and Training Board will continue to provide a language training and orientation programme for up to one year post resettlement in the community.  All topics covered in the initial orientation and language training programme are revisited during this period.</p>  <p>  Transition arrangements are put in place in the Emergency Reception and Orientation Centres for children up to 12 years.  Many children of this age have never attended mainstream education.  The transition programme, which is run by qualified teachers, is designed to introduce children to normal school behaviours and practices and they also follow part of the mainstream curriculum and learn English.  The objective is to prepare children for an easy transition to mainstream education when they move to the community.</p>  <p>  Similar arrangements will be provided in the new Emergency Reception and Orientation Centres for asylum seekers admitted under the relocation programme from Italy and Greece.</p></reply>

Ireland s 12.5% corporation tax rate plays an important role in attracting foreign direct investment ( FDI ) to Ireland and thereby increasing employment here.  </p>  <p>  In a recent research paper 'Corporate Taxation and Foreign Direct Investment in EU Countries: Policy Implications for Ireland', the Economic and Social Research Institute ( ESRI ) outlined the importance of the 12.5% rate in attracting FDI.  The paper demonstrates that amongst all EU countries, Ireland would be the most sensitive to a change in the corporate tax rate in its ability to secure FDI.  An increase in Ireland s statutory corporate tax rate of 1% would be associated with a reduction in its probability of being chosen as a location for FDI projects from non-EU countries by 4.6%. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, in October 2015 the OECD published the final reports on their project regarding Base Erosion and Profit Shifiting or BEPS.  I welcomed the publication of the final BEPS reports.  From the beginning, the key aim of the BEPS project has been to better align the right to tax with real economic substance and activity and, as such, the BEPS project is one which aligns with Ireland's own tax strategy.  Ireland has been a strong supporter of the BEPS project and I believe it is the best approach for dealing with aggressive tax planning. Ireland will now play an active part in the work to implement the BEPS recommendations globally.  The post-BEPS environment, which will see companies seek to better align the amount of tax that they pay with their substantive operations, will result in opportunities for Ireland.  The alignment of substance with a competitive rate of tax has long been the cornerstone of our corporation tax policy. </p>  <p>  The ongoing commitment to the 12.5% rate, as stated in the Programme for a Partnership Government, is extremely important for Ireland s economy.   I believe that Ireland's long-term commitment to the 12.5% rate will ensure that we remain highly competitive and will support Ireland's ability to attract and retain investment from around the world.  Our European colleagues are fully aware of our position in relation to this issue.</p></reply>

Claimants who have contracted to purchase, or drawn down the first tranche of their qualifying loan to self-build, their home in the period between 19 July 2016 and 31 December 2016, inclusive.  This category is known as Retrospective Claimants.</p>  <p>  2.  Claimants who draw down the first tranche of their qualifying loan to self-build their home in the period between 1 January 2017 and 31 December 2019.</p>  <p>  3.  Claimants who contract to purchase their home, in the period between 1 January 2017 and 31 December 2019.</p>  <p>  Regarding retrospective claimants, I am advised by Revenue that the claim process does not require the developer to pass information to Revenue.  Instead, retrospective claimants are required to submit supporting documentation including a signed copy of the contract, evidence of their mortgage or mortgage drawdown, and details of the property directly to Revenue.</p>  <p>  Regarding claimants who draw down the first tranche of their qualifying loan to self-build their home in the period between 1 January 2017 and 31 December 2019, I am advised that the information supplied by the claimant will require verification by the claimant's solicitor before any refund is paid.  The appropriate refund will be made to the claimant's qualifying loan bank account. Such claims do not require the developer to pass information to Revenue.</p>  <p>  Regarding claimants who contract to purchase their home in the period between 1 January 2017 and 31 December 2019, I am advised that the information supplied by the claimant will require verification by the Revenue-approved qualifying contractor before any refund is paid.  The appropriate refund will be made directly to the qualifying contractor. </p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that as of 3 February 2017 there have been 114 applications for registration as 'qualified contractors', with 31 of these being fully approved.  Given the number of queries they have received from contractors, Revenue anticipates that the number of approved contractors will continue to increase over coming weeks.</p>  <p>  Requiring contractors to register with Revenue under the Help to Buy incentive in advance of processing any claims is an important element to ensure compliance under the scheme and is necessary in order to safeguard public monies being paid under the incentive.  As such, I do not intend to remove this requirement to register.</p>  <p>  The Help to Buy scheme is a generous incentive that facilitates the purchase of a new home by a First Time Buyer.  For new builds, the rebate is payable on signing the contract to purchase the property rather than upon completion of the sale.  This means that it is necessary that details of the planning permission and ownership of the land are provided to Revenue.  This information is completely within the control of the builder/developer.  The other key condition is that of tax clearance/tax compliance.  If a contractor is not tax compliant, in order to participate in the scheme, he or she should engage with Revenue to bring his or her tax affairs up to date.</p>  <p>  If the Deputy knows of a contractor who is not co-operating with a First Time Buyer to allow them claim any payments under the Help To Buy incentive, he should provide these details to my officials and I will arrange to have this information passed to Revenue.</p></reply>

The latest Revenue Local Property Tax Statistics for 2016 indicate that about 200 nursing homes availed of this exemption.  However, this exemption is not intended to act as a tax incentive but to ensure that, in recognition of their caring/medical aspect vis-&agrave;-vis private residential properties, nursing homes are not liable for LPT.  Furthermore, nursing homes may have to pay commercial rates and there is also an LPT exemption available for residential-type properties in respect of which commercial rates are payable to prevent double taxation.</p><p>The Deputy may be aware that tax relief is also available to individuals who invest in qualifying nursing homes via the Employment and Investment Incentive (EII).  Information as to the overall cost of the EII is available on Revenue's Statistics webpage but, as data is not collected on a sectoral basis, any cost relating specifically to investments in nursing homes cannot be separately identified.  Individuals may also claim income tax relief at the marginal rate in respect of qualifying nursing home fees.  The annual cost of this relief in the years  2011 to 2014 is as outlined in the table below.  Data for the years 2015 and 2016 is not yet available.</p><p><b>Health Expenses (Nursing Homes Only)</b><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Numbers</th><th>Cost<br /><br />&euro;million</th></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>6,200</td><td>29.1</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>5,800</td><td>25.2</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>5,500</td><td>25.2</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>5,000</td><td>23.1</td></tr></table></p></reply>

In June 2014 the Central Bank of Ireland issued a Consumer Notice on Crowdfunding which alerts consumers to the fact that crowdfunding is not a regulated activity.  The notice can be found via the following link: .</p><p>There are currently several crowdfunding platforms active in the Irish market and the Government recognises that crowdfunding can be a valuable source of funding for SMEs either as a complement to, or as an alternative to traditional bank finance.  The European Commission recently published a detailed report which finds that several member states of the EU have developed, or are in the process of developing national regulatory regimes but currently there is no evidence of a firm proposal from the Commission to bring forward an EU regulatory initiative.</p><p>The Department of Finance is currently undertaking a detailed analysis of crowdfunding and is engaging with the Central Bank of Ireland in advance of holding a Public Consultation on the Regulation of Crowdfunding in Q1 2017.  I am not in favour of considering changes to the tax treatment of investments made via such platforms in advance of the conclusion of this review and the regulation of the sector.  The Deputy will also note that my Department has published guidelines for tax expenditure evaluation which need to be considered in relation to any new proposals for tax expenditures. Some of the key evaluation questions that need to be addressed as part of such evaluations are:</p><p>(i) What objective does the tax expenditure aim to achieve?</p><p>(ii) What market failure is being addressed?</p><p>(iii) Is a tax expenditure the best approach to address the market failure?</p><p>(iv) What economic effect is the tax expenditure likely to have?</p><p>(v) How much is it expected to cost?</p><p>In relation to the Deputy's second question, I am informed by Revenue that it is not possible to provide the information sought by the Deputy concerning the current yield to the Exchequer from the taxation of investment earnings from crowd-funding loans to small and medium enterprises.  Income Tax returns do not seek the information required to enable this data to be separately identified.</p></reply>

The Financial Stability Group (the successor to the Principals' Group), which includes the Department of Finance, the Central Bank and the NTMA, is assessing geopolitical risks including changes in other jurisdictions' financial regulation which could affect the global financial system.  The Deputy will be aware that at a European and national level, financial legislation and regulation has undergone significant reform and strengthening since the financial crisis. </p>  <p>  In an Irish context, these comprehensive reforms, as well as the structural, organisational and cultural changes made within State Institutions, including my Department, were aimed at addressing the weaknesses in our financial system. Ireland has learned the importance of firm action to prevent financial crisis. </p>  <p>  Ireland is also a full participant in the reform of financial regulation at the European level.  The stability of financial markets has been a central priority for the European Union since the financial crisis and in the interim we have seen the introduction of reformed oversight and resolution regimes to address any emerging vulnerabilities or instabilities in the European Banking Sector. </p>  <p>  These reformed oversight and resolution regimes include new European institutions; strengthened regulations; a more intrusive supervisory approach; and a new focus on macroprudential requirements.  </p>  <p>  The Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) is now responsible for the prudential supervision framework for euro area banks.  The central piece of the SSM supervisory process is the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP) under which ECB led joint supervisory teams inspect business models, internal governance, profitability and banking risks.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that financial regulation developments in other jurisdictions, outside of the EU, are subject to continual monitoring by the EU, the Central Bank and my Department. </p></reply>

There are no plans to re-establish a dedicated training organisation for the sector, but rather to deliver the required education and training through the mainstream higher and further education and training sectors, in line with provision for other sectors.</p>  <p>  The Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGSFN) carried out a study on the future skills needs of the sector and the report of the study was published in November 2015.  The objective was to assess demand arising within the sector in Ireland including hotels, restaurants, bars, canteens and catering over the period to 2020.  The aim was to ensure that there will be the right supply of skills to help drive domestic hospitality sector business and employment growth.  The report provides a clear and coherent framework for the development of talent in the hospitality sector in the years ahead to help drive both hospitality business and employment growth which is one the key goals of the Government&rsquo;s Tourism Policy Statement &ndash; People, Place and Policy-Growing Tourism to 2025. </p>  <p>  The Study assesses skills demand at all NFQ levels, with a particular focus on career progression opportunities for those at lower skilled levels to help fill anticipated job openings.  The report provides a set of recommendations designed to address the skills requirements of the sector over the period to 2020.  A key recommendation in the report was the need to set up of a National Oversight and Advisory Group comprising all the key hospitality stakeholders.  </p>  <p>  Following on this recommendation, the Hospitality Skills Oversight Group was established early last year, chaired by SOLAS for the first year.  To date the group has held seven meetings.</p>  <p>  Membership of the Group includes the Restaurant Association of Ireland, the Irish Hotel Federation, Irish Hospitality Institute, Licenced Vintners Association, Vintners Federation of Ireland, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Department of Education and Skills, Department of Social Protection, Higher Education Authority, Skillnets, SOLAS, ETBs, IoTs, DIT and Quality and Qualifications Ireland. </p>  <p>  The role of the Group is to monitor progress on the implementation of the recommendations of the EGFSN and to provide a forum for on-going collaboration in addressing the skills needs of the sector and to identify and progress actions to overcome barriers on its implementation.  </p>  <p>  The Group plan to publish a progress report later this year.  To date work has been undertaken on careers promotion via a range of fora, the launch of the Tourism Insight online programme &ndash;aimed at promoting careers in tourism and hospitality with particular reference to transition year and Youthreach participants.  Audits of both higher and further education facilities and courses are underway as well as the establishment of a Restaurant and Hospitality Skillnet which aims to address key skills requirements of restaurants and catering companies to help drive the domestic hospitality sector, employment growth, talent attraction and retention. </p>  <p>  Funded through the National Training Fund by my Department, the network plans to design tailored programmes covering all aspects of the restaurant, food and beverage industry to SMEs nationally, with a particular focus on career progression for those at lower skilled levels to help fill anticipated job openings and increase retention levels within the sector and is well placed to address key recommendations of the EGFSN 2015 Report on the Future Skills.</p>  <p>  On the 26th January 2017, I launched the 2016-2020 Action Plan to expand Apprenticeship and Traineeship in Ireland, setting out how state agencies, education and training providers and employers will work together to deliver on the Programme for Government commitments on the expansion of apprenticeship and traineeship in the period to 2020.  The Plan sets out how we will manage the pipeline of new apprenticeships already established through the first call for proposals in 2015 and also commits to a new call for apprenticeship proposals later this year, to provide for the needs of all sectors, including hospitality and tourism.  Over the lifetime of the Action Plan, 50,000 people will be registered on apprenticeship and traineeship programmes representing a doubling of current activity. </p>  <p>  Work is progressing on the development of a new Commis Chef Apprenticeship led by the Irish Hotels Federation and the Restaurants Association of Ireland working with Kerry Education and Training Board.  It is planned that this programme will commence later this year.  The Apprenticeship Council also recently approved development funding for a separate proposal to develop a Chef de Partie Apprenticeship.  The Apprenticeship Council will continue to work with the proposers of these new programmes to develop them into sustainable apprenticeships that can be delivered on a nationwide basis. The funding for planned and forecast expansion in 2017 will see an additional &euro;20 million provided.  </p>  <p>  In 2015 a new Career Traineeship initiative was begun by SOLAS in collaboration with ETBs and enterprise to develop a more effective model of work-based learning, primarily at NFQ levels 4 and 5, incorporating best national and international research and practice.  Networks of Employers have been created to facilitate partnerships between ETBs and employers in identifying training needs, designing the training programmes, recruitment of learners and delivery of the training on and off the job.  The Career Traineeship model of work-based learning is currently being piloted with the Hospitality and Engineering sectors, with the involvement of seven ETBs.</p>  <p>  Given the breadth and range of programmes within the Further Education and Training (FET) sector, it is not possible to provide details of funding and places on a county by county basis across specific sectoral provision.  However, one way in which Solas classify FET provision is by the career areas which it serves.  The attached table on provision in the FET sector, shows the total number of beneficiaries in the career areas of Food and Beverage and Tourism in each of the sixteen Education and Training Boards for 2015 along with that planned for 2016. As yet, final 2016 figures are not available. </p>  <p>  While it is not possible to give details of expenditure at the level of career areas, the scale of total investment in FET and the numbers served on both a full and part time basis are also included in the table.  </p>  <p>  In relation to the number of tourism and hospitality skills training positions within the higher education sector in 2015 and 2016 and the amount of funding allocated for tourism and hospitality skills training in the same years, it is not possible to give a breakdown by county as students can apply for courses throughout the country, through the CAO application process.  However the attached table on provision in the higher education sector gives a breakdown outlining the number of training positions and the total estimated funding allocated which is categorised by each individual Institute.</p>  <p>  In 2015 the total number of student in higher education courses in this sector was 8,220 with estimated funding allocated of approx. &euro;47.4million and in 2016 the total number of student  for the sector was 8,033 with estimated funding allocated of approx. &euro;48.4m.  The funding detailed in this response includes an estimation of grants allocated to these courses, student contribution and free fees.  The student numbers are calculated as full time equivalents (FTE) which includes part time and full time student counts.  </p>  <p>This analysis of the higher education sector includes all courses within the following categories:  </p>  <p>  Tourism/Hotel/Leisure/Event </p>  <p>  Hospitality and Culinary</p>  <p>  Heritage and Cultural </p>  <p>  I also understand that a limited amount of complementary tourism-related business development and training supports are provided by F&aacute;ilte Ireland, the agency responsible for encouraging, promoting and supporting tourism as a leading indigenous component of the Irish economy.  However, I have no role or responsibility in relation to F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  Matters relating to that agency and its training and business supports are matters for my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport</p></reply>

This scheme is additional to other capital funding schemes that are operated by my Department such as the additional accommodation scheme, Emergency Works Scheme i.e. for projects of such urgency that they would prevent some or all of the school from opening, and Minor Works Schemes.  The current SWS was announced in late 2015 and is being applied on a multi-annual basis for the years 2016 and 2017. </p>  <p>  Nearly 50% of schools have applied for inclusion under the scheme which reflects a very high demand.  It is a matter for school authorities to identify and decide on the project they regard as being most urgent for their school.  The school in question has prioritised an application for mechanical works, Category 3, under the current scheme.

SCPA is utilised, in the main, where as yet unfilled vacancies exist in NEPS staffing provision locally or where staffing resource is lost through extended leave (maternity, sick or carer&rsquo;s leave)</p><p>I attach for the Deputy&rsquo;s information a list of schools who currently derive this service through the abovementioned SCPA scheme rather than through a NEPS psychologist.  In the case of these schools, NEPs psychologists may no longer be assigned to those schools as a result of retirement, resignation or transfer to another NEPs region.  </p><p>The Public Appointments Service (PAS) maintain regional recruitment panels of qualified personnel to fill these vacancies.  During 2016, despite my Department's best efforts the panels did not produce recruits for NEPS in relation to all vacancies, the panels were therefore closed.</p><p>A new national recruitment competition was put in place last Autumn by PAS to fill all vacancies within all NEPS Regions.  The resulting interview process associated with this competition was completed last week and recruitment panels for each NEPS region, including Dublin, will now be formed.  PAS will finalise the processing of the candidates, including Garda vetting, and propose each candidate in series to my Department Human Resources Section for contract negotiations and formal job offer.</p><p>It is envisaged that the process will produce new NEPS psychologists for assignment to schools, including that to which the Deputy refers in his question, by the end of the current academic year.</p><p>However it is important to point out that in cases where NEPS service is not available through staffing vacancy or temporary absence of staff, as described above, the schools affected continue to have access to a psychologist through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments to undertake pupil assessment work.</p><p>I would also confirm that all schools are able to access full NEP supports in the event of a critical incident irrespective of their having ongoing access to an assigned NEPS psychologist or not.</p><p>List of Co.

To deliver this statutory function, CDETB set up a business unit called SUSI (Student Universal Support Ireland). </p>  <p>  The assessment of student grant applications by SUSI is a significant undertaking each year involving in excess of 100,000 applications.  While every effort is made to prevent error and the overpayment of grants, some overpayments will nevertheless occur.    </p>  <p>  Where overpayments do occur, SUSI treats the overpayment as a debt to the exchequer and seeks to ensure that all such payments are recovered from the student.  This approach is consistent with the general policy and principle regarding the recovery of debt, as set out in the Student Support Act 2011. </p>  <p>  Some difficulties were encountered by SUSI in its first year of operations when processes and procedures were being rolled out for the first time.  In light of the circumstances in which these overpayments incurred, the approval of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform was obtained for write-off of these specific overpayments as an exceptional measure in 2016.</p>  <p>  Since 2013, SUSI has made significant improvements to its internal control systems and procedures to enhance control and reduce the potential of future overpayments occurring. </p>  <p>  It operates a comprehensive set of processes and controls to manage the assessment process and to minimise the risk of incorrectly awarding grants.  Such measures include comprehensive training for new staff as well as updates for existing staff on new scheme rules, and improved quality control procedures including random sample checking of ongoing grant applications by SUSI&rsquo;s Quality Assurance Team.</p>  <p>  SUSI has also strengthened data sharing processes with other relevant agencies such as the Department of Social Protection (DSP) and the Revenue Commissioners, as a means of ensuring significantly improved accuracy when assessing grant eligibility. </p></reply>

The local SENO contact details are available on www.ncse.ie.</p>  <p>  Section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 provides for an appeal by a parent or guardian to the Secretary General of my Department, or in the case of an Educational Training Board (ETB) school to the ETB in the first instance, where a Board of Management of a school, or a person acting on behalf of the Board, refuses to enrol a student in a school, expels a student or suspends a student for 20 or more days in any school year.  Further information on the Section 29 appeals process is available on the Department's website www.education.ie.</p>  <p>  The Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2016, published on 6th July 2016 and passed second stage on 17 November 2016, provides that where a school has places available it must admit all applicants.  The Bill also contains a provision for the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) to designate a school for a child who has no school place for reasons related to the child&rsquo;s special educational needs, and for the Child and Family Agency to designate a school for a child who has no school place (other than a child with special educational needs).  The NCSE or the Child and Family Agency will not be able to increase a school&rsquo;s capacity, a school must have places available for a designation to be made.</p>  <p>  Children with autism may be eligible for home tuition if a school placement is not available for them and/or where a determination is awaited in respect of an expulsion or refusal to enrol taken under section 29 of the Education Act, 1998.  Details in relation to the Home Tuition schemes are available on my Department's website at www.education.ie.</p>  <p>  Home Tuition will not be available where a school placement has been identified by the NCSE. Similarly, failure to enrol a child in school will not give rise to eligibility under this scheme.</p>  <p>  It is general practice to include a Special Needs Unit in the accommodation brief for new school buildings, unless local circumstances indicate that it will not be required.  In addition, my Department may also provide capital funding to schools to establish special needs provision e.g. reconfigure existing accommodation to provide a special class where this has been approved by the NCSE through its network of local SENOs.</p>  <p>  The NCSE is responsible for organising and planning provision for children with Special Educational Needs, including establishing special classes in mainstream primary and post primary schools.</p>  <p>  The NCSE has advised that there are almost 18,000 students with ASD attending schools nationally.  Of these 3,484 are attending primary ASD classes and 1,118 are attending post primary ASD classes. </p>  <p>  There are currently 1,153 special classes, which is an increase of over 100% on the number available in 2011.  Of these, 127 are ASD early intervention classes, 525 are primary ASD classes and 237 are post-primary ASD classes.  The remainder are non-ASD special classes.</p>  <p>  The NCSE, in consultation with the relevant education partners, must take into account the present and future potential need, location and sustainability in looking to establish special classes in certain areas.  In this regard the NCSE has advised that they are continuing to engage with schools, in opening special classes where there is an identified need for special class provision.</p>  <p>  Details of all special classes for children with special educational needs are available on www.ncse.ie in county order.</p>  <p>  The NCSE recently launched guidelines for Boards of Management and Principals of Primary and Post Primary schools which provide information on setting up and organising special classes.  These guidelines are available to download from www.ncse.ie.</p></reply>

The scheme also provides a compensatory educational service for children with special educational needs seeking an educational placement and provision is made for early educational intervention for children with autism.</p><p>Children aged 2.5 years with a diagnosis of ASD are not eligible for enrolment in an early intervention class and qualify for 10 hours tuition per week under the terms of the Home Tuition Grant Scheme, should the parent wish to avail of it.  Home Tuition continues from their 3rd birthday if no placement in a school based autism early intervention class is available for them.  The number of hours tuition per week will then increase to 20 for eligible children. </p><p>When a child with an autism diagnosis reaches 4 years of age they may be accommodated in a number of school settings.  In such circumstances, a school placement can be a place in a mainstream class in a mainstream school, a place in a special class attached to a mainstream school, a place in an early intervention class for children with ASD (where the child will not reach the age of 6 during the school year), or a place in a special school.  Where there is no educational placement available, my Department will consider applications under the Home Tuition Grant Scheme, where the child can receive 20 hours home tuition per week and until a placement is available. </p><p>The Home Tuition Grant Scheme is an interim measure to provide for education until an educational placement becomes available.  When a school placement becomes available the Home Tuition Grant will be discontinued.</p><p>Home Tuition has been approved to date in this school year for 629 children aged over 2.5 years with special educational needs, including children with autism.

As set out in the Home Tuition Circular for 2016/17, 0046/2016, allocations to siblings are on a group/combined basis which is reflective of the school grouping principle i.e. where the pupil teacher ratio in school settings can result in one teacher being allocated to a class of six pupils with children of mixed age and ability at the appropriate educational level (i.e. primary or post primary).  However, my Department may consider applications for separate allocations where evidence is provided which sets out the differentiated needs of siblings and reasons why they cannot be tutored together. </p></reply>

The Examination comprises an Assessment Task, undertaken in schools, which is worth 10% of the available marks and a Final Examination, in June 2017, representing 90% of the marks.  Both elements are marked externally by the SEC.</p>  <p>  Post-primary schools were advised in December 2016 of a second window for the completion by third year students of Junior Cycle English of the second Classroom Based Assessment (CBA) and Assessment Task.  The new window for the Assessment Task, which forms part of the Final Examination and which is marked by the SEC, will be in the week beginning 24 April. </p>  <p>  The SEC will provide guidance for the completion of the Assessment Task to schools.  The SEC can assure parents and students that its guidance to schools will make clear that all their students will have an opportunity to undertake the Assessment Task, and in this way to complete all elements that are marked by the SEC within the Junior Cycle Final Examination.</p>  <p>  I understand that the  guidance to be provided by the SEC to schools closer to the time of this second window will make clear that completion of the Assessment Task in English involves candidates engaging with stimulus material and questions (provided by the NCCA, having been developed in conjunction with the SEC), and then completing a booklet provided by the SEC within the set timeframe.  The NCCA and SEC materials are focused on candidates referring to their collection of texts, which they have undertaken as part of the reading strand over the period of their study of the Junior Cycle English subject specification and as part of the second CBA. </p>  <p>  The class teachers' role in relation to the completion of the Assessment Task is to engage with their students in relation to the NCCA stimulus material and questions, and then to supervise the class in completing the SEC-provided booklet.  Class teachers have no role in marking this work.</p>  <p>  The completed Assessment Task booklets are then securely stored by schools for return to the SEC for marking.  Schools will be required to complete an undertaking to authenticate that the completed Assessment Tasks are the candidates own work and have been completed in accordance with the NCCA and SEC guidelines.</p>  <p>  These arrangements are in line with those applying in schools for the conduct of externally assessed coursework in a range of subjects across both Junior and Senior Cycle.  These longstanding arrangements provide for school supervision and authentication of the completion of work for external assessment by the SEC. </p>  <p>  I welcome the reassurance provided by the State Examinations Commission on this issue, and I am satisfied that all students will have the opportunity to complete the Assessment Task and Final Examination.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-02-09a.250.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017020900067#WRF02900"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 96 and 108 together. </p><p>Through comparing education internationally, it has been found that in high performing education systems such as New Zealand, Queensland, Estonia and Finland, schools have been given greater autonomy and flexibility in the programmes they offer. </p><p>When schools in Ireland are implementing the new Framework for Junior Cycle, they too will have the autonomy and flexibility to design programmes within the parameters of the framework, mindful in particular of the needs of their students and their teaching resources.  I am in favour of leaving the decisions on what is offered to the discretion of the school, and of students having as broad a range of options to choose from as possible.</p><p>Because the total number of full subjects which can be done for assessment in junior cycle is ten, it is likely that schools will retain most or all of their current subjects in their junior cycle going forward.</p><p>Currently, over 90% of students choose History, although it is compulsory only in voluntary secondary schools, not much more than half our post-primary schools.  Curriculum choice is important in motivating students to learn and to remain in school to completion of senior cycle.</p><p>Schools across all sectors offer History. History teachers attract students to their subject through their own love and passion for History, and by engaging the natural curiosity of their students in, for example, the lives of people, the origins of the modern world and in objects and documents from the past. History is generally the 5th most popular subject in the Junior Certificate examination. </p><p>I have every confidence that, through the implementation of the <i>Framework for Junior Cycle</i>the place of History will be retained and given a new impetus across the junior cycle curriculum.  A new specification for Junior Cycle History is being developed by the NCCA.  This involved extensive consultation with key stakeholders and the public, which finished recently, during which  over 200 submissions were received.  The new specification will be available for implementation in all schools from September 2018.</p><p>The Leaving Certificate History syllabus attracts about 25% of the total cohort of students.  The aim is to make the new specification for Junior Cycle History more attractive, so young people can see it as a realistic option, rather than focusing on learning content by heart.  Many people believe that uptake in senior cycle could be improved if the junior cycle History was made more attractive, more relevant and perhaps less of a race against time.</p><p>In the new Framework for Junior Cycle, all schools are expected to provide opportunities for students to achieve 24 statements of learning over the period of junior cycle.  These statements include valuing local, national and international heritage and understanding the importance of the relationship between past and current events, the forces that drive change, and understanding the origins and impacts of social, economic and environmental aspects of the world around them.  Even where students do not take History as a full subject, it is to be hoped that opportunities to achieve such statements through other forms of historical study can be provided to them. </p><p>The minimum time allocated for subjects such as History will be 200 hours over the three years of junior cycle, or the equivalent of three 40-minute periods per week over three years.  For many schools, this will lead to an increased time provision for History as a subject, and it will no longer be nominally linked to Geography as previously.</p><p>This new minimum time stipulation for History as a subject should allow not only for a deepening of a student's historical knowledge but also of his or her ability to analyse, interpret, write and develop historical skills more thoroughly.  Those very skills, and attitudes, can indeed be hugely important in ensuring that students are able to understand and interpret all forms of  history, news and current affairs too. </p></reply>

There will then be discussions between individual ETBs and the existing patrons/landowners concerning the possible transfer of schools to accommodate this demonstrated demand for diversity.</p>  <p>  Each ETB will then prepare a report for the Department outlining the levels of demand within their functional areas and the responses of the existing patrons as to how this might be accommodated through the reconfiguration of existing school provision.</p>  <p>  In the subsequent implementation phase, where the level of demand for multidenominational schools is sufficient to justify transfer of a school from denominational to multi-denominational patronage, a process will commence to give effect to that.  There will be a role for the existing patron/landowner in consulting with local community and school interests and taking into account proposals from different prospective multi-denominational patrons.  It is envisaged that transfers will largely be by way of voluntary transfer of live schools by existing patrons.</p>  <p>  This new process for supporting transfers of schools to multi-denominational patrons in response to the wishes of local families is based around principles of transparency and co-operation.  Therefore, there will be a very substantial level of consultation of local communities in the process, both with the ETBs&rsquo; in the initial phase to establish evidence of demand by consulting pre-school parents and subsequently through the requirement for the existing patron to consult with local community and school interests in proposing to transfer patronage of an existing school to an alternative patron body.  In that process, the existing patron will also take into account proposals from all prospective multidenominational patrons that wish to be considered.</p></reply>

The schools are multi-denominational, and they allow for belief nurturing during the school day.  The Community National School (CNS) model was initially piloted in two schools.  Since then it has expanded with a total of eleven new Community National Schools, located in four ETB areas across the country (Dublin and Dun Laoghaire, Cork, Kildare and Wicklow, and Louth and Meath), being established in line with the patronage selection process operated by my Department.  Patronage of all the schools formally transferred from the Minister to the relevant ETB in 2016. </p>  <p>  Community National Schools are multidenominational, and aim to accommodate parents who wish to have their children learn about different faiths and beliefs while at the same time nurturing children in their own beliefs. The schools do not prioritise any particular religion or belief.</p>  <p>  The &lsquo;Goodness Me, Goodness You&rsquo; (GMGY) curriculum is the patron&rsquo;s programme that underpins the characteristic spirit of CNS schools, and is being developed by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA). GMGY is a common programme suitable for pupils of all faiths and beliefs and none.  Children learn together about the same themes and the schools communicate with parents so that families can talk at home about the different themes from their own faith and belief perspective.  The GMGY programme has evolved since the establishment of the schools, taking account of feedback from teachers, parents, pupils and faith and belief leaders. </p>  <p>  Parents can opt for their child to receive belief-specific teaching for a time during the school year and may request additional supports around specific rites of passage.  This approach is open to parents and pupils of all religions and beliefs and none.  The approach that a school takes to belief-specific teaching and rites of passage may be different in each Community National School, depending on the needs of the school community and the practices of local belief communities.  </p>  <p>  Article 44 of the Constitution and Section 30 of the Education Act 1998, which apply to all recognised schools, provide that parents have a right to have their children opt out of religion classes if they so wish.  The manner in which any school ensures that the right to opt out of religion classes is upheld is a matter for the school concerned.  Each individual school determines the particular arrangements which are most appropriate in its individual circumstances having regard to local issues such as, for example, available space and supervision requirements. </p>  <p>  The Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2016, which completed second stage in the D&aacute;il in November, includes a specific requirement that school enrolment policies must include details of the school&rsquo;s arrangements for any students who do not wish to attend religious instruction.  This is an important measure which will help ensure transparency from the outset as to how a school will uphold the rights of parents in this regard.</p>  <p>  The operation of Community National Schools, like all other recognised schools, is subject to ongoing inspection and evaluation.  My Department's school inspectorate inspects the schools on an ongoing basis and this has included a Whole School Evaluation in certain cases.  The findings of such Whole School Evaluations are published on my Department's website.  In addition, the schools all engage in school self-evaluation, the findings of which are published on school websites. </p></reply>

For the 2016-2017, some &euro;30m was allocated and is now being distributed to eligible schools.  The amounts to be paid per school are based on the number of qualifying students enrolled in eligible schools, and so the &euro;30m is fully allocated.</p>  <p>  New schools and schools in new buildings receive ICT equipment grants as part of their furniture and equipment funding.  For primary schools, &euro;5,000 per classroom is allocated, while at post-primary level, the allocation depends on the room use - a business/computer room for example is allocated some &euro;26,500 for that room alone.  General classrooms are also allocated funding at post-primary level.  The cut off year at which schools will become eligible will move forward year on year - so a school that opened in 2013 for example, will become eligible for funding in the 2017-2018 school year, and so on.  There are no plans to review the criteria for the scheme. </p>  <p>  Subject to the availability of exchequer funding, it is anticipated that an equipment grant scheme will operate in each year up to the 2020-2021 school year. </p>  <p>  The Digital Strategy for Schools 2015-2020 (Enhancing Teaching, Learning &amp;amp; Assessment), launched in October 2015, sets out a clear vision for the role of ICT in teaching, learning and assessment in primary and post primary schools.

As I explained in that reply contributions are being made under the binding 2002 Indemnity Agreement and under voluntary offers made in 2009 in the aftermath of the publication of the Report of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse.  Since providing that response two further properties have been fully transferred under the terms of the Indemnity Agreement.  Those properties are:</p><p>- Kidron, Old Chapel, Bandon, Co.

Cork, valued at &euro;4,445,000.</p><p>Both properties have transferred to the ownership of the Health Service Executive.</p><p>The completion of these transfers brings to 50 the number of properties fully transferred under the Indemnity Agreement.  The total value of these properties is &euro;48,466,175 which represents 76.4% of the total monetary value of all properties transferring under this aspect of the agreement.  Cash contributions of &euro;54.42 million due under the Agreement have been paid in full while information has been provided to my Department that confirms that counselling services in excess of the &euro;10 million provided for in the Agreement have been funded directly by the contributing congregations.</p><p>A list of the remaining properties which have yet to be fully transferred, and in relation to which work is continuing to complete the legal requirements to finalise the transfer process, is set out below.  In most cases these properties are currently in use by the intended recipients.</p><p>Respite Centre, Garretstown, Co.

The Direction was subsequently renewed on two occasions, with the last renewal expiring on 30 April 2016.  At the time of the last renewal in February 2016, the Housing Agency was requested to conduct a review of the operation of the Direction and provide an impartial assessment.</p><p>The Agency recommended that the Direction should be allowed to lapse upon its expiry.</p><p>This Direction was only ever intended to operate for a short period of time to provide an immediate increase in the number of social housing tenancies being allocated to homeless households.  In the normal course, local authorities and their elected members are best placed to determine the allocation of social housing for their own areas, in line with national policy.</p><p>Among the Agency&rsquo;s findings was that the well-established allocation procedures of housing authorities are capable of responding to particular housing need without an on-going Ministerial Direction.  This analysis is vindicated by the fact that, in the first 6 months of 2016, local authorities nationally assisted more than 1,350 sustainable exits from homelessness into independent tenancies, with almost half of these going into social housing tenancies.  While final details are awaited, it is anticipated that housing authorities will have assisted 2,700 sustainable exits from homelessness during 2016, a record level of exits, with a comparable figure of 2,300 in 2015.</p><p>Taking account of the Housing Agency's report, my predecessor decided not to renew the Ministerial Direction after 30 April 2016 and I do not propose to revisit the issue.  I am confident that the comprehensive range of actions and initiatives underway to increase housing supply generally, as set out in the <i>Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness,</i>will enable local authorities to prioritise appropriately the level of housing allocations to homeless households and other vulnerable groups achieved under the Direction.</p></reply>

As I am satisfied that housing authorities are making every effort to make the most suitable accommodation available to homeless households seeking emergency accommodation, I do not believe it is necessary to introduce legislative amendments in this regard.  Accommodating family units in commercial hotel arrangements is inappropriate for anything other than a short period of time. <i>Rebuilding Ireland: Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness</i>fully recognises that the period of time that families spend in emergency hotel accommodation should be minimised.  This is reflected in the commitment that, by mid-2017, hotels should only be used in limited circumstances as emergency accommodation for families.  Full details and timeframes in relation to the range of actions to address family homelessness are set out in <i>Rebuilding Ireland</i>, which is available on the www.rebuildingireland.ie website.</p><p>The increases in Rent Supplement and Housing Assistance Payment levels from 1 July 2016 will play an important role in the achievement of this overall objective, in terms of supporting families to remain in rented accommodation.  However, where families do find themselves in homelessness situations, there are a range of solutions in place and bring progressed.  These include the Housing Agency programme to acquire 1,600 units and the expanded HAP Homeless Pilot Scheme in Dublin, where some 800 homeless HAP tenancies were entered into by end-2016 and a further 1,200 tenancies are targeted for 2017 across the Dublin Region.  A rapid-build programme is also in place, with over 350 rapid-build homes advancing at end-2016.  My Department engages with the Dublin Region local authorities on a regular and on-going basis in relation to the delivery of these initiatives.</p></reply>

The Regulations specify requirements in relation to a range of matters, such as structural repair, sanitary facilities, heating, ventilation, natural light and safety of gas and electrical supply.  With very limited exemptions, these regulations apply to local authority and voluntary housing units as well as private rented residential accommodation.</p><p>All landlords have a legal obligation to ensure that their rented properties comply with these regulations.  Responsibility for the enforcement of the regulations rests with the relevant local authority, supported by a dedicated stream of funding provided from part of the proceeds of tenancy registration fees collected by the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB).</p><p>Under section 159 of the Local Government Act 2001, each Chief Executive is responsible for the staffing and organisational arrangements necessary for carrying out the functions of the local authorities for which he or she is responsible.  It is therefore, a matter for each individual Chief Executive to assign staff to specific divisions within their organisation.  In general, detailed information on local authority staffing levels is not available in my Department.  However, Wexford County Council has indicated to my Department that they currently have 3 staff (1.0 Whole Time Equivalent) dedicated to inspections of rental properties regarding compliance with the regulations.</p><p>Since the establishment of the RTB in 2004, over &euro;32 million has been paid to local authorities to assist them in the performance of their functions under the Housing Acts, including the inspection of rented accommodation.  Over 185,000 inspections have been carried out in this period.  Following the enactment of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, local authorities have a strengthened legislative framework available to them which provides for the issuing of Improvement Notices and Prohibition Notices, where landlords are in breach of their obligations.  Fines for non-compliance with the regulations were also increased; the maximum fine increased from &euro;3,000 to &euro;5,000 and the fine for each day of a continuing offence increased from &euro;250 to &euro;400.</p><p>The Government&rsquo;s <i>Strategy for the Rental Sector</i>, published in December last, sets out a number of actions under standards with the combined aim of improving the quality and management of rental accommodation.  Under the standards heading, my Department conducted a review of the existing Regulations in 2016 to bring them into line with modern requirements with a focus on tenant safety including new measures covering heating appliances, carbon monoxide and window safety.</p><p>On 27 January, I signed the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2017 giving effect to the commitment in the Strategy.  The regulations come into operation generally on 1 July 2017, replacing the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2008 and the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) (Amendment) Regulations 2009.</p><p>The Strategy also prioritises strengthening the inspection capacity of Local Authorities to increase the number and frequency of inspections of rental properties.  In addition to the updated regulations, procedures for a more efficient, standardised and transparent inspections and enforcement approach across all Local Authority areas will be introduced; and specific ring-fenced funding for inspections will be provided from 2018 onwards, so that by 2021 25% of rental properties will be inspected every year.</p></reply>

The scheme is applicable to dwellings which are subject to significant damage attributable to pyritic heave established in accordance <i>with I.S. 398-1:2013 - Reactive pyrite in sub-floor hardcore material &ndash; Part 1: Testing and categorisation protocol</i>.  It is a condition of eligibility under the scheme that an application to the Board must be accompanied by a Building Condition Assessment with a Damage Condition Rating of 2.

However, there was a downward trend in appeal receipts between 2015 and 2016 in all of the other schemes mentioned by the Deputy: 4,912 disability allowance appeals were received during 2016 compared with 6,435 received in 2015; 1,198 domiciliary care allowance appeals were received in 2016 (1,258 in 2015); 1,362 invalidity pension appeals were received in 2016 (1,857 in 2015); and 819 illness benefit appeals were received in 2016 (1,204 in 2015).</p><p>In terms of the outcome of the appeals in question which were determined during 2016, some 64.4% of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance appeals had a favourable outcome i.e. were either allowed or partially allowed by an Appeals Officer, or revised in favour of the appellant by the Department&rsquo;s Deciding Officer or Designated Person in light of the appeal contentions and evidence adduced in support of the appeal.  Some 72.1% of disability allowance appeals determined during 2016 had a successful outcome; as had 80.5% of domiciliary care allowance appeals; 80.6% of invalidity pension appeals and 54.8% of illness benefit appeals determined during 2016.</p><p>There are a number of reasons why a decision which was refused at first instance might be successful on appeal and it is not necessarily the case that the first decision was wrong.</p><p>Where new evidence is provided with an appeal, the original decision may be revised by the Deciding Officer or Designated Person.  This was the case in some 34.4% of the 8,967 appeals which had a favourable outcome in 2016 in respect of the above schemes.  Where the decision is not revised in the Department in light of the appeal contentions, further evidence is often provided by the appellant as the appeal process proceeds.  In addition, the Appeals Officer may gain insights when they meet the appellant in person at oral hearing which may also influence the outcome of the appeal.</p><p><b>Appeals Received and Finalised 1 January 2016 &ndash; 31 December 2016</b><table><tr><th><b>Scheme</b></th><th><b>Appeals Received</b></th><th><b>Appeals Finalised</b></th><th></th><th></th><th><b>Favourable outcome</b></th><th><b>Disallowed</b></th><th><b>Withdrawn</b></th></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td><b>Revised Deciding Officer Decision</b></td><td><b>Allowed</b><br /><br /><b>by AO</b></td><td><b>Partially Allowed by AO</b></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><b>Carer&rsquo;s Allowance</b></td><td>3.887</td><td>3,624</td><td>815</td><td>1,375</td><td>145</td><td>1,237</td><td>52</td></tr><tr><td><b>Disability Allowance</b></td><td>4,912</td><td>5,175</td><td>815</td><td>2,830</td><td>88</td><td>1,367</td><td>75</td></tr><tr><td><b>Domiciliary Care Allowance</b></td><td>1,198</td><td>1,344</td><td>469</td><td>596</td><td>18</td><td>250</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td><b>Invalidity Pension</b></td><td>1,362</td><td>1,654</td><td>642</td><td>682</td><td>10</td><td>302</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td><b>Illness Benefit</b></td><td>819</td><td>880</td><td>341</td><td>136</td><td>5</td><td>168</td><td>230</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Damian Green, M.P. on Thursday, 2nd February 2017 to discuss two main issues, namely:</p>  <p>  1. Information exchange on the UK&rsquo;s welfare reforms with regard to pensions, working age and also illness payments; and</p>  <p>  2. The social protection implications of the vote by the UK to leave the EU.  </p>  <p>  Social security is, clearly, one of the major issues as part of the Brexit process as it impacts on the daily lives of people.  My meeting with the Secretary of State was part of the wider engagement by Government with our fellow EU Member States including the UK.  Ireland, of course, will negotiate as part of the EU 27, when the UK triggers Article 50 and will be working with the UK and our EU partners to deliver the best possible result.</p>  <p>  At present, and as with all EU and EEA Member States and Switzerland, the UK is part of the EU Regulations that co-ordinate the social security entitlements of people who work, live and move within the EU.  These co-ordinating regulations do not harmonise the social security system of Member States but, rather, support free movement throughout the EU/EEA by removing barriers to workers.  These arrangements will continue to apply and entitlements will remain unchanged until such time as the UK leaves the EU.</p>  <p>  Ireland also has a Bilateral Agreement with the UK on social security [S.I. No 701/2007 &ndash; Convention on Social Security between the Government of Ireland and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland].  This Agreement consolidated the terms of earlier agreements, modified them to take account of legislative changes in both countries and extended their scope to the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands. </p>  <p>  I emphasised to the Secretary of State that our long-term objective is to ensure that the reciprocity of civic rights and, specifically in the context of the meeting, social welfare rights and entitlements, which currently exist for Irish and UK citizens moving within Ireland and between Ireland and Britain under the Common Travel Area (CTA), are safeguarded and maintained.  The meeting was very positive and constructive and it was agreed that officials from both Departments will work together and share information towards finding practical solutions.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-02-09a.351.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017020900070#WRJ01400"><p>The latest CSO Survey on Income and Living Conditions for 2015 shows that the consistent poverty rate for lone parent households is 26.2%, up from 25% in 2014.  The deprivation rate for lone parent households fell from 58.7 per cent in 2014 to 57.9% in 2015.  The at-risk-of-poverty rate for lone parent households is largely unchanged in 2015 at 36.2%, compared to 36.5% in 2014.</p>  <p>  The full impact of the recovery is not reflected in these 2015 figures.  Macro-economic and labour market indicators have shown continued economic and employment growth since then.  Unemployment has fallen from 9.5% in mid-2015 to 7.1% now.  The number of people in receipt of working-age income and employment supports continued to fall.  The full impact of the reforms to the one-parent family payment (OFP) and the positive impact of recent Budgets on lone parents are also not reflected in these figures. </p>  <p>  In Budget 2016 lone parents benefited from a number of measures including increases in child benefit, changes to the means test on the jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment to align it with the more generous means test on the one-parent family payment, and increases in the family income supplement thresholds.  In Budget 2017 all lone parents on OFP, the jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment (JST) and jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance (JA) will benefit from the &euro;5 increase in the weekly rates of payment from March.  A new &euro;500 annual Cost of Education Allowance will be made available to Back to Education Allowance participants with children from the next academic year in September.  In addition, the income disregards for OFP and JST have risen by &euro;20 from January this year, from &euro;90 to &euro;110 per week, reversing in part previous reductions, to encourage one parent families to stay in, and return to, work.  During that time the national minimum wage also increased from &euro;8.65 to &euro;9.25 per hour.</p>  <p>  The improvement in the economy combined with these Budget measures is likely to have supported a reduction in poverty since the period in 2015 to which the SILC publication refers.  This improvement is expected to continue with further rises in incomes and living standards.</p>  <p>  The Department of Social Protection&rsquo;s social impact assessment of Budget 2017 showed that average household incomes increase by 1%. Non-earning lone parents were the biggest beneficiary of Budget 2017 with gains of 4.5%.  Working lone parents also experienced above average gains at almost 1.2%.  This represents a cumulative increase across Budgets 2015, 2016 and 2017 of 4% or almost &euro;27 per week for working lone parents and 6.9% or just over &euro;24 per week for lone parents who are not working.  </p>  <p>  Initial indicative data from the latest Quarterly National Household Survey also shows that there has been a significant increase in the percentage of lone parents in employment in the year since the end of June 2016.  This increase relates to all lone parents in the State and reflects the increase in economic and employment growth generally.  The magnitude of the increase for lone parents specifically, however, is clearly significant and cannot be dismissed. </p>  <p>  We know that social transfers are very effective in reducing poverty and that Eurostat data shows that Ireland performs well in this regard.  But we also know that reducing poverty for lone parents is not just about income support.  It is also about supporting lone parents to make the transition into employment and assisting these families through the provision of quality services in areas such as activation including education, training and employment supports, and childcare.</p>  <p>  As part of the OFP reforms the Department has begun engaging with lone parents whose youngest child is seven years and older, on a proactive and supported basis. To date over 9,000 lone parents, of the 14,500 lone parents who are on the jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment, have been selected for activation.  This is a very significant step forward in addressing the poverty rates for these families.  Over 6,000 of those 9,000 lone parents have already been selected for activation and have been case managed, are scheduled for an engagement or are awaiting an appointment time.  The remaining 3,000 individuals have been fully case managed which means they have met with a case officer, have agreed a personal plan and are progressing with this plan which includes moving into education and training on foot of their engagement.</p>  <p>  It will take time to see the full impact of these activation engagements as it will take time for lone parents to complete the education, training or employment support programmes.</p>  <p>  Continued economic recovery, together with the actions outlined above will support further reductions in poverty over the coming years.  The independent review of the one-parent family payment reforms, once completed, will also assist with discussions in my Department on measures for lone parents in Budget 2018.</p></reply>

The EU average is 9.5%. Ireland ranks 4th  lowest with a rate of 4.8%. </p>  <p>  The full impact of the recovery is not reflected in these 2015 figures.  Macro-economic and labour market indicators have shown continued economic and employment growth since then.  The number of people in receipt of working-age income and employment supports has continued to fall. </p>  <p>  With these improvements, the Government was in a position to introduce a range of welfare increases from 2016 onwards.  Measures include increases in core weekly rates for working-age adults, child benefit, income disregards for lone parents, rent limits for housing support payments and new initiatives to make work pay, such as the Back to Work Family Dividend. </p>  <p>  Income supports play an important role in addressing poverty.  The Family Income Supplement (FIS) and Back to Work Family Dividend (BTWFD) are important in-work supports for this group.  FIS is an in-work support which provides an income top-up for employees on low earnings with children.  It is designed to prevent in-work poverty for low paid workers with child dependants and to offer a financial incentive to take-up employment.  The BTWFD is a targeted scheme designed to further improve the incentive to take-up employment or self-employment for welfare recipients with children.  In 2015, social transfers reduced the at-risk-of-poverty rate for people of working-age from 35.3% to 18.2%.  This equates to a poverty reduction effect of 52% in 2015. </p>  <p>  Recent budgets have been forward looking, allocating limited resources in a prudent way, to make sure that everyone benefits from the recovery.  The focus of these budgets has also been on the provision of services rather than simply on income supports (e.g. extension of the School Meals Scheme and the Single Affordable Childcare Scheme).</p>  <p>  The Social Impact Assessment of Budgets 2016 and 2017 show average household incomes increasing by 1.6% (&euro;14.30 per week) and 1% (&euro;9.20 per week) respectively.  They also provided greater rewards for working, with over 80% of the unemployed substantially better-off in work and almost 70% of the working population experiencing a reduction in their Marginal Effective Tax Rate. </p>  <p>  The improvement in the economy, together with the welfare measures referred to, are likely to have supported a reduction in poverty since the period in 2015 to which the SILC publication refers.  This improvement is expected to continue with further rises in incomes and living standards.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s strategy for addressing poverty and social exclusion is set out in the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion.  The Plan identifies a wide range of targeted actions and interventions to achieve the overall objective of reducing consistent poverty.  The Department will review the Plan this year, as it reaches the end of its current term, with a view to developing an updated plan for future periods.  The Department will also review the national social target for poverty reduction.  This review will be undertaken in consultation with relevant stakeholders.</p></reply>

This reflects the rise in real median disposable income of 6.2% in 2015, driven by employment growth and the safeguarding of social welfare payments. </p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s strategy for addressing poverty and social exclusion is set out in the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion.  The Plan identifies a wide range of targeted actions and interventions to achieve the overall objective of reducing consistent poverty.  The Department will review the Plan this year, as it reaches the end of its current term, with a view to developing an updated plan for future periods.  The Department will also review the national social target for poverty reduction.  This review will be undertaken in consultation with relevant stakeholders.</p>  <p>  Income supports will continue to play an important role in addressing social exclusion and income inequality.  During 2017, more than 840,000 people will benefit from the first increase in weekly payments for working-age adults since 2009.  Using Eurostat data for 2015, social transfers (excluding pensions) reduced the at-risk-of-poverty rate in Ireland from 36.2% to 16.3%, thereby lifting a fifth of the population out of income poverty.  This represents a poverty reduction effect at 55%, far in excess of the EU norm of 33.5%.  Ireland is the best performing EU member state in reducing poverty through social transfers.</p>  <p>  Income support is only one aspect of the whole-of-government policy response to addressing poverty.  The other components are inclusive labour markets and access to quality services.  Growing employment and providing access to the labour market is important for tackling poverty, particularly in welfare-dependent households.  The Pathways to Work 2016 - 2020 Strategy focuses on ensuring jobseekers can access good quality work, training and education opportunities.  It continues to prioritise the activation of the long-term and young unemployed people, with supports provided through the network of Intreo offices.</p>  <p>  Recent budgets have been forward looking, allocating limited resources in a prudent way, to make sure that everyone benefits from the recovery.  The focus of these budgets has also been on the provision of services rather than simply on income supports (e.g. extension of the School Meals Scheme and the Single Affordable Childcare Scheme).</p>  <p>  More broadly, the updated National Action Plan for Social Inclusion reflects the multi-dimensional nature of poverty.  The policy goals include a focus on early childhood development, youth exclusion, access to the labour market including measures for people with disabilities, migrant integration, social housing and affordable energy.</p></reply>

This is a significant decrease of almost 5 percentage points, from 18.1%, in the past 12 months.  The overall unemployment rate has fallen by 1.4 percentage points from 8.5% in January 2016 to 7.1% in January 2017.</p>  <p>  Reduced rates for younger jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance recipients were first introduced in 2009 and were further extended in subsequent budgets to apply to jobseekers under 26 years of age.</p>  <p>  These measures were introduced as they were considered to prevent young people from entering welfare dependency by providing young jobseekers with a strong financial incentive to engage in education or training or to take up employment.  Should a young jobseeker on a reduced jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance payment participate on an education or training programme they will receive a higher weekly payment of &euro;160. This rate will be further increased to &euro;193 per week from September 2017.</p>  <p>  The review of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance rates for young persons under 26 years of age will examine the effectiveness of the reduced rates in encouraging young jobseekers to avail of education, training, employment programmes and opportunities.  As part of a wider effort to encourage and promote research based on the Department&rsquo;s administrative data, researchers from the National University of Ireland, Maynooth have been provided with data on all JA claims since 2007 for persons aged under 28 years.  They intend looking specifically at the impact of changes in rates on the duration of young people&rsquo;s claims and on their subsequent employment experience after exiting from unemployment.  Some preliminary analysis has been done and work is ongoing.  I hope that this review will be completed in the coming months, subject to the necessary data being available and the required level of analysis involved being completed.</p>  <p>  I am committed to ensuring my Department identifies effective measures to incentivise and support young people in finding and securing sustainable jobs.  The best way to do this is through engagement processes and by incentivising them to avail of educational and training opportunities, thereby enhancing their employment prospects.</p></reply>

Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension, all contributions paid or credited over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement.</p>  <p>  Since 1961, when contributory pensions were introduced, the average contributions test has been used in calculating the rate of pension entitlement.  Entitlement is banded, with the maximum rate payable to those with a yearly average of 48-52 contributions, and the minimum rate payable to those with a yearly average in the range of 10-14 contributions per year.  Even if someone has only 10 years (520 weeks) of paid reckonable contributions between their 16th and 66th birthdays, they would generally qualify for a State pension (contributory), although the rate payable would vary depending on their circumstances, and it will not always be their most advantageous payment to claim, particularly if they qualify for a full-rate State pension (non-contributory).</p>  <p>  The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme was introduced in 1994 to make qualification for State pension contributory (SPC) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme allows up to 20 years from that date spent caring for children under 12 years of age, or incapacitated people, to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being calculated for pension purposes.  The effect of this is to reduce the number of years by which the person&rsquo;s contributions are divided, thereby increasing their yearly average, making it easier for them to qualify for a maximum rate SPC. It does not involve the award of credits.</p>  <p>  My Department reviews these and other provisions on an ongoing basis and has estimated that the cost of extending the Homemaker's scheme to allow people to avail of the full 20 years currently allowed under the scheme, encompassing periods prior to 1994, could cost &euro;290m in 2017.  This figure would increase in subsequent years.</p>  <p>  It is worth noting that the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund in 2012 confirmed that the Fund provides better value to female rather than male contributors.  This is due to the redistributive nature of the Fund.</p>  <p>  Where people who were unattached to the labour market during most of their adult lives cannot qualify for a contributory pension in their own right as they have paid few or no contributions, or cannot qualify for a full rate as a result of an intermittent PRSI record, the social protection system provides alternative methods of supporting such pensioners in old age.  Therefore, if their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension based on their means, which by default is paid directly to them.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State Pension (non-contributory), amounting up to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate, based on their household means. </p>  <p>  The National Pensions Framework (2010) proposed that a &ldquo;Total Contribution Approach&rdquo; (TCA) should replace the yearly average approach, for new pensioners from 2020.  The aim of this approach is to make the rate of contributory pension more closely match contributions made by a person.  Officials of my Department are currently working on the detailed development of the TCA with a view to making proposals for consideration later in the year.  This is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative, and technical elements in its implementation.  An important element in the final design of the scheme will be the position of people who have gaps in their contribution records for various reasons, and this factor is being considered very carefully in developing this reform. </p>  <p>  The forthcoming independent Actuarial review of the Social Insurance Fund will provide data that will allow officials to accurately cost and project various options under the TCA reform.  Following the analysis of those data, it is intended to have a public consultation later this year, and following this, proposals on the final details of the scheme will be made by the Government to the Oireachtas before the end of the year. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

I have noted the clarification issued by the Embassy of the United States in Dublin on 31 January, 2017, to the effect that the Executive Order in question does not restrict the travel of dual nationals to the United States, so long as they hold the passport of an unrestricted country and possess a valid US visa, if required.

The situation is being closely monitored by my Department and by the Embassy of Ireland in Mexico, which is accredited to Colombia.  I reiterate that I condemn unreservedly any intimidation or violence perpetrated against human rights defenders in Colombia or elsewhere.  I firmly believe that the Colombian peace process, which aims to create a virtuous circle between peacebuilding and respect for human rights, provides the framework in which the endemic violence and impunity which has afflicted Colombian society can successfully be addressed.</p>  <p>  I had the opportunity to discuss the peace process in Colombia with my EU colleagues and with the President of Colombia, Mr Juan Manuel Santos, at the Foreign Affairs Council in Brussels on 12 December.  The EU Special Envoy to the Colombian Peace Process, Mr Eamon Gilmore, also participated in our discussion.  I made clear the importance Ireland attaches to supporting the implementation of the peace agreement, and noted the need for all parties to the process to maintain momentum and to ensure that the citizens of Colombia begin to see evidence of a peace dividend.  </p>  <p>  Ireland is a founder member and one of the largest contributors to the EU Trust Fund for Colombia.  We have committed to providing &euro;3 million in funding over the lifetime of the Fund, which aims to support the implementation of the peace agreement. Ireland has been closely involved in discussion of its strategic direction and advocated a strong human rights perspective for the Fund, in keeping with our commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights internationally.  We will continue to prioritise this issue as the agreement between the Government of Colombia and the FARC is implemented in the months and years ahead. </p>  <p>  Officials from my Department regularly meet representatives of human rights organisations active in Colombia.  Most recently, in November 2016, they hosted a delegation from Peace Brigades International to discuss the worrying increase in violence against local leaders and human rights defenders in Colombia. </p>  <p>  Officials from our Embassy in Mexico regularly interact with organisations working to promote and defend human rights in Colombia.  Ireland has provided more than &euro;10 million to international and local civil society organizations in Colombia in the past decade, including to the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and Christian Aid, amongst others.  In addition, Ireland regularly raises issues relating to human rights directly in Bogot&aacute; and via the UN and European Union.</p></reply>

I am pleased that I secured significant additional funding for the Arts Council in Budget 2017 amounting to an increase of &euro;5 million, or 8%.  This increase will enable the Council to enhance support to artists and arts organisations around the country, including young and upcoming artists, in line with its strategy statement, <i>Making Great Art Work</i>, which prioritises support for the artist and public engagement.</p><p>In addition, my Department, through Culture Ireland, provides supports for Irish artists and musicians to travel abroad and develop their careers.  I have increased the annual baseline funding for Culture Ireland from &euro;2.5m in 2016 to &euro;3.5m in 2017. </p><p>My Department also provides funding for an annual scheme to assist in the purchase of musical instruments by talented individuals and groups.

Further details are available on the website of Music Network at www.musicnetwork.ie</p><p>In addition to funding for the purchase of musical instruments, my Department provides funding to Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann (CC&Eacute;) for its work in the protection and promotion of Irish traditional music and culture.

Financial support is provided through a number of structured schemes for the repair, conservation, preservation or safeguarding of protected structures, sites or monuments.  </p><p>The Structures at Risk Fund seeks to encourage the regeneration and reuse of heritage properties and to help to secure the preservation of protected structures, in both private and public ownership, which might otherwise be lost.  The Built Heritage Investment Scheme (BHIS) was developed to assist with the repair and conservation of structures that are protected under the <i>Planning and Development Act 2000</i>(as amended).</p><p>Both these schemes are administered through the local authorities and I recently announced that they will be open for applications throughout the month of February.  It is a matter for each local authority to invite applications and to submit them to my Department by the due dates.  On receipt, applications will be examined by my Department and I will announce funding allocations in due course, including to the two local authorities in question. </p><p>The Heritage Council, which my Department funds, also provides grants for the protection and preservation of the built heritage.  It is primarily a matter for the Heritage Council to decide how its funding should be allocated across the range of research, education and conservation programmes it supports annually having regard to competing priorities for limited resources.  The announcement of any proposed grant schemes for 2017 will be advertised by the Heritage Council on www.heritagecouncil.ie.  </p><p>My Department is also providing &euro;350,000 of funding to the OPW in 2017 to assist in the conservation and presentation of historic buildings and national monuments in State ownership.  OPW undertakes the care and maintenance of national monuments in my ownership or guardianship (of which there are approximately 750).  My Department&rsquo;s National Monuments Service works in close collaboration with the OPW on survey, excavation and research work to optimise the protection, management, interpretation and presentation of national monuments in State care.  </p></reply>

Decisions on admissions to undergraduate courses are made by the HEIs who instruct the CAO to make offers to candidates who meet the required criteria.</p>  <p>  I can confirm that the places for undergraduate degree programme are currently set at 1,570.  This figure was considered to ensure that capacity factors including clinical placement requirements are available to each student on the programme.  Each placement requires supervisory, teaching and assessment support, all of which are resource intense.  It should also be noted that during the final year of the programme the student is paid 70% of the first point of the staff nurse salary scale for a period of 36 weeks.</p>  <p>  Allocation of these places is made to both standard and mature applicants.  Standard applicants include those applying on the basis of leaving certificate results and QQI FET (FETAC) level 5 awards.  Mature applicants apply on the basis of being over 23 years and an assessment test.  Approximately 15% of places are allocated to mature applicants.</p>  <p>  It is the decision of the universities and colleges as to the quota of places made available to QQI FET applicants and not all courses will accept these applicants.  The overall quotas available for QQI FET applicants is limited - for example in 2016, there were 1,581 applications using QQI FET awards for approximately 98 places.</p>  <p>  I would also like to advise the Deputy that the budget for these degree programmes is held by the Department of Education and Skills.</p>  <p>  During 2016, the Department wrote to the Minister of Education and Skills highlighting the current shortage of nurses in Ireland, especially psychiatric nurses.  The Department sought an increase in the number of undergraduate nursing places available in HEIs in the 2016/2017 academic year in order to reduce the shortage of psychiatric nurses in Ireland.</p>  <p>  In that regard, I wish to advise you that the Department of Education and Skills and the Higher Education Authority agreed to increase the Psychiatric nursing places by 60 for the 2016/2017 intake.  Workforce planning for replacement psychiatric nurses that are due to retire in the next few years is also currently under review.</p></reply>

Part 3 requires the HSE to have regard to the following criteria: </p>  <p>1. the health needs of the public;</p>  <p>2. the cost-effectiveness of meeting health needs by supplying the item concerned rather than providing other health services;</p>  <p>3. the availability and suitability of items for supply or reimbursement;</p>  <p>4. the proposed costs, benefits and risks of the item or listed item relative to therapeutically similar items or listed items provided in other health service settings and the level of certainty in relation to the evidence of those costs, benefits and risks;</p>  <p>5. the potential or actual budget impact of the item or listed item; </p>  <p>6. the clinical need for the item or listed item;</p>  <p>7. the appropriate level of clinical supervision required in relation to the item to ensure patient safety;</p>  <p>8. the efficacy (performance in trial), effectiveness (performance in real situations) and added therapeutic benefit against existing standards of treatment (how much better it treats a condition than existing therapies);</p>  <p>9. and the resources available to the HSE.</p>  <p>  I am informed that, following a request from the HSE, the NCPE carried out an assessment of the manufacturer's economic dossier submitted in March 2016 on the cost effectiveness of Orkambi.  This dossier included details on all relevant costs and relevant cost offsets including those associated with hospitalisation, disease management costs, intravenous antibiotics, adverse events and any additional costs arising in patients not taking Orkambi.</p>  <p>  The NCPE has completed its Health Technology Assessment and this is available on its website.  It was submitted to the HSE in June 2016. The NCPE determined, following an evaluation of the economic dossier, that the manufacturer failed to demonstrate cost-effectiveness or value for money from using the drug.  The NCPE have confirmed that all relevant costs were included in the analysis.  In line with the HSE's assessment process, the HSE Drugs Committee considered the NCPE recommendation, the manufacturers submissions and commercial offer and other information.  Following this consideration the Drugs Committee did not recommend reimbursement at the current price.  The HSE Directorate considered the Drugs Committee&rsquo;s recommendation in December and the Directorate took the decision not to reimburse at the current price offered by the company.</p>  <p>  The HSE has since re-entered into negotiations with Vertex, the manufacturer of Orkambi, with a view to significantly reducing the cost of Orkambi.  A meeting was held in December and again in early January.  Following completion of the negotiation process, I am advised that the HSE&rsquo;s Drugs Committee met at the end of January and considered the manufacturer's latest price offerings.

Part 3 requires the HSE to have regard to the following criteria:</p><p>1.  the health needs of the public; </p><p>2.  the cost-effectiveness of meeting health needs by supplying the item concerned rather than providing other health services;</p><p>3.  the availability and suitability of items for supply or reimbursement;</p><p>4.  the proposed costs, benefits and risks of the item or listed item relative to therapeutically similar items or listed items provided in other health service settings and the level of certainty in relation to the evidence of those costs, benefits and risks;</p><p>5.  the potential or actual budget impact of the item or listed item;</p><p>6.  the clinical need for the item or listed item;</p><p>7.  the appropriate level of clinical supervision required in relation to the item to ensure patient safety;</p><p>8.  the efficacy (performance in trial), effectiveness (performance in real situations) and added therapeutic benefit against existing standards of treatment (how much better it treats a condition than existing therapies); and</p><p>9.  the resources available to the HSE. </p><p>I am informed that the HSE received a request and economic dossier from the manufacturer of Respreeza for maintenance treatment of emphysema in adults with documented severe alpha1-proteinase inhibitor deficiency.</p><p>In June of this year the HSE asked the NCPE to carry out a health technology assessment on the cost effectiveness of this treatment.  The NCPE completed its assessment and made a recommendation on 9 December 2016.  The NCPE determined that the manufacturer failed to demonstrate cost-effectiveness of the drug and did not recommend it for reimbursement.</p><p>A summary of the health technology assessment has been published on the NCPE website and is available at: www.ncpe.ie/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/NCPE-website-summary_Final.pdf.</p><p>The HSE will consider the NCPE assessment, and other expert advice, as part of its decision-making process for reimbursement.  This decision will be made on objective, scientific and economic grounds by the HSE in line with the 2013 Act.</p><p>The operation of compassionate access schemes is at the discretion of manufacturers.  There is no provision in Irish legislation for the approval of compassionate use programmes for specific groups of patients with an unmet medical need.  I have previously asked manufacturers to show compassion and to maintain compassionate access schemes for patients during the assessment process by the HSE and this remains the position.  The manufacturer of Respreeza, CSL Behring, has confirmed that the compassionate programme has been extended until the end of February 2017.</p></reply>

The development of a regulatory and funding model for homecare services is a complex undertaking involving very significant legislative, operational and financial resources.</p>  <p>  A significant amount of detailed preparation needs to be done before final decisions are taken on the form of a home care scheme and the regulation of these services.  In 2016 the Department commissioned the Health Research Board to carry out an evidence review of international approaches to the regulation and financing of home care services.  This will be published shortly.  The Department will also undertake a mapping exercise of current service provision nationally, taking into account the scale and diversity of services funded by the HSE.  This work will be used to identify major policy options for a new statutory homecare scheme &ndash; around the areas of regulation, financing, assessment and eligibility.</p>  <p>  Once this is complete a public consultation will be launched to allow stakeholders, including older people themselves, their families and healthcare workers to express their views regarding a new homecare scheme.  It is my hope and intention at this stage that this consultation on this important issue can be launched in May of this year.</p>  <p>  The development of a new home care scheme is a priority for me, as Minister.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-02-09a.543.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017020900075#WRO03200"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 204 and 205 together.</p><p>At the outset I would like to emphasise again that the project to develop the new children&rsquo;s hospital is an extraordinary opportunity to enhance paediatric services for children.  The granting of planning permission in April 2016 for the hospital, satellite centres and related buildings was a huge and very welcome milestone for the project.  An internationally recognised design team, supported by an experienced National Paediatric Hospital Development Board and Project Team, are in place to drive the new children&rsquo;s hospital project and to ensure that the project is delivered in accordance with national policy to optimal design and value for money. </p><p>In relation to funding, the figure of &euro;650 million for the hospital relates to Exchequer funding that was approved in 2014 for the core construction of the new children's hospital together with the two Satellite Centres.  This funding was approved following a cost estimate that commenced in 2013 and which was completed in early 2014. At this time, construction inflation was estimated at 3%. </p><p>The tender process for the core construction elements for the new children&rsquo;s hospital and the Satellite Centres at Connolly Hospital and Tallaght Hospital has recently been completed.  The pricing proposed by the tenderers took account of construction inflation, which is now running at higher than 9%, the extended project timeline which is now scheduled to be completed in 2021, and the final market cost of the build. </p><p>Local and international companies participated in the tender process.  More than 35 people participated in review panels for the tenders.  The tenders were reviewed and measured against a number of technical and financial criteria and were independently peer-reviewed by construction experts with extensive experience of projects of this size and complexity.  I understand that it was a highly competitive process and following the conclusion, a company has been notified that it is the preferred bidder. </p><p>While there has been much media speculation about the cost of building this hospital, I am informed that the final proposed construction cost is actually within 5% of projections and the successful party was the one with the most competitive tender.  The Department is aware from the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board that the tendered construction costs per bed as suggested in recent media commentary are not accurate and do not resemble the actual tender costs.</p><p>The construction tender does not include equipment which will be funded through annual operational expenditure or ICT costs.  These elements of the project were always to be funded and procured separately.  Funding for educational facilities and commercial elements such as retail and car parking were also separately identified from the core construction costs for the new children&rsquo;s hospital. </p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">  The Deputy will be aware that the new children&rsquo;s hospital and satellite centres programme is made up of three inter-related elements, the building, the ICT infrastructure and the operational integration.  It includes the change management needed in order for the three existing hospitals to become one and the actions required to ensure the smooth, safe and efficient transition to the satellite centres and new children&rsquo;s hospital.</font>Work is ongoing to finalise the heads of bill to merge the three existing children&rsquo;s hospitals into one entity to further facilitate this service integration. </p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">  This complex programme of work is set out the Definitive Business Case for the new hospital which includes the capital, ICT and integration costs.  Now that the construction tenders have been completed, the capital</font>costs put forward in the preferred tenders have been incorporated into the Definitive Business Case.  This has been submitted to the HSE recently for final review, after which it will be considered by the Department of Health.  I intend to bring the Definitive Business Case to Government in the coming weeks for decision.  </p><p>The Department of Health continues to work closely with the HSE, the Children's Hospital Group Board and the Development Board to ensure that we deliver a world class hospital needed and wanted by children, young people, their families and the staff in the three children&rsquo;s hospitals.</p></reply>

The strategy was developed in response to a recommendation of the National AIDS Strategy Committee on the need to establish clear leadership within the health sector around the area of sexual health.  The Strategy contains 71 recommendations that address all aspects of sexual health and a Sexual Health Action Plan for 2015-2016 that contains 18 priority actions for immediate attention.</p>  <p>  One of the priority actions identified in the Action Plan for 2016 is to 'Prioritise, develop and implement guidance to support clinical decision making for STI testing, screening and treatment and on the appropriate use of antiretroviral therapy in HIV prevention&rsquo;.  An Implementation Group has now been established within the HSE as an outcome of this action.

These data are published monthly on the NTPF website.  Since April 2015, the NTPF has published waiting list data for both the Outpatient and the Inpatient / Day Case waiting list by hospital and by specialty.  </p>  <p>  The HIQA Report and Recommendations on Patient Referrals from General Practice to Outpatient and Radiology Services, including the National Standard for Patient Referral Information  published in 2011 makes a number of recommendation in relation to Secondary Care Referral Management Systems, including that GP should address referrals in the first instance to a central point within a hospital, then to the relevant specialty/service, followed by named consultant if relevant.  The report indicates that international evidence suggests that, where possible, patient referrals should be processed at specialty level, with re-allocation of referrals to the consultant within a specialty with the most appropriate experience and training to manage the patient.  </p>  <p>In addition, the HSE National Framework for operation and management of Outpatient Departments   published in 2013 recommends that referral to a named consultant should be treated as general to the specialty involved, unless it is more appropriate for a particular patient to be managed by a specific consultant.  </p>  <p>  With regard to the Outpatient waiting lists, the HSE operates a portal for hospital consultants to be able to view and manage their lists.  This information is not placed in the public domain.  Publication of waiting lists by consultant raises potential patient confidentiality issues and is not in line with the aim of hospitals and Hospital Groups to move to maintaining single waiting lists for different procedures and in different specialties to improve scheduling and equity.</p></reply>

Biosimilar medicines are similar but not identical to their reference biological medicines, and therefore are not considered in the same way as generic medicines.  Under the Heath (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013, biosimilars are not considered to be interchangeable, and therefore cannot be substituted for biological medicines.</p>  <p>  It is likely that the use of biosimilar medicines will grow in Ireland in the coming years as the patents on biological medicines expire, offering opportunities for the State to make further savings on the cost of medicines.  The Framework Agreement on the Supply and Pricing of Medicines 2016-2020 with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association includes a provision to take advantage of these new developments in the pharmaceutical industry.  Under the new Agreement the price of a biologic medicine will be reduced by 20% and an additional rebate of 12.5% provided upon entry into the market of a biosimilar.  </p>  <p>  This component of the Agreement was considered in detail by the State negotiating team.  The State team&rsquo;s view, which was confirmed by our international consultants, was that this provision strikes the appropriate balance between reducing the originator price and enticing new entrants into the market.</p>  <p>  Officials in my Department are currently assessing the whole area of biosimilar medicines and are developing a national biosimilar policy.  This will require consideration of a range of regulatory, patient safety and health policy issues as well as an examination of different policy levers and tools that might be implemented in Ireland in order to increase the uptake of biosimilars in the health system in the coming years.</p>  <p>  My officials will be working with the Health Products Regulatory Authority and the HSE to progress this agenda and will also examine the need for any legislative changes in this area.</p></reply>

Local authorities have specific powers under the Act to require measures to be taken, or to take measures directly, to prevent or limit environmental pollution caused or likely to be caused by the holding, recovery or disposal of waste, and to mitigate or remedy the effects on the environment of such activity.</p>  <p>  My role, as Minister, is to provide the legislative and policy framework under which both local authority and Environmental Protection Agency enforcement action against illegal dumping is initiated.  Enforcement action against illegal waste activity is a matter for the local authorities and the Office of Environmental Enforcement of the EPA as appropriate.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this arrangement, my Department encourages a multi-facetted approach to tackling the problem, incorporating enforcement, public awareness and education and, as such, provides funding to support the activities of the Waste Enforcement Regional Lead Authorities and the network of local authority waste enforcement officers.  In this regard, from 2012 to 2016 some &euro;37 million has been allocated by my Department to support local authority waste enforcement with a further &euro;9.35 million being allocated this year to ensure that effective waste enforcement capacity is maintained. </p>  <p>  In addition and in recognition of the particular difficulties border counties have experienced in dealing with diesel laundering waste dumping, my Department has also fully reimbursed the substantial clean-up costs associated with this nefarious practice with payments of &euro;5.37 million being made to local authorities from 2012 to 2016. </p>  <p>  I intend to support a new anti-dumping initiative in the near future. Its aim is to provide specific funding for projects tackling illegal dumping in particular black spots.  Further information will be available from the Environment Section of each local authority at that point.</p></reply>

However, following difficulties which became apparent following the introduction of the NDLS in 2013, an amendment was made in summer of 2014, allowing that people normally resident in Ireland but abroad for a period for study or work reasons could apply for a licence by post.  Replacement licences may therefore be sought in this way.</p>  <p>  However, in accordance with EU rules, a person who is normally resident in another jurisdiction may not renew their licence once it expires.  If they are resident in another EU Member State, or in a state with which Ireland has a mutual licence exchange agreement, they should exchange their licence for the equivalent from their new state of residence.</p></reply>

The welcome increase in the number in employment has impacted on transport, not only through the beginning of a recovery in public transport numbers, but also through increased car use and re-emergence of peak period congestion.  As Dublin City Centre is the target destination of many of the journeys being undertaken in the region, there is a substantial degree of congestion evident at many locations on the road network approaching the city.</p>  <p>  Insofar as congestion issues in Dublin are concerned, the National Transport Authority (NTA) has overall responsibility for the implementation of their published Transport Strategy for the Greater Dublin Area.  My Department is in close contact with the NTA about addressing travel demand growth in the Dublin Region with a view to intensifying efforts to combat congestion in the short to medium term through greater use of bus priority, demand management and other alleviating measures. </p>  <p>  I expect this work will help me strengthen the case for increased public transport investment, as part of the Mid-Term Review of the Government's Capital Plan in 2017.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-02-09a.675.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1247" speakername="Mary Mitchell O'Connor" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017020900079#WRS01300"><p>The Living Wage concept is grounded in the idea that a person&rsquo;s wage should be sufficient to maintain a safe, decent standard of living.  At an individual level the resources required to achieve a minimum essential standard of living is very dependent on family circumstances and thus the interaction of individual earnings with household income and State-provided supports such as Child Benefit, Family Income Supplement as well as supports available in relation to housing, education and health all contribute to an individual&rsquo;s standard of living.</p>  <p>  It is important that Ireland&rsquo;s statutory National Minimum Wage and the Living Wage concept are not conflated. </p>  <p>  In Ireland, the Low Pay Commission is the statutory body established under the National Minimum Wage (Low Pay Commission) Act 2015, to examine the national minimum hourly rate of pay and to make an annual recommendation to the Minister.  The Commission is tasked with ensuring that all recommendations are evidence based, fair and sustainable, and do not create significant adverse consequences for employment or competitiveness.</p>  <p>  The Commission submitted its first report in July 2015.  Its recommendation to increase the minimum wage from &euro;8.65 to &euro;9.15 per hour was accepted by Government and the increase came into effect on 1st January 2016.  The Commission&rsquo;s second report was submitted to Government in July 2016 and the recommendation made by the Commission for an increase to &euro;9.25 per hour was approved by Government in the context of Budget 2017.  The increase came into effect on 1st January last.  The next review of the minimum wage is underway and the closing date for submissions to the Commission falls this week.</p>  <p>  The Living Wage must be seen as a voluntary societal initiative centred on the social, business and economic case to ensure that, wherever it can be afforded, employers will pay a rate of pay that provides an income that is sufficient to meet an individual&rsquo;s basic needs, such as housing, food, clothing, transport and healthcare.  The Living Wage has no legislative basis and is therefore not a statutory entitlement.  This is different to the National Minimum Wage which is a statutory entitlement and has a legislative basis. </p>  <p>  Deputy you will be aware of the existence of a number of other wage setting mechanisms that were legislated for in recent years to assist workers in sectors that were traditionally characterised as low paid.  Orders made under these provisions can set minimum rates that are higher than the national minimum wage.</p>  <p>  The Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2012 provides for a revised framework for the making of Employment Regulation Orders.</p>  <p>  A Joint Labour Committee (JLC) discuss and agree proposals for terms and conditions to apply to specified grades or categories of workers in the sector concerned.  When it reaches agreement on such proposals for terms and conditions, the JLC publishes details and invites submissions from interested parties.  If, after consideration of any submissions received, the Committee adopts the proposals it will submit them to the Labour Court for consideration. </p>  <p>  The Labour Court will then make a decision on the adoption of the proposals.  If the Court decides they should be adopted it will forward a copy of the proposals to the Minister.  If it is considered appropriate to do so, an Employment Regulation Order giving effect to such proposals will be made by the Minister.  </p>  <p>  There are JLCs for the following sectors - Agriculture; Security; Retail Grocery and Allied Trades; Hairdressing; Contract Cleaning and Catering. </p>  <p>Two Employment Regulation Orders relating to the Security and Contract Cleaning Sectors came into effect on October 1st 2015.  (An amended ERO for the Contract Cleaning Sector was made in October 2016).</p>  <p>  The Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2015 provides for a mechanism whereby, at the request, separately or jointly from organisations substantially representative of employers and/or of worker, the Labour Court can initiate a review of pay and pension and sick pay entitlements of a class, type or group of workers in particular sector.   </p>  <p>  If deemed appropriate the Labour Court can make a recommendation to the Minister on the matter.  If satisfied that the process provided for in the 2015 Act has been complied with by the Labour Court, the Minister will make a Sectoral Employment Order.  Where such an Order is made it will be binding across the sector to which it relates, and will be enforceable via the Workplace Relations Commission.  </p>  <p>  The 2015 Act also provides for the reintroduction of a mechanism for the registration of employment agreements between an employer or employers and trade unions governing terms and conditions in individual enterprises.  Such agreements, known as Registered Employment Agreements (REAs), are legally binding on the subscribing parties. </p></reply>

The HSA does not have a statutory responsibility for ensuring the health and safety of users of fairground equipment nor has it any role in the regulation of public safety where the operation of funfair equipment used by members of the public is concerned.   </p>  <p>  The Authority carries out over 8,000 inspections each year in a variety of work sectors and work activities which come under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005.  Most inspections are targeted at high risk sectors such as construction, agriculture, forestry, manufacturing, mines, quarries, transport of dangerous goods by road, or the chemical sectors.   </p>  <p>  Employers in some sectors may be inspected only following a complaint or the notification of an adverse event to the Authority.  Accordingly, inspections in respect of the occupational safety of those working at amusement parks, theme parks and funfair sites have occurred only on a reactive basis.  In 2011 a particular funfair site was the subject of a workplace inspection, and two further inspection visits took place in 2012.  Inspections were carried out in two other funfair sites in 2014.  All of these inspections focused on the duties of employers to their employees.  The Authority did not conduct any inspections of fairground and funfair equipment or roller coasters over the period indicated.    </p>  <p>  The Authority has no responsibility for wider public safety issues, including matters that come under the aegis of my colleague the Minister for Housing Planning and Local Government, Simon Coveney TD, who is responsible for legislation relating to the regulation of fairground equipment and funfairs in section 239 of the Planning and Development Act 2000.   </p>  <p>  Accidents and dangerous occurrences are required to be reported to the Authority in line with the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Reporting of Accidents and Dangerous Occurrences) Regulations 2016 (S.I. No. 370 of 2016).  In the case of an accident involving an employee at work, the employer is responsible for reporting the accident.  In any other case (if the injured person is self-employed or a member of the public), the person responsible for reporting the accident is the person having control of the place of work at which the accident occurred.    </p>  <p>  Within the range of work activity associated with amusement parks and theme parks, only four accidents were officially notified to the Authority between 2011 and 2016.  An assessment of the information submitted as part of these notifications indicates that the accidents concerned were not connected with the use of funfair or fairground equipment.</p></reply>

The 2005 Act places a range of duties on undertakings and individuals to ensure as far as reasonably practicable, the safety, health and welfare at work of employees.  The statutory remit of the HSA in relation to fairgrounds is exclusively concerned with the protection of persons at work and the protection of others where a work activity is taking place or is imminent.  This is determined by whether or not persons were engaged in or affected by a work activity at the time and place when an incident occurred. </p>  <p>  The Authority does not have statutory responsibility for ensuring the health and safety of users of fairground equipment nor has it any role in the regulation of public safety where the operation of funfair equipment used by members of the public is concerned. </p>  <p>  In relation to the specific incident referred to by the Deputy, I have been informed by the HSA that relatives of the individual involved in the incident did make contact with the HSA some weeks after the incident occurred.  It was explained to them that the Authority had no legal basis to conduct an investigation in the matter as the particular incident did not occur as a result of work activity.</p>  <p>  I understand that my colleague, the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Mr Simon Coveney TD, has initiated a review of the role of his Department in relation to its responsibility for the regulatory regime covering the operation of fairground equipment and funfairs at section 239 of the Planning and Development Act, 2000 particularly in respect of the specific legislative provisions relating to fairground equipment.  I look forward to the outcome of the review. </p></reply>

The Regional Action Plan initiative aims to support employment growth by working with local stakeholders to identify and develop each region&rsquo;s own sectoral strengths and areas of economic opportunity. </p><p>A key objective of the plans is to have a further 10 to 15 per cent at work in each region by 2020.  The targets for additional jobs to be created in each region is set out in the table: <table><tr><th><div>Region</div></th><th><div>Published Regional APJ targets by   2020</div></th></tr><tr><td>North East/North West</td><td>28,000</td></tr><tr><td>Midland</td><td>14,000</td></tr><tr><td>West</td><td>25,000</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>66,000</td></tr><tr><td>Mid-East</td><td>25,000</td></tr><tr><td>Mid-West</td><td>23,000</td></tr><tr><td>South-East</td><td>25,000</td></tr><tr><td>South-West</td><td>40,000</td></tr><tr><td>State Total</td><td>246,000</td></tr></table></p><p>The first Progress Reports prepared by the 8 Regional Action Plan Implementation Committees have been published.  While at an early stage, the reports show that good progress is being made in the implementation of the Regional APJs. All regions are on target to meet or exceed the job targets to be delivered by 2020. </p><p>In 2016, almost two thirds of new jobs created by Enterprise Ireland supported companies, and over half of those created by IDA supported companies, were outside Dublin.  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s strategy for 2017-2020 aims to create a further 60,000 jobs, while sustaining existing ones; IDA will continue to target a minimum increase in investment of 30% to 40% in each region outside Dublin to 2019.</p><p>To support the regional jobs agenda, I have ensured that additional funds will be made available through the enterprise development agencies out to 2020.  In June 2016, I announced an initial allocation of &euro;5m in competitive funding for 48 local and regional initiatives under two of these calls.  All regions benefitted under this initiative.</p><p>My Department and Enterprise Ireland are finalising plans for a further regional funding initiative of up to &euro;60m to support collaborative approaches to grow and sustain jobs across the regions.  Additional funding of &euro;150m is being made available to the IDA to support its Regional Property Programme and drive job creation in the multi-national sector.</p></reply>

Over the past number of months, I have tasked my Department officials with making Brexit their number one priority.</p><p>In advance of the Referendum my Department conducted a contingency risk assessment of the potential impacts of Brexit across policy areas of my Department.  We are continuing to refine our analysis post-Referendum and we have been working with Agencies to put in place actions to mitigate risks and maximize opportunities.</p><p>Enterprise Ireland are working intensively with their client base with a particular focus on:</p><p>- Consolidating and growing exports into the UK market;</p><p>- Expanding the Irish export global footprint, re-orienting towards N America, Canada, Asia and the Middle-East;</p><p>- Expanding the EI Export Platform.</p><p>IDA Ireland is continuing to work with its existing client base to assist and support them in their growth and expansion in Ireland.  The IDA is also exploring the potential for winning more FDI on account of Brexit and the Agency and its staff are already working hard with this goal in mind. </p><p>At the many events I attend on a daily basis I am engaging with stakeholders listening to their views about challenges and opportunities particularly in the context of Brexit.  I have met with a wide range of representative organisations, to hear their views. </p><p>In addition, my Department held a large stakeholder engagement event in Carrick-on-Shannon on 30 January where we heard the views of over 200 stakeholders.  These engagements, along with a number of studies being undertaken through my department to determine the impact of Brexit on Ireland&rsquo;s trading patterns provide essential intelligence for me, as I develop a response to Brexit that has the best interests of our citizens and companies at heart. </p></reply>

Over that period, the world economy has changed shape many times, yet Ireland has remained an attractive destination for FDI.  As the global investment climate continues to evolve, we will adapt accordingly &ndash; as we have done so in the past &ndash; and make sure that Ireland continues to secure new FDI projects and the jobs that go with them. </p>  <p>  Our capacity to continue winning such new investment, despite geopolitical changes, will be aided by the underlying strengths of our FDI offering.  These include our talented workforce, pro-enterprise business environment, first-rate education system and our proven track record as a home to global businesses.  Our continued membership of the European Union and Eurozone has also become particularly important.  </p></reply>

These negotiations could take the maximum allowed period of two years to complete.  Ultimately any deal on Article 50 will require the agreement of the EU Commission, Council and Parliament.  </p><p>There is a whole of Government approach in place focusing on Brexit issues and my Department and its agencies are to the forefront of this effort.  </p><p>It is hard to predict at this stage the full impact of Brexit.  Much will depend on the nature of the future trade deal that will be negotiated between the EU and the UK.  These negotiations are likely to be complex and multifaceted.  </p><p>Promoting diversified export markets in light of the potential impacts of Brexit is a key priority for my Department.  This includes markets that are growing and have scale as well as markets where we are already well established but with potential for further growth.  The programme of trade missions and trade events for 2017 includes a substantive focus on the EU and third country markets.  In 2017 we have 42 Minister led trade missions to existing and emerging markets.  These have been reorientated to reflect an increased focus on EU markets.</p><p>The EU&rsquo;s suite of Free Trade Agreements with 3<sup>rd</sup>Countries help to open new markets, break down barriers and provide new opportunities for Irish firms.  These existing EU Agreements and new trade deals will continue to be important for Ireland.  With a small domestic market, further expansion in other markets is essential to our continued economic growth.  </p><p>Ireland will continue to support the EU&rsquo;s ambitious programme of negotiating new Free Trade Agreements giving Irish Firms expanded market access and a predictable trading environment in third countries.  </p><p>Enterprise Ireland is consistently working with client companies focussing on enhancing their competitiveness, capability and levels of innovation to assist them to diversify into new markets.</p></reply>

The employment permits system is intended to offer an interim solution where specific skills prove difficult to source within the EEA; it offers a conduit into the Irish labour market for non-EEA nationals with in-demand skills and is operated as a vacancy led system. </p>  <p>  Changes to access to the Irish labour market for specific occupations via the employment permits system are made on the basis of research undertaken by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN) in tandem with a consultation process, as part of a package of measures to meet those skills needs.</p>  <p>  The education system plays a critical role in delivering many of those measures, and any changes to the lists managing the eligibility of specific occupations for employment permits are made with due regard not only to their potential impacts on the resident labour market but also to upskilling and training that is in place. </p>  <p>  The bi-annual review of the Highly Skilled Eligible Occupations List and the Ineligible Categories of Employment List ensures that access to the global labour market for Irish employers experiencing skill shortages is focused on the State&rsquo;s current skills needs. </p>  <p>  The demand for employment permits has risen by circa 300% since 2013.  Over this period a number of initiatives have been introduced to address the increase in demand including conducting a business process review, the introduction of a Trusted Partner Initiative, the provision of an online Status Query facility and the launch of an online application system.  Further actions will be taken in 2017 to respond to the increased demand which reflects positive labour market tightening in the economy.</p></reply>

As of Q3 2016, there were an additional 190,000 at work in the economy since the launch of the first Action Plan for Jobs, which achieved and exceeded the Government&rsquo;s target of 100,000 extra at work by 2016.  The services sector made the largest contribution to the achievement of the Government&rsquo;s job creation targets.  Following a number of years of decline in employment from 2007, I am pleased to report that the manufacturing sector has also recorded increases in job numbers since 2011.  Exports of Enterprise Ireland supported firms are estimated to have reached a new record of &euro;23bn in 2016.  </p>  <p>  To achieve our ambition of sustainable full employment, jobs growth in export oriented manufacturing and services businesses will be essential over the coming years. Manufacturing is key focus in the Government's long term  enterprise policy, Enterprise 2025 and also of the Regional Action Plans for Jobs.  There are a range of measures designed to support industry growth including encouraging entrepreneurship, further improving our skills base, improving access to finance by SMEs and supporting indigenous companies and foreign-owned manufacturing companies to transform their businesses and to improve their productivity and competitiveness.  These initiatives are important to growing and sustaining the competitiveness of existing enterprises, to sustaining employment and to attracting new investment and I am confident that both manufacturing and services sectors can continue to improve their competitiveness in international markets. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-02-09a.732.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1247" speakername="Mary Mitchell O'Connor" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017020900081#WRU00400"><p>The ongoing changes in the geopolitical landscape heighten the importance of maintaining Ireland&rsquo;s world class business environment.  Ireland will continue to provide a competitive offering, including tax offering, to attract foreign direct investment and to ensure that our innovative entrepreneurs establish and scale in Ireland which provides jobs for our citizens and contributes to funding the provision of services.</p>  <p>  Ireland is the first country world-wide to introduce an OECD compliant Knowledge Development Box (KDB) offering.  The certainty, predictability and clear signal that this sends to enterprise &ndash; including both Irish owned and foreign owned entities establishing and doing business from here - remains essential. </p>  <p>  The KDB, introduced in Budget 2016 forms part of Ireland&rsquo;s competitive offering to continue to attract foreign direct investment (FDI) and to support Irish owned companies to innovate and to compete effectively on international markets.  The Government and I are satisfied that the Knowledge Development Box is benefitting and will continue to benefit the Irish economy.</p>  <p>  The continuing imperative to establish Ireland as the best place in which to succeed in business is reinforced in our national Enterprise and Innovation strategies.  Our aim is that Ireland will be recognised as the place where businesses are innovative, competitive and productive &ndash; leading to growth that is sustainable and results in employment opportunities and a higher standard of living for all.  These strategies set out the framework for investment over the coming decade to ensure that Ireland remains equally attractive to foreign direct investment and to Irish entrepreneurs and growth businesses in the context of an intensely competitive international environment. </p>  <p>  The KDB complements the existing suite of initiatives and supports available to companies that undertake R&amp;D activities in Ireland across the lifecycle of research and development &ndash; including R&amp;D tax credits, RD&amp;I grant supports, support for technology acquisition (S291A), significant state investments in National Research Centres and knowledge transfer infrastructures, and advisory supports for accessing Horizon 2020 funding &ndash; providing a competitive proposition for business investment. </p>  <p>  The OECD nexus approach sets out the principles and guidelines under which income arising from IP assets can qualify for a lower rate of tax under a KDB initiative. Ireland&rsquo;s KDB effective rate is 6.25 percent (half of the corporation tax rate of 12.5 percent) and is internationally competitive. </p>  <p>  The Knowledge Development Box (Certification of Inventions) Bill 2016 to allow small and medium sized companies to avail of the Knowledge Development Box is going to Second Stage in the D&aacute;il on 14th and 15th February 2017.  Under the new scheme, the Patents Office will be the body certifying applications for inventions under the new certification scheme to check that they meet the criteria of being novel, useful and non-obvious.</p>  <p>  The Bill is intended to open up the opportunity for companies across a broad spectrum to pay lower taxes on profits from Irish-based research and development activities.  This includes companies in incubation units right through to high-potential start-ups in all industry sectors once they are generating income resulting from research and development activities.  The scheme should serve to significantly boost Irish innovation and investment in research and development. </p></reply>

The Scheme will be open to all Tusla-registered childcare providers, including childminders.  In the Heads of Bill and General Scheme for the Affordable Childcare Scheme Bill, it is also proposed that the legislation should allow for the possibility of additional categories of childcare provider to access the scheme, including childminders who are currently exempt from the Early Years Regulations and standalone afterschool services, provided that such providers meet quality criteria that are to be specified in accordance with the legislation.  While it is proposed that the legislation should allow for this possibility, no decisions have yet been made on whether, when or by what criteria specified groups of non-registered providers might access the Scheme.  The issue will be further considered during the process of drafting legislation and in consultation with stakeholders.</p>  <p>  In order to meet the needs of parents whose preference is to use a childminder, and to build capacity to cater for increased demand in future years, the Department has commenced talks with Childminding Ireland (CMI) in recent months to explore a number of options around how quality can be assured within the childminding sector.  A Working Group has been established, chaired by CMI, and including officials from Tusla and the DCYA, to make recommendations on reforms and supports for the sector in the short, medium and long term, and the feasibility and implications of the migration from voluntary to mandatory regulation.  These will include recommendations in relation to childminders who are not currently eligible to apply for registration with Tusla (those minding three or fewer pre-school children, or those minding school age children only).</p>  <p>  My colleague Minister Bruton and I will shortly publish an Action Plan on School Age Childcare which will include actions relating to the development of quality standards for the school age childcare sector, as well as the establishment of a Working Group to recommend a robust quality assurance system for centre-based school age childcare settings.</p></reply>

The programme was then expanded by reducing the age of eligibility to 3 years and by increasing the number of entry points to three throughout the programme year (September, January and April).  This means that children can begin to avail of their free place on the pre-school programme as soon as possible after they reach the age of 3.  As with any scheme, there must be entry and cut off points.  These rules for ECCE reflect evidence based policy and are necessary from an administrative and budgetary management perspective. Regrettably, it is the nature of such rules that they benefit some more than others. </p><p>Providing free pre-school for children from the age of 3 was a key recommendation of the <i>Expert Advisory Group on the Early Years Strategy. </i>Expansion of ECCE was also given significant consideration by the Inter-Departmental Group on Future Investment in Childcare which reported in July 2015.  Senior officials from the Department of Education and Skills contributed to the discussions on an upper age limit for the scheme, taking a child centred approach.<i></i></p><p>I would note that this summer we will come to the end of the first delivery cycle of the newly expanded ECCE programme.  My Department will ensure that the scheme is kept under ongoing review and that learning from this cycle informs its ongoing development. </p><p>I would also note to the Deputy that plans are currently in train to provide for a new national scheme of financial support for parents towards the cost of their childcare entitled the Affordable Childcare Scheme, which will replace the existing targeted childcare subsidisation schemes with a single, streamlined and more user-friendly scheme.  The new scheme will provide a system from which both universal and targeted subsidies can be provided towards the cost of childcare.  In the case of targeted subsidies, these will be payable for children from 6 months of age up to 15 years of age.  The level of subsidy will depend on the investment available and on a family&rsquo;s income.  The new Affordable Childcare Scheme will &ldquo;wraparound‟ ECCE for pre-school and school-age children.</p></reply>

The scheme is designed with the specific aim of equipping participants with life and other marketable and certifiable skills which will assist them both in their capacity to participate fully in society as well as their ability to enter the workforce and or to pursue further education for this purpose.  Participation in the scheme is voluntary.</p><p>The scheme and the programme content have been developed through detailed discussions involving the Department of Defence, the Defence Forces, the Department of Social Protection and the Dublin and Dun-Laoghaire Education and Training Board.  The Department of Social Protection identifies suitable participants. Participants retain any Department of Social Protection benefits that they are currently entitled to for the duration of the Scheme.  Participants do not receive any payment from the Department of Defence.</p><p>The scheme is a training programme of ten (10) weeks duration, consisting of five (5) weeks of training delivered by the Defence Forces interspersed with five (5) weeks of educational orientated training by the Education and Training Board. </p><p>A successful pilot programme was held in Gormanston Camp from Monday 20<sup>th</sup>June 2016 to 26<sup>th</sup>August 2016 with 25 participants.  Following an evaluation of the pilot programme and Ministerial approval, the current plan is to run up to 2 iterations of programme in 2017.</p><p>A programme will commence in Limerick on 22<sup>nd</sup>May 2017.  The Department of Social Protection invited 1,006 persons selected from the Live Register in counties Clare and Limerick aged between 18 and 24 years to attend information sessions about the scheme.</p><p>A total of 260 persons attended the information sessions which were held on 16<sup>th</sup>and 17<sup>th</sup>January 2017 which were conducted jointly by personnel from the Defence Forces and Department of Social Protection.  It was clearly pointed out at each information session that it was a voluntary training programme and not recruitment for the army. </p><p>There are 30 places on the programme and the selection process is ongoing.</p></reply>

Because of this accessibility illegal dumping is an ongoing problem.  The response to illegal dumping is managed by the Department land staff in cooperation with the County Kildare Litter Warden.  The Department also has in place an environmental maintenance contract for the Curragh Plains which provides a removal/cleanup service where dumping has occurred.  At the last meeting of the Curragh Forum several actions were agreed by the members of the Forum to assist in addressing a number of the problems in the Curragh , including illegal dumping.  In line with agreed actions, a review of the Curragh Bye-Laws and the Curragh of Kildare Act is progressing with a view to identifying what changes can be made to current legislation in order to better deal with dumping and the other issues identified by the Forum.</p></reply>

This was exacerbated most recently by the unanticipated retirement of ATC personnel.  These unanticipated retirements have impacted the level of ATC service than can be delivered, including the scheduling of flights into and out of Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel.  As the Deputy will appreciate, for security reasons, it would not be appropriate to disclose precise details of the implications for the management of Air Operations.</p></reply>

This will include additional Cadets for pilot training, general enlistment to fill Airmen and Airwomen vacancies and a further apprentice class.

Defence Force Regulations clearly distinguish between the Permanent Defence Force and the Reserve Defence Force.  The Defence Force Regulations define both entities and therefore, it is considered to be prudent to identify both in regard to dress.  Peak Caps are not part of the issue to RDF members and I am informed there are currently no plans to amend this provision.  However, I am informed that a temporary derogation in this regard was granted by the Deputy Chief of Staff (Support) to a limited number of RDF members, who were selected to march in the Centenary Easter Sunday Parade in Dublin in 2016, for ceremonial reasons.  This derogation ended after the parade. </p></reply>
