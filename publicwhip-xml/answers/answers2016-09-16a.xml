    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-09-16a.8.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016091600003#WRA00500"><p>The Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the exercise of his duties under the Valuation Acts, 2001 - 2015 and the making of valuations for rating is his sole responsibility.  The statute does not accord me as Minister any function in this regard.</p>  <p>  The basic premise under the Valuation Acts is that all interests including buildings and lands used or developed for any purpose (irrespective of whether such lands are surfaced) and any constructions affixed thereto are rateable unless expressly exempted under Schedule 4 of the Acts.  Schedule 3, paragraph 1(m) of the Acts specify that electricity generating stations, including where appropriate, all buildings and structures thereon which include solar panels, are rateable.</p>  <p>  Solar panels, whether affixed to the roof or other external surface of a commercial or industrial building or existing quite independently as "solar farm" type installations are rateable structures. In the case of panels affixed to buildings, they form part of the building valuation itself and in the case of solar farms, they form part of the valuation of electricity generating stations as defined under Schedule 3, paragraph 1(m) of the Valuation Acts 2001 to 2015.</p>  <p>  The basis of rateable valuation for all property including solar farms is "net annual value" and is set out in Part 11 of the Valuation Act 2001.  Net annual value is the rental value for which one year with another, the building might, in its actual state, be reasonably expected to let from year to year, on the assumption that the probable average annual cost of repairs, insurance and other expenses (if any) that would be necessary to maintain the property in that state, and all rates and other taxes in respect of the property, are borne by the tenant of the property.</p>  <p>  In accordance with the legislation, well-established valuation principles and case law arising from the independent Valuation Tribunal and the higher Courts, various methodologies may be used in estimating the net annual value (NAV/rental value) of a rateable property.  The most common methodology used is the "comparative" method which, as the name implies, employs direct comparison with other similar properties in the same rating area.  In the absence of direct comparative evidence of value, two other methods may be used.  The first of these is what is known as the "receipts and expenditure" method of valuation where trading accounts are analysed to arrive at the rent which a hypothetical tenant might be reasonably expected to expend for the property. Another method of valuation used from time to time, depending on the particular circumstances and type of property involved, is the "contractor's" method where the notional cost of construction, allowing for depreciation as appropriate, and the value of the site are used to arrive at the net annual value.  This is provided for in Section 50 of the Valuation Act 2001, as amended by the Valuation (Amendment) Act 2015.</p></reply>

These are companies registered under the Companies Act, the members of which are the owners of residential units within the development, which are established for the purposes of ownership and management of such common areas.</p>  <p>  As regards the provision of information to members, section 17 of the Act imposes specific obligations on OMCs.  It provides that they must prepare an annual report which includes details of  income and expenditure, as well as assets and liabilities; annual service charges and sinking fund accounts; planned expenditure on maintenance and repair; insurance cover and contracts entered into by the OMC.  It also provides that OMCs must hold a meeting at least once a year to consider the report.  Advance notice of the meeting must be given to each member at least 21 days before the meeting; a copy of the annual report must be provided at least 10 days beforehand; moreover, the meeting must take place within reasonable proximity to the multi-unit development unless otherwise agreed in writing by 75% of the members.</p>  <p>  Section 18 of the Act requires OMCs to establish and maintain a scheme of annual service charges from which they may discharge expenditure incurred on the provision of common or shared services to the owners and occupiers of residential units in the development, including insurance, waste management and security services.  These service charges must be calculated on a transparent basis, and be equitably apportioned between the residential unit owners.  In order to ensure transparency and accountability, both the annual service charge and the services to be provided must be approved by a general meeting of the members of the OMC.</p>  <p>  Section 24 of the Act contains provisions for the resolution of disputes relating to multi-unit developments.  It provides that a person, including any member of an OMC, may apply to the Circuit Court for an order to enforce any rights conferred or obligations imposed by the Act.  The Court, if satisfied that a right has been infringed or an obligation has not been discharged, may make such remedial order as it deems appropriate in the circumstances with a view to ensuring the effective enforcement of the right or the effective discharge of the obligation in respect of the multi-unit development concerned.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-09-16a.20.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016091600003#WRA01400"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 6 together.</p>  <p>  The Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the exercise of his duties under the Valuation Acts 2001 - 2015, and the making of valuations for rating purposes is his sole responsibility.  I, as Minister for Justice and Equality, have no function in that regard.</p>  <p>  The Valuation Acts provide that all buildings used or developed for any purpose are rateable unless expressly exempted under Schedule 4 to the Acts. Such exempt buildings would principally include those used for public worship, education and health care provided on a not-for-profit basis, and charitable purposes.  The Acts maintain the long-standing position that commercial facilities - including all private childcare facilities such as play schools, pre-schools, creches and Montessori schools - are liable for rates.</p>  <p>  However, certain pre-school facilities are exempt from rates under paragraph 16 of Schedule 4 which provides that a property occupied by a charitable organisation and used exclusively for charitable purposes and otherwise than for private profit is exempt from rates.  Similarly, certain pre-school facilities can be exempt from rates where the conditions set out in paragraph 10 of Schedule 4 are met, i.e. it must be occupied by an educational institution and it must be used exclusively for the provision of educational services, otherwise than for private profit.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that reclassifying pre-school facilities as educational under Schedule 4 to the Valuation Acts would not in itself result in such facilities being no longer liable for rates.  However, the Valuation (Amendment) Act 2015, which was commenced on 8 June 2015, contains an amendment to Schedule 4 which provided for a new exemption from rates in respect of community-based childcare facilities which are operated on a not-for-profit basis.</p>  <p>  Private childcare facilities which are operated for profit form part of the rateable valuation base on a nationwide basis.  The exemption from rateability of such facilities would reduce local authority revenues, which if it were not to entail an increase in Exchequer funding for local authorities, would have to be made good by imposing a corresponding increase on the remaining ratepayers.  Accordingly, and in line with the long-standing position that commercial facilities are liable for rates, there are no plans at this time to provide for any exemptions from valuation in respect of for-profit childcare facilities.</p></reply>

The Istanbul Convention is a significant legal instrument in the fight against domestic and sexual violence.  Ireland is fully supportive of the aims and terms of the Convention and the Deputy will be aware that Ireland signed the Convention on 5 November 2015.  The Programme for a Partnership Government contains a commitment to implementing the Istanbul Convention.  Work has commenced on implementing the 18 legislative and administrative actions, which when implemented, will enable Ireland to ratify the Convention.  All of the actions required for the ratification of the Istanbul Convention are contained in the Second National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence which was published in January of this year.</p>  <p>  The new Domestic Violence Bill, the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Bill and the Criminal Justice (Sexual Offences) Bill are among the legislative actions required.</p>  <p>  It is my intention to publish the  Domestic Violence Bill this year.

The specific output from this review was the identification of a range of venues nationwide which could be considered for closure subject to a detailed assessment and the preparation of a business case in respect of each identified venue.</p>  <p>  In this regard, the identification of venues as part of the review process does not necessarily mean that the identified venues will close.  The assessments undertaken were informed by a consultation process with local public representatives, solicitor firms and a range of other interested parties and the final decision in relation to the closure of any venue is a matter for the Board of the Courts Service.  Following this review Killorglin courthouse was identified as a venue which could be considered for closure subject to a detailed assessment and the preparation of a business case.</p>  <p>  The Courts Service, during the course of 2013, commenced the process of undertaking a detailed assessment of all identified venues in Kerry.  Consultations were completed with local interested parties but the detailed assessment was never formally completed or advanced to conclusion.  The Courts Service are of the view that having regard to the lapse of time since the aforementioned assessment was commenced, it would be appropriate to consult further with all interested parties and therefore it is proposed that such a process will commence within the next two months.</p></reply>

The process leading to deportation is extensive with many avenues of appeal, including judicial review in the High Court, open to persons subject to deportation orders.</p><p>The statutory criteria which must be considered in relation to a decision to make a deportation order under section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 include national security and public policy, the character and conduct of the person concerned and the common good.  Where persons have been identified as a threat to national security by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, it remains open to me to make deportation orders against such persons and I have done so in the past and will continue to do so where appropriate.</p><p>In determining whether to make a deportation order, in addition to the factors set out in Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, I must also consider Section 5 (Prohibition of Refoulement) of the Refugee Act 1996, as amended, as well as any other relevant statutory provisions, Constitutional or international human rights arising.  This essentially means that the safety of returning a person, or refoulement as it is commonly referred to, is fully considered in every case when deciding whether or not to make a deportation order i.e. that a person shall not be expelled from the State or returned in any manner whatsoever to a State where the life or freedom of that person would be threatened on account of his or her race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.</p><p>The statistics requested by the Deputy are set out in the following table.  It should be noted that the overwhelming majority of persons who arrive at the frontiers of the State without permission to enter or reside here are refused leave to land, without ever reaching the stage where they would be considered under the deportation process.  Indeed, this figure has risen substantially to almost 3,500 last year and is expected to exceed 4,000 this year.  Others voluntarily remove themselves before a Deportation Order is made or is required to be enforced.  Given the number of deportations effected, and the detailed individual assessment carried out in each case, it is not possible to provide the Deputy with the reasons for each individual deportation which has been carried out over the past three years.</p><p>The legislation in this area was recently amended by way of section 78 of the International Protection Act, commenced on 10th March this year.  These amendments have given additional powers to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to allow them to more effectively enforce deportation orders where persons subject to deportation orders have failed to comply with their legal obligation to remove themselves from the State. </p><p><b><i>Deportations Effected for the years 2013 - 2015</i></b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Year</th>       <th>No of Deportations</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2013</td>       <td>209</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2014</td>       <td>114</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2015</td>       <td>251</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total</td>       <td>574</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

In addition, prisoners who have engaged in authorised structured activity may apply to receive enhanced remission of greater than one quarter but not exceeding one third of their sentence.  In order for a prisoner to be granted enhanced remission, I must be satisfied that the prisoner is less likely to re-offend and is able to re-integrate into the community<i>.</i></p><p>The principles governing the awarding of enhanced remission are contained under Rule 59 of the Prison Rules 2007 to 2014 (S.I. No. 252 of 2007 and S.I. No. 385 of 2014).</p><p>Additionally prisoners serving between 1 and 8 years imprisonment who are making genuine efforts to desist from reoffending may apply for incentivised early release under the Community Return Programme on a Community Return Scheme.  Prisoners serving sentences of under one year may apply for the Community Support Scheme.  Decisions are made on an individual case basis and are governed by the Criminal Justice Act 1960, as amended by the Criminal Justice (Temporary Release of Prisoners) Act 2003.</p><p>I am advised that the Irish Prison Service publishes figures in relation to the prisoner population and capacity levels on their website www.irishprisons.ie on a daily basis.  On 7 September 2016 a total of 378 were on temporary release, of whom there were 81 participants on Community Return Schemes and 83 participants on Community Support Schemes.</p><p>The Deputy should be aware that the overall bed capacity of the Irish Prison System is 4,202.  On 7 September 2016 there were 3,670 prisoners in custody, representing an occupancy rate of 87%.  I am advised by the Irish Prison Service that it is continuing to reduce the capacity of our prisons to align with the Inspector of Prisons recommended bed capacity of 3,997.  Significant decreases in prison numbers have taken place since 2011.  The Deputy may wish to note that the number in custody reached a peak of 4,621 on 23 February 2011.  On 29 August 2016 there were 951 less prisoners in custody, a decrease of 20%.  I am therefore satisfied that the existing prison capacity is sufficient.</p></reply>

The Commissioner is also responsible for the allocation of all Garda resources, including personnel.  As such, it is not open to me as Minister for Justice and Equality to comment on such matters.  However, to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have requested an up to date report from the Garda authorities in relation to road traffic enforcement and I will forward this report to the Deputy as soon as it is to hand.</p>  <p>  Insofar as road traffic enforcement is concerned generally, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Roads Policing Operations Plan 2016 incorporates a programme of high visibility road safety and enforcement operations, carried out in partnership with other state agencies, and is being implemented by each Regional Traffic Superintendent.  The focus of the Roads Policing Operations Plan for 2016 is on the most vulnerable road user categories of motor cyclists, pedal cyclists, pedestrians and learner permit holders.  Garda operations specifically target road use behaviour known to contribute significantly to collisions, including speeding, driving while intoxicated, and use of a mobile phone.</p>  <p>  Road traffic legislation is also enforced as part of the day to day duties of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Both targeted and general methods of enforcement have a valuable role to play in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's enforcement programme, which targets locations with a view to preventing the commission of offences, detecting errant motorists, changing their behaviour and ultimately reducing death and injuries on our roads.</p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 also sets out key strategic objectives for Roads Policing which will inform and guide An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s Road Policing plans over the next 5 years.  The Deputy is no doubt aware of the significant investment in Garda resources currently underway.  This investment is closely associated with delivery on the Modernisation and Renewal Programme.</p>  <p>  Ireland has, over a number of years, developed a multi-agency approach to road safety through the involvement of a number of agencies working in partnership, under the aegis of a Road Safety Strategy led by my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  Ireland's current Road Safety Strategy covers the period 2013-2020 and seeks to close the gap between Ireland and the safest countries in the European Union and beyond.  Progress in relation to the actions and outcomes set out in this strategy are monitored on an ongoing basis by the Road Safety Authority and the other agencies involved, and overseen at a Ministerial Committee on Road Safety.</p></reply>

The research referred to by the Deputy comprises academic publications completed as part of third level studies and has, I understand, been considered by the PRA.  Given the low participation rate in the associated studies and the admission of use of anecdotal evidence therein, together with the feedback provided to the PRA from its customers, the PRA has concluded that no changes to its mapping practice are necessary. Notwithstanding this, the PRA has a longstanding and valued relationship with solicitors, surveyors, engineers and architects in all matters pertaining to property registration.  No concerns relating to a perceived increase in boundary disputes have been raised via this PRA Customer Focus Forum.  The PRA engages fully with any parties to assist where possible in matters pertaining to the mapped representation of the registration.  Section 85 of the Registration of Title Act 1964 as amended by Section 62 of the Registration of Deeds and Title Act 2006 provides that registered land shall be described and identified by reference to the registry maps concerned in such manner as may be prescribed and except as provided for in the Act, neither the description of land in a register nor its identification by reference to a registry map is conclusive as to its boundaries or extent.  The PRA has in place a robust structure whereby the registered owners of properties or their representatives can engage with the PRA in relation to matters pertaining to the mapped representation of the registration.  Disputes between parties in the absence of consent are matters for the courts and the PRA is not the appropriate body to deal with such disputes.</p>  <p>  There is no requirement by the PRA that requires those engaged in the preparation of application maps to hold a professional qualification.  However, the PRA in its guidelines recommends that application maps submitted for registration be prepared and certified by competent Land Surveyors. A comprehensive and detailed Mapping Practitioners Guide, which is published on the PRA's website, www.prai.ie, clearly states that the responsibility for the accuracy of boundaries submitted for registration rests with the applicant.  The Appendices therein clearly set out the mapping requirements and act as a guide to solicitors and other land professionals in the preparation of application maps for registration.  Application maps which do not comply with the Guidelines are rejected or queried by the PRA to ensure that its standards are adhered to prior to registration.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.</p><p>The number, rank and title of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who were assigned to the Cavan/Monaghan Garda Division on the 31 July 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available, is as set out in the following table.  For operational reasons it is not possible to provide specific details in relation to roles undertaken by individual  Garda members.</p><p>In relation to the other queries raised by the Deputy in relation to the number of new vehicles allocated to the Cavan/Monaghan Division since 2015, and the number and rank of Garda members in that Division who retired from 2011 to 2016 together with their stations, I have requested this information from the Garda Commissioner and will update the Deputy when it is to hand.</p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  Key to achieving this goal is the commitment in the<font color="#2F2F2F"> &quot;Programme for a Partnership Government&quot; to</font>continue the ongoing accelerated Garda recruitment programme with a view to increasing Garda numbers to 15,000.  Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 will require some 3,200 new Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next four years in addition to the 1,200 that will have been recruited by the end of this year since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014.  So far 534 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of whom 15 of these have been assigned to Cavan/Monaghan.  Another 150 are due to  attest later this year.</p><p>In order to continue to ensure seamless ongoing recruitment I was very pleased to announce the commencement of a new recruitment campaign on 8 September.  The campaign is being organised by the Public Appointments Service on behalf of the Garda Commissioner.  Applications must be made through <i>www.publicjobs.ie</i>before the closing date for applications on 29 September 2016.The existing recruitment campaign (launched last November) is ongoing and successful candidates will continue to be called from that campaign this year and into next year.  It is expected that successful candidates from the new campaign will enter the Garda College from mid-2017.</p><p>As I have stated previously, when accelerating recruitment it is essential to ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the capacity to train larger numbers without any diminution in the quality of its excellent Bachelor of Arts in Applied Policing, and to provide appropriate supervision and support to newly qualified Garda&iacute; to ensure that victims and the public generally are well served by their policing service.  My officials are engaging with Garda management as a matter of priority in relation to the preparation of a recruitment plan for the next five years that will ensure the delivery of increased numbers of Garda&iacute; without any compromise on the quality of those recruited or the training programme.</p><p>An accelerated programme of recruitment of trainee Garda&iacute; is essential to ensuring a visible policing presence but it is not the only means.  This is recognised in the Programme for Government which includes commitments to double the Garda Reserve to act in a supportive role undertaking local patrols and crime reduction measures.  Again my officials are engaging with Garda management on  a plan to deliver this commitment.  <b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p><p><b>CAVAN / MONAGHAN Division 31 July 2016</b> <table>    <tr>

The manual is a comprehensive document which outlines strict procedures for Escorting Prisoners throughout the state and caters for frequent water and rest breaks for the prisoners.</p><p>I can advise the Deputy that the Irish Prison Service 'Escorting of Prisoner Policy' document sets out in general terms the procedures and processes relating to the transportation of prisoners.  There is no specific information available on the length of time prisoners are detained in cellular transport, but I am advised by the Irish Prison Service that escorts are conducted as expeditiously as possible.  The Irish Prison Service works closely with other Criminal Justice agencies, such as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Court Services.  On occasion the Irish Prison Service is required to transport prisoners to court locations that have no secure holding facilities.  In such cases the Irish Prison Service has to utilise cellular transport to ensure secure and safe custody in as humane a manner as possible.</p><p>In relation to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na I can advise the Deputy that the following legislative provisions are of relevance.</p><p>Section 5 Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1997, provides authority for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to transfer a person to a Court, other than that to which they were first remanded to:</p> <blockquote>	   	 <blockquote> 	 <blockquote> 	<b>5.</b>&mdash;(1)<i>Notwithstanding section 27 (3) of the Courts of Justice Act, 1953 , the court before which a person first appears charged with a particular offence or a judge of the District Court exercising jurisdiction under subsection (2) of section 79 of the Act of 1924 (inserted by section 41 of the Courts and Court Officers Act, 1995) may remand that person in custody to appear at a sitting of the District Court (&ldquo;alternative court&rdquo;) in the District Court District in which the prison or place of detention where he or she is to be held in custody is situated or a District Court District adjoining the first-mentioned District Court District</i><br /><br />Section 5(2)(a) of the Immigration Act 2003 as amended by Section 80 of the International Protection Act 2015 provides: <br /><br /><i>(2) (a) Subject to paragraph (b), a person to whom this section applies may be arrested without warrant by an immigration officer or a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and a person so arrested may be taken to a place referred to in subparagraph (i) or (ii) and detained&mdash;</i><br /><br /><i>(i) under warrant of that officer or member in a prescribed place and in the custody of the officer of the Minister or member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for the time being in charge of that place, or</i><br /><br /><i>(ii) for the purposes of subsection (6) and for a period or periods each not exceeding 12 hours&mdash;</i><br /><br /><i>(I) in a vehicle, for the purposes of bringing the person to the port from which the ship, railway train, road vehicle or aircraft concerned is due to depart, or</i><br /><br /><i>(II) within the port referred to in clause (I).&rdquo;.</i> </blockquote> </blockquote>  </blockquote>  <p>Section 5(2)(a) of the Immigration Act 2003 as amended by Section 80 of the International Protection Act 2015 is the only legislation which provides for a specific period of time in which a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can detain a person in a vehicle.

He explained that agreement on such deployments would be made between the police forces involved as an operational matter and that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would insist in relation to any such deployment that no criminal or agent provocateur activities would be allowed or undertaken.  Any such officer so deployed would be focussed on reporting on the actions and intentions of external activists rather than domestic protestors.  He indicated that the use of such deployments can be crucial to the prevention of wide-scale public disorder, destruction of property and violence.</p>  <p>  The then Commissioner's report also stated that the capacity of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to enter into such arrangements was vital in the interests of national security.  The maintenance of confidentiality was an essential feature of those arrangements and the Commissioner indicated his belief that, notwithstanding the public attention which had been given to the case of the person in question, that for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to disclose whether the person in question acted as an under cover agent in the context which was outlined would impair the ability of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to enter into such arrangements and to protect the security of the State.  In the circumstances the report to my Department did not indicate whether the person in question had acted in such a capacity here.</p>  <p>  These are entirely Garda operational matters and my Department would not be involved in any way in such arrangements.</p>  <p>  In the circumstances which I have outlined I am not in a position to comment on matters relating to any specific deployments.</p>  <p>  That report indicated that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was aware of the presence of the person in question on a number of occasions between 2004 and 2006.  They had established no evidence that while in this jurisdiction that the person in question was involved in criminal activities and indicated that any person coming forward in possession of such evidence could be assured that it would be pursued fully by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  There are a number of general points which it may be helpful to make, which I have made in previous replies to Parliamentary Questions (in the context of which I have been briefed on the general issues which arise in this regard).  In particular, there is no question of a police officer from outside the jurisdiction exercising police powers here.  Any such person is subject fully to our laws and any evidence of breach of our criminal law would be fully pursued.   Following any criminal investigation it would be a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions to determine whether charges are warranted in any given case.  It will be appreciated also that there are statutory mechanisms in place to deal with complaints about the conduct of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  I am aware that an Undercover Policing Inquiry was established by the UK Government in March, 2015 in order to inquire into and report on undercover police operations conducted by English and Welsh police forces in England and Wales.  As Deputies will understand, the establishment of the inquiry and its terms of reference were and are matters solely for the UK authorities and, accordingly, I have not sought any information from them in relation to the matters subject of the inquiry.  I am aware of reports that the German authorities have been in contact with the UK authorities in respect of the inquiry.  However, the issue of my requesting the extension of a UK inquiry into matters which may relate to this jurisdiction does not arise.  I can assure the House, however, that should anything emerge from the inquiry's findings that would be relevant to policing in this jurisdiction, I will consider it fully and take any action that may be required.</p></reply>

In private family law cases, it is the responsibility of the person who is alleging the violence to bring an application for a domestic violence order. In some, but not all, cases of domestic violence, applicants also seek orders in relation to custody or access. In bringing an application, it is open to an applicant to call any witnesses the applicant sees fit or engage any expert to provide evidence to support the applicant's case.  The State does not provide reports for the Courts hearing private family law cases. If requested, the Courts make orders dealing with the terms of custody of and access to children where domestic violence is alleged.</p>  <p>  In public family law proceedings, the Child and Family Agency, Tusla, apply to bring children into care, in instances of abuse, neglect or domestic violence. In making an application, Tusla engages experts to prepare reports on the welfare of the children who may also give direct evidence in Court.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 contains new provisions regarding the best interests of children which have been in operation since 18 January 2016.  Section 45 of the 2015 Act replaces section 3 of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 with a new provision which clearly stipulates that the best interests of the child will be the paramount consideration for the court in any proceedings where the guardianship, custody or upbringing of, or access to, a child is in question.</p>  <p>  The best interests of a child are to be determined in accordance with the new Part V of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964, inserted by section 63 of the 2015 Act.  The new Part V contains two important sections.  Section 31 sets out a wide range of factors that the court is required to take into account when determining the best interests of the child.  These factors include any harm which the child has suffered or is at risk of suffering as a result of household violence, and the protection of the child&rsquo;s safety and psychological well-being.  Section 32 provides the court with the option to seek a written expert report on the welfare of the child. It also enables the court to appoint an expert to determine and convey the child&rsquo;s views to the court, so that the child&rsquo;s voice can be heard in the proceedings.</p></reply>

No. 569 of 2011).  The application fee, stipulated at &euro;175, is payable on application for a certificate of naturalisation and a certification fee is payable on the issue of a certificate of naturalisation.  The standard certification fee is set at &euro;950, while a reduced fee of &euro;200 applies in the case of an application made on behalf of a minor or in certain cases where the application is made by a widow, widower or surviving civil partner of an Irish citizen.  In the case of recognised refugees and stateless persons the certification fee is nil.</p>  <p>  The standard fees payable by an applicant are designed to reflect the effort and cost involved in processing applications for a certificate of naturalisation.  I might also add that following the grant of citizenship it is no longer necessary for the person to register their presence in the State with the Garda National Immigration Bureau which requires the payment of a fee of &euro;300 per registration.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that formal citizenship ceremonies have been introduced at no extra cost to applicants. These have been universally well received by participants as the ceremonies provide a sense of dignity and occasion that serves to underscore the importance to both the State and the applicant of the granting of Irish citizenship.</p>  <p>  All of the fees payable under the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956 are kept under ongoing review by my Department; however, currently there are no plans to reduce or abolish these fees.</p></reply>

Under the Act, the grant of legal aid entitles the applicant to the services of a solicitor and, in certain circumstances, up to two counsel, in the preparation and conduct of their defence or appeal.  The  assignment of lawyers or the granting of aid are matters for the Court and, as such, are handled by the judiciary.</p><p>Regulations made under the Act set out the fees payable by my Department to a solicitor assigned to a case in pursuance of a free legal aid certificate.  On being assigned, the legal practitioner makes a declaration that they have not received, nor will they accept any payment towards the cost of a case from, or on behalf of, the defendant.  A solicitor, therefore,  should not charge a defendant top-up or additional fees and may not accept fees from a defendant in relation to any case where that solicitor has been assigned under the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme, and the relevant sanction is set out in section 12(2) of the Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Regulations 1965. Section 12(2) states as follows:</p><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><i>&quot;If the Minister so thinks fit, he may refuse to make a payment under the Act in relation to a case in respect of which a certificate for free legal aid has been granted unless the person in respect of whom the payment falls to be made, furnishes to the Minister a document stating that he has not made or agreed to make and will not make or agree to make a payment towards the costs or expenses of the case in relation to which the certificate was granted and is not aware of a payment or intention to make a payment by any other person (other than under the Act) towards such costs or expenses&quot;.</i></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><p>It is open to any client of a solicitor to complain to the Law Society in any case where it is believed that he or she has been overcharged, or incorrectly charged,  by a solicitor, and similar safeguards are contained in the legislative provisions establishing the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority. </p><p>I should add that, if it is the case that the Deputy is aware of any instance where top-up or additional fees may have been charged by a solicitor under the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme, I would invite the Deputy to make me aware of the relevant details.</p><p>My Department is currently preparing legislation to give effect to the Government's commitments to transfer the administration of the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme to the Legal Aid Board and to strengthen aspects of its operation.</p></reply>

Its primary function is to provide face to face services with its customers in relation to registration for immigration permission and for re-entry visas.  I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department, that operational control of the registration function in Burgh Quay transferred from the Garda National Immigration Bureau  to the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department on 25th  July 2016.</p>  <p>  In relation to the registration process, the majority of documents presented by customers are returned to them before the completion of their registration/renewal. The Deputy will appreciate that many of these customers are in correspondence with INIS before the registration of their immigration permission takes place, and in most cases will have previously forwarded relevant documentation to INIS.  The only documents retained by the Registration Office are what are termed 'College Letters', provided by some colleges to assist students to complete the registration process. INIS is in the process of phasing these letters out with electronic communication.</p>  <p>  In relation to re-entry visa applications similar procedures apply, with all documentation returned to the customer at the end of the re-entry visa appointment transaction.</p>  <p>  On occasion, individuals whose applications are not being considered by the public office, have sought to hand in documentation at the reception desk in the public office. INIS recommends that, in all cases, individuals wishing to submit such documentation, particularly if it contains valuable documents such as passports, etc., should do so via recorded postal delivery addressed to the correct Division of INIS. INIS cannot take responsibility for documentation that is forwarded outside of this method of delivery.</p></reply>

In this regard I can assure the Deputy that I am in ongoing contact with the Garda Commissioner to ensure that the available Garda resources are used as effectively as possible for tackling crime in our community. In addition An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na work in partnership with a wide range of community based groups, including Community Alert and Neighbourhood Watch groups, to support enhanced community safety and with particular regard to the needs of elderly and more vulnerable people.</p><p>The protection of elderly and vulnerable people was a key consideration in the broad review of our response to burglary and related crimes which I initiated in the early part of 2015. Arising from this the Deputy will be aware of the concerted strategy which has been put in place to tackle such crimes and protect householders. In particular, very important progress has been made under Operation Thor which has led to concentrated Garda activity with more than 30,000 crime prevention patrols and in the order of 38,500 targeted checkpoints nationwide, with 2,500 arrests and 2,900 charges being made. The success being achieved through Operation Thor is reflected in the official CSO Crime Statistics which show that in the first three months of 2016 there were 36% less burglaries than in the first three months of 2015.The recently announced package of additional resources to support Garda operations in 2016 includes provision for the ongoing implementation of Operation Thor. So there will be no let-up on the pressure which the Garda&iacute; are bringing to bear on the organised gangs engaged in burglary, including the mobile gangs who have targeted rural communities in various parts of the country.</p><p>These intensive policing measures are backed up by the specific legislation targeting repeat burglars with previous convictions which was enacted in the Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Act<b></b>2015. I am very pleased that these provisions are now available to Garda&iacute; to support prosecutions arising from Operation Thor.</p><p>More generally, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s Older People Strategy promotes actions to support and respond to the needs and expectations of older people on an ongoing basis.  In addition, the Seniors Alert Scheme, which is provided by my colleague the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community &amp;amp; Local Government, provides grant assistance towards the purchase and installation of personal monitored alarms to enable older persons, of limited means, to continue to live with independence and peace of mind in their own homes.  As part of the Community Policing approach Garda&iacute; engage with a wide range of local groups, including more than 3,700 Neighbourhood Watch and Community Alert groups established countrywide. as well as participating in more formal structures such as Joint Policing Committees, which provide an important forum to address a wide range of local policing concerns.</p><p>The Garda authorities strongly support the ongoing development of community partnership initiatives, and I as T&aacute;naiste greatly value this work. In fact, the Deputy will be aware that I secured a doubling of the funding for crime prevention initiatives to be funded by my Department in 2016. Most of this funding goes to support the Community Alert programme which provides a very practical model for communities working in partnership with local Garda&iacute; to prevent crime and to provide reassurance for more vulnerable people. To support the establishment of local groups An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have published Community Crime Prevention Guidelines as well as guidelines for local Text Alert Groups. The Garda Text Alert Scheme is a particularly successful example of community partnership with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, with over 900 local groups in operation, involving in excess of 160,000 subscribers and with an estimated 200,000 text messages sent each month.

The project is to be delivered by way of Public Private Partnership in accordance with the Government&rsquo;s Infrastructure and Capital Investment Programme 2016 - 2021 and it is anticipated that the project could be completed by 2020.</p><p>I am informed that the rezoning of a part of the Hammond Lane site as a park, has been proposed in an amendment which has been tabled by some members of Dublin City Council to the draft Dublin City Development Plan 2016 - 2022. The Courts Service has informed me that this would have a serious and detrimental effect on the proposed development of that site.</p><p>Currently family law cases and cases involving children are dealt with at four separate locations in central Dublin and the facilities currently available at these locations are considered inadequate.  The proposal to develop a dedicated Family Law and Children&rsquo;s Court complex on the Hammond Lane site provides a unique opportunity to address the inadequacy of the current facilities by providing a purpose built courthouse specifically designed to cater for the particular needs of those involved in family or child care cases.</p><p>However, if the proposed rezoning is adopted the Courts Service advise that this would impact negatively on plans to develop the Family Law and Children's Court complex. The site is quite small (approximately 0.45 hectares) and a major challenge in the design work undertaken to date has been to fit all the necessary courtrooms, support services and court offices into the available space. A reduction in the size of the site would severely restrict the size of the complex and could have the potential to delay the project and also to jeopardise its viability.</p><p>Since becoming aware of the proposed amendment the Courts Service has written to Dublin City Council expressing its concerns and has made a submission requesting that the rezoning proposal be withdrawn. The Courts Service understands that similar submissions have also been made by other organisations working in the area of family and child care law. I am informed that all submissions will be considered by City Councillors at a special meeting scheduled for 23 September next following which the Courts Service will consider the matter further and I can assure the Deputy that it is my intention to continue to take a very strong interest, from the Government's perspective,  in the delivery of this critical enhancement of our family court facilities in Dublin<b><i>.</i></b></p></reply>

Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 will require some 3,200 new Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next four years in addition to the 1,200 that will have been recruited by the end of this year since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014. So far 534 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream uniform duties nationwide.</p><p>In order to continue to ensure seamless ongoing recruitment I was very pleased to announce the commencement of a new recruitment campaign on 8 September.  The campaign is being organised by the Public Appointments Service on behalf of the Garda Commissioner. Applications must be made through <i>www.publicjobs.ie</i>before the closing date for applications on 29 September 2016.The existing recruitment campaign (launched last November) is ongoing and successful candidates will continue to be called from that campaign this year and into next year. It is expected that successful candidates from the new campaign will enter the Garda College from mid-2017.</p><p>As I have stated previously, when accelerating recruitment it is essential to ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the capacity to train larger numbers without any diminution in the quality of its training programme, and to provide appropriate supervision and support to newly qualified Garda&iacute; to ensure that victims and the public are well served. I welcome the detailed planning process that the Commissioner and her team have in place to ensure the delivery of increased numbers of Garda&iacute; without any compromise on the quality of those recruited or the training programme.</p></reply>

International best practice indicates that a multidimensional approach is required to address the potential for violent radicalisation and our policies concerned with integration, equality, combating discrimination and building positive relationships with our minority communities are central.</p>  <p>  In the circumstances of the current international threat environment a focus may unfairly be brought to bear on our Muslim community.  I am sure the Deputy will agree that the actions of a small number of violent extremists do not reflect the views of the majority of our Muslim community, which is a peace-loving community of citizens that contributes much to the cultural vibrancy of the State.</p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na operates a progressive community engagement programme with all our minority communities through the Garda Racial, Intercultural and Diversity Office (GRIDO) and the national network of Garda Ethnic Liaison Officers.  Interaction with our Muslim community, especially with the main mosques and cultural centres, is conducted on the community policing model which serves the general policing needs of the community.  The GRIDO model has been identified as a model of best international practice by the UN Counter Terrorism Committee in the context of combating radicalisation. </p>  <p>  Community engagement is also regarded as an essential component of strategies designed to deal with this issue and included as a key action in the EU's Strategy for Countering Radicalisation and Recruitment to Terrorism.  Ireland contributed to the formulation of this Strategy and on an ongoing basis to EU responses to this threat.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is a member of the EU's Radicalisation Awareness Network. </p>  <p>  While the expert assessment of the threat of a terrorist attack from this source is that is not considered likely, there are a number of persons in the State whose activities in support of extremism give rise to concern.  The Garda Authorities will continue to take appropriate measures to monitor their activities and take any appropriate action to prevent and detect any criminal activity.</p>  <p>  It is also important that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is supported by the necessary legislative powers to counter violent radicalisation.  The Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) (Amendment) Act 2015 which came into force in June 2015, further enhanced the powers available by the creation of three new offences of public provocation to commit a terrorist offence, recruitment for terrorism and training for terrorism.  These offences will carry sentences of up to 10 years imprisonment on conviction on indictment. </p>  <p>  I have made clear previously that all the options available under the law, including immigration law, to deal with those who constitute a threat to the security of the State will be used and that remains the position.  Any decision whether or not to make a deportation order against an individual is based on the specific circumstances of their case.  There is a range of grounds that must be considered in this context and these include national security and public policy, and also the character and conduct of the individual concerned.</p></reply>

Under the programme the Government has pledged to accept a total of 4,000 migrants into the State by the end of 2017, through a combination of the EU relocation mechanism established in 2015 to assist Italy and Greece (which Ireland voluntarily opted into) and the UNHCR-led refugee resettlement programme currently focused on resettling refugees from camps in Jordan and Lebanon.  </p>  <p>  Under the Resettlement part of the IRPP, 520 refugees are to be resettled in Ireland by 31 December 2016.  As of yesterday, 377 of these 520 have been admitted to the State.  Sufficient cases  were selected during a selection mission to Lebanon earlier this year to fill the rest of the quota of 520.  These cases have been security screened and health screened and are scheduled to arrive in groups between now and the end of October.  In addition to this 520, the Government recently announced it is extending the resettlement programme to take in a further 260 refugees from Lebanon in 2017. </p>  <p>  As regards the EU relocation mechanism, it is well documented that the pace of arrivals under this programme to date has been slower than expected.  The Government is wholly committed to ensuring that Ireland meets its obligations under the EU Relocation mechanism in a timely fashion.  I am pleased to report, therefore, that following a highly productive visit by Irish officials to Greece earlier this year, the frequency and numbers of arrivals has increased and is continuing to improve.  Ireland has to date taken in 69 Syrian people, mostly families.  A further 40 people have been assessed and cleared for arrival and arrangements for their travel to the State are currently being made and last week IRPP officials interviewed a group of 63 people in Athens who, once cleared for travel, are expected to arrive in October.  It is estimated that by the end of 2016 Ireland will have accepted up to 360 people under relocation.  The intention thereafter is to sustain the pace and size of intakes throughout 2017 at the levels required to allow Ireland to meet its commitments within the timeframes envisaged under the EU Relocation Decisions.  </p>  <p>  In announcing the IRPP, the Government recognised the importance of prioritising family groups and in addressing the position of unaccompanied children.  A significant number of those who have arrived to date are children with one or two parents.  The position with regard to unaccompanied minors is that Ireland has formally indicated to Greece its desire to accept unaccompanied minors under the relocation mechanism and we now have a commitment from the Greek authorities that Ireland will be receiving the first group of unaccompanied minors later this year.  The next step is for the authorities in Greece to forward case files for those unaccompanied minors they wish to assign for relocation here.  Once these files are received, officials from Tusla - the Child and Family Agency with responsibility for the care of unaccompanied minors in the State - will travel to Greece to assess the needs of those minors and plan for their care and accommodation upon arrival. </p>  <p>  It is not possible at this juncture to determine the overall number of unaccompanied minors that will be accepted during the lifetime of the programme as it will depend on the number of cases referred by Greece and the level of resources that each individual case will require upon arrival.  Ireland will continue to prioritise its commitment to offer protection to this vulnerable group. </p>  <p>  I continue to work proactively with my colleagues in Europe to ensure that Ireland and the European Union responds comprehensively to all aspects of the ongoing migration and refugee crisis. I share the concerns of the Deputy in relation to unaccompanied minors as an especially vulnerable group and I expect this issue to remain high on the agenda at EU level.</p></reply>

It is up to each student to make the best use of that opportunity.If their academic achievement is high, Ireland offers opportunities to students to stay on as graduates, researchers, or high skilled  employees.  In other words, student permission gives the person concerned a chance to qualify for an enhanced immigration status on the basis of their academic achievement.  However, student permission is of a temporary and limited nature that is not reckonable for naturalisation purposes and that generally does not allow for family reunification.  Merely spending time in Ireland as a student does not confer entitlement or expectation to remain.  Guidelines for non-EEA national students are available on the INIS website at <i>www.inis.gov.ie</i>.</p><p>I am informed by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that the persons concerned were contacted on 18 April 2016 with regard to their residency status in the State.  </p><p>Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

This proposal was based on the conclusions of studies the European Commission conducted evaluating all provisions of the Firearms Directive and their implementation in EU countries.  The reports highlight a number of weaknesses and loopholes in the current legislation which the Commission's proposal aims to address. </p>  <p>  The Firearms Directive allows the Commission to adopt standards and rules on the deactivation of firearms.  The Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/2403 of 15 December 2015 (Deactivation Regulation) establishes common guidelines on deactivation within the EU with the objective to address problems due to the illegal reactivation of firearms by using pieces of other deactivated arms, home-made pieces or pieces acquired via the Internet. </p>  <p>  The Commission Implementing Regulation has been developed in discussion with EU country experts and is based on technical specifications for deactivation developed by the Permanent International Commission for the Proof of Small Arms (the CIP).  This Regulation sets out common and strict minimum criteria for the way EU countries must deactivate weapons so that they are rendered irreversibly inoperable.  This Regulation came into effect on 8 April 2016 and has direct application within this jurisdiction.  It permits both firearms owners and registered firearms dealers to carry out the work required to render the firearm irreversibly deactivated in accordance with the regulation.  The firearm must then be submitted to any one of the current 46 national competent authorities within the EU for verification and certification.</p>  <p>  Ireland has not appointed a Competent Authority to verify the deactivation of firearms in accordance with this Regulation because there is no significant firearms manufacturing industry in this country and no formal training for a gunsmith is recognised by the State.  However, the Department of Justice and Equality has received statements of interest from five interested parties who wish to be assessed to be appointed as a Competent Authority for the verification of the deactivation of firearms under the regulation.  The applicants are preparing formal applications at present and these shall be assessed upon receipt.  In the meantime, the Birmingham Proof House has been approved by UK authorities to verify the deactivation of firearms in accordance with the Regulation and they have indicated their willingness to undertake such verification work for Irish customers. </p>  <p>  The possession of any firearm, even after deactivation, will continue to require authorisation by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  </p></reply>

The aim of the Strategic Plan is to create a better environment in the Service by developing and progressing four key actions: Staff Support, Prisoner Support, Victim Support and Enhancing Organisation Capacity.  In building the Strategy the Irish Prison Service was cognisant of the recommendations for cultural change set out by the Inspector of Prisons in his Report "Culture and Organisation in the Irish Prison Service  - A Road Map for the future".</p>  <p>  Staff Support is identified as a key Strategic Action the Irish Prison Service will take over the next three years.  A key goal of the Strategic Plan is to create a work environment that is centred on dignity and respect with clear standards of behaviour and ethics in place for staff, management and the organisation.  To progress this the Irish Prison Service will promote the Council of Europe Code of Ethics for Prison Staff and introduce an Acceptable Behaviour Standard.  This will set out what is expected of each individual in relation to behaviour, what individuals have a right to expect in relation to the behaviours of others and the mechanisms to quickly and effectively resolve behavioural issues.  This will result in guidance for staff in how prisons should be managed, how prisoners should be treated and how prison personnel should behave to achieve a culture where respect and decency are to the forefront. </p></reply>

Arising from this I met with the Inspector of Prisons to discuss his findings.  The Inspector made it clear to me that he considered the Irish Prison Service has to retain a central role in the complaints process but with independent oversight and that he was satisfied that a fair and effective complaints procedure could be achieved with the implementation of his recommendations.  I also had a separate meeting with the Director General of the Irish Prison Service to see what action needed to be taken following on from the report.</p><p>In the light of this report it is clear that more needs to be done before we have a system that will gain the full confidence of staff, prisoners and the general public.  One of the key recommendations in the Inspector's report is that prisoners&rsquo; complaints would be subject to review by the Ombudsman, who would also be able to deal with complaints directly in the case of undue delay.  I accept this recommendation and my officials have already had a number of meetings with the Ombudsman's office and will be engaging with Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on the matter.</p><p>Another recommendation is that complaints would also be categorised as either serious Category A or minor Category B and that a robust investigative mechanism must be put in place in prisons to ensure the proper investigation of Category A complaints.  While I fully accept this recommendation, I am concerned that replacing external investigators with an internal IPS team of investigators might give rise to a perception of bias.  I have directed that more training be provided for external investigators and that this independent investigative element be maintained for a 12 month period and then reviewed.</p><p>I have also accepted further recommendations in the report.  These include resolving minor complaints at the lowest level; allowing prisoners to make complaints to relevant professional bodies; prisoners being entitled to an explanation for decisions made affecting them; frivolous and vexatious complaints being addressed; and the application of fair procedures.  Similarly the recommendations on adequate training, adhering to protocols and statutory obligations, holding staff to account, not hindering the complaints procedure and having an effective communication system are accepted.</p><p>In my meeting with the Inspector about his report, I specifically asked him to keep the complaints procedure under review and to give me regular reports.  I emphasised that the rights of all prisoners, including vulnerable prisoners, have to be promoted and an effective complaints system is just one aspect of achieving this goal.</p><p>While some amendment to secondary legislation may be required to effect these recommendations, it is not envisaged that primary legislation would be required.</p></reply>

The scheduling and hearing of court cases is a matter for the Presidents of the Courts and the presiding Judges.</p>  <p>  However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had inquiries made and the Courts Service has informed me that the assignment of judges and the distribution of the business of the District Court, including in the Dublin Metropolitan District, is a matter for the President of the District Court.  The decision on the number of judges to hear family law matters in Dolphin House is a matter for the President of the District Court.</p>  <p>  The President of the District Court, in consultation with the Courts Service, keeps the distribution of business in Dolphin House under regular review and where specific issues are identified appropriate action is taken bearing in mind any constraints imposed by the availability of judicial, administrative or structural resources.  In this context, the Courts Service is making final arrangements for the relocation of the three child care hearing courts currently located in Dolphin House to the Chancery Street Courthouse in September 2016.  This will increase the number of dedicated courtrooms available for the hearing of District Family Law cases to eight and will facilitate the holding of additional family courts and reduce waiting times and the number of cases listed per court per day.</p>  <p>  The Courts Service has commenced discussions with the users of Dolphin House as to how the additional space resulting from the transfer of the three courts from Dolphin House to Chancery Street can be used for the benefit of all court users, bearing in mind the restrictions of the building and the health and safety and security needs of all who attend the building.</p>  <p>  I am pleased that plans for a dedicated and integrated Family Law and Children&rsquo;s Court building on a site at Church Street and Hammond Lane, adjacent to the Four Courts are progressing well.  This will provide new family law courts for the District, Circuit and High Courts in a single location with associated facilities and it is currently envisaged that the new facility will be available by 2020.</p></reply>

Court hearing times are arranged to enable judges to prepare for the case, read the papers where appropriate in the case or cases listed before them for hearing and to complete other preparatory work associated with their lists.  Judges, in individual cases, regularly arrange earlier times for commencement of hearings and extend hearings beyond the usual finishing time to facilitate parties, witnesses and legal representatives, and to ensure hearings are completed within the time allocated to them in the court's calendar.</p>  <p>  Business is scheduled in so far as possible with a view to ensuring that the court has sufficient business for the full duration of a scheduled sitting.  The Court normally has no advance notice of matters that will not proceed, matters that will proceed as expected and matters that overrun their expected duration.  Inevitably, on occasions, cases listed for hearing may settle and the Court will finish early.  The Court, in scheduling cases, endeavours to strike a balance between managing the expectations of parties that their cases will get listed for hearing and the realistic possibility of such occurring.</p>  <p>  The Presidents of the Courts, in consultation with the Courts Service, keep waiting times under regular review.  Where specific issues are identified additional judicial resources are targeted at the areas of greatest need.  Currently final arrangements are being put into place to redistribute the work of the District Court in Dublin to allow the use of three courtrooms in Chancery Street Courthouse for District Court Family Law child care business.  This will increase from five to eight the available courtrooms in Dublin to hear family law matters in the District Court.  The opening of the additional courts will impact positively on current waiting times in family law in Dublin.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, it is my intention, subject to Government approval, to bring forward proposals in the coming months regarding a dedicated Family Court and issues relating to access to the Family Courts and optimising the use and availability of court time are likely arise for discussion in the course of discussions and consultations on those legislative proposals.</p></reply>

In relation to the fixing of hearing dates in the Dublin Circuit Family Court on 17 June 2016, most of the requests for hearing dates were accommodated in October/November 2016 which is a waiting time of 4 to 5 months and also includes the summer vacation period.

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.</p><p>In relation to the specific query raised by the Deputy, the number of Garda Reserves in the Cavan/Monaghan Division as on 31 July 2016, the latest dates for which figures are readily available, is as set out in the table.</p><p>There are currently in the region of 800 Reserves making a real and tangible contribution to the policing of communities right across the country.  This is recognised by the commitment in the &quot;Programme for a Partnership Government&quot; to double their number so that they can act in a supportive role to full-time members, undertaking local patrols and crime reduction measures.  The Commissioner is currently developing plans to deliver increased numbers of Reserves and, in this context, is assessing their existing powers and whether an extension of these powers might provide operational advantages to the organisation.</p><p>With regard to recruitment generally, this Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime. Key to achieving this goal is the commitment in the<font color="#2F2F2F"> &quot;Programme for a Partnership Government&quot; to</font>continue the ongoing accelerated Garda recruitment programme with a view to increasing Garda numbers to 15,000.  Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 will require some 3,200 new Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next four years in addition to the 1,200 that will have been recruited by the end of this year since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014. So far 534 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of whom 15 of these have been assigned to Cavan/Monaghan.  Another 150 will attest later this year.</p><p>In order to continue to ensure seamless ongoing recruitment of trainee Garda&iacute; I was very pleased to announce the commencement of a new recruitment campaign on 8 September which includes a special stream for eligible reserve members.  The campaign is being organised by the Public Appointments Service on behalf of the Garda Commissioner.  Applications must be made through <i>www.publicjobs.ie</i>before the closing date for applications on 29 September 2016.  The existing recruitment campaign (launched last November) is ongoing and successful candidates will continue to be called from that campaign this year and into next year.  It is expected that successful candidates from the new campaign will enter the Garda College from mid-2017. </p><p>As I have stated previously, when accelerating recruitment it is essential to ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the capacity to train larger numbers without any diminution in the quality of its training programme, and to provide appropriate supervision and support to newly qualified Garda&iacute; to ensure that victims and the public are well served.  I welcome the detailed planning process that the Commissioner and her team have in place to ensure the delivery of increased numbers of Garda&iacute; without any compromise on the quality of those recruited or the training programme.</p><p><b>Cavan/Monaghan Garda Reserves as of 31 July 2016</b><table><tr><th>Cavan</th><th>5</th></tr><tr><td>Carrickmacross</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Bailieboro</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Clones</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Castleblayney</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>TOTAL</td><td>15</td></tr></table></p></reply>

This commitment was acknowledged in the Report on the Strategic Review of Penal Policy which also recommended a greater focus on step down facilities, supported accommodation, the use of more community based open conditions for female offenders and the provision of an open centre for women. </p>  <p>  The joint Probation Service/Irish Prison Service Women's Strategy 2014 - 2016,  "An Effective Response to Women Who Offend" is ongoing and will be reviewed at the end of its term.  The Women&rsquo;s Strategy sets out how the Irish Prison Service and the Probation Service work together, as well as with other statutory, community and voluntary sector partners, to provide  women-focused interventions to help reduce offending, improve opportunities for reintegration and to improve outcomes more generally. </p>  <p>  As part of the Joint Strategy, a joint Irish Prison Service/Probation Service working group considered an open centre for women and decided to recommend step down facilities for women as a more practical and cost effective way to address the deficit rather than developing an open centre for women.  In this regard, I have given approval to the Heads of the Irish Prison Service and Probation Service to proceed to scope the possibilities for the development of a step down unit in Dublin.</p>  <p>  There are 14 institutions in the Irish prison system consisting of: Portlaoise, which is the maximum security prison in the state; 10 traditional 'closed' prisons; 2 open centres; and 1 semi-open centre.  These prisons are suitable for the prison service's needs at present.  There are no plans to convert some of the country's prisons to low security status.  I can advise the Deputy in regard to the female accommodation within the prison estate that planning is well under way for the modernisation and expansion of facilities in Limerick Prison. Part of this redevelopment includes the provision of high quality prison accommodation for female prisoners with a capacity of approximately 50 individual cells and 8 transition units, which will more than double its current capacity.</p>  <p>  Alternatives to custody continue to be pursued and legislation has already been passed.  The Criminal Justice (Community Service) (Amendment) Act 2011 requires the sentencing judge to consider the imposition of community service where a custodial sentence of 12 months or less is being considered.  </p></reply>

No. 569 of 2011).  The application fee, stipulated at &euro;175, is payable on application for a certificate of naturalisation and a certification fee is payable on the issue of a certificate of naturalisation.  The standard certification fee is set at &euro;950.  The Regulations provide for a reduced fee of &euro;200 in the case of an application made on behalf of a minor, or in certain cases where the application is made by a widow, widower or surviving civil partner of an Irish citizen.  In the case of recognised refugees and stateless persons the certification fee is nil.  </p>  <p>  The standard fees payable by an applicant are designed to reflect the effort and cost involved in processing applications for a certificate of naturalisation.  There is no reduction for EU citizens.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that formal citizenship ceremonies have been introduced at no extra cost to applicants.  These have been universally well received by participants as the ceremonies provide a sense of dignity and occasion that serves to underscore the importance to both the State and the applicant of the granting of Irish citizenship.</p>  <p>  All of the fees payable under the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956 are kept under ongoing review by my Department; however, currently there are no plans to reduce or abolish these fees.</p></reply>

The function of the Central Authorities network, and the international instruments and legislation underpinning them, is to facilitate applications for the return of children who have been abducted, usually by a parent to another contracting State. </p>  <p>  It provides a mechanism whereby a left behind parent can request the return of their wrongfully removed/retained child through this network.  Where a parent applies for the return of a child, the Central Authority ensures that the application meets the requirements of these laws before forwarding the application to the relevant Central Authority abroad which in turn will forward it to a competent/deciding authority, usually a court in their State.  </p>  <p>  The Irish Central Authority does not have an active role in the proceedings in the foreign court as such; it monitors the progression of applications and keeps applicants or their legal representatives informed of any developments as soon as possible.  In cases where foreign courts are involved, these proceedings must run their course (including appeals) in accordance with the rules of that other jurisdiction and the progress of these cases is dependent on these authorities. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to comment on a matter which is the subject of legal proceedings.  However I can assure the Deputy that our Central Authority is in regular contact with the other EU Central Authority and the applicant's legal representative in relation to this matter and continues to provide what assistance it can within its remit given both the circumstances of this case and the dependence on the judicial process in the other jurisdiction.</p></reply>

The granting of an application for a certificate of naturalisation is governed by the provisions of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended.  Section 15 of the Act provides that the Minister may, in her absolute discretion, grant an application for a certificate of naturalisation provided certain statutory conditions are fulfilled.  The conditions are that the applicant must -</p><p>- be of full age</p><p>- be of good character</p><p>- have had a period of one year's continuous residency in the State immediately before the date of application and, during the eight years immediately preceding that period, have had a further total residence in the State amounting to four years</p><p>- intend in good faith to continue to reside in the State after naturalisation</p><p>- have, <font color="#212100">before a judge of the District Court in open court, in a citizenship ceremony or in such manner as the Minister, for special reasons, allows</font></p><p><font color="#212100">- (i) made a declaration, in the prescribed manner, of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State, and</font></p><p><font color="#212100">- (ii) undertaken to faithfully observe the laws of the State and to respect its democratic values.</font></p><p>It is open to any individual to lodge an application for citizenship if and when they are in a position to meet the all the statutory requirements.An on-line residency calculator is available on the website <i>www.inis.gov.ie</i>which may be of assistance in establishing if the residency requirements are met.  </p><p>Section 16 of the Act provides that the Minister may, in her absolute discretion, waive some or all of the statutory conditions in certain circumstances i.e. where an applicant is of Irish descent or of Irish associations; where an applicant is a person who is a refugee within the meaning of the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees; or where an applicant is a Stateless person within the meaning of the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Stateless persons.  There is no right or entitlement to have any of the conditions waived, it is entirely at the Minister's discretion.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution under continual review taking into account crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the best possible use is made of these resources.  </p><p>Ballymun forms part of the Dublin Metropolitan North (DMR North) Division.  I have been informed by the Garda Commissioner that the Garda strength of that Division, on the 31 July 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 224.  Of these some 120 are stationed in Ballymun with another 84 stationed in Santry.  There are also 11 Garda Reserves and 11 civilians attached to the Ballymun District.</p><p>There are 130 vehicles assigned to the Division.  The breakdown by District is provided in the table.  It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate vehicles within his/her Division as appropriate. </p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  Key to achieving this goal is the commitment in the<font color="#2F2F2F"> &quot;Programme for a Partnership Government&quot; to</font>continue the ongoing accelerated Garda recruitment programme with a view to increasing Garda numbers to 15,000.  Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 will require some 3,200 new Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next four years in addition to the 1,200 that will have been recruited by the end of this year since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014.  So far 534 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of whom 41 have been assigned to the  DMR North.  Another 150 recruits are due to attest later this year.</p><p>In order to continue to ensure seamless ongoing recruitment I was very pleased to announce the commencement of a new recruitment campaign on 8 September.  The campaign is being organised by the Public Appointments Service on behalf of the Garda Commissioner.  Applications must be made through <i>www.publicjobs.ie</i>before the closing date for applications on 29 September 2016.  The existing recruitment campaign (launched last November) is ongoing and successful candidates will continue to be called from that campaign this year and into next year.  It is expected that successful candidates from the new campaign will enter the Garda College from mid-2017.</p><p>As I have stated previously, when accelerating recruitment it is essential to ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the capacity to train larger numbers without any diminution in the quality of its training programme, and to provide appropriate supervision and support to newly qualified Garda&iacute; to ensure that victims and the public are well served.  I welcome the detailed planning process that the Commissioner and her team have in place to ensure the delivery of increased numbers of Garda&iacute; without any compromise on the quality of those recruited or the training programme. <table>    <tr>       <th colspan="9"><div>Garda Fleet Details &ndash; DMR NORTH Division on 14/09/2016</div></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td rowspan="2"></td>       <td colspan="3"><div>Cars</div></td>       <td><div>Vans</div></td>       <td><div>M/Bikes</div></td>       <td><div>4X4</div></td>       <td><div>MPV</div></td>       <td rowspan="2"><div>Total</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><div>Marked</div></td>       <td><div>Unmarked</div></td>       <td><div>Total</div></td>       <td><div> </div></td>       <td><div> </div></td>       <td><div> </div></td>       <td><div> </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total</td>       <td><div>35</div></td>       <td><div>54</div></td>       <td><div>89</div></td>       <td><div>34</div></td>       <td><div>2</div></td>       <td><div>2</div></td>       <td><div>3</div></td>       <td><div>130</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>BALBRIGGAN DISTRICT</td>       <td><div>5</div></td>       <td><div>4</div></td>       <td><div>9</div></td>       <td><div>3</div></td>       <td><div>0</div></td>       <td><div>0</div></td>       <td><div>0</div></td>       <td><div>12</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>BALLYMUN DISTRICT</td>       <td><div>13</div></td>       <td><div>25</div></td>       <td><div>38</div></td>       <td><div>24</div></td>       <td><div>2</div></td>       <td><div>2</div></td>       <td><div>3</div></td>       <td><div>69</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>COOLOCK DISTRICT</td>       <td><div>9</div></td>       <td><div>16</div></td>       <td><div>25</div></td>       <td><div>3</div></td>       <td><div>0</div></td>       <td><div>0</div></td>       <td><div>0</div></td>       <td><div>28</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>RAHENY DISTRICT</td>       <td><div>8</div></td>       <td><div>9</div></td>       <td><div>17</div></td>       <td><div>4</div></td>       <td><div>0</div></td>       <td><div>0</div></td>       <td><div>0</div></td>       <td><div>21</div></td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

The final notification letter issued on 13 July 2016. </p>  <p>  I have repeatedly emphasised that the Independent Review Mechanism was not established to act as a Commission of Inquiry or Investigation.  Nor was it designed to make findings. Its purpose was to triage the allegations to see whether further action was needed and what that action would be.  I have previously assured Deputies that where further investigation has been recommended by the review then that will occur.  However,  I have also pointed out that in a large proportion of cases, counsel would be likely to recommend that no further action could reasonably be taken.  This has proven to be the case.  </p>  <p>  In circumstances where individuals have genuine but necessarily subjective concerns about how their particular cases were originally handled, it is inevitable that many of those complainants who were informed that no further action was recommended, will be unhappy with that outcome.  The crucial point, however, is that every case has been reviewed by independent counsel, who have made an objective recommendation. </p></reply>

The Roadmap to Ratification, which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website, sets out the substantial legislative agenda required for ratification.  </p>  <p>  Considerable progress has already been made to overcome barriers to Ireland&rsquo;s ratification.  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 was signed into law on 30 December 2015 and is a comprehensive reform of the law on decision-making capacity.  The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill 2015 was passed by the Seanad on 26 January this year.  When enacted, the Bill will reform Section 5 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 to facilitate the full participation in family life of persons with intellectual disabilities and the full expression of their human rights.  Achieving the necessary balance between those rights and ensuring appropriate protection is crucial.   </p>  <p>  Work is also underway on drawing up an Equality/Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill to progress miscellaneous legislative amendments necessary to proceed to ratification.  It is intended that the Bill will address issues such as the Convention's requirements in relation to reasonable accommodation and deprivation of liberty, as well as removing archaic references in existing legislation relating to mental health.  The General Scheme of the Equality/Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill is available on the Department's website.  Enactment is expected by the end of the year.</p></reply>

The intention will be to ensure that persons convicted of murder, attempted murder or manslaughter will be precluded from taking any share in the property or other assets of their victim.  While I am not in a position at this stage to announce when such legislation will be published, my intention is to proceed quickly with enactment of the legislation following its publication.</p>  <p>  For the sake of completeness, I should add that the Law Reform Commission published a consultative paper on Section 117 of the Succession Act 1965 earlier this year and sought submissions on possible changes to the law in this area.  Section 117 is the provision under which the child of a deceased parent who has made a will may apply to court on the basis that parent had failed in his or her &ldquo;moral duty" to make proper provision for the child.  Where the court finds that a parent had failed in his or her moral duty to make proper provision for the child, it can make an appropriate order which redistributes the estate between the beneficiaries.  The Law Reform Commission's paper identified a number of issues which may need to be reconsidered at this stage, e.g. the matters to be taken into account by the court when determining whether the deceased had failed in his or her moral duty; and whether the provision in section 117 should be extended to situations in which the deceased parent had not made any will.</p>  <p>  I understand that the closing date for receiving submissions on the consultation paper was 25 June and that the Commission is now embarking on completion of the project.  I look forward to receiving the completed Report and considering any recommendations for reforms in this important area of succession law in due course.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution under continuing review taking into account crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the best possible use is made of these resources.</p><p>I have been informed by the Garda Commissioner that on 31 July 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available, there were 554 Garda&iacute; (a reduction of one member compared to January 2016) assigned to Limerick, with 46 Reserves and 49 civilians.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation (NBCI), the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (formerly the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation) and the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) the Drugs Unit.  The needs of each Division are fully considered within the context of the overall policing needs of the State.</p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  Key to achieving this goal is the commitment in the<font color="#2F2F2F"> &quot;Programme for a Partnership Government&quot; to</font>continue the ongoing accelerated Garda recruitment programme with a view to increasing Garda numbers to 15,000.  Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 will require some 3,200 new Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next four years in addition to the 1,200 that will have been recruited by the end of this year since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014. So far 534 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of whom 12 of these have been assigned to Limerick.  Another 150 are due to attest later this year.</p><p>In order to continue to ensure seamless ongoing recruitment I was very pleased to announce the commencement of a new recruitment campaign on 8 September.  The campaign is being organised by the Public Appointments Service on behalf of the Garda Commissioner.  Applications must be made through <i></i>before the closing date for applications on 29 September 2016.  The existing recruitment campaign (launched last November) is ongoing and successful candidates will continue to be called from that campaign this year and into next year.  It is expected that successful candidates from the new campaign will enter the Garda College from mid-2017.</p><p>As I have stated previously, when accelerating recruitment it is essential to ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the capacity to train larger numbers without any diminution in the quality of its training programme, and to provide appropriate supervision and support to newly qualified Garda&iacute; to ensure that victims and the public are well served.  I welcome the detailed planning process that the Commissioner and her team have in place to ensure the delivery of increased numbers of Garda&iacute; without any compromise on the quality of those recruited or the training programme.</p></reply>

In order to interpret these figures correctly, it is important to note that they include a number of persons who had been granted status to remain in the State and are preparing to move into communities.  In August there were approximately 550 persons with such status residing in direct provision, the majority of whom would be expected to fall into the three year plus cohort.</p>  <p>  When a person makes an application for international protection, they are offered accommodation in the direct provision system.  While there is no obligation on them to accept this offer, approximately 50% of applicants avail of the accommodation offered.  They are not obliged to remain there and can leave direct provision and indeed return to direct provision as they so require.  In addition, those who refuse the initial accommodation offer can choose to avail of direct provision accommodation at a later date.</p>  <p>  The Programme for a Partnership Government contains a commitment to reform the Direct Provision system, with particular focus on families and children and to this end the recommendations of the Working Group are being implemented.</p>  <p>  The International Protection Act 2015 responds to the Report's recommendations in relation to improving the application process and thereby reducing the length of time spent by applicants in State provided accommodation.  The Act provides for the introduction of a single application procedure for international protection which is a key recommendation of the Report.  The single procedure is specifically aimed at addressing the length of time persons spend in the protection process.  The new procedure will significantly streamline and speed up the processing of protection applications and will reduce the length of time that persons spend in the Direct Provision system. Preparations for commencement of the single procedure are progressing.</p>  <p>  The Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) of my Department is progressing the implementation of recommendations around access to cooking facilities as well as increasing the living space for direct provision residents.  Pilot projects are being undertaken in a number of centres to ensure the best approach to realising these objectives and ensuring greater respect and dignity for those residing in the direct provision system.</p></reply>

The Regulation was introduced as a result of an ongoing review of the Firearms Directive.  The Charlie Hebdo terrorist attacks and later the Paris shootings involved reactivated firearms being used.  This Regulation involves a significant tightening of arrangements across the EU Member States to ensure that standardised arrangements are in place to ensure that deactivated firearms cannot be reactivated for use.</p>  <p>  It consists of a two step process whereby the firearm is firstly deactivated in accordance with the technical requirements of the Regulation followed by an independent verification of this deactivation by a competent authority appointed by Member States within each jurisdiction.  There are currently more than 40 such competent authorities throughout the EU.  The initial first step may still be carried out by a Registered Firearms Dealer in this jurisdiction.  Only such Registered Firearms Dealers persons may carry out this work.  The owner may then choose which competent authority to utilise in order to verify the deactivation.</p>  <p>  Ireland has not appointed a Competent Authority to verify the deactivation of firearms in accordance with this Regulation because there is no significant firearms manufacturing industry in this country and no formal training for a gunsmith is recognised by the State.  However, the Department of Justice and Equality has received statements of interest from five interested parties who wish to be assessed to be appointed as a Competent Authority for the verification of the deactivation of firearms under the regulation.  The applicants are preparing formal applications at present and these shall be assessed upon receipt.  The firearm must then be submitted to any one of the current 46 national competent authorities within the EU for verification and certification.  The Birmingham Proof House has been approved by UK authorities to verify the deactivation of firearms in accordance with the Regulation and they have indicated their willingness to undertake such verification work for Irish customers.</p>  <p>  The possession of any firearm, even after deactivation, will continue to require authorisation by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></reply>

For example, in China the number of short-term visas has increased by 35% in 2015 and by a further 15% this year to date.  Of course these figures only reveal part of the story as a large number of visitor visas have also been granted by the UK authorities for the countries involved enabling these visitors to travel onwards to Ireland.  The volume increases reported by Tourism Ireland bears this out.</p>  <p>  I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that an integral part of the scheme is the utilisation of modern technology and information systems to capture biographical and biometric information for all visa applicants, and the use of joint (with the UK) Visa Application Centres across China and India for the lodgement of visa applications and the initial processing of documentation.  This provides a greater coverage for customers as well as changing the processing procedures in the visa offices.  It also ensured that the operation of Scheme has not incurred a significant additional workload beyond dealing with increased visa application volumes.

The published processing time advertised to applicants is 8 weeks.  The current timescales are due in the main to seasonal pressures coupled with a significant increase in the number of applications in all visa categories.

The Irish Prison Service continues to engage extensively with the Irish Youth Justice Service regarding the transfer of responsibility for 17 year olds to Oberstown Campus in line with the Government decision to close St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution.  The Prisons Act 2015 was passed by the Oireachtas in December 2015 and is a significant step toward the closing of St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution.</p>  <p>  In addition the new Irish Prison Service Strategic Plan 2016-2018, published on 27 June 2016, gives the commitment that the Prison Service will work in partnership with their community partners and the relevant justice and state agencies to agree targeted measures to facilitate the rehabilitation of young offenders (with an initial focus on 18 - 21 year olds) and the effective and safe transition from custody to the community.</p></reply>

The Incentivised Regimes Programme, introduced in 2012, provides for differentiation of privileges between prisoners according to their level of engagement with services and quality of behaviour.  The objective is to provide tangible incentives to prisoners to participate in structured activities and to reinforce good behaviour, leading to a safer and more secure environment.</p>  <p>  All prisoners enter the system on an equal basis at standard regime level.  Prisoners can then work towards advancement to enhanced regime level through positive interaction with prison-based services and by demonstrating consistently good conduct.  Conversely, a prisoner may be moved to basic regime level for breaches of prison discipline or consistent refusal to take part in recommended rehabilitative programmes.  The Incentivised Regimes Programme provides significant motivational factors to encourage prisoners to improve their participation in productive and rehabilitative activities while in custody.</p>  <p>  Experience in other jurisdictions has shown that a tiered incentivised regime structure is a hugely valuable addition to prisons in the context of maintaining good order, and in motivating prisoners to partake in constructive activities.</p>  <p>  I am advised by the Irish Prison Service that the application of the Incentivised Regimes Policy is under continuous review by the Incentivised Regimes Implementation Group.  The Irish Prison Service will shortly commission an independent external review of the Incentivised Regimes Programme which will consider the ongoing effectiveness of the current policy and inform any future development of this programme.</p></reply>

Part 10 of the Act is divided into five Chapters of which Chapter 3, consisting of sections 149 to 153, deals with the duties of legal practitioners in relation to legal costs.  The remaining Chapters of this Part deal with other aspects of the new legal costs regime including the new Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicators that will take over the work currently carried out by the Office of the Taxing-Master along with the way in which the new legal costs adjudication process will operate.  There is no impediment to their taking effect other than that of ensuring, through detailed planning and sequencing, that the relevant legal and administrative arrangements are properly in place within the Courts system and under the new legislative measures.  The Deputies will appreciate that a significant transformation of the existing taxation of costs system is provided for in Part 10 of the Act and that this cannot be done overnight and must be managed carefully - including in terms of having the relevant personnel and expertise in place and given the fundamental legal procedures involved.</p>  <p>  All legal practitioners will be obliged, under the transparency provisions of Chapter 3, to provide more detailed information about legal costs from the outset of their dealings with clients.  This will be in the form of a Notice, written in clear language, which must be provided when a legal practitioner takes instructions.  Among other things, the Notice must disclose the costs that are involved, or, where this is not known, the basis upon which such costs are to be calculated.  A cooling-off period is to be allowed for the consideration of costs by the client. When there are any significant developments in a case which give rise to further costs, the client must be duly updated and given the option of whether or not to proceed with proceedings.  In addition, this Chapter of the Act provides that it will not be permissible for legal practitioners to set fees as a specified percentage or proportion of damages payable to a client from contentious business, and, that it will no longer be permissible for barristers to charge junior counsel fees as a specified percentage or proportion of Senior Counsel fees.</p>  <p>  These provisions complement the accompanying provisions of Part 10 of the Legal Services Regulation Act which provide in Chapter 2 for the changeover to the new Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicators.  Under the enhanced adjudication process that is set out in Chapter 4 of Part 10, aggrieved clients will be able to apply for the adjudication of disputed legal costs under a reformed and modernised framework which will be under the stewardship of a Chief Legal Costs Adjudicator.  This is underpinned by a set of Legal Costs Principles which are set out, for the first time, in Schedule 1 of the 2015 Act.  Moreover, the new Office will maintain a publicly accessible Register of Determinations which will disclose the outcomes and reasons for decisions made by the Legal Costs Adjudicators.  The new Office will also prepare strategic and business plans and annual reports of its activities.  Subject to consultations, the Chief Legal Costs Adjudicator may also from time to time prepare, for the guidance of Legal Costs Adjudicators, legal practitioners and the public, guidelines indicating the manner in which the functions of the Chief and other Legal Costs Adjudicators are to be performed.</p>  <p>  As I have just set out, the five Chapters of Part 10 of the 2015 Act are very much interlinked and their successful commencement will be key to the phased roll-out of that Act which is already underway.  As with other Parts of the Act which will be commenced on a phased basis over the coming period, I am, along with officials at my Department and the Courts Service, giving detailed consideration to the commencement of Part 10.  This includes the possible prioritisation for commencement of sections 149 to 161 contained in Chapter 3  as may be practicable from both a structural reform and a legal perspective.</p>  <p>  It remains my intention to appoint 1st October 2016 as establishment day for the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority which is also expected to have its inaugural meeting early that month.</p></reply>

This circular is available at the website of the Department of Education and Skills <i>www.education.ie</i>.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, vetting for teachers is governed by the provisions of the National Vetting Bureau (Children &amp;amp; Vulnerable Persons) Acts 2012.  The Teaching Council is registered with the National Vetting Bureau of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in respect of providing vetting services for teachers.  The implementation of eVetting solution earlier this year has greatly enhanced the vetting process.  The Teaching Council is operational on the eVetting system and this allows an applicant and the Teaching Council to monitor the progress of a vetting application.</p><p>The current average processing time for vetting applications is less than four weeks.  The primary purpose of the Garda employment vetting service is to seek to ensure the safety of children and vulnerable adults.  Accordingly, the vetting process demands rigorous procedures to safeguard its integrity and to maintain the highest level of confidence by the public and organisations availing of the service.  Any vetting process will take a certain minimum amount of time to complete and, taking into account the importance of measures to protect children and vulnerable adults while providing an effective and efficient service, the current average processing period is not unreasonable.</p><p>It can arise that in respect of some individual applications additional enquiries may be necessary, sometimes from the applicant themselves or from authorities located abroad and, as you will appreciate, the Garda Authorities have no control over such delays as may arise in these circumstances.  This can result in processing times in excess of the average.</p></reply>

Under the programme the Government has pledged to accept a total of 4,000 migrants into the State by the end of 2017, through a combination of the EU relocation mechanism established in 2015 to assist Italy and Greece (which Ireland voluntarily opted into) and the UNHCR-led refugee resettlement programme currently focused on resettling refugees from camps in Jordan and Lebanon.</p>  <p>  Under the Resettlement part of the IRPP, 520 refugees are to be resettled in Ireland by 31 December 2016.  As of yesterday, 377 of these 520 have been admitted to the State.  Sufficient cases were selected during a selection mission to Lebanon earlier this year to fill the rest of the quota of 520.  These cases have been security screened and health screened and are scheduled to arrive in groups between now and the end of October.  In addition to this 520, the Government recently announced it is extending the resettlement programme to take in a further 260 refugees from Lebanon in 2017.</p>  <p>  As regards the EU relocation mechanism, it is well documented that the pace of arrivals under this programme to date has been slower than expected.  The Government is wholly committed to ensuring that Ireland meets its obligations under the EU Relocation mechanism in a timely fashion.  I am pleased to report, therefore, that following a highly productive visit by Irish officials to Greece earlier this year, the frequency and numbers of arrivals has increased and is continuing to improve.  Ireland has to date taken in 69 Syrian people, mostly families.  A further 40 people have been assessed and cleared for arrival and arrangements for their travel to the State are currently being made and last week IRPP officials interviewed a group of 63 people in Athens who, once cleared for travel, are expected to arrive in October.  It is estimated that by the end of 2016 Ireland will have accepted up to 360 people under relocation.  The intention thereafter is to sustain the pace and size of intakes throughout 2017 at the levels required to allow Ireland to meet its commitments within the timeframes envisaged under the EU Relocation Decisions.</p>  <p>  In announcing the IRPP, the Government recognised the importance of prioritising family groups and in addressing the position of unaccompanied children.  A significant number of those who have arrived to date are children with one or two parents.  The position with regard to unaccompanied minors is that Ireland has formally indicated to Greece its desire to accept unaccompanied minors under the relocation mechanism and we now have a commitment from the Greek authorities that Ireland will be receiving the first group of unaccompanied minors later this year.  The next step is for the authorities in Greece to forward case files for those unaccompanied minors they wish to assign for relocation here.  Once these files are received, officials from Tusla - the Child and Family Agency with responsibility for the care of unaccompanied minors in the State - will travel to Greece to assess the needs of those minors and plan for their care and accommodation upon arrival.</p>  <p>  As regards relocations from Italy, some technical issues have arisen with regard to the programme in Italy and Government officials are continuing to work through these with the Italian authorities.</p></reply>

(When a person makes an application for international protection, they are offered accommodation.  While there is no obligation on them to accept this offer, approximately 50% of applicants avail of the accommodation offered.  They are not obliged to remain there and can leave direct provision and indeed return to direct provision as they so require.  In addition, those who refuse the initial accommodation offer can choose to avail of direct provision accommodation at a later date.) <table>    <tr>       <th>Time Period</th>       <th>Number of persons</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>0 &amp;lt; 1 year</td>       <td>1,791</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>&amp;gt; 1 year &amp;lt; 2 years</td>       <td>854</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>&amp;gt; 2 years &amp;lt; 3 years</td>       <td>510</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>&amp;gt; 3 years &amp;lt; 4 years</td>       <td>235</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>&amp;gt; 4 years &amp;lt; 5 years</td>       <td>199</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>&amp;gt; 5 years</td>       <td>659</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total</td>       <td>4,248</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>In order to interpret these figures correctly, it is important to note that they include a number persons who had been granted status to remain in the State and are preparing to move into communities.

The Act provides for the introduction of a single application procedure for international protection which is a key recommendation of the Report.  The single procedure is specifically aimed at addressing the length of time persons spend in the protection process.  The new procedure will significantly streamline and speed up the processing of protection applications and will reduce the length of time that persons spend in the Direct Provision system.  Preparations for commencement of the single procedure are progressing.</p><p>The Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) of my Department is progressing the implementation of recommendations of the Working Group report around access to cooking facilities as well as increasing the living space for direct provision residents.

It will provide for the licensing of all forms of online gambling.  The General Scheme was referred to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality for consideration and observations.  The Joint Committee received 29 submissions and held public hearings following which it issued a report on 6 November 2013 which contained 8 conclusions and was laid before the Houses.  </p><p>The Gambling Control Bill will, as set out in the General Scheme, confer responsibility for all regulatory matters on the Minister for Justice and Equality.  The Minister's functions will include licensing, inspections and prosecutions, and it is envisaged that these functions will be carried out by a body located within the Department of Justice and Equality.  The General Scheme also provides for a dedicated inspectorate to ensure compliance by licence holders with the terms of their licences and with the new legislation generally.</p><p>The Gambling Control Bill will have consumer protection generally as one of its core principles, and it is envisaged that it will include several measures aimed at the protection of vulnerable persons, including children, from risks to their well-being arising from gambling.  The Scheme includes measures that will require licence holders to act in a socially responsible way.  These measures will include controls on advertising, promotions and sponsorship.</p><p>The Deputy may wish to note that the Advertising Standards Authority, in its most recent code published in 2015, included specific provisions relating to the advertising of gambling products.</p><p>It is also worth noting that the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland is currently engaged in a consultation exercise regarding a revision of its General Commercial Communications Code.  This Code will also include specific provisions for gambling operators.</p><p>It would remain the intention to proceed with this legislation at the earliest feasible opportunity and, in that light, I expect that this will be given renewed consideration in the preparation of the next legislation programme.  At the same time, and pending the bringing forward of the main Bill, I have also asked my Department to examine whether there are any individual pressing areas of concern, intended to be dealt with in the Bill, which could be dealt with sooner by separate legislative measures.In support of these efforts the Government has delegated powers of the Minister for Justice and Equality under the gaming and lotteries legislation to me.</p></reply>

I am further informed that the first year cost of recruitment of 314 new members to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on a full year basis is some &euro;6.8 million.  However, as the Deputies will be aware, the distribution of personnel within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is a matter for the Garda Commissioner and I, as Minister, have no direct role in the matter.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge the serious issue of road traffic collisions referred to by the Deputy, and I am mindful of the traumatic impact of serious collisions on those directly affected and their families, as well as the impact of dangerous driving, more generally, on the quality of life of residents in local communities across the country.</p>  <p>  Ireland has, over a number of years, developed a multi-agency approach to road safety through the involvement of a number of agencies working in partnership, under the aegis of a Road Safety Strategy led by my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  Our current Road Safety Strategy covers the period 2013-2020 and seeks to close the gap between Ireland and the safest countries in the European Union and beyond.  Progress in relation to the actions and outcomes set out in this strategy are monitored on an ongoing basis by the Road Safety Authority and the other agencies involved, and overseen at a Ministerial Committee on Road Safety.</p>  <p>  The Deputies are, no doubt, aware of the significant investment in Garda resources currently underway.  This investment is closely associated with delivery on the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021, which sets out key strategic objectives for Roads Policing and will inform and guide An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s road policing plans over the next 5 years.</p>  <p>  Insofar as road traffic enforcement is concerned generally, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Roads Policing Operations Plan 2016 incorporates a programme of high visibility road safety and enforcement operations, carried out in partnership with other state agencies, and is being implemented by each Regional Traffic Superintendent.  The focus of the Plan is on the most vulnerable road user categories of motor cyclists, pedal cyclists, pedestrians and learner permit holders.  Garda operations specifically target road use behaviour known to contribute significantly to collisions, including speeding, driving while intoxicated, and use of a mobile phone.</p>  <p>  Road traffic legislation is also enforced as part of the day to day duties of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Both targeted and general methods of enforcement have a valuable role to play in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's enforcement programme, which targets locations with a view to preventing the commission of offences, detecting errant motorists, changing their behaviour and ultimately reducing death and injuries on our roads.</p></reply>

The Act provides a modern statutory framework to support decision-making by adults with capacity difficulties.  The specific decision-making supports available under the Act to adults with capacity difficulties are decision-making assistants, co-decision-makers and decision-making representatives who will be supervised by the Director of the Decision Support Service.</p><p>Once the relevant provisions of the Act have been commenced, each ward of court who is an adult will be reviewed by the wardship court in accordance with the new system.  A ward who is found to have capacity will be discharged from wardship.  A ward who continues to have capacity needs will be discharged from wardship and offered the decision-making support option most appropriate to his or her needs.</p><p>As the Deputy may also be aware, jurisdiction in Wards of Court matters is vested in the High Court.  Section 4(3) of the Courts Service Act 1998 provides that the Courts Service is independent in the performance of its functions, including the management of the Courts.  Court funds which are held for the benefit of Wards of Court are private funds under the control of the Courts Service which, through its offices in the High, Circuit and District Courts, has responsibility for the management and investment of funds in court.</p><p>However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had inquiries made and the Courts Service has advised that the investment arrangements for all court funds operate under a structured framework.  The Investment Committee of the Courts Service has an advisory role and its main function is to devise investment policy for court funds, oversee the recommendations received from its investment advisors, and to ensure compliance with best practice in the management of court funds.  The Committee comprises members of the judiciary, representatives from the Courts Service and independent members.  The Committee is chaired by the President of the High Court and is also supported by external investment advisors.  The Courts Service also produces annual financial statements and is subject to both internal and external audit.  The audited financial statements are published each year in accordance with the Superior Court Rules and published on the Courts Service website at <i>www.courts.ie</i>.</p><p>Arrangements have been made to carry out an independent review as requested in the Public Accounts Committee in its Report on Wards of Court Funds in July 2015 and the Courts Service has informed me that this review will be completed shortly.  In addition, individual statements on the performance of court funds will be issued.  However, it is important to ensure that data held on each case, such as names and addresses of person's to whom sensitive information is issued, is accurate and up to date and work has commenced to update and verify the information held on the Courts Service tracking systems.  This will be completed by the end of 2016, at which time individual statements will issue.</p></reply>

In addition, the uniform cost per Reserve member is in the region of &euro;1,300.</p>  <p>  I am further advised that the cost of training both recruits and members of the Reserve is subsumed into the overall training costs of the Garda College and is not easily identifiable.

Garda management keep this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.</p><p>I have been informed that there are 783 dedicated Community Police Officers throughout the State.  It is, of course, the case that all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in addressing community policing issues as and when the need arises. In that sense, community policing involves far more than a single unit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, a point highlighted by the Garda Inspectorate in their third report entitled &quot;Policing in Ireland - Looking Forward&quot; in which they stated that community policing is a fundamental policing philosophy and that there is a strong foundation for it in Ireland.</p><p>The Garda Commissioner's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021, published on 9 June 2016, places a strong emphasis on developing and supporting the community policing ethos of the organisation and enhancing the current delivery model so that Garda&iacute; spend more time in the community, gaining public confidence and trust and providing a greater sense of security.</p><p>With regard to the cost of increasing the number of dedicated Community Police Officers  by 100 in any given year, it is not possible to determine the exact cost due to the fact that individual Garda&iacute; are on different points of the salary scale and may be in receipt of various allowances.  However, it is the case that the post of Community Police Officer attracts an allowance of approximately &euro;1,575 per annum. Therefore at a minimum, the cost for 100 extra Community Police Officers would be in the region of &euro;157,500.</p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime. Key to achieving this goal is the commitment in the<font color="#2F2F2F"> &quot;Programme for a Partnership Government&quot; to</font>continue the ongoing accelerated Garda recruitment programme with a view to increasing Garda numbers to 15,000.  Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 will require some 3,200 new Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next four years in addition to the 1,200 that will have been recruited by the end of this year since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014. So far 534 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream uniform duties nationwide. Community policing, and all other Garda activities, will undoubtedly benefit from the resources now coming on stream through the accelerated Garda recruitment programme.</p></reply>

The Joint Agency Task Force is led by the police and revenue services and brings together the relevant law enforcement agencies to better co-ordinate strategic and operational actions against cross-border organised crime.  It involves senior officers from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the PSNI, the Revenue Commissioners and HM Revenue and Customs; it also includes the Criminal Assets Bureau and UK National Crime Agency as well as other interested law enforcement services (such as environmental protection agencies and immigration services).</p>  <p>  One of the advantages of the structure of the Task Force is its flexibility in providing for different agencies to be engaged at an operational level depending on the nature of the operation and requirements for expertise.  In that regard the numbers of personnel involved is variable.  From a Garda perspective the work of the Task Force is embedded into the Garda organisation and can draw, therefore, on the full range of Garda and Criminal Assets Bureau expertise and resources in accordance with operational demands.</p>  <p>  The Joint Agency Task Force has been operational and active since the start of this year and I received the first six-monthly report on its work at my meeting with the Northern Ireland Minister of Justice, Claire Sugden MLA on 4 July.  The report is available on my Department's website.</p>  <p>  The report details the work that has been undertaken in establishing the Joint Agency Task Force as well as the particular areas of cross-border criminal activity that have been the subject of joint operations.  There have, for example, been specific operations targeting rural crime, child sexual exploitation and human trafficking for labour exploitation that have resulted in a number of arrests, the seizure of stolen vehicles, equipment and other goods, cash and drugs and the identification by the Revenue services of unregistered business interests.  In respect of rural crime, there was also a specific focus on awareness-raising and providing crime prevention advice at community level on both sides of the border.</p>  <p>  The report illustrates the positive and proactive approach that the Joint Agency Task Force has taken over its first six months and I commend the work of all of the agencies involved.</p></reply>

Section 89 of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act (CATCA) 2003 provides for 'agricultural relief'. The relief takes the form of a 90% reduction in the taxable market value of the gifted or inherited agricultural property.</p>  <p>  The person taking the gift or inheritance (the 'beneficiary') of the agricultural property must qualify as a 'farmer' for the purpose of section 89 CATCA 2003. This means that a beneficiary's agricultural property must comprise at least 80% by gross market value of the beneficiary's total property at a particular date. Revenue takes the view that land on which solar panels are installed is not agricultural property for the purpose of establishing whether or not a beneficiary satisfies this '80%' test. Thus, depending on the amount of an individual's land that is actually occupied by solar panels, the use of agricultural land for a solar farm may result in a beneficiary's failure to satisfy the '80%' test and to qualify for agricultural relief.</p>  <p>  A condition for agricultural relief that applies in relation to gifts and inheritances taken on or after 1 January 2015 is that a beneficiary, or a lessee where the beneficiary leases the agricultural land, must actually farm the land for a period of at least 6 years after taking the gift or inheritance. As it would not generally be possible to farm any part of the land occupied by solar equipment, the change in the use of land from farming to the generation of solar energy within the required 6-year period would result in a withdrawal of some, or all, of any agricultural relief that had been granted, depending on how much of the land is diverted to this alternative use.</p></reply>

A landlord may claim a deduction for other costs such as maintenance, repairs, insurance, management of the property and any goods provided or services rendered to the tenant.</p>  <p>  A deduction for 75% of the interest paid on borrowed money used to purchase, improve or repair the rented premises is also allowed.  In addition, the Deputy will be aware that in Finance Act 2015 I introduced a new relief to allow 100% mortgage interest deductibility for landlords who undertake, for at least three years, to provide accommodation to tenants in receipt of social housing supports. The relief is designed to improve the stability of housing supply to such tenants, and operates by means of an increase from 75% to 100% in the deductibility of mortgage interest against the landlord's rental income.</p>  <p>  This relief was one element of an overall package of measures designed by the last Government aimed at stabilising rent and boosting supply in the housing market which, in my view, is the most appropriate and effective route to addressing rental price increases driven by supply constraints.  The current Government is continuing this process and, in addition to a commitment to maintain the enhanced tax relief for landlords of tenants in receipt of social housing supports, the Programme for a Partnership Government also contains a number of non-tax commitments relating to increasing the supply of both social and private housing.</p>  <p>  With regard to families with unoccupied properties, it would seem reasonable that in this situation it would normally be more beneficial to rent out the property where possible, even if the rent paid does not cover the relevant mortgage payment.  If the property remained unoccupied, the mortgage payment would still have to be paid without the property generating any rental income.  It should also be noted that in most cases a mortgage repayment contains a capital repayment element in addition to the interest cost.</p>  <p>  To extend relief further to allow a deduction for the full interest and capital cost of a mortgage repayment in addition to other allowable letting expenses, as appears to be suggested in the Deputy's question, would in effect see the State further subsidise the purchase by a private individual of a residential rental investment property. I do not believe that this would be an appropriate use of State resources at this time.</p></reply>

The proposed amendment as published on the 6th of September is intended to apply to profits arising from the business of qualifying companies that involve the holding, managing or both the holding and managing of specified mortgages, including any activities which are ancillary to that business, after 6 September 2016.  Specified mortgages refers to any financial asset that derives its value, or the greater part of its value directly or indirectly, from land in the State.  The part of the section 110 company's business that relates to specified mortgages will be treated as a separate business from any other business the company may carry on and, with certain exceptions, no interest above an arm's length rate will be deductible in computing the taxable profits of that part of the business.</p>  <p>  Targeted measures regarding the use of funds in the Irish property market are also being prepared for my consideration.</p></reply>

A system which allowed, under the OPFTC, multiple claims in respect of the same child was unsustainable.</p>  <p>  The Commission on Taxation acknowledged that the previous One Parent Family Tax Credit played a role in supporting and incentivising the labour market participation of single and widowed parents.  However, in its recommendations it concluded that the credit should be retained but that it should be allocated to the primary carer only. The restructuring of the credit into the SPCCC achieves such an outcome.</p>  <p>  It is possible for a qualifying Primary Claimant to surrender (relinquish) his or her entitlement to the credit in favour of a Secondary Claimant where the child resides with that Secondary Claimant for at least 100 days per year. It should be noted that a Secondary Claimant does not qualify for the SPCCC in his/her own right. Rather it is the primary carer of the child who is entitled to the credit, subject to meeting the qualifying criteria, and, should he/she choose, may subsequently surrender the credit to a Secondary Claimant who has care of the child for at least 100 days in a year. Where the child's primary carer is married, in a civil partnership or cohabiting they would not be entitled to the SPCCC (or indeed the former credit), on the basis that the relevant child is not, in the main, being cared for by a single person. In such circumstances the Primary Claimant cannot relinquish the credit to a secondary carer.</p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that in the case concerned, as the Primary Claimant has remarried, then the Secondary Claimant has no entitlement to the claim.

The VAT rating of goods and services is subject to the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply.  The EU VAT Directive lists goods and services to which Member States may apply a reduced VAT rate in Annex III. As Annex III does not list dog grooming it is not possible under that provision to apply a reduced VAT rate to dog grooming services.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the EU VAT Directive also allows for the continuation of historic VAT rating. Where a Member State applied a zero or reduced VAT rate to a good or service on and from 1 January 1991, they are entitled to retain that historic VAT treatment. However, dog grooming services did not apply at a zero or reduced VAT rate on 1 January and as such it is not possible to apply a reduced or zero VAT rate to the service now.</p>  <p>  This historic reduced VAT rate treatment does apply, however, to the supply of services by a veterinary surgeon, which is liable to VAT at the 13.5% rate because Ireland applied a reduced VAT rate to those services on 1 January 1991.  In this context, where a veterinary surgeon carries out a dog grooming service as part of a veterinary procedure, such as treating an illness or disease, the dog grooming is considered part of the veterinary procedure and the entire procedure is liable to VAT at the 13.5% rate.  However, where a veterinary surgeon provides a dog grooming services as a supply that is distinct from a veterinary procedure the service is liable to VAT at the 23% rate.</p></reply>

Enterprise was selling motor insurance in a number of European countries including Ireland on a freedom of services basis.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank of Ireland has informed me of the following:</p>  <p>  The Central Bank was notified by the GFSC on 22 July that it was taking steps, with the cooperation of Enterprise, to petition for the winding up of the Company.  The GFSC took this action as Enterprise had told the GFSC that the company was insolvent and had not been able to secure additional funding.</p>  <p>  The GFSC also notified the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA), and the relevant financial services regulators and compensation schemes in France, Greece, Italy, Norway, Ireland and the UK, where Enterprise has written business.</p>  <p>  The Supreme Court of Gibraltar appointed Mr. Frederick David John White of Grant Thornton (Gibraltar) Limited as Provisional Liquidator of Enterprise Insurance Company Plc on 25 July 2016.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank has worked closely with the GFSC since 22 July to ensure that all Irish motor policyholders are identified and are communicated with directly.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank issued a press statement on 22 July to alert consumers of the issue and to encourage them to arrange new insurance as soon as possible.  The Central Bank has updated this press statement as necessary.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank has been in on-going contact with and has been onsite in Wrightway Underwriting Limited (Wrightway), the master general agent for Enterprise in Ireland, to ensure that Wrightway is acting in the best interest of the consumers.</p>  <p>  On 27 July the Central Bank contacted the 323 insurance brokers who sold Enterprise products to consumers requiring them to immediately contact any policyholder who holds a current Enterprise motor insurance policy and inform them of the urgency to make alternative motor insurance arrangements. This urgency stems from the fact that any claim made by policyholders who hold active policies with Enterprise, may not be fully covered irrespective of the policy remaining in force. It is noted by the Central Bank that Wrightway has agreed to make an ex gratia payment equal to the value of the premiums from now until the end of the contract term, in respect of any policyholder who holds a current Enterprise motor insurance policy.</p>  <p>  On 12 August the GFSC issued a warning to the public regarding the website "enterpriseinsuranceclaim.com".  This website purports to offer assistance with claims against Enterprise Insurance Company Plc which is currently in provisional liquidation. The Central Bank has alerted the public to this warning via it website.</p>  <p>  The website contains false and misleading information regarding the validity of Enterprise insurance policies and the position of policy holders while the company is in provisional liquidation. There are concerns about the legitimacy of the website and the purpose for which subscriber information will be used. The Central Bank has indicated that policyholders should not rely on statements contained on this website but should instead refer to information issued by the GFSC and the Provisional Liquidator.</p></reply>

This is done through 'passporting' which is the establishment of a branch or operation by way of freedom of services. Passporting is not applied for but notified. In such circumstances, EU insurance legislation puts the onus on domestic supervisors to supervise for prudential purposes this passporting business conducted in other Member States.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank has indicated that supervisory authorities across the European Union cooperate and share relevant information to achieve the objectives of insurance supervision and, in particular, financial stability and adequate protection of policyholders and other stakeholders. The supervision of most insurance companies established in Ireland is conducted within European supervisory colleges where some decision-making is shared with the group supervisor and European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) as per Solvency II.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Central Bank of Ireland that earlier this year it asked the Gibraltar Financial Services Commission to review the Irish motor business of Gibraltar based firms and offered its assistance in that regard, drawing their attention to the Central Bank's Bodily Injury Thematic Review and the increasing cost of claims in Ireland. The Central Bank followed that letter with a visit to GFSC on 7 July 2016.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank's Bodily Injury Thematic Review was published in November 2015.  It reviewed bodily injury claims and reserving data and assessed the extent to which the insurance industry's data reflected the upward trends in frequency and cost of claims up to the end of 2014.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank also discussed the Bodily Injury Thematic Review with its peers at a European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority's Practitioners Day on 'Supervisory aspects of Motor Insurance' on 21 June 2016 and bilaterally with foreign supervisors of insurance firms having significant motor insurance business in Ireland.</p></reply>

Neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products or have the power to direct insurance companies to provide flood cover to specific individuals or businesses.</p>  <p>  Government policy in relation to flooding is focused on the development of a sustainable, planned and risk-based approach to dealing with flooding problems, with a view to addressing the increased availability of flood insurance.</p>  <p>  To achieve this aim the OPW is carrying out assessments of 300 areas under the Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) programme and each area will have a Flood Risk Management Plan (FRMP) by the end of 2016. Decisions on future investment in relation to flood risk management will be informed by the FRMP's. Dublin city is among the 300 areas of further assessment under the CFRAM programme. Work on the preparation of draft Flood Risk Management Plans for the Eastern Region (including Dublin City) is nearing conclusion, and OPW expect to publish the draft plans for public consultation in mid to late September.  </p>  <p>  This strategy is complemented by a Memorandum of Understanding between the OPW and Insurance Ireland which provides for the transfer by the OPW of data in relation to completed flood defence schemes to the insurance industry.</p>  <p>  I have been informed by the OPW that there are no flood protection works currently underway or planned in the East Wall area. The River Tolka Dublin City Flood Defence scheme provided protection to a significant part of the East Wall area of Dublin, mainly on the western side of the Dublin-Belfast railway line, and maps are available on the OPW website showing the protected areas.

The OPW are the lead agency and have responsibility for submitting the final report of the group to Government.</p>  <p>  As an input to the Inter-Departmental Group's work the Department of Finance has carried out a review of flood insurance with a particular focus on the strategies that other jurisdictions have implemented to increase the availability of flood insurance cover. This work examined a number of policy options and has made a number of recommendations.

Since the introduction of Tax Relief at Source (TRS) in respect of mortgage interest payments in 2002, 'interest charged' and 'interest paid' figures generally reconciled in the vast majority of cases over any 12 month period.  In such circumstances, Revenue agreed with lenders to allow the relief on the basis of both 'interest charged' and 'interest paid' for ease of administration.  A key part of the agreement required the lenders to inform Revenue of the exceptional cases where cumulative arrears had built up over an 18 month period.  All such cases were reviewed on a case by case basis and the relief was withdrawn where appropriate.  The 18 month 'review period' was reduced to 6 months in September 2012 in response to the increasing numbers of mortgage arrears cases.</p>  <p>  As the number of arrears cases being reported by the lenders increased, Revenue further reviewed the practice of allowing the relief on both 'interest charged' and 'interest paid' and on the basis of the review, instructed all lenders to only allow TRS in line with the requirements of the legislation with effect from 1 January 2014, i.e. interest paid by the borrower.</p></reply>

In order to meet the market coverage requirements, 3 Irish participants (one life, one non-life and one composite undertaking) had their results submitted to EIOPA.  A further 13 undertakings submitted results for local supervisory purposes.  In total, 16 Irish companies (8 life, 6 non-life and 2 composite undertakings) reported their results to the Central Bank for the Core Module.</p>  <p>  For the Low-Yield module, 11 companies (4 life, 5 non-life and 2 composite undertakings) participated in the low yield exercise and had their results submitted to EIOPA to meet the relevant market coverage requirement for this exercise (50% Market Coverage in terms of Gross Life Technical Provisions). </p>  <p>  The approach taken by EIOPA was to carry out an exercise that focused on impacts and vulnerabilities rather than pass/fail of individual participants.  While 100% Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR) cover on a Standard Formula basis was used as a benchmark, it was not a target level of capital and companies did not "fail" if they did not hold this level of capital before or after stresses</p>  <p>  For the market stress scenarios, Irish participants found the EU equity market stress more severe than the non-financial corporate bond market stress.  This is in line with results from the wider European sample.</p>  <p>  The most severe non-life Single Factor Insurance Stress was the provisioning deficiency stress of 3% (participants were asked to calculate the shortfall for all liability claims reserves based on the assumption of a 3% increase in the inflation rate).  In this respect, the Irish results were also in line with results of the wider European sample.  While longevity and mass lapse stresses were the most severe life stresses across Europe, in Ireland, this depended heavily on the type of business written and no single stress was obviously the most severe.</p>  <p>  For the low yield scenario exercise, it was found that the Irish sample was not particular vulnerable to either of the low-yield stresses.</p>  <p>  Analysis of the 2014 exercise fed into the Central Bank of Ireland's normal supervisory functions and issues identified in the exercise were used to guide a number of firm specific engagements by them in 2015.</p></reply>

This is not currently the case with section 110 companies and therefore tax costings cannot be provided at this time.</p>  <p>  The tax return is designed to capture the information necessary to correctly determine a taxpayer's liability to tax. Certain reliefs are available for taxpayers to claim, and those claims are generally made through a tax return.  Efforts to simplify tax returns has led to some tax reliefs being required in aggregate form on tax returns.  Where it is not necessary to officially 'claim' a relief, it will not generally feature in the tax return.  In the last decade the CT1 form has more than doubled in length to accommodate the myriad scenarios of tax affairs possible.  Continued expansion of the complexity of the CT1 return is not seen as sustainable.</p>  <p>  A number of concerns have been raised recently about the possible use of aggressive tax practices by some section 110 companies to avoid paying tax on Irish property transactions.  In light of these concerns, and due to the highly technical and complex nature of the legislation, I recently proposed an amendment to section 110 Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  This amendment targets the issues that have been raised and will ensure that the Irish tax base is appropriately protected.  Further targeted proposals in relation to the use of funds in the Irish property market are also being considered.</p></reply>

This second target represented an increase of around 150% in the number of &euro;10 notes dispensed from ATMs previously.  These targets were met by the banks on the dates set, as part of their commitment to the broader goal of improving the efficiency of payments in the National Payments Plan.</p>  <p>  Building on the recommendations in the National Payments Plan, the Central Bank has now set targets for the banks to achieve in terms of issuance of &euro;10, &euro;20 and &euro;50 notes from ATMs by 2018.  These targets were calculated following a study of the requirements of consumers given patterns of cash usage.</p>  <p>  The targets are that 6-10% of all notes by volume are to be &euro;10 notes by the end of 2018, 40-45% of all notes by volume are to be &euro;20 notes and 45-50% of all notes by volume are to be &euro;50 notes.  The Central Bank is working, in co-operation with the commercial banks, towards these targets.  The latest available data, for Q2 2016, on amounts actually dispensed shows that 7% of all notes are &euro;10 notes, 35% of all notes are &euro;20 notes and 58% of all notes are &euro;50 notes.  I am informed that this data is collected on a national basis and that it is not possible to provide data on a county-by-county basis.</p>  <p>  By way of additional information, I am also informed by the Central Bank that the commercial banks are in the process of rolling out amended algorithms for their ATM fleet which will provide more choice for customers in relation to the denomination mix of their withdrawals.</p></reply>

Therefore, under the current system a pint of cider and a pint of beer have an equivalent excise rate of &euro;0.54.</p><p>I understand that the Deputy is requesting that the band between 6.0% and 8.5% be removed so that there is one band from 2.8% to 8.5% at rate of &euro;94.46 per hectolitre.  If this band was removed, cider with a strength of 8.5% would only attract excise of &euro;0.54 a pint, while beer of a similar strength would be charged double that amount, &euro;1.09 per pint.  As well as failing to account for the negative health externalities caused by consumption of the products with a higher alcohol content, the price differential would offer an unfair competitive advantage to cider over beer.</p><p>It is recognised however that taxation of cider does not have an ideal structure.  I would inform the Deputy that the European Commission intends to review the Alcohol Tax Products Directive with a view to making any necessary amendments in 2017.  My officials will engage will this review with the intention of securing similar alcohol taxation structures for similar and substitutable alcohol products.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-09-16a.643.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016091600012#WRK02600"><p>I am aware of the report on "Illicit Trade in Ireland 2013-2015", published recently by Grant Thornton, which addresses illicit trade in the sectors referred in the Deputy's Question.</p>  <p>  I understand that the report looks at the costs associated with illicit trade in those sectors.  I would point out, however, that estimating the extent of any illicit activity is inherently problematic and must, therefore, be approached with caution. It follows that, unless a clear and credible methodology is specified for particular estimates of illicit trade and the resulting tax loss, they must be regarded as speculative.  I am advised that the Grant Thornton report itself expressly recognises the difficulties involved in estimating reliably the extent of losses incurred as a result of illicit trade in certain of the sectors which it addresses, or provides only very broad estimations of possible loss.</p>  <p>  I understand also that the report refers to a number of estimates of the loss to the Exchequer arising from the illicit trade in tobacco products.  The extent of this illicit trade is estimated through annual surveys that are carried out for the Revenue Commissioners and the Health Services Executive by Ipsos MRBI.  Assuming that the illegal cigarettes consumed displace the equivalent full tax paid quantity of cigarettes, the results of the survey for 2015 indicate that the loss to the Exchequer in excise duty and VAT was in the order of &euro; 192 million.  Revenue advise me that they are satisfied that this survey is the best indicator of the extent of the market in illicit cigarettes.  This is because of the methodology used and the consistent way in which the survey has been undertaken over a number of years.  It is geographically representative and surveys population samples that are statistically robust.  In addition, this methodology, in contrast to others such as empty pack surveys, is capable of distinguishing between illicit cigarettes and legal personal imports.</p>  <p>  It is, however, accepted by all interested parties that illicit trade in the sectors addressed by the report, and shadow economy activities in general, pose a threat to legitimate and compliant businesses and to consumers, as well as depriving the Government of tax revenues.  Tackling the illegal activities in those sectors, and broader shadow economy activities, is therefore a key priority.</p>  <p>  Revenue's actions against the illicit tobacco trade include a range of measures to identity and target those who are involved in the supply or sale of illicit products, with a view to seizing those products and prosecuting the persons involved.  This multifaceted strategy also includes ongoing analysis of the nature and extent of the problem, development and sharing of intelligence on a national, EU and international basis, use of analytics and deployment of detection technologies.</p>  <p>  Revenue has also implemented a comprehensive strategy to tackle the illegal fuel trade, based on the introduction of stringent new supply chain controls, the very successful implementation from April 2015, here and in the UK, of a new fuel marker developed in cooperation with the UK authorities, and rigorous enforcement action.</p>  <p>  In the case of alcohol, Revenue's action against illicit trade encompasses the full supply chain for alcohol products and includes measures to combat smuggling, the illicit production of alcohol and the sale or supply of illicit products.</p>  <p>  Revenue also acts to detain or seize, at the point of entry to the State, products that are suspected to be illegal or counterfeit medicines.  Products detained by Revenue are passed to the Health Products Regulatory Authority, which is the competent authority for such matters, for analysis, identification and any necessary further action.</p>  <p>  Revenue works closely, as well, with other agencies in the State, including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in acting against illegal activities related to illicit trade.  The relevant authorities in the State also work closely with their counterparts in Northern Ireland to target the organised crime groups that are involved in a range of criminal activities, including the kinds of illicit trade addressed in the Grant Thornton report.  I believe that this work to tackle cross-jurisdictional organised crime is being supported and facilitated by the establishment, in the framework of "A Fresh Start: the Stormont Agreement and Implementation Plan" of the Joint Agency Task Force, which includes Revenue.  There is close cooperation also with the relevant authorities in other jurisdictions, the European Anti-Fraud Office and other international bodies and agencies in the ongoing programmes of action at international level to combat illicit trade.</p>  <p>  I am assured by Revenue that action against illicit trade is, and will continue to be, a central element of their work.  For my part, I have taken action through the Finance Acts over recent years to ensure that Revenue has all the necessary powers to act against these forms of criminal activity and I am satisfied that there is a robust legal framework in place that allows effective action to be taken against those responsible for such crimes.</p>  <p>  Matters relating to digital piracy fall within the remit of my colleague the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.</p></reply>

The amount spent in respect of all these credit cards in 2014 was &euro;13,123.19 inclusive of &euro;13.23 bank interest and &euro;16,927.43 in 2015 inclusive of &euro;1.36 bank interest.</p>  <p>  There are guidelines in place to ensure the appropriate use of credit cards in my Department.  These make it clear to staff that the use of the Departmental credit cards is strictly for business purposes.</p>  <p>  Requests for cards must be sanctioned at senior management level (Assistant Secretary level or above), and a statement outlining the necessity for the card must be provided in relation to any request for the provision of an official credit card.  All cards that are no longer required must be returned to Facilities Management Unit of my Department who arrange the issuing of credit cards and organising payment of monthly bills in respect of official credit cards.</p>  <p>  Each officer who hold an official credit card receives a copy of their monthly statement and is required to certify that all charges incurred are correct and are of an official nature and they need to certify that the appropriate approval had been obtained for the expenditure.  In cases where approval is required by a senior officer, the statement should be countersigned by the relevant senior officer and include receipts, in all cases.  In the event that a receipt cannot be provided, the officer in question is required to provide a detailed explanation of the charge.  A hard copy of the statement, certified as being in order for payment, must be returned to the Facilities Management Unit in order that payment can be made.</p>  <p>  In the case of official entertainment, an entertainment claim form must be completed and approved in accordance with the official guideline governing the amount that may be spent on official entertainment.  A copy of this form must be forwarded to the Facilities Management Unit.</p>  <p>  Occasionally there are requests to use the credit card held specifically by the Facilities Management Unit for purchases of work related goods or services.  The relevant officer needs to complete a credit card application form giving details as to the item being purchased.  The form must be signed off by a senior officer in the section and receipts if available or explanation in respect of the item required and cost must be forwarded to the Facilities Management Unit.</p>  <p>  The rules also cover personal purchases made by an individual officer and require the making of a payment and an explanation as to the reason for the specific purchase.  Significant use of a departmental credit card for personal purposes can result in it being withdrawn.</p>  <p>  Officers may use their personal credit cards for official purposes.  These are more often for travel or accommodation costs incurred as part of official business inside and outside Ireland. Travel and accommodation costs are reclaimed via the core portal system where the expenditure is subject to checking and confirmation by a more senior officer. Invoices are required to be provided and retained to support any such expenses claims.</p>  <p>  Finally I would also point out that expenditure on departmental credit cards are subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General to ensure that correct procedures are being followed in relation to the issue and use of Departmental credit cards.</p>  <p>  Given the small number of credit cards in use and the oversight and controls exercised by my Department I am satisfied that there are appropriate processes and procedures in place to manage expenditure on departmental credit cards.</p></reply>

The legislation provides for an independent, impartial investigation and resolution of disputes between consumers and financial service providers.</p>  <p>  This legislation also provides the Financial Services Ombudsman with various powers in order to determine jurisdiction on a complaint.

However, the issues in this regard are complex involving a range of considerations including the interface with the statute of limitations, existing consumer protection laws, complaints mechanisms and the availability of records. </p>  <p>  This piece of legislation is currently on the 'second list' of the current legislative programme set out by the Office of the Government Chief Whip that is, Bills that are expected to undergo Pre-Legislative Scrutiny this session.  We hope to conclude the legislation shortly.</p></reply>

The standard rate is the VAT rate applied to such products in the majority of EU Member States.</p>  <p>  Some years ago, the Revenue Commissioners Appeal Commissioner ruled in relation to a specific vegetable juice product, that the product in question was food/drink but not a beverage and accordingly should not be excluded from the zero-rate.  The ruling led to uncertainty in relation to the VAT treatment of other drinkable products made from fruit and vegetables.  In this regard, it should be noted that fruit and vegetables are also the main ingredients of most soft drinks which are also subject to the standard VAT rate.</p>  <p>  In order to clarify this position, Finance Act 2007 provided that the supply of fruit juices and vegetable juices would continue to be taxable at the standard VAT rate of 21% (now 23%).  Not ensuring that the supply of fruit and vegetable juices continued to be taxable at the standard VAT rate would have resulted in a possible distortion of competition between producers of what could be considered similar products.  It was necessary to re-establish a level playing field in this market to ensure that a more favourable tax treatment does not apply to one product.</p></reply>

In addition, following recommendations of the report of the Independent Review Panel on Strengthening the Capacity of the Department of Finance (The Wright Report) being implemented, additional resources were added to expand the skill set of the Department. 2014 and 2015 also saw the formation of a Shared Services model for the Civil Service whereby a number of my staff and functions were transferred out of my Department.  All of these circumstances have led to a significant evolution in the structure of my Department.</p><p>This period therefore has seen my Department adapt, realign and enhance our resources in order to achieve our goals, facilitated by the development of an integrated business planning process, which ensures that resources are directed towards key priorities.  The period has also seen continued investment in the roll-out of our ICT strategy as a key enabler to introduce innovation to and transform the way in which we work.</p><p>Furthermore, my Department is committed to the Civil Service Workforce Planning process, has a robust Recruitment and Selection policy which feeds into an ongoing Resource Review managed by HR and directed by the Executive Board.

As a result, there are now over 2 million people in employment for the first time since early 2009.</p><p>- The unemployment rate fell to 8.3 per cent in August, down from a peak of over 15 per cent in early 2012.</p><p>These are some of the most important indicators that my Department and investors currently monitor when assessing the strength of the Irish economy.</p><p>It is important to note that the Central Statistics Office has put together a group of experts to provide guidance on how more relevant indicators could be produced and published alongside the GDP figures in the future.  My Department will be represented on this group. It is expected that this group will publish a report detailing their findings later this year.</p><p>I must also highlight that, given the exceptional nature of these growth figures, the Government will not formulate policy on the basis of these inflated figures.  Rather, policy will continue to be designed on the basis of more normal growth rates such as those recently indicated by my Department, which are in the region of 3&frac12; to 4 per cent growth over the coming years.</p></reply>

Investing on a risk-adjusted commercial basis means that, in respect of each and every investment, there is an expected return for the ISIF from the investment and this expected return is commensurate with the risk involved.</p><p>As a means of validating the commerciality of potential investments, ISIF seeks co-investment by private sector investors.  In cases where ISIF may be the only investor, the ISIF seeks to have the proposed transaction pricing benchmarked against market indicators to establish that the investment is on a commercial basis.</p><p>In terms of economic impact, the key principle underpinning ISIF's investments is &quot;additionality&quot; ISIF is seeking to invest where its money can make a difference and help to generate economic activity that would otherwise not occur.  ISIF's key differentiating features of flexibility, long-term timeframe and being a sovereign partner means that it can fill investment gaps and respond to strategic imperatives in the Irish economy in a way that conventional market financiers may be unable or reluctant to finance.</p><p>In the context of ISIF's investment focus on promoting economic additionality (benefits to GDP which arise as a result of the investment) it seeks to avoid deadweight (where the economic impacts would have been achieved in any event in the absence of the investment) and displacement (where the investment will simply substitute for existing economic activity).</p><p>Copies of ISIF's Economic Impact Reports for the period to end-December 2015 are available on the ISIF website at .  These reports identify the metrics used to measure the economic impact of ISIF investments which include measures such as employment, turnover, exports and Gross Value Added.</p><p>Further detail on ISIF's investment criteria is set out in the Executive Summary of the Fund's Investment Strategy, which is available on the ISIF website at .  The National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act 2014, which established the ISIF on a statutory basis, provides that the ISIF shall review its investment strategy after 18 months of operation.  This review will be conducted in the second half of 2016.</p><p>The Deputy will note that the mandate given to ISIF by the Oireachtas at inception had the effect of making ISIF one of the world's first sovereign development funds with an explicit mandate to assist in the development of its local economy.  This so-called &quot;sovereign development fund&quot; concept is new, which means there is no comparable precedent for operation of such an investment fund and, as a result, ISIF's strategy and approach can be regarded as pioneering.  However, the concept has proven to have significant appeal and many other countries continue to express interest in learning about how ISIF is managing its double bottom line mandate.</p></reply>

These companies are regularly referred to as "re-domiciled PLCs". Typically, this does not involve the shift of substantive activity to Ireland. However, it does mean that corporate profits on worldwide activity are recorded as an income inflow. This has the effect of increasing GNP/GNI and increasing the current account in the balance of payments. However, it has no impact on GDP.</p>  <p>  On the other hand, if a multinational corporation chose to relocate its intangible assets to Ireland, the capital stock of the economy would increase. This would have a positive impact on headline GDP. However, this would not have a direct bearing on employment and wealth creation for Irish citizens unless the relocation was linked to an increase in substantive activity in Ireland. </p>  <p>  It is important to stress that Irish GDP/GNP statistics are produced to meet required international standards and that these activities are correctly included in Ireland's National Accounts and Balance of Payments statistics under the standards set by the UN, the IMF, Eurostat and the ECB. </p>  <p>  Finally, given the globalised nature of the Irish economy and the importance of multinational corporations, it is important to stress that Ireland's economy is highly complex and activity is more volatile than elsewhere. From a policy perspective, the best way to mitigate risks associated with this volatility and complexity is through prudent management of the public finances and by adopting competiveness-oriented policies. That is what the Government will continue to do.  </p></reply>

Instances where companies may overpay preliminary tax can arise due to a broad range of reasons.  However, the main reason for overpayments of preliminary tax is that companies must estimate their expected profits before the end of accounting period when calculating preliminary tax.  For example, for companies with a tax liability not exceeding &euro;200,000, in the previous accounting period, preliminary tax is payable in one instalment 31 days before the end of the accounting period.  However, Finance (No.2) Act 2008 provides for the payment of preliminary tax by large companies with a tax liability of more than &euro;200,000, in the previous accounting period, in two instalments, payable in the sixth month of the accounting period and in the eleventh month of the accounting period. </p>  <p>  Profits may deviate from forecasts for a number of reasons, if for example trading conditions improve or a company's circumstances change.   </p>  <p>  Finally, I am informed by Revenue there is no basis on which to estimate the final amount by which corporation tax preliminary tax may be overpaid in the current year or when it may be reclaimed. On occasion, Revenue case managers become aware of issues that lead to repayments and this is shared, without revealing the identity of the particular companies affected, with my Department to assist with forecasting and Exchequer reporting.</p></reply>

Section 960EA also stipulates that the transaction costs required by the necessary service providers, i.e. the merchant acquirer and the technical connection support, can be passed to the taxpayer. This is consistent with the approach adopted by other Revenue administrations.</p><p>Revenue currently applies a transaction fee of 1.1% to all tax payments made by credit card. The fee was until very recently (July 2016) administered under the terms of a Local Government Management Agency (LGMA) agreement with service providers in respect of Public Sector payments (not just Revenue payments). The fee covers the service providers' costs only and Revenue does not gain any financial advantage from the charge. The terms of the LGMA's agreement with the service providers allowed for a reduction in cost depending on the volume and value of transactions processed. This facilitated a reduction in fees from 1.49% to 1.1% in October 2014. </p><p>Since July 2016 Revenue is operating its credit card payment option under the terms of a new Public Service level contract, which was negotiated with the relevant service providers by the Office of Government Procurement. The new contract also facilitates reductions in transaction fees based on value and volume and Revenue is optimistic that further reductions to the 1.1% rate can be achieved in the short to medium term. </p><p>The following table sets out the total number of credit card payments and transaction charges for 2012 to 2016 (year to date). <table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Transactions</th><th>Charges</th></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>9,084</td><td>&euro;166,447.95</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>301,674</td><td>&euro;1,006,805.14</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>119,096</td><td>&euro;635,721.58</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>120,682</td><td>&euro;605,099.20</td></tr><tr><td>2016(YTD)</td><td>63,147</td><td>&euro;301,209.37</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>613,683</td><td>&euro;2,715,283.24</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The Act does not prohibit the granting of credit to such persons.</p>  <p>  However, the granting of credit to a person in an insolvency arrangement or who has completed one, is a commercial decision for each lender institution concerned. This decision must also safeguard the interests of the borrower and the Deputy will be aware that there are a number of legislative provisions in place to ensure that a lender properly assesses the ability of the borrower to repay the debt.  </p>  <p>  The person concerned may wish to make a formal complaint regarding this matter to the bank in question and the Central Bank's Consumer Protection Code 2012 sets out timeframes within which a regulated entity must respond to complaints. If a customer has made a formal complaint to the financial service provider in question and is not satisfied with the outcome, I would suggest that they make a complaint to the Financial Services Ombudsman who may investigate a failure or refusal to provide a service. Investigations by the Financial Services Ombudsman are free of charge to the customer.</p>  <p>  If the person is a business, the Credit Review Office may be able to assist. The Office helps SME or farm borrowers who have had an application for credit of up to &euro;3 million declined or reduced by the main banks, and who feel that they have a viable business proposition. They also examine cases where borrowers feel that the terms and conditions of their existing loan, or a new loan offer, are unfairly onerous or have been unreasonably changed to their detriment. This is a strictly confidential process between the business, the Credit Review Office and the bank. The Credit Reviewer and his team have overturned more than 50% of the refusals that have been appealed to the Office. Further details are available at www.creditreview.ie.</p></reply>

As part of this, the merit of extending the forecast horizon applied by the European Commission when implementing this methodology, from two years, as current practice dictates, to four years, is currently under review. At present, the three and four year ahead forecasts are determined soley by mechanical rules. Effectively, this proposal places greater weight on judgemental as opposed to such purely mechanical estimates for three and four-year ahead forecasts. </p>  <p>  Discussion on this issue are continuing at technical level in the Output Gap Working Group, which is a sub-group of the Economic Policy Committee. At this stage, consensus across a range of technical aspects remains to be achieved. </p>  <p>  At a technical level my Department is broadly in favour of the proposal. Adopting this proposal would ensure consistency across Member States' application of the methodology. As a result, greater ex-ante certainty around the evaluation of public finances could be achieved. In this context, it should be noted that my Department's three and four year-ahead forecasts are in line with the current practice approach used by the Commission.  Consequently, differences in estimates of the structural balance due to horizon mismatch between my Department and the Commission has not arisen. In contrast, a discrepancy between how other Ministries and the Commission apply this methodology motivated the 8 signatories of the 18 March letter addressed to Vice President Dombrovskis and Commissioner Moscovici. </p>  <p>  An extension of the forecast horizon used by the Commission would also have the added benefit of improving how structural reforms are assessed.  However, there are also drawbacks to a longer time horizon. These warrant careful consideration and include difficulties associated with producing accurate economic forecasts at longer time-horizons, and the increased scope for introducing bias into the forecasts. </p>  <p>  My officials continue to engage at technical level along the above lines on these important issues. Furthermore, the Chief Economist of my Department is chair of the Output Gap Working Group where these technical discussions are taking place. </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to advocate for improvements in the harmonised methodology and will continue to engage constructively in ongoing discussions on this and other relevant technical issues. </p></reply>

These charges could negate any potential savings arising from a potential early repayment.</p>  <p>  In addition, the early repayment of programme loans to the IMF, EFSF, EFSM, United Kingdom, Sweden or Denmark would also trigger automatic mandatory proportional early repayments to each of the other programme funding partners unless, as was the case with the IMF early repayment, the other lenders agreed to waive the mandatory proportional early repayment clause.  A condition of the agreement to waive this clause in the case of the early IMF repayment was that Ireland retains a significant element of IMF funding in order to maintain the IMF's participation in post-programme monitoring for the duration initially envisaged, which is out to 2021.</p>  <p>  It is important to point out that, while Ireland along with other euro area countries, is currently experiencing historically low interest rates on new borrowings, the vast majority of our EU-IMF borrowings are either at fixed interest rates or are less expensive on a like-for-like basis. Therefore, there would be no immediate saving notwithstanding the points raised earlier in this answer. For example, the two main lenders, EFSF and EFSM have higher credit ratings than Ireland which means they can borrow at less expensive interests rates compared to Ireland. We receive these monies at cost.</p>  <p>  My Department, in conjunction with the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA), will always seek to avail of any appropriate opportunity for savings on the cost of our EU-IMF programme loans and the matter is being kept under ongoing review. </p></reply>

The Central Bank sought to conduct a broad examination of tracker mortgage-related issues covering, among other things, transparency of communications with and contractual rights of tracker mortgage borrowers.</p>  <p>  This review is now underway, and the Central Bank is working with the banks to conduct a comprehensive examination of customer mortgage accounts with regard to tracker rates, including any instances where banks may have failed to deliver on their obligations to customers. Such instances may include cases where the bank was not sufficiently clear with customers on their terms and conditions, or where they have failed to honour contractual commitments.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank has laid out a detailed and rigorous process for each institution to follow. The identification of affected customers, implementation of any appropriate rectification actions, as well as the calculation of any appropriate interest redress or compensation, are all processes currently being worked through by the banks. The review also involves oversight of each bank's work by an independent  third party, and the establishment of an independent appeals process. Further, the Central Bank continues to review and monitor each institution's progress at every stage. It is possible that different banks will progress through the review process at different speeds.</p>  <p>  I expect that the Central Bank, and each of the institutions involved, will provide information periodically on steps taken and progress made. The tracker mortgage review is an ongoing process involving the banks, their regulator and any affected customers; I have no direct role in its implementation. It is therefore not possible, nor appropriate, for me to speculate at this time on the number of customers that may be affected.</p>  <p>  For completeness, I have requested a brief update from each of the banks in which the State is a shareholder:</p>  <p>  AIB</p>  <p>  "AIB is conducting a comprehensive review of customer mortgage accounts with regard to tracker rates. AIB s review which is progressing, has found the bank fell short on its obligations to some customers. In order to prevent further detriment for the customers identified to date, AIB has in the first instance begun correcting interest rates on these accounts and writing to customers to outline their new interest rates and repayment amounts.</p>  <p>  As the review progresses, AIB will later in the year commence refunding customers who overpaid interest and will also pay compensation. At that point, details of a set payment towards the cost of independent professional advice will also be made available to customers and the bank will have established an independent appeals process. An independent third party, KPMG, will review key aspects of AIB s work.

The first of these was a "Financial Stability Contribution" (FSC) linked to a credible and effective resolution mechanism. The main component of the FSC would be a levy to pay for the fiscal cost of any future government support to the sector. In relation to any further desired contribution from the financial sector the IMF said it should be raised by a "Financial Activities Tax" (FAT) levied on the sum of the profits and remuneration of financial institutions, and paid to general revenue.</p>  <p>  In its 2010 report to the G-20 the IMF suggested three forms of FAT. The IMF considered that the revenue potential of the various forms of FAT would differ across countries, depending on the relative size, profitability and wage structures of their financial sectors, and would be constrained by the need to apply low rates where the impact on competitiveness or the risk of avoidance were of concern. The IMF report indicated very broad orders of magnitude for the potential tax base of the suggested forms of FAT for the pre-crisis year 2006. In respect of Ireland, the broad orders of magnitude estimated for the base were 8.4% of GDP, 5.7% of GDP and 1.8% of GDP respectively for the three different forms of FAT in 2010 but the base is likely to be different  now. The potential yield would of course depend on the tax rate applied. In the absence of further detailed work it would not be possible to estimate the amount to be raised by a FAT. There is no evidence that any state has adopted the FAT proposed by the IMF.</p>  <p>  In Ireland we have a tax on financial transactions in the form of a Stamp Duty on transfers of shares in Irish incorporated companies. This currently stands at 1%. The yield from this charge in 2015 was &euro;424.13 million and is estimated to yield &euro;498 million in 2016. </p>  <p>  The Financial Institutions Levy I announced as part of Budget 2014 is a revenue raising measure which provides for a contribution from the banking sector to Ireland's economic recovery. The levy is in place for the years 2014 to 2016 inclusive with an anticipated annual yield of &euro;150 million. As the levy is a percentage of an institution's DIRT liability in 2011, liability to the levy relates to the size of an institution's Irish operation. The entire banking system has been underpinned by the strong Government support provided both here and abroad and I believe it is appropriate therefore that the banking sector should make a contribution to the State's economic recovery. Accordingly, I announced in my Budget 2016 statement that I propose to extend the levy out to 2021. This will bring in an additional &euro;750 million over the period, which is a very significant additional contribution to the Exchequer.</p></reply>

It should also be noted that information on USC is classified based on a taxpayer's primary income source, being either PAYE income or Schedule D.  Schedule D income includes both self-employed income and many sources of unearned income including rental income taxable under Schedule D Case V.  Data is therefore not available in such a manner that enables a breakdown to be provided for the USC collected in the level of detail requested by the Deputy beyond the PAYE / Schedule D split as shown in the table below.<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>PAYE &euro;M</th><th>Schedule D &euro;M</th></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>2,744</td><td>370</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>3,367</td><td>423</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>3,447</td><td>483</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>3,171</td><td>476</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>3,640</td><td>534</td></tr></table></p><p>The estimated yield from USC for 2016 and 2017 is set out in the following table:<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>PAYE &euro;M</th><th>Schedule D &euro;M</th></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>3,540</td><td>500</td></tr><tr><td>2017*</td><td>3,485</td><td>445</td></tr></table></p><p>*This estimate is based on current USC rates and bands, and does not take into account any changes to USC which may be made in Budget 2017. It should also be noted that it is expected that &euro;220 million of USC receipts for 2017 may be delayed into 2018 due to Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) requirements.</p><p>In relation to abolishing the USC for all Income Earners, I am advised by Revenue that the estimated first and full year cost to the Exchequer would be in the order of &euro;3,330 million and &euro;4,040 million respectively.</p><p>As regards abolishing USC for all PAYE Income Earners, I am advised by Revenue that the estimated first and full year cost to the Exchequer would be in the order of &euro;2,885 million and &euro;3,240 million respectively. </p><p>Following clarification of the final question with the Deputy's office, I am advised by Revenue that the estimated first and full year cost to the Exchequer from abolishing USC on all income under &euro;90,000, with USC at current rates as set out in Budget 2016 to apply on the portion of income above &euro;90,000 where relevant, is in the order of &euro;2,580 million and &euro;3,020 million respectively.</p><p>These figures provided in response to the second, third and fourth questions are estimates from the Revenue tax forecasting model using latest actual data for the year 2014, adjusted as necessary for income, self-employment and employment trends in the interim.

This would require ex ante knowledge of any behavioural changes on the part of taxpayers as a consequence. In terms of any increase in the 12.5% rate, the negative impacts of behavioural effects on the corporation tax yield are likely to be relatively significant.  Additionally, due to the interaction of reliefs and allowances after the calculation of gross tax at the various corporation tax rates, it is not possible to identify the amount of receipts that are in respect of profits taxable at the 12.5% rate alone. However, I am advised by Revenue that the vast majority of the net receipts are from the 12.5% rate of tax.</p><p>The Deputy may wish to note the published statistics regarding corporation tax receipts available on the Revenue website at . The Deputy may also wish to note that an analysis of the Corporation Tax payments in 2014 and 2015 has been published via the following link and further information on corporate profits, before allowing credits and reliefs are published at . </p><p>In 2014 the Department of Finance carried out and commissioned extensive research which sought to quantify the effect of corporation tax policy on the Irish economy.  The comprehensive Economic Impact Assessment of Ireland's Corporation Tax Policy was published on the Department's website on Budget day.  As part of this project, the Economic and Social Research Institute ('ESRI') were commissioned to carry out a study into the impact that the corporation tax rate has on the decision of firms to invest in Ireland.  This independent research found that if Ireland had increased the 12.5% corporation tax rate it would have considerably reduced the amount of Foreign Direct Investment ('FDI') into Ireland.  </p><p>The maintenance of the standard 12.5% rate of corporation tax is therefore important for Ireland's economy. Ireland, like other smaller member states, is geographically and historically a peripheral country in Europe.  A competitive corporate tax rate is a tool to address the economic limitations that come with being a peripheral country, as compared to larger core countries.  Ireland's corporation tax rate plays an important role in attracting FDI to Ireland and thereby increasing employment here.  This evidence underpins the Government's continued commitment to the 12.5% rate.  </p></reply>

Although an individual's assets and liabilities are declared to the Revenue in a number of specific circumstances (for example, after a death), this information is not a complete measure of financial assets in the State, nor is it recorded in a manner that would allow analysis of the implications of an overarching wealth based tax.</p>  <p>  As part of the research programme agreed between the Department of Finance and the ESRI covering macroeconomic and taxation issues, a research project involving detailed analysis of wealth distribution and taxation has been included. Officials from both institutions are currently analysing the components of the wealth held by Irish households, using data available from the CSO's Household Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS) which was collected in 2013 and which the CSO made available to my department earlier this year. The research will enhance understanding of the distribution and composition of wealth in Ireland and will explore various wealth tax scenarios for the purposes of better-informed policy making.  The research project is ongoing and it is intended that the results will be ready for presentation at the Department's annual Tax Policy Conference in November 2016. </p></reply>

Chairs have been appointed to these sub-groups and work has already commenced.  The sub-groups will be holding their second meeting in the coming days, and it is proposed that they meet regularly.  The outputs of these sub-groups will feed into the meetings of the Working Group.</p><p>The Working Group has held two meetings to date, on 20<sup>th</sup>July and 1<sup>st</sup>September.  It will hold its third meeting on 15<sup>th</sup>September.  Further meetings are scheduled for every two to three weeks to the end of 2016.  </p><p>The consultation process has commenced.  Minister of State Murphy has had informal meetings with representatives from a number of key stakeholders including:</p><p>Insurance Ireland, AA Ireland, the Irish Brokers Association, the Injuries Board, IBEC, FBD Insurance, and the Central Bank of Ireland.</p><p>The Working Group and the four sub-groups will also meet with the relevant stakeholders.  At its meeting this week, the Working Group will meet with representatives from the Law Society, AA Ireland, and possibly a couple of other relevant stakeholders depending on their availability.  In addition, submissions received from all interested parties will be considered as part of the process. </p><p>By the end of October, the Working Group will provide me with an update report which will set out the priority actions required.  From November to December, the Working Group will develop an action plan to enable the relevant Government Departments and Offices to commence the implementation of these priority actions. In this regard, the Chair will be consulting regularly with Government colleagues.</p></reply>

The Government disagrees profoundly with the Commission's analysis and will now challenge the Commission's decision before the European Courts. This is necessary to appeal this case to defend the integrity of our tax system; to provide tax certainty to business; and to challenge the encroachment of EU state aid rules into the sovereign Member State competence of taxation.</p>  <p>  This is a legal process that could take several more years to conclude.  It is therefore not possible to provide a comprehensive estimate of expected further expenses at this time.  As it is an important issue for the State, the case will continue be appropriately resourced.</p></reply>

These indicators are closely monitored by investors, analysts, credit rating agencies and others and it is the ongoing recovery that is the most important factor behind the restoration of Ireland's international reputation.</p>  <p>  It is also important to note that while the figures are heavily distorted by a relatively small number of very large multinationals, they are compiled in accordance with best international practice and statistical standards.  They measure what they are supposed to measure this is an important message that should be communicated internationally.  But what is also clear is that in a small, open and very globalised economy such as Ireland, it is clear that the relevance of these figures   as a metric by which underlying economic trends and changes in living standards can be assessed   is considerably less than elsewhere.</p>  <p>  With this in mind, the Central Statistics Office has put together a group of experts to provide guidance on how more relevant indicators could be produced and published alongside these figures in the future. My Department will be represented on this group. It is expected that this group will publish a report detailing their findings later this year.</p></reply>

The second, referred to a 'favourite nephew or favourite niece relief', applies the higher Group A tax-free threshold for CAT liability, normally applied to gifts or inheritances between parents and children, to a niece or nephew in certain circumstances. Both reliefs may apply to the same gift or inheritance. </p><p>Section 89 of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act (CATCA) 2003 provides for agricultural relief. The relief takes the form of a 90% reduction in the taxable market value of the gifted or inherited agricultural property.</p><p>To qualify for the relief the person taking the gift or inheritance (the 'beneficiary') of the agricultural property must qualify as a 'farmer' for the purpose of section 89 CATCA 2003. This means that a beneficiary's agricultural property must comprise at least 80% by gross market value of the beneficiary's total property at a particular date. In addition, for gifts and inheritances taken on or after 1 January 2015 a beneficiary, or a lessee where the beneficiary leases the agricultural land, must actually farm the land for a period of at least 6 years after taking the gift or inheritance.</p><p>The relationship between the person who provides the gift or inheritance (i.e. the disponer) and the beneficiary determines the maximum tax-free threshold known as the 'Group threshold' below which gift or inheritance tax does not arise. There are, in all, three separate Group tax-free thresholds based on the relationship of the beneficiary to the disponer.</p><p>Group A: &euro;280,000 - applies where the beneficiary is a child (including adopted child, step-child and certain foster children) or minor child of a deceased child of the disponer. Parents also fall within this threshold where they take an inheritance of an absolute interest from a child.</p><p>Group B: &euro;30,150 - applies where the beneficiary is a brother, sister, a nephew, a niece or lineal ancestor or lineal descendant of the disponer. </p><p>Group C: &euro;15,075 - applies in all other cases.</p><p>Any prior gift or inheritance received by a beneficiary since 5 December 1991 from within the same Group threshold is aggregated for the purposes of determining whether any tax is payable on the current benefit. Tax at the rate of 33% is payable on any excess received over the relevant tax-free threshold.</p><p>Ordinarily, a nephew or niece of a disponer is entitled to the Group B tax-free threshold of &euro;30,150. However, a nephew or niece who has worked substantially on a full-time basis for a period of five years prior to the gift or inheritance in carrying on, or assisting in the carrying on, the trade, business or profession of the disponer is entitled to the Group A tax-free threshold of &euro;280,000 for the purposes of computing the tax payable on any gift or inheritance received by him or her of those business assets. This relief is known as favourite nephew or favourite niece relief and applies equally to a nephew or a niece who satisfies the conditions for the relief.</p><p>This specific relief is targeted at gifts or inheritances of business assets<b></b>in circumstances where the nephew or niece has, by their continued presence on a weekly basis, placed their labour and expertise at the disposal of the disponer thereby ensuring that material benefit is conferred on the business. The relief is designed to ensure that, in those circumstances, the higher Group A tax-free threshold of &euro;280,000 is available to the deserving nephew or deserving niece.  </p><p>This means that, provided a nephew or niece satisfies the relevant conditions, they could inherit a farm from an aunt or an uncle and qualify for both agricultural relief and favourite nephew or favourite niece relief on that transfer. Assuming the nephew or niece has no previous gifts of inheritances under the Group A tax-free threshold since 5 December 1991, they could potentially inherit a farm from an aunt or uncle with a value of up to &euro;2,800,000 without any liability to CAT arising.</p></reply>

Revenue co-operates extensively with, inter alia, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and HM Revenue and Customs in Northern Ireland through cross-Border enforcement groups to target those that are involved in such activities.</p><p>I am also advised that the number of intermediate bulk containers, IBCs, of waste from diesel washing dumped in counties, Louth, Monaghan and Donegal have reduced significantly since the Accutrace s10 marker was introduced as evidence in the data set out in the following table.<table><tr><th>Period</th><th>Monaghan</th><th>Louth</th><th>Donegal</th></tr><tr><td>Jan  July 2015</td><td>186</td><td>239</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Jan  July 2016</td><td>11</td><td>69</td><td>0</td></tr></table></p><p>Revenue is satisfied with the effectiveness of the new marker introduced  in Ireland and the UK on the 01/04/2015. A national random sampling programme of fuel licence holders was conducted by Revenue in 2016 with a view to quantifying the extent to which laundered road diesel was evidenced among approximately 200 licensed fuel outlets.  No evidence of the new marker was found in any of the traders sampled and affirms the effectiveness of the various measures introduced by Revenue over recent years, including the Accutrace s10 marker. Additionally, no fuel laundering plants have been detected in the State since the introduction of the marker and no arrests have been made for fuel laundering in the period.</p><p>The work to tackle cross-jurisdictional organised crime such as diesel laundering is supported and reinforced by the establishment, in the framework of A Fresh Start, the Stormont agreement and implementation plan, of the joint agency task force, which includes Revenue. In this context, the development of strategic and tactical plans has been agreed by all key stakeholders to further support effective action against cross-Border excise fraud. This interagency national and international co-operation is complemented by Revenue's use of intelligence gathering, risk profiling and effective intervention programmes to counter the threat posed by criminal activities such as fuel fraud.</p><p>Over the past number of years Revenue has implemented a number of strategies against fuel fraud,  underpinned by an extensive and effective legislative framework to maximise the impact on the illegal operations referred to in the Deputy's question. I am satisfied that the current legislative framework provides an effective basis for action by Revenue against fuel offences, and I am assured by Revenue that action against such activities continues to be a key focus of its work.</p></reply>

For example, during 2015 it agreed almost 8,500 phased agreements covering approximately &euro;96m of tax debt. </p><p>However, any such engagement is predicated on open and honest discussion by the taxpayer/business, including a willingness to identify and agree a realistic payment arrangement.

The four categories to which a deferral (or partial deferral) could apply were agreed as, Income Threshold, Personal Representative of a Deceased Person, Personal Insolvency and Hardship Grounds.  In excess of 30,000 property owners availed of the various deferral options in 2016.</p>  <p>  There are a number of criteria that must be met to qualify for a deferral but in the main the income of the individual must be below &euro;15,000 for a full deferral and below &euro;25,000 for a partial deferral (&euro;25,000 and &euro;35,000 thresholds apply for couples).  These thresholds, which can be increased by 80% of gross mortgage interest payments, were recommended by the interdepartmental group report based on analysis by the ESRI.</p>  <p>  Part 12 of the LPT Act clearly sets out the meaning a deferral of LPT and the qualifying criteria that must apply.  The law also clearly sets out that deferral is not an exemption and that the tax becomes payable at a later date.  Part 12 (Section 137) also clearly states that the deferred amount remains as a charge on the property until paid and generates an interest calculation (Section 131) of 4% per annum.  I should point out that the 4% interest rate is half of the standard rate of 8% that applies to the late payment of LPT.</p>  <p>  Following his 2015 review of LPT, Dr Thornhill recommended that the deferral options should continue to apply and that the relevant income thresholds be revised periodically in line with changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI).  Dr Thornhill also recommended that for owner-occupiers aged 80 years or over and also for those with stated certified long term illnesses and disabilities who are living alone, that consideration be given to raising the eligible income limit for deferrals to &euro;20,000.  My Department will be considering issues relating to the implementation of this and other recommendations made by Dr Thornhill in due course.</p>  <p>  Finally, where a liable person does not qualify for or does not wish to avail of a deferral there are a wide number of phased payment options available to assist with budgeting.  The various options are designed to provide the maximum possible flexibility for individual circumstances.</p></reply>

The purpose of the CUAC is to advise the Minister for Finance on Credit Union issues and all meetings are held in the Department of Finance.  </td></tr><tr><td>Credit Union Restructuring Board (ReBo)</td><td>The Credit Union Restructuring Board (ReBo) does not communicate with households.</td></tr><tr><td>Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal</td><td>The Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal (DDMBA) does not currently use Eircode for its correspondence with households via An Post.</td></tr><tr><td>Financial Services Ombudsman Bureau</td><td>Progress made to date:<br /><br />- All printed material to issue from FSOB with postal address into the future now contains Eircode<br /><br />- Internal case management system releases are reviewed to identify postal address capture, and Eircode fields added<br /><br />- On-line complaints forms prompt inclusion of Eircode <br /><br />Future plans:<br /><br />The FSOB will be completing its review of all IT and communications systems over the course of 2016 to confirm all issued materials containing contact details, as well as all data entry points (internal and service user), include Eircode capture.</td></tr><tr><td>Financial Services Ombudsman Council</td><td>As per the Financial Services Ombudsman Bureau (FSOB) reply.</td></tr><tr><td>Investor Compensation Company Limited (ICCL)</td><td>ICCL has two data sources for their database of addresses: <br /><br />- Central Bank official registers for participant firms (not within ICCL control);<br /><br />- Claimant submissions (within ICCL control).<br /><br />With regard to the Claimant submissions, ICCL systems are developed to facilitate the receipt and recording of Eircode details for claimants if supplied to them, they do not mandate the requirement for the Eircode.<br /><br />For the participant firm data, ICCL are dependent on the CBI data stream.  The CBI have started to record Eircode for authorised firms.  ICCL automatically update their records in this regard on receipt from the CBI data stream.</td></tr><tr><td>Irish Bank Resolution Corporation</td><td>IBRC (in Special Liquidation) have recently moved to a new premises in Kings Building, Church Street, Dublin 7 and have applied for an Eircode, this application is currently being processed.<br /><br />In relation to IBRC (in Special Liquidation) correspondence with households, they record Eircodes as and when they are made aware of them from households.</td></tr><tr><td>Irish Financial Services Appeals Tribunal (IFSAT)</td><td>IFSAT does not use the Eircode as of yet however it is the intention of the Tribunal to use the Eircode once they have secured new office accommodation (currently in progress).</td></tr><tr><td>Irish Fiscal Advisory Council</td><td>IFAC shares the same building as the ESRI and note the ESRI's Eircode.</td></tr><tr><td>National Asset Management Agency</td><td>NAMA is progressing the implementation of Eircode. The Eircode reference has been included in contact details on the NAMA website and staff will be advised to include the eircode as part of their email signatures. <br /><br />Similarly, NAMA will engage with facilities in relation to headed paper etc.  You will appreciate that NAMA is currently working through its existing stock of collateral and it wouldn't be appropriate to dispose of these given the costs involved.</td></tr><tr><td>National Treasury Management Agency </td><td>The National Treasury Management Agency has ensured that all key systems are either currently provisioned for Postcode/Eircode data entry or are planned to be so provisioned. The NTMA would have limited communication with households via An Post, primarily this would be through Human Resources. The new My HR system which has been recently launched facilitates the use of Eircode. </td></tr><tr><td>Office of the Revenue Commissioners</td><td>Revenue advise that currently, about 60% of postal addresses in Revenue's database of individual and business customers have the appropriate Eircode. Revenue's customers can have the Eircode included on their Revenue record either via the MyAccount facility or when they file a return either online or in paper. All Local Property Tax correspondence from Revenue includes the Eircode where Revenue has that information. <br /><br />Revenue has been extending the facility to provide the Eircode via its tax returns and other forms (paper and online, English and Irish) on a rolling basis since Quarter 3 of 2015. Thus far, 52 separate forms provide the facility to update the Eircode. This is an ongoing programme of work as evidenced, for example, by the fact that a further 4 forms will include that facility this month. Revenue estimates that it has to date issued 1.6million pieces of correspondence which include an Eircode since Eircodes were introduced.</td></tr><tr><td>Social Finance Foundation</td><td>The CEO of the Social Finance Foundation has advised that as they are a wholesale provider of funds, they do not communicate with households directly. <br /><br />The SFF does, however, include the Eircode on the header of any communication sent out and on the footer of electronic communication.</td></tr><tr><td>Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland</td><td>The SBCI gathers data from SMEs to assess their eligibility for SBCI funding and to meet the reporting requirements of its funders.  This information is gathered through the SBCI's Loan Portal which has been deployed to its on lending partners.  The information about the SME required as part of a loan application includes: name, address, county and NUTS code.  <br /><br />The SBCI has upgraded the Loan Portal to also request the Eircode for each SME, however, this is not a mandatory field. The SBCI cannot enforce the capture of this information as the data required for each SBCI loan application is specified in the original lending agreements with its on lenders. <br /><br />The SBCI intends to encourage its on lenders to capture the Eircode of SMEs going forward.</td></tr><tr><td>Tax Appeals Commission</td><td>The Tax Appeals Commission has incorporated its Eircode reference into all its stationery, business cards etc. and also on its website. The Tax Appeals Commissioners use their Eircode on all correspondence with parties with whom they communicate and also use Eircodes provided by third parties as appropriate when communicating with them. </td></tr></table></p></reply>

The revised criteria include properties where:</p>  <p>  1. a certificate of damage has been completed by a competent person as set down in I.S. 398-1.2013 or,</p>  <p>  2. the property has been accepted into the pyrite remediation scheme operated by the Pyrite Resolution Board or,</p>  <p>  3. an insurance company has remediated the property or provided sufficient funds to carry out the remediation or,</p>  <p>  4. the person who built the property has remediated it or provided sufficient funds to carry out the remediation.</p>  <p>  Property owners claiming the exemption under Criteria 1 must provide a certificate to Revenue, which is completed in accordance with I.S. 398-1.2013 as set down by the then Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government in Statutory Instrument (SI) No 147 of 2013.  Property owners claiming the exemption under Criteria 2 to 4 must provide appropriate supporting documentation.</p>  <p>  The 'pyrite exemption' is claimed by property owners on a self-assessed basis and the onus is on the claimants to provide the appropriate supporting documentation to Revenue when requested to do so.  Where the supporting documentation is not provided or where it does not conform with the statutory requirements then Revenue is obliged to withdraw the relief and secure payment of any outstanding LPT liabilities.</p>  <p>  Once granted, the exemption becomes applicable from the following 1 November and normally remains in place for a period of six years.  The Act does not provide entitlement to the exemption for any years previous to a property being accepted as having significant pyritic damage or in circumstances where the pyritic damage was remediated prior to the introduction of LPT on 1 July 2013.  Revenue has confirmed to me that 731 additional properties have benefitted from the exemption since commencement of the Amendment.</p>  <p>  In regard to the specific North County Dublin properties to which the Deputy is referring, I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the owners in question claimed the pyrite exemption on a self-assessed basis but that the supporting documentation subsequently confirmed the remediation occurred prior to the enactment of LPT, thereby falling outside of the required criteria.</p></reply>

To qualify for a Primary Medical Certificate, an applicant must be permanently and severely disabled within the terms of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994 and satisfy one of the following conditions:</p>  <p>- be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs;</p>  <p>- be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs;</p>  <p>- be without both hands or without both arms;</p>  <p>- be without one or both legs;</p>  <p>- be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg;</p>  <p>- have the medical condition of dwarfism and have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.</p>  <p>  The Senior Medical Officer for the relevant local Health Service Executive administrative area makes a professional clinical determination as to whether an individual applicant satisfies the medical criteria.  A successful applicant is provided with a Primary Medical Certificate, which is required under the Regulations to claim the reliefs provided for in the Scheme.  An unsuccessful applicant can appeal the decision of the Senior Medical Officer to the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal, which makes a new clinical determination in respect of the individual.  The Regulations mandate that the Medical Board of Appeal is independent in the exercise of its functions to ensure the integrity of its clinical determinations.  The Medical Board of Appeal's clinical determination is limited to the scope of the six qualifying criteria, and the Board does not have discretion in relation to the application of these criteria.  The criteria to qualify for the Scheme are necessarily precise and specific.  After six months a citizen can reapply if there is a deterioration in their condition.</p>  <p>  The Scheme represents a significant tax expenditure.  Between the Vehicle Registration Tax and VAT foregone, and the repayment of excise on fuel used by members of the Scheme, the Scheme represented a cost of &euro;50.3 million to the Exchequer in 2015, an increase from &euro;48.6 million in 2014.  These figures do not include the revenue foregone to the Local Government Fund in the respect of the relief from Motor Tax provided to members of the Scheme.</p>  <p>  I recognise the important role that the Scheme plays in expanding the mobility of citizens with disabilities.  I have managed to maintain the relief at current levels throughout the crisis despite the requirement for significant fiscal consolidation.  From time to time I receive representations from individuals who feel they would benefit from the Scheme but do not qualify under the six criteria.  While I have sympathy for these cases, given the scale and scope of the Scheme, I have no plans to expand the medical criteria beyond the six currently provided for in the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994.</p></reply>

More taxpayers are engaging electronically with Revenue and utilising electronic fund transfers to settle their tax liabilities and receive tax refunds.</p>  <p>  From May 2016 any repayments of tax to taxpayers who are mandatory efilers are repaid to a bank account designated by the taxpayer.  This is in accordance with Tax Returns and Payments (Mandatory Electronic Repayment) Regulations 2016 which requires the repayment of specified liabilities as defined in earlier 2011, 2012 and 2014 Regulations to be made by electronic means.  These regulations apply mainly to business taxpayers and are in line with the National Payments Plan, approved by Government in 2014 which recommended the end of cheque usage between Government and business.</p>  <p>  For taxpayers not falling within these regulations such as taxpayers registered for PAYE and LPT, Revenue continues to issue cheques for tax refunds where the taxpayer has opted not to provide bank account details.  For the 7 months to July 2016, 65% of PAYE customers had opted to provide their bank account details to Revenue and receive their refunds directly into a bank account.  This represented 324,000 refunds to the value of &euro;208m.  For the same period 181,000 repayment cheques to the value of &euro;110m were issued to PAYE customers who had not provided bank account details.</p>  <p>  Since the introduction of SEPA in 2013, Revenue can process electronic fund transfers to Credit Unions who have developed the necessary IT capability to accept such transfers.</p></reply>

The CoCo was issued by AIB in July 2011 with a set five year maturity; the repayment was a contractual commitment, written into the terms of the instrument.  AIB returned the full capital value of the instrument, plus accrued interest of &euro;160m, to the exchequer. </p>  <p>  Given the predictable nature of the CoCo instrument's maturity, the return of capital and associated interest payments have been included in the exchequer planning calculations over the last number of years.  As a non-recurring income, the payment does not impact the available fiscal space or the ongoing budget process.  The capital repayment has reduced the State's borrowing requirements this year and can be seen as an effective reduction in national debt.</p></reply>

As a result, the general government expenditure outturn for 2015 does mean that there is a significant buffer now built into the calculation of Ireland's compliance with the expenditure benchmark in 2016. </p>  <p>  However, as the Deputy is aware, the expenditure benchmark is only one of the two pillars used to assess compliance with the preventive arm of the Stability and Growth Pact.  The second pillar is the balanced budget rule, which requires a Member State to move towards its medium-term budgetary objective or MTO in accordance with its adjustment path.  The MTO is set in structural terms, which means it excludes the effects of the economic cycle and one-off transactions, such as the AIB transaction in 2015. </p>  <p>  The buffer under the expenditure rule allowed for the additional &euro;540m expenditure detailed in the 2016 Revised Estimate Volume for known spending pressures in the areas of Health and Justice.  Based on the assessment at the time and reflected in the fiscal forecast in the Summer Economic Statement, this was largely compatible with our obligations under the balanced budget rule; however, it was estimated to be very much at the limit.</p>  <p>  Assessment of compliance with the preventive arm of the Stability and Growth Pact by the European Commission is based on overall assessment, taking account of both the expenditure benchmark and the balanced budget rule.  As part of the Budget 2017 process, there will be a detailed re-assessment of these measures; however, our judgement at this time is that there is no scope for further additional voted expenditure above the aggregate level already approved.  However, this does not preclude additional expenditure on specific items provided it is matched by savings within the existing level of authorised aggregate expenditure allocations.</p></reply>

However, other mitigating factors mean the overall increase in the EU budget contribution is now estimated to be in the order of &euro;280m when compared to the forecast underlying the SES.</p>  <p>  It must be emphasised that the final impact depends on a number of variables including the size of the overall EU budget for 2017 (which is not due to be agreed until November 2016), GNI movements in other EU Member States and other EU budget operational developments.  My officials will continue to liaise with the European Commission in order to achieve greater clarity on the exact contribution, whether this expenditure will impact on the available fiscal space for new measures and how the Commission's overall assessment of Ireland's compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact requirements may be affected.</p></reply>

The report favoured the use of market value of residential properties as the basis of assessment and this  recommendation was accepted by the Government.</p>  <p>  The Thornhill Group concluded that the arguments for SVT were outweighed by the likely difficulties in ensuring acceptance by taxpayers, i.e., arriving at values that were evidence based, understandable and acceptable to the public in addition to complexities and uncertainties in the valuation effort necessary to put an SVT in place.  In contrast, the Group considered that under a market value approach applied to housing, the market value of a residential property would be related to the characteristics of the building itself, the site on which it was located and the characteristics and amenities of the neighbourhood.  There would be a relationship between the market value of a house and benefits to the owners in terms of enjoyment of the amenity value of the properties. </p>  <p>  At the request of the Minister for Finance, the operation of the LPT was reviewed in 2015 by Dr. Thornhill.  A number of submissions to the review favoured changing the basis of determination of LPT liabilities to site value, floor area or variations thereof.  Dr. Thornhill considered these but remained of the view that market value is the most appropriate and equitable basis on which to determine LPT liabilities.</p>  <p>  Both Commissions on Taxation in 1985 and 2009 favoured property taxation based on market value citing inter alia significant difficulties in communicating to home-owners and land-holders the nature of the taxation charge that is involved and the benefits that would accrue from that change. </p>  <p>  I have no plans to introduce a Site Value Tax.</p></reply>

A landlord may claim a deduction for costs incurred in respect of the property such as maintenance, repairs, insurance, management of the property and any goods provided or services rendered to the tenant.  A deduction for 75% of the interest paid on borrowed money used to purchase, improve or repair the rented premises is also allowed.  This deduction may increase to 100% of interest paid where the terms of the incentive for landlords who make their property available for a minimum of three years to tenants in receipt of social housing supports are met.</p>  <p>  The method for calculating a landlord's net rental profit does not vary in proportion to the number of rental properties a landlord has.  My Department is not undertaking an analysis of such a proposal, and nor do I see a policy rationale for doing so.  Income tax rates and bands are generally applicable and are determined by factors such as a taxpayer's personal circumstances and taxable income from all sources.  To impose a higher rate of tax in respect of a number of sub-sets of taxpayer with income from a particular source would be highly unusual, and could be open to challenge under state aid rules.  In addition, it is likely that the charging of higher taxes of the nature contemplated by the Deputy would ultimately be passed on to tenants in the form of further increases in rents.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, Ireland's residential property market has traditionally been characterised by a multitude of part-time private landlords owning an average of 1 to 2 properties.  This concentrates risk for both landlords and tenants, and in my view a rental market which includes more professional, full-time, landlords should help to standardise and improve management standards across the rental property sector and, in the longer term, lead to a more sustainable and secure residential property market for both investors and property tenants.</p></reply>

The Government is conscious that there is a supply shortage of housing and of the challenges faced by first-time buyers.  Therefore, building upon the range of structural actions outlined in the Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, I will also outline details of a new tax-based &quot;Help-to-Buy&quot; scheme in the forthcoming Budget in October.  Full details of the incentive, including eligibility criteria and implementation method, will be provided on Budget day.  Subject to the approval of the Oireachtas, eligibility for the scheme will be back-dated to take effect from the date of publication of the Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness (19 July).</p><p>As the Deputy will also be aware, the Central Bank has now commenced its review of the macro prudential regulations for residential mortgage lending.  As part of this process, I can confirm that the Department has made a submission to the Central Bank and this is now available on the Department's website at the following link: .  The Department's submission recognises the overall importance of macro prudential controls on the extension of credit for housing purposes but considers that it would be appropriate at this time to make some adjustment to the existing position; in particular, it asks the Central Bank to consider the adoption of a &quot;capacity to pay&quot; test (e.g. the payment capacity of potential purchasers based on rent paid over a five year period to be off set against the current deposit rules), an increase in the allowance for lending for PDHs in excess of the LTV and LTI caps to 20% and 25% respectively and that the first time buyer LTV limit of 90 per cent be applicable to the first &euro;320,000 value of a property.  It is also the recommendation of the Department that the above adapted measures be directed primarily towards first time buyers. </p><p>The Central Bank has advised that its review of the impact and effectiveness of the measures is due to be completed by the end of November and that all submissions to the call for evidence will be published in due course.</p></reply>

As noted in the Spring Quarterly Economic Commentary published by the ESRI, the numbers of mortgages in negative equity has fallen below 100,000 for the first time since 2008.  This figure had been above 300,000 in 2011.</p>  <p>  With regard to the taxation of rental income, the Deputy will be aware that landlords are liable to tax on their net rental profit after deduction of allowable letting expenses, and not on the gross rental income received.  A landlord may be allowed a deduction of 75% of the interest paid on borrowed money used to purchase, improve or repair rented premises when calculating rental income.  This deduction may be increased to 100% of mortgage interest where the property is let to a tenant in receipt of social housing supports, under the terms of the incentive I introduced in Finance Act 2015.  A number of other allowances and deductions are also available to reduce the taxable rental profit, including the cost of maintenance, repairs, insurance and management of the property, and the cost to the landlord of any goods provided or services rendered to a tenant.</p>  <p>  To extend relief further to allow a deduction for the full interest and capital cost of a mortgage repayment in addition to other allowable letting expenses, as appears to be suggested in the Deputy's question, would in effect see the State further subsidise the purchase by a private individual of a residential rental investment property.  I do not believe that this would be an appropriate use of State resources at this time.</p>  <p>  It should also be noted that as the taxation of all rental property in the State is dealt with under the same legislation, an attempt to carve out a cohort of 'accidental' landlords would prove problematic.  There are many reasons why individuals might choose, or feel obliged, to let out a property which they own while also renting a separate property for their own accommodation, and all are treated equally by the tax system.  The provision of additional tax deductions to one sub-set of landlords could also create difficulties in the rental marketplace as a result of the advantage obtained over other landlords of similar residential property.</p></reply>

The EU VAT Directive provides that VAT exemption limits may only be raised by Member States to maintain their value in real terms, that is, they may only be increased in line with inflation.  The VAT thresholds were increased to their current values on 1 May 2008.  As the Central Statistics Office figures show the consumer price index is below the level it reached in 2008, it is not possible to increase the services threshold to &euro;50,000.

To qualify for a Primary Medical Certificate, an applicant must be permanently and severely disabled within the terms of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994 and satisfy one of the following conditions:</p>  <p>  - be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs;</p>  <p>  - be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs;</p>  <p>  - be without both hands or without both arms;</p>  <p>  - be without one or both legs;</p>  <p>  - be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg;</p>  <p>  - have the medical condition of dwarfism and have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs. </p>  <p>  The Senior Medical Officer for the relevant local Health Service Executive administrative area makes a professional clinical determination as to whether an individual applicant satisfies the medical criteria.  A successful applicant is provided with a Primary Medical Certificate, which is required under the Regulations to claim the reliefs provided for in the Scheme.  An unsuccessful applicant can appeal the decision of the Senior Medical Officer to the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal, which makes a new clinical determination in respect of the individual.  The Regulations mandate that the Medical Board of Appeal is independent in the exercise of its functions to ensure the integrity of its clinical determinations.  After six months a citizen can reapply if there is a deterioration in their condition.</p>  <p>  The Scheme represents a significant tax expenditure.  Between the Vehicle Registration Tax and VAT foregone, and the repayment of excise on fuel used by members of the Scheme, the Scheme represented a cost of &euro;50.3 million to the Exchequer in 2015, an increase from &euro;48.6 million in 2014.  These figures do not include the revenue foregone to the Local Government Fund in the respect of the relief from Motor Tax provided to members of the Scheme.  </p>  <p>  I am aware that the Ombudsman has made comments regarding the eligibility criteria of the Disabled Driver and Disabled Passengers Scheme.  The Ombudsman stated that, in his opinion, the criteria were narrowly focused and prescriptive.  The Scheme and qualifying criteria were designed specifically for those with severe physical disabilities and are, therefore, necessarily precise.  </p>  <p>  I recognise the important role that the Scheme plays in expanding the mobility of citizens with disabilities.  I have managed to maintain the relief at current levels throughout the crisis despite the requirement for significant fiscal consolidation.  From time to time I receive representations from individuals who feel they would benefit from the Scheme but do not qualify under the six criteria.  While I have sympathy for these cases, given the scale and scope of the Scheme, I have no plans to expand the medical criteria beyond the six currently provided for in the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994.</p></reply>

At this meeting, an outline structure table of contents for the chapter on 'Cost of Claims' was agreed following consultation amongst all members.  Drafting tasks were also allocated.</p><p>The preliminary views of sub-group 3 were relayed to Minister of State Murphy at his meeting with Chairs and Vice Chairs of all sub-groups on Friday 9 September. </p><p>Sub-group 3 will proactively engage with stakeholders when appropriate at both steering group and sub-group level.</p><p>Sub-group 4: Other public policy issues</p><p>This group will examine, amongst other things, insurance fraud and uninsured drivers.</p><p>This group met on Tuesday 6 September where it agreed its broad work plan.  As part of this, it will meet with members of Insurance Ireland's Fraud Committee and the Motor Insurers' Bureau of Ireland's Committee at its next meeting on 14 September.  It is proposed to meet on weekly basis thereafter.</p><p>By the end of October, the Working Group will provide me with an update report which will set out the priority actions required.  From November to December, the Working Group will put in place an action plan to enable the relevant Government Departments and Offices to commence the implementation of these priority actions.  In this regard, Minister of State Murphy will be consulting regularly with Government colleagues.</p></reply>

They are estimated by reference to projected 2017 incomes, they are provisional and may be revised.</p><p>As regards marginal rates paid by income earners, I must point out that PRSI is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Social Protection in the first instance.  I am advised by Revenue that the following tables provide a percentage breakdown of PAYE and self-assessed income earners at each income tax rate and Universal Social Charge (USC) rate.  This information represents the out-turn figures based on actual tax returns from 2014, the most recent tax year for which such data is available.<table><tr><th>Tax Rate</th><th>PAYE</th><th>Self-Assessed (Schedule D)</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>Exempt</td><td>39%</td><td>31%</td><td>857,394</td></tr><tr><td>Marginal Relief</td><td>1%</td><td>2%</td><td>24,796</td></tr><tr><td>20%</td><td>41%</td><td>51%</td><td>937,419</td></tr><tr><td>41%</td><td>18%</td><td>16%</td><td>404,439</td></tr><tr><td>All</td><td>2,035,249</td><td>188,799</td><td>2,224,048</td></tr></table><table><tr><th>USC Rate</th><th>PAYE</th><th>Self-Assessed (Schedule D)</th><th>All</th></tr><tr><td>Exempt</td><td>30.48%</td><td>31.86%</td><td>680,430</td></tr><tr><td>2 &amp;amp; 4%</td><td>19.10%</td><td>20.91%</td><td>428,267</td></tr><tr><td>7%</td><td>50.38%</td><td>42.10%</td><td>1,104,802</td></tr><tr><td>3% Surcharge</td><td>0.04%</td><td>5.13%</td><td>10,549</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>2,035,249</td><td>188,799</td><td>2,224,048</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The self-assessment system applies uniformly to all self assessed taxpayers.  Revenue provides comprehensive assistance to taxpayers in complying with the self-assessment obligations.</p>  <p>  Every business sector, including farming, has a requirement to keep full and accurate records of their business; which are sufficient to enable them to make a proper return of income.  Changing the basis of taxation for a lower income cohort of one particular business sector would give rise to inconsistent treatment between, either different categories of self-assessed taxpayers, or self-assessed taxpayers with different levels of income.  Additionally, a system on the lines suggested by the Deputy based on an average gross margin could result in certain taxpayers paying a higher amount of tax than they would be otherwise due to pay.  Having different bases of calculating tax for different sectors would give rise to confusion for the taxpayers concerned and a need for additional support in understanding the requirements. </p>  <p>  I am aware that Revenue has in place a range of supports to assist taxpayers making their tax return including the ongoing development of the Revenue Online Service (ROS) and the pre-population of certain information onto the taxpayer's online return.  I understand that nearly 90% of farmers use ROS for filing their tax returns.  </p>  <p>  For taxpayers not registered for Revenue's online services, there are a number of simplified paper income tax returns available, which aimed at reducing the administrative burden on any taxpayer whose tax affairs are not overly complex.  The Form 11S is a short income tax return and I understand from Revenue that 5% of farmers are provided with the Form 11S.  Additionally, for lower income taxpayers, Revenue makes available a two-page paper tax return (a Form 11P) including, where possible, certain pre-populated information.  Some 20% of the cases to whom a Form 11P is sent are farmers. </p>  <p>  Finally, I am also advised by Revenue that they are working on expanding the range of information that is pre-populated in taxpayer returns to include information about payments from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  This work will be particularly useful to the farming community and it is expected to be available for the 2016 annual tax return which is due to be filed in 2017.</p></reply>

My Department will be represented on this group.  It is expected that this group will publish a report detailing their findings later this year.</p></reply>

This will commence in 2017 with a move from 50 to 65 per cent of regulation costs being borne by industry, subject to parameters on cost growth being implemented. </p>  <p>  The inclusion of cost control measures in the phased increase of industry funding are to demonstrate that both the Central Bank and Government have considered and acted on the valid concerns raised during the industry funding public consultation.  Further, it should reassure Central Bank stakeholders that the commitment to cost control is firmly embedded in the Bank, and it is also an example of the Bank leading in best practice for the wider public sector.  Any cost control parameters will be implemented with regard to protecting the Central Bank's statutory independence and ensuring regulatory best practice. </p>  <p>  In terms of the timeframe for implementing the phased move, I have agreed an initial increase to 65 per cent in 2017, contingent on the Central Bank agreeing to and implementing cost control measures.  The phasing of the remaining increases are yet to be agreed between the Department and the Central Bank.  The rollout of the phased increase will take into account the unique characteristics of each sector in the industry and if appropriate may adopt different tracks to achieving 100 per cent funding in different industry sectors.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank is at present working to agree the cost control parameters.  When this work is concluded, its outcomes will be integrated into the Joint Feedback Statement on the Public Consultation.</p></reply>

At the same time, the Commission published the communication "Towards the Completion of the Banking Union".  On foot of this a temporary Ad Hoc Working Party (AHWP) on the Strengthening of the Banking Union was established within the Council.  This AHWP, chaired by the rotating Presidency, is composed of representatives of all Member States at the appropriate level, regardless of their intention to participate in EDIS or not.  The European Central Bank and Single Resolution Board attend as observers.  </p>  <p>  I believe EDIS is an essential part of the overall Banking Union project, particularly since it should ensure that savings are equally protected in all Member States, thus further weakening the link between banks and the sovereign.  It is my view that EDIS should be in place as quickly as possible and should not be contingent on progress on other risk reduction measures.</p>  <p>  My officials are engaging on an ongoing basis with the AHWP with the aim of achieving the introduction of EDIS as quickly as possible.  Under the Slovak Presidency the discussions have moved into a more technical phase as the current text is being discussed on an article by article basis.  The Department is also working closely with the Central Bank to ensure that they are kept abreast of developments in this area and have the opportunity to provide comments on the issues being discussed.</p></reply>

The Directive includes five significant corporate tax anti-avoidance measures.  Three of the measures derive from the non-binding elements of the OECD BEPS process, with the remaining two measures coming from the European Commission's previous Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCCTB) Directive.  </p>  <p>  With regards to the measures that are derived from the non-binding elements of the BEPS process, namely the controlled foreign company rules, the hybrid mismatch rules and the interest limitation rules, these measures must be implemented by Member States by 01 January 2019.  However, the provisions on interest deductions (the interest limitation rule) may be deferred until 2024 for countries that already have strong targeted interest rules.  </p>  <p>  The Directive also proposes that an exit tax must be applied when a company moves its residence, its assets or a branch out of a Member State.  Ireland currently has an exit tax which will be reviewed to determine what changes may be needed to ensure it is in line with the Directive.  The exit tax will need to be implemeneted by 01 January 2020.  </p>  <p>  Finally, the Directive also proposes that Member States introduce a general anti avoidance rule which disregards any non-genuine arrangements which are carried out by a company for the purpose of gaining a tax advantage.  Ireland in fact already has a similar General Anti-Avoidance Rule in our domestic tax law since the 1980s.  The general anti-abuse rule in the Directive will need to be implemented by 01 January 2019.</p></reply>

All small and medium companies less than seven years old in qualifying trades, in all geographic areas of the country, can use the incentive, as can certain older companies which are expanding into new products or geographic markets. </p>  <p>  Alternatively, the Start-Up Refunds for Entrepreneurs scheme provides a refund of tax paid in the previous 6 years to those in PAYE employment or those who have recently been made unemployed, where they invest funds into a new company.</p>  <p>  The Start Your Own Business scheme provides for relief from Income Tax for long term unemployed individuals who start a new business as a sole trader.  The scheme will provide an exemption from Income Tax up to a maximum of &euro;40,000 per annum for a period of two years to individuals who set up a qualifying business, having been unemployed for a period of at least 12 months prior to starting the business.</p>  <p>  A sector-specific incentive for micro-breweries also exists, which allows relief of up to 50% of the national rate of excise duty to micro-breweries producing 30,000 hectolitres or less per annum.</p>  <p>  With regard to PRSI, in Budget 2016 I introduced a new tapered employee PRSI credit in order to smooth entry into the PRSI system for employees who were previously affected by the PRSI 'step effect', thereby removing a barrier to provision of additional hours of labour by affected employees.  I also increased the point at which an employer becomes liable to pay the higher rate of employer PRSI by &euro;20 per week in order to mitigate the cost to employers of the increase to the national minimum wage.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that the Department of Social Protection provides financial support to companies engaging additional employees through the JobsPlus scheme.  JobsPlus offers differentiated levels of subsidies to employers to encourage them to focus recruitment on jobseekers who are longer term unemployed.  There is no limit on the number of new recruits per employer, and start-up employers may also avail of the scheme, on production of evidence that the business has commenced operations.</p>  <p>  I am of the view that the above reliefs and supports are more appropriately targeted at supporting small enterprises and increasing employment than an employer PRSI credit of the nature proposed by the Deputy.</p></reply>

I am aware that initiatives such as the DIT Ballymun Music Programme play an enormous role in providing children with access to non-mainstream music education.</p>  <p>  My Department is very committed to the implementation of the objectives outlined in the Arts in Education Charter, which was published in 2012, and has consequently made a number of significant commitments, both of a financial and staffing nature, to various initiatives outlined therein on the advice and recommendations of the Charter Implementation Group.  It is very important that the initiatives outlined in the Charter continue to be supported while also being cognisant of limited resources available.</p>  <p>  The Department of Education and Skills also established a Committee for Non-Mainstream Department of Education and Skills funded Music Education.  It was allocated a fund of &euro;50,000 to provide bursaries for non-mainstream music initiatives in 2016.  The Committee sought applications for the bursary.  Over 70 applications were received.  A sub-group of the Committee considered the applications.  It was decided to provide bursaries to 25 initiatives.

There has been no financial threat to staffing of DITSU or to its activities.</p>  <p>  On an annual basis DITSU receives funding of &euro;1.1 million through DIT under a funding agreement between DIT and DITSU.  This level of funding, which is greater than that available to students' unions in any other institution, has been maintained over the last three years despite challenging economic times in higher education.  As the three-year funding agreement expired on 30 June this year, negotiations on a new agreement took place over the previous six months and agreement was reached and formally signed by the President of DITSU and the Director of Student Services.  As any such agreement is subject to DIT Governing Body approval, it was presented jointly by DIT and DITSU to Governing Body.</p>  <p>  While the agreement was broadly accepted, the Audit Committee of Governing Body has asked for an amendment to a paragraph concerning internal audit.  DITSU has expressed concern in relation to its own independence if it is required to submit information through the Internal Audit function in DIT.  DIT fully accepts the importance of the independence of the Students' Union and does not wish to interfere with this in anyway.  While the Internal Audit function is the administrative conduit through which Audit Committee oversees DIT finances, the audits are in fact conducted by external bodies.  The matter of oversight is entirely the responsibility of the Governing Body Audit Committee and is not a process in which the Institute management can be involved.</p>  <p>  DIT and DITSU management have met on a number of occasions since the issue arose to seek a solution that may be acceptable to the Audit Committee.  It is hoped that the matter can be resolved satisfactorily and that the new three-year agreement can be formally implemented.  In the interim, funding is being provided to DITSU on a similar basis to the arrangements under the expired agreement.</p></reply>

Actions consist of a range of measures, including the provision of lockers and in the case of second level school the arrangement of the timetable into double class periods, active liaison with parents and the co-ordination of homework by subject teachers.</p>  <p>  Ultimately it is a matter for each individual school to determine which particular measures are most suited to its individual circumstances and to how the school concerned organises teaching and learning.</p>  <p>  The use of digital resources by teachers and students in schools is increasing.  While conventional textbooks are still widely used, a number of schools have introduced or are considering introducing e-books and other digital resources to enhance students' work in school and at home.  Schools can use the book grant scheme to purchase a range of digital resources relevant to the curriculum.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that Scoilnet.ie, the Department funded website, supports Primary and Post-Primary teachers in sharing and finding useful resources for the classroom, including the Britannica School website, and other valuable online content and resources to assist in teaching and learning.</p>  <p>  The circulars (PC 13/05 and M35/05) and the report of the Working Group on the Weight of School Bags are available on my Department's website at www.education.ie.</p></reply>

These defined areas facilitate the orderly planning of school provision and accommodation needs.  In identifying the requirement for additional school places in a school planning area, my Department uses a Geographical Information System to identify the areas under increased demographic pressure nationwide.  The GIS uses data from the Central Statistics Office, Ordnance Survey Ireland, the Department of Social Protection and my Department's own databases.  With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic analyses to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level. </p>  <p>  Following the 2015 demographic analyses, four new primary schools and nine new post-primary schools were announced to open in 2017 and 2018 to cater for increased demographic needs in these areas.  This includes a new post-primary school which will open in 2017 to serve the Carpenterstown and Castleknock school planning areas in Dublin 15, which will provide an additional 1,000 post-primary pupil places, supplementing provision in these areas.</p>  <p>  As with other school planning areas nationwide, the demographic data for the areas outlined by the Deputy are being kept under ongoing review by my Department to take account of updated child benefit data and updated enrolment data and also the impact of ongoing and planned capacity increases in these, and adjoining, school planning areas.</p>  <p>  My Department liaises with Local Authorities in relation to their County Development Plans and Local Area Plans and makes submissions in relation to potential educational impacts arising from projected increases in population included in a draft Plan.  If a need for an additional school or schools is identified, my Department requests the Local Authority to zone a suitable area appropriately for educational provision, as part of this process.  In this context, my Department made a submission to Fingal County Council in April this year, as part of their draft Development Plan consultation phase, which indicated that if the projected population targets from 2017 to 2023 published in the draft Plan materialises and could not be accommodated in existing schools, this would result in the need for additional schools.  My Department's submission set out the importance of ensuring that sufficient lands in the areas where significant additional population is likely to arise, is zoned educational, to ensure that educational infrastructure can be put in place the meet the needs of these new communities.</p></reply>

This enables special schools to create flexible class settings for students with ASD.</p><p>The NCSE, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), is responsible for processing applications from primary and post primary schools for special educational needs supports, including the establishment of special classes in various geographical areas as required.  The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.</p><p>Progress in developing this network has been significant and in addition to the special school placements there are currently over 1,000 special classes throughout the country at primary and post primary level of which 762 are for children with Autism.</p><p>The NCSE recently published a list of special classes for the 2016/17 school year.  In total there will be 1,153 special classes available next year, which is an increase of over 100% in the number of special classes which were available in 2011, which was 548.</p><p>The NCSE has advised that for the current school year there will be 127 early intervention classes, 525 primary ASD classes and 237 post-primary ASD classes, which represents an increase of approx. 16% on 2015/16 classes for children with autism.</p><p>Of these, there will be 19 ASD classes in Co. Waterford, including 3 Early Intervention Classes for children who are not yet school going age, 10 primary school classes and 6 at post primary level in mainstream schools.  4 of these classes are new classes due to open in September 2016, 1 Early Intervention Class and 3 classes at primary level.</p><p>The NCSE continues to monitor and review the requirement for special class places in particular areas and has capacity to establish such new special classes where necessary subject to the willingness of schools to open classes.</p><p>Details of all special classes for children with special educational needs , including those in Co.

Their use in the Department is restricted to Ministerial Private Secretaries and the Principal Officer responsible for the Department's IT Unit.

The use of credit cards is monitored by the Department's Finance Unit, to ensure compliance with Departmental policy.  This written policy is kept under review, and the most recent review was carried out in July 2016.  </p>  <p>  There are currently three credit cards in use by the Department, all of which are held with the Bank of Ireland.  Expenditure in 2014 amounted to &euro;7,111.28 and the equivalent sum was &euro;13,779.68 in 2015.  This expenditure included &euro;366 for Stamp Duty and Annual Fee charges, along with interest payments of &euro;44.14 in the two year period.  The reason interest payments were incurred in 2014 is that the bank required matching of payments lodged to their account with reference credit card numbers.  This facility was not available on the Department's Financial Management System at that point, resulting in some short delays.

My Department uses a Geographical Information System to identify the areas under increased demographic pressure nationwide.  The system uses data from the Central Statistics Office, Ordnance Survey Ireland, the Department of Social Protection and information from my own Department's databases.  With this information, nationwide demographic analyses are carried out to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary levels.</p><p>When it is decided that a new school is required to meet demographic needs in an area, the Department runs a separate patronage process to decide who will operate the school.  It is open to all patrons and prospective patrons to apply for patronage of the school under this process and the level of parental preference for each patron, along with the extent of diversity in the area, are key to decisions in relation to the outcome of the process. </p><p>This process was followed in relation to the decision on the patronage of the new school which opened in September 2016 to serve the Drumcondra/Marino/Dublin 1 area.  My Department assessed the applications received from the prospective patrons, including examining the parental preferences received in the applications to ensure they represented children living within the school planning area which the school is set up to serve.  My Department prepared an assessment report for the consideration of the New Schools Establishment Group (NSEG) which then submitted a report with recommendations to me for consideration and final decision. </p><p>The patronage assessment report which is published on my Department's website, while indicating substantial support for an Irish medium school, reflects nearly twice as many valid preferences for an Educate Together school in this area as for a Gaelscoil.  I accepted the recommendation of the NSEG and the school under the patronage of Educate Together opened in September.  </p><p>While there are three Gaelscoileanna already operating in the area, the NSEG, in their report to me, noted the strong level of demand from parents for Irish-medium education in the area and recommended that this should be kept under review in the context of future demographic exercises.  My Department is continuing to keep the demographic data for the Drumcondra/Marino/Dublin 1 school planning area under ongoing review to take into account updated enrolment and child benefit data and the impact of ongoing and planned capacity increases in this and adjacent school planning areas. </p></reply>

My colleague in Government, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs is responsible for the ECCE scheme and the implementation of the AIM programme.</p><p>AIM is a child-centred model, involving seven levels of progressive support, moving from the universal to the targeted, depending on the needs of the child and the pre-school. </p><p>The supports include: </p><p>A new Inclusion Charter for the Early Years sector, alongside updated and strengthened Diversity, Equality and Inclusion Guidelines for Early Childhood Care and Education. </p><p>A new higher education programme for early years practitioners (LINC) which will commence from September 2016. </p><p>A new national specialist service which is based in the Better Start National Early Years Quality Development Service will provide expert advice, mentoring and support to pre-school providers from a team of 50 specialists in early years care and education for children with disabilities. </p><p>A new national scheme will provide specialised equipment, appliances and minor alterations which are necessary to support a child's participation in the ECCE programme. </p><p>A new national scheme will also provide additional capitation to pre-school providers where this is critical to fund extra support in the classroom and enable a child's participation in pre-school. It is estimated that only 1 to 1.5% of children in pre-school will require, and therefore be eligible for, this scheme of additional capitation. </p><p>Details of the supports which will be available under AIM can be found at www.preschoolaccess.ie which contains comprehensive information on the access and inclusion model and on how to apply for the new schemes and supports.</p></reply>

This information was gathered using surveys, information and training days, self-reflective questionnaires and a formal review undertaken by my Department's Inspectorate. </p><p>Through these processes, schools indicated that they welcomed the increased flexibility and autonomy provided by the model to allocate resources based on need.  Most schools believe the model allows more scope for team teaching, targeted interventions, mix of in-class and group work, with less focus on withdrawal and one to one teaching.  Schools welcome the move away from the unnecessary labelling of children in order to secure resources.

These supplementary assignment arrangements for SNAs continue to operate under the Lansdowne Road Agreement, and both unions representing SNAs, namely SIPTU and IMPACT, have signed up to that agreement.  As set out in the LRC proposals, the supplementary assignment arrangements for SNAs only apply to current SNAs who are notified that they are to be made redundant.  Accordingly, the purpose of these arrangements is to facilitate eligible SNAs who are being made redundant by one employer in filling SNA vacancies that may become available in another school/ETB.</p><p>Once an SNA with a minimum of one year's service (service in a substitute capacity i.e. covering for maternity leave, sick leave, career breaks, job-sharing etc. does not count) is notified by his/her employer that s/he is to be made redundant then s/he shall be deemed to be a member of a supplementary assignment panel for SNAs.  The detailed supplementary assignment arrangements for SNAs for the 2016/2017 school year are set out in Departmental Circular 0035/2016 which issued on 20 May 2016 and which is available on the Department's website at the following address: <i></i>.</p><p>The operation of this panel is described and outlined in Circular 0035/2016 and it is designed to be as flexible as possible which enables all eligible SNAs, who have the requisite Panel Form 1 completed by their former employer, to apply for any SNA position that is advertised by a school or an ETB with no sectoral, diocesan or geographical limitations imposed.  Every eligible SNA will remain on the panel for two years with a view to getting further employment.  If they are not successful over that period of time in obtaining a further SNA position then they will be eligible for a redundancy payment.  Furthermore, an SNA may opt out of this supplementary assignment panel at any point in time triggering the processing of his/her redundancy payment in line with the terms set out in the SNA redundancy scheme (DES Circular 58/06) or any revision of same that is applicable at that time.</p><p>It should be noted that this does not prevent any person, including SNAs who were employed prior to 1 May 2014 as referenced by the Deputy, from applying for SNA vacancies but employers are obliged to give precedence to applicants who are members of the SNA Supplementary Assignment Panel.</p><p>It is important to note that when an employer has a vacancy to fill, they must undertake the recruitment process in accordance with the provisions outlined in Circular 0035/2016.  My Department has set up a dedicated e-mail address to deal with all queries in relation to the SNA Supplementary Assignment Panel and any queries in respect of the operation of the Panel can be directed to this dedicated e-mail address:<i>snasupplementpanel@education.gov.ie</i>. </p></reply>

Some 130,000 students qualified for free fees in the 2014/15 academic year at a cost of over &euro;263 million.  Students who qualify for free fees must pay the student contribution directly to their higher education institution which will stand at &euro;3,000 for the current academic year.  Some 50% of of students who qualify for free fees have the student contribution paid on their behalf by the Exchequer under my Department's Student Grant Scheme at a cost of 196 million.  The costs in relation to tax relief on fees is a matter for the Department of Finance.</p></reply>

Responsibility for deciding on the quantum of educational supports and resources to be allocated to schools to support individual pupils rests with the NCSE. </p><p>The NCSE allocates SNA support to schools in accordance with the criteria set out in my Department's Circular 0030/2014, which is available on my Department's website at <i>www.education.ie</i>, in order that students who have care needs can access SNA support as and when it is needed.  In making allocations to schools, the NCSE will take into account the assessed individual needs of all children with identified needs in the school.  It should also be noted that SNA allocations are not made to individual children, but are made to schools to support the care needs of children with assessed special educational needs in the school.  </p><p>The NCSE requests schools in Spring each year to submit applications for SNA support to the NCSE in respect of applications for such support for the coming school year.  Having considered all of the applications received, the NCSE advises schools of their SNA allocation for the coming school year, taking into account the number of valid applications for SNA support and the assessed care needs of the children concerned. </p><p>Whereas the NCSE will continue to consider applications throughout the school year in cases where schools have enrolled new pupils with care needs, where new assessments have been forthcoming, or in cases of emergencies, the main allocation of SNA support is now made to schools on an annual allocation basis. </p><p>When making an application for SNA support, schools are asked to consider the importance of balancing the need of the child for necessary care support and the right of the child to acquire personal independence skills.  A school's application for the services of an SNA must be based on a report from the professional who diagnosed the child's special care needs and evidence that describes the child's special care need, the reasons why the support of an SNA is necessary and the benefits that the child would gain from such care support in a school setting. </p><p>While a parent of a child with special educational needs should, in the first instance, contact the school to which the child is enrolled, to discuss the child's special educational needs and supports available, the local SENO is available to discuss any concerns that parents have about the present or future educational needs of their child.  SENOs recognise that parents/guardians are the key stakeholders with regard to the child and are committed to forging good relationships with parents and parent groups. </p><p>All schools have the contact details of their local SENO. Contact details are also available on the NCSE website at <i>www.ncse.ie</i>.</p><p>The NCSE has a range of Information Booklets available on its website for parents of children with special educational needs, which are written for parents to answer key questions they may have about special education, both generally and as it relates to their child: <i></i>.</p></reply>

One is open to students from a Protestant background and one is open to all students.  The provision of a route for students of a Protestant background continues the arrangements that have heretofore been in place for entry to the B Ed programme provided by the Church of Ireland College of Education (CICE).</p>  <p>  In accordance with Department policy on the restructuring of initial teacher education, CICE and St Patrick's, Drumcondra, are scheduled to be incorporated into DCU on 1 October 2016.  Two centres for denominational education are being created in DCU's Institute of Education, such that the University whilst maintaining its secular context, will facilitate and support the co-existence of different faith-based traditions.</p>  <p>  CICE provides teachers for the Protestant primary school sector and the College has for many years restricted its annual B.Ed. intake (currently 32 students) to students from Protestant backgrounds.  This is to ensure that there is available to schools under Protestant patronage a sufficient number of teachers who themselves come from a Protestant background and are trained in an institution with a Protestant ethos.  The arrangement is provided for by order made by the Minister for Education and Skills, with the consent of the Minister for Justice and Equality, in accordance with Section 12 of the Employment Equality Act.</p>  <p>  The current order applies to the academic years 2013/14 to 2017/18 inclusive.  However, a new order will be required under Section 12, having regard to the incorporation of CICE into DCU.  An application for this must be made to me and upon receipt, it would be my intention to make the order, with the consent of my colleague the Minister for Justice and Equality.  The order will help ensure the continued availability of teachers with a background in the Protestant faith and thereby protect the constitutional right to free expression of religion. </p></reply>

The HEA allocates this funding to the institutions and the internal disbursement of funding is then a matter for the individual institution.  Universities are autonomous bodies as set out in the Universities Act 1997 and are responsible for their own day to day affairs, including the allocation of all of their income (both public and private). </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, since the introduction of the moratorium on public sector recruitment, an Employment Control Framework (ECF) has been in place for the higher education sector which provides institutions with considerable flexibility to fill vacancies through recruitment or promotions on the basis of meeting an overall ceiling of posts.  Under this Framework the re-employment of retired staff should only occur in very limited exceptional circumstances and in these cases the salaries offered may not exceed 20% of the full-time salary of the post of the individual at the time of their retirement, adjusted to reflect the application of Government pay policy in the period since their date of retirement &ndash; including in particular the application of salary adjustments imposed under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act 2009. </p>  <p>  In Budget 2015, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform announced that the existing ECFs and associated moratoriums would be lifted and replaced with a system of delegated sanction for recruiting and promoting up to Principal Officer level, subject to adherence by Departments to binding pay ceilings and ongoing compliance with Workforce Planning requirements.  In light of this announcement a new Delegated Sanction Agreement for the higher education sector will be put in place shortly.</p></reply>

Schools are supported in this regard by the National Educational Psychological Services. </p>  <p>  Schools are not required to apply directly to my Department for learning support for SLDs such as dyslexia.  Schools should monitor and utilise their allocation of additional teaching support to best support the needs of identified pupils, in accordance with my Department's guidance.  The teaching time afforded to each individual pupil is decided and managed by schools, taking into account each child's individual learning needs. </p>  <p>  My Department's Circular 70/2014 provides guidelines for post primary schools in relation to the utilisation of additional teaching resources which have been allocated to them for pupils with special educational needs. </p>  <p>  As the allocation of support for pupils with SLDs is managed locally by schools, a parent who feels that their child requires additional learning support in school should raise this matter directly with their school Principal in the first instance, or with the Board of Management of the school. </p>  <p>  In policy advice provided to my Department in 2013, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) advised that the current system for allocating resource hours to schools to support pupils with specific disabilities is potentially inequitable.  This is because the current system fails to take account of the individual needs of the children concerned. </p>  <p>  The NCSE recommended that a new model would be developed through which resources would be provided to schools on the basis of profiled needs of each school.  My Department has developed the recommended new model and a pilot of the new model was implemented over the 2015/2016 school year in 47 schools. </p>  <p>  The pilot has now been completed and a report of a review of the outcomes of the pilot is being finalised.  Following consideration of this report, decisions will be taken as to the timeframe for the introduction of the proposed new model.  In the meantime there are no plans to extend the list of disability categories for which resource teaching hours will be allocated.  Specific Learning Disability currently is not a disability category included in the list of low incidence disabilities which are eligible for the allocation of resource teaching hours to individual students.</p>  <p>  SENOs also make recommendations to my Department where assistive technology is required.  The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in making recommendations for support in the form of Assistive Technology, which is set out in my Department's Circular 0010/2013. </p>  <p>  Further supports which are provided to support pupils with Dyslexia include an information resource pack on Dyslexia which has been made available to all primary and post-primary schools as well as provision for continuing professional development for teachers with additional training needs in the area of Dyslexia through the Special Education Support Service (SESS).</p></reply>

The LRA also applies to teachers in Designated Community Colleges who are TUI members, as such schools are dual-union schools with both TUI and ASTI representing teachers.  The Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts 2013 and 2015 as set out in Section 3 of the Circular applies to all other teachers employed in Designated Community Colleges. </p>  <p>  As is the norm with public service collective agreements, the Lansdowne Road Agreement was negotiated with trade unions which are recognised as representing staff in the public service (including teachers).  It is normal industrial relations practice in the public service that the decision of the trade union recognised as holding representative rights for a particular grade or sector will determine the position for all relevant staff in that grade/sector, and to do otherwise may not be seen as appropriate in an industrial relations context.  This context does not allow for acceptance or rejection of collective agreements by staff on an individual basis.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, there is no proposal at this time to treat teachers separately based on the fact that they are not a member of a trade union.</p></reply>

Under this scheme schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.  In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service.  The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring.  Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximize positive outcomes for these pupils.  NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties.  Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process.  Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment.  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.  It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention.  If the parents of the child, the subject of this question, have specific concerns relating to eligibility for an exemption form Irish then I would advise in the first instance that they speak to the Principal of the school with a view to him/her raising these concerns with the assigned NEPS psychologist.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-09-16a.1451.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016091600022#WRU04700"><p>Alleviating the housing crisis is a cross-Government priority and the available analysis indicates that the lack of suitable rental accommodation for students is driving up rents in the private rental sector, particularly in areas where demand for rental property is high.  This is contributing to what we know is already a considerable strain on some students and their families to participate in higher education with knock-on effects on completion rates.  The reality is that dealing comprehensively with this issue will only take place as part of a more general programme to address the major housing and homelessness issue.</p><p>Accordingly, my colleague Mr. Simon Coveney T.D., Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, yesterday (19 July 2016) published &quot;Rebuilding Ireland &ndash; an Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness&quot;, following Government approval of this comprehensive and ambitious Plan.  The full plan can be accessed at: .</p><p>My Department worked closely with the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government in developing this Plan, with a specific focus on student accommodation, and the following measures detailed in the Plan are directly relevant to this issue:</p><p>(i) The Department of Education and Skills in conjunction with a number of other key stakeholders will prepare and publish a national student accommodation strategy, which will set out a broad framework for delivery of an enhanced level of accommodation and which will inform local authority housing strategies and the land management process in general, in order to provide suitably located and affordable sites.  This will be prepared with a view to developing a national policy on specific needs and mechanisms for the development of appropriate on-campus and off-campus student accommodation.</p><p>(ii) My Department will work with stakeholders to prioritise and progress viable projects to provide additional student accommodation in key urban areas.  This will be done with a view to bringing on stream proposals capable of delivering an additional 7,000 student accommodation places by end 2019, on or off campus, in addition to projects already committed to.</p><p>(iii) Dedicated delivery structures, such as Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) will be established in the Higher Education Institutions (HEI) sector to access Housing Finance Agency (HFA) funding, and complete any required policy, regulatory or legislative changes necessary.  This will be done with a view to providing additional funding mechanisms for the HEI sector, in conjunction with the HFA.</p><p>(iv) The Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government will help to fund a Student Housing Officer to work with the Union of Students in Ireland, local authorities, AHBs and housing providers, to identify and expand short-term capacity enhancing measures in the student accommodation sector.  This will be done with a view to assisting students in finding appropriate accommodation.</p><p>(v) Funding mechanisms will be established for Institutes of Technology to support the development of their student accommodation capacity.  This is to facilitate the Institute of Technology sector in developing their potential for on-campus student accommodation through addressing current borrowing capacity and funding constraints.</p><p>(vi) The Department of Housing Planning and Local Government in conjunction with the Department of Education and Skills will carry out an assessment of scope for provision of additional student accommodation on local authority or other publicly-owned lands with a view to maximising the potential for student accommodation provision on suitable sites as part of mixed developments.</p><p>(vii) The Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government will enable student accommodation projects for 100 units or more to go straight to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, as well as maximise the opportunities for joint venture projects on local authority sites to proceed through the Part 8 process and prepare guidance on planning policies around student accommodation developments.  This will be done to enhance certainty and reduce delivery timescales and costs associated with bringing student accommodation proposals forward.</p><p>I very much welcome the commitments contained in the plan and I look forward to working with colleagues on a cross-Departmental basis to ensure that the commitments contained in the Plan are implemented as soon as practicable.</p><p>In addition to this, I should point out that a number of our Higher Education Institutions have Student Accommodation projects ongoing, or in the pipeline, with a number of additional on-campus Student Accommodation bed-spaces coming online from September 2016.  Maynooth University have 296 new on-campus bed spaces, and UCD have 350 new on-campus bed spaces, which came on stream for the commencement of the 2016/17 academic year.  Six other Higher Education Institutions are currently engaged in, or going through the planning phases for student accommodation projects, namely National University of Ireland Galway, Trinity College Dublin, University of Limerick, Dublin City University, University College Cork and Dublin Institute of Technology.</p><p>The Actions in the Plan in relation to Student Accommodation build on the report, Student Accommodation: Demand &amp;amp; Supply, which was published last year by the Minister for Education and Skills.  The full report can be accessed at .</p><p>The previous Minister for Education and Skills introduced two immediate actions following the publication of this report. </p><p>Firstly, funding was provided by the HEA to the Union of Students' (USI) in Ireland to progress short-term solutions for students in need of accommodation.  This funding will allow USI to develop their homes.usi.ie website, to communicate more effectively to student and homeowners, and to carry out research into this important issue.</p><p>Secondly, the establishment of an inter-departmental steering group to examine the recommendations contained in the HEA Report and to provide a coordinating mechanism to ensure that the higher education institutions have access to information on new potential funding and delivery models.  </p><p>There were 13 recommendations contained in the HEA Report on Student Accommodation and the current position in respect of all of the recommendations is as follows: </p><p>1. Encourage and support the take-up of the rent-a-room scheme by homeowners in areas adjacent to higher education institutions.</p><p>Action: Funding of &euro;30,000 was provided to Union of Students in Ireland (USI) by the HEA to fund their #HomesForStudy campaign.  While the campaign is still on‐going until the end of September 2016, USI is confident that at least 1,700 students will access accommodation directly as a result of the campaign.  A full report will be completed following the end of the campaign.  </p><p>2. Ensure continued flexibility by local authorities on application of guidelines for the specification of student accommodation.  </p><p>3. Ensure the requirement for student accommodation is considered as part of the reviews of Development Plans by Local Authorities. </p><p>4. Local Authorities to consider the use of the Vacant Land Levy, provided for in the Urban Regeneration and Housing Bill 2015 to increase the supply of land that could potentially be used for the development of student accommodation in our cities. </p><p>Action: These 3 recommendations are all related to Planning and Development.  These issues are being taken forward as part of the &quot;Rebuilding Ireland&quot; Action Plan and is specifically referenced in point (vii) above.  Furthermore, new planning policy guidance was issued to local authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la on the use of student accommodation complexes outside of the academic year, as their use during these periods provides a potential additional income stream, thereby aiding the overall viability of these projects.  This was contained in Circular PL 8/2016 APH 2/2016 which issued from the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government on 28 July 2016, a copy of which has been forwarded to the Deputy.</p><p>5. Explore, with relevant stakeholders, the potential for joint initiatives involving HEIs and an approved housing agency to deliver student accommodation places.</p><p>Action: This recommendation was examined by the Inter-Departmental Steering Group on Student Accommodation and is being taken forward as part of the &quot;Rebuilding Ireland&quot; Action Plan and is specifically referenced in point (iv) above.  The HFA have met individually with most of the Universities over the course of the past 2 months and officials in my Department are currently in discussion with officials in the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government in relation to the legislative requirements and other matters related to this measure.</p><p>6. Consider the provision of a capital grant specifically for HEI's development of student accommodation for a fixed period of time.</p><p>Action: This recommendation is being taken forward as part of the &quot;Rebuilding Ireland&quot; Action Plan and is specifically referenced in point (v) above.</p><p>7. Consider the potential to deliver future projects through a PPP financing model.</p><p>Action: This measure is currently being examined by the Inter-Departmental steering group on student accommodation.</p><p>8. The Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) sees Student Accommodation as an area of investment consistent with its dual bottom line mandate of commercial investment with economic impact. ISIF to continue to engage with Higher Education Institutions to develop financing solutions for on-campus accommodation and with private sector developers for potential off-campus investments.</p><p>9. Consult with NAMA, on a commercial basis, regarding the availability of suitable properties and land that could be used for student accommodation developments either by individual HEIs or HEIs working on joint projects. </p><p>Action:  In relation to these two recommendations, ISIF are now involved in the provision of funding to the development of a number of Student Accommodation projects in HEIs.  Furthermore, the Head of Infrastructure and Credit Investments in ISIF and the Heads of Public Affairs and the Docklands SDZ in NAMA gave presentations to an information session specifically in relation to student accommodation which was arranged by my Department and took place on Friday 27 November 2015.  All HEI's, representative bodies for the sectors (Irish Universities Association and Institutes of Technology Ireland) a number of Government Departments and other relevant stakeholders were in attendance at this information session and a number of follow-up meetings and conversations took place between relevant parties arising from this information session.  </p><p>10. Consideration to be given to tax measures to develop on-campus accommodation for HEIs.</p><p>Action: This measure is currently being examined by the Inter-Departmental steering group on student accommodation.</p><p>11. It is recommended that any future developments should comply with the recommendations for enabled access as published by the Department of the Environment. HEIs should consult with relevant stakeholders including students with disabilities on adaptation of existing stock and design for new builds. </p><p>Action: This measure will be taken forward individually by each HEI as part of the development of their future plans for student accommodation bed spaces on campus.</p><p>12. HEIs should consider allocating up to 10% of new bed spaces for students with disabilities to allow for likely increased demand by these students.</p><p>Action: This recommendation has been communicated to each HEI.  Each HEI has their own separate allocation policies and procedures for the allocation of on campus student accommodation bed spaces which includes the allocation of student accommodation to students with disabilities.</p><p>13. The Irish Survey of Student Engagement (ISSE) should be expanded to include relevant questions on student residences to enable research to be carried out on student preferences for accommodation and related issues.</p><p>Action: This matter is on the Agenda for discussion by the plenary group for the ISSE who examine potential future questions for inclusion in the ISSE.</p></reply>

However, I am keen to keep back to school costs as low as possible for parents.  In late 2013, as part of an initiative in this area, schools were requested to ballot parents on school uniform policy.  This move was aimed at giving parents a say on what, if any, uniforms a school should have and, in turn, to tackle the high costs of some uniforms.</p>  <p>  In keeping with the DES Action and Strategy Statement just released, the Department does plan to issue a new Circular to school authorities and ETBs regarding school uniform policy, and the need to put a greater emphasis on the need to reduce the cost of school uniforms and other costs.  The views of the National Parent Councils and other partners will be considered and will feed into the development of the Circular.  This Action is slated for Q4 2016-Q1 2017. </p>  <p>  My objective is to empower parents to have a greater say in their children's school uniform policy, thereby allowing for the maximum choice and diversity.  The Parents and Learners Charter will allow for consultation about this and other matters. </p></reply>

However their collection should not be such as to create a situation where either parents or pupils could reasonably infer that the contributions take on a compulsory character.</p>  <p>  If parents have a concern that there is some compulsion regarding contributions in a school, they can bring the matter to the attention of my Department who will follow up with the school in question. </p>  <p>  Apart from those recognised fee-charging second level schools, recognised primary and post primary schools are precluded from charging school fees.  No charge may be made in respect of instruction in any subject of the school curriculum or for recreation or other activities where all pupils are expected to take part.</p>  <p>  However, it is permissible for a school to seek payments in respect of extra-curricular activities provided such activities are not obligatory and individual pupils can choose whether or not to participate.  My Department's Circular 0065/2010 clarifies certain charges that may be legitimately requested from pupils.</p>  <p>  The Education (Admission to Schools) Bill, which was published on 6th July 2016, contains a provision prohibiting the charging of fees or seeking payment or contributions for an application for admission to a school or for the enrolment or continued enrolment of a student in a school.</p>  <p>  I believe that schools need to be accountable to parents and we need greater levels of communication, engagement and transparency in how schools serve their communities.  Better information for parents, including information in relation to the collection and use of voluntary contributions, is an issue that I will be looking at in the context of my Department's work on developing plans for a Parents' and Students' Charter.</p></reply>

The scheme does not stipulate precisely how an awarding authority satisfies itself that such circumstances prevail.  This is to allow the awarding authority sufficient flexibility to assess the evidence of irrevocable estrangement in each individual case. </p>  <p>  It is difficult to legislate for all possible scenarios that can lead to genuine estrangement cases.  Guidelines as to how students can demonstrate estrangement will, by their very nature, restrict the assessment of estrangement cases to those that fall within these guidelines.  Such restrictions may not be in the best interest of students genuinely in this situation.</p>  <p>  It is important that scarce public resources are targeted at those students who are genuinely in need. </p></reply>

The Commissioner for Valuation has sole responsibility for all valuation matters including procedures for the revision of the valuation of property set out under the Valuation Acts 2001 to 2015.  The Valuation Acts 2001 to 2015 come under the aegis of my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality.</p>  <p>  The levying and collection of rates is a matter for each individual local authority.  The annual rate on valuation (ARV) is applied to the valuation of each property as determined by the Valuation Office, to obtain the amount payable in rates.  The ARV is decided by the elected members of each local authority as part of the annual budget.  Rates income is a very important contribution to the cost of services provided by local authorities such as roads, public lighting, development control, parks and open spaces.  Locally elected members adopt the annual rate on valuation they consider necessary in order to provide the required services. </p>  <p>  My Department has in recent years requested local authorities to exercise restraint in setting, and where possible to reduce, ARVs and they have responded positively in this regard.  The national average ARV decreased each year from 2010 to 2014; 2015 and 2016 are not directly comparable due to the local authority mergers and the necessity to harmonise rates across new local authority areas.</p></reply>

The NPPR Charge, which has since been discontinued, applied in the years 2009 to 2013 to any residential property in which the owner did not reside as their normal place of residence.  The self-assessed charge is set at &euro;200 per annum and liability for it falls, in the main, on owners of rental, holiday and vacant properties.  It is a matter for an owner, whether resident in Ireland or elsewhere, to determine if he or she has a liability and, if so, to declare that liability and pay the Charge and any late payment fees applicable.  Under the Act, it is a function of a local authority to collect Non-Principal Private Residence Charges, and late payment fees due to it and all Charges and late payment fees imposed and payable to a local authority are under the care and management of the local authority concerned. </p>  <p> Approximately 380,000 properties have been registered for the Non-Principal Private Residence Charge, which has raised in excess of &euro;538m to date over its five years of operation.  Proceeds from the charge are retained by local authorities and are used for the provision of local services.  It is not possible to state with certainty the level of non-compliance with the Charge.

In broad terms, the standard sets out a two-step process to facilitate the testing and categorisation of dwellings.</p><p>The first step requires that a Building Condition Assessment be carried out; this comprises a desktop study and a visual non-invasive internal and external inspection of a dwelling to establish the presence or absence of visible damage that is consistent with pyritic heave and to quantify the extent and significance of such damage in that dwelling.  Damage ratings of 0, 1 or 2 can be assigned to a dwelling under this process.</p><p>The results of the Building Condition Assessment will inform whether the second step, i.e. sampling and testing of the sub-floor hardcore material, will be required in order to confirm the presence or otherwise of reactive pyrite.  Dwellings which have been tested and the hardcore is shown not to be susceptible to expansion are classified as Category A and may be issued with a green certificate.  These dwellings have a negligible risk of pyrite damage given that testing has demonstrated that the hardcore is not susceptible to expansion; any damage that may be visible in such dwellings is likely to be attributable to other causes.  Homeowners wishing to place their homes on the market may test their properties in accordance with I.S. 398-1:2013 and, where appropriate, obtain a green certificate from a competent person to show their home is not susceptible to pyritic heave.  However, my Department does not maintain statistics on the number of properties which have been provided with green certificates given there are no requirements on property owners to test their properties for pyrite nor are there any requirements to report on the issue of green certificates.</p><p>The Pyrite Panel&rsquo;s report provided the overarching framework for the development of the and the ensuing The Panel was clear in its view that only dwellings with significant damage due to pyritic heave should be remediated and that it would be unreasonable to expect dwellings not exhibiting such damage to be remediated unless or until they exhibit significant pyritic damage.  This remains the position with regard to dwellings which do not display significant pyritic damage.</p><p>The pyrite remediation scheme is a scheme of &ldquo;last resort&rdquo; and is limited in its application and scope.  The scheme is applicable to dwellings which are subject to significant damage attributable to pyritic heave established in accordance with I.S. 398-1:2013.  It is a condition of eligibility under the scheme that an application to the Board must be accompanied by a Building Condition Assessment with a Damage Condition Rating of 2.</p><p>While dwellings with a Damage Condition Rating of 1, or a 1 with progression, do not qualify under the scheme, some may be considered for inclusion at a later stage if the Board is satisfied that exceptional circumstances apply in accordance with the provisions of section 17 of the Act.  My Department also understands that, in a number of cases, dwellings which had a Damage Condition Rating of 1 when their Building Condition Assessments were first completed have now progressed to a Damage Condition Rating of 2; these dwellings have now been included in the pyrite remediation scheme.</p></reply>

The information was gathered from a number of sources including local authorities, structural guarantee providers, representatives of homeowners, private builders, construction professionals and public representatives and was cross referenced to verify, as far as practicable, its validity.</p><p>Seventy four estates were identified to the Pyrite Panel , as possibly having pyrite.  At the time of the (June 2012), all of these estates were located in the five local authority areas of Dublin City, Fingal, Kildare, Meath and Offaly, although two estates were subsequently identified in 2014 as having pyrite problems, one each in the administrative areas of Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and South Dublin County Council.</p><p>The Pyrite Panel recommended a categorisation system as a means of prioritising pyrite remediation works in recognition of the expensive and intrusive nature of pyrite remediation and the unpredictability of pyritic heave.  The Panel was clear in its view that only dwellings with significant damage due to pyritic heave should be remediated and that it would be unreasonable to expect dwellings not exhibiting such damage to be remediated.  Dwellings which have no significant damage but have reactive pyrite in the hardcore should be monitored and only remediated if they display significant damage due to pyritic heave.</p><p>The Panel&rsquo;s report provided the overarching framework for the development of the and the ensuing The scheme&rsquo;s eligibility criteria are reflective of the conclusions and recommendations of that report.

Under the Act, planning authorities are required to establish a register of vacant sites in their areas, beginning on 1 January 2017 and to issue annual notices to owners of vacant sites by 1 June 2018 in respect of vacant sites on the register on 1 January 2018.  The levy shall be applied by planning authorities, commencing on 1 January 2019 in respect of sites which were vacant and on the vacant site register during the year 2018 and shall subsequently be applied on an annual basis thereafter, as long as a site remains on the vacant site register in the preceding year. </p>  <p>  Planning authorities are empowered to apply an annual vacant site levy of 3% of the market value of vacant sites exceeding 0.05 hectares in area - with reduced or zero rates of levy applying in specific circumstances &ndash; which, in the planning authority&rsquo;s opinion, were vacant or idle in the preceding year, in areas identified by the planning authority in its development plan or local area plan for residential or regeneration development.  The 3% rate of vacant site levy is consistent with the rate applied to derelict sites under the Derelict Sites Act 1990 and is considered reasonable, without being over-punitive, for the purposes of incentivising the activation of such sites for residential or regeneration purposes.  In this regard, it is also worth noting that all levies due on an individual site shall remain a charge on the land concerned until all outstanding levies due are paid so there will be a cumulative effect associated with not activating a site for development purposes for each year a site remains vacant or idle.</p>  <p>  The proceeds of the levy raised on vacant sites by planning authorities will be used by them for the provision of housing and regeneration development in the local area in which vacant sites are located.  No more than 10% of the levy monies received by planning authorities may be used on their collection and administration costs.  At this time, it is not possible to provide an estimate of the annual levies that may be raised by planning authorities in the operation of the levy/or to estimate the annual levies that may be raised from application of different levy rates than those provided for, or by commencing the application of the levy at an earlier date than is provided for in the Act.</p></reply>

The Commissioner for Valuation has sole responsibility for all valuation matters.  The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority.  The annual rate on valuation (ARV), which is applied to the valuation for each property determined by the Valuation Office to obtain the amount payable in rates, is decided by the elected members of each local authority in the annual budget and its determination is a reserved function.  Rates income is a very important contribution to the cost of services provided by local authorities such as roads, public lighting, development control, parks and open spaces.  Locally elected members adopt the annual rate on valuation they consider necessary in order to provide the required services.  The information requested is not available in my Department.</p>  <p>  Under the provisions of the Local Government (Rates) Act 1970, a rating authority may make and carry out a scheme, providing for the waiver by the authority of all or a portion of commercial rates due by ratepayers in respect of a specified class or classes of property.  The making of such a scheme is subject to my consent as Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.  No rate waiver schemes have been consented to in respect of commercial property.</p>  <p>  Recent developments have seen some local authorities introduce locally designed business incentive schemes which promote the use of vacant commercial property.  Such schemes rely upon Part 9 of the Local Government Act 2001 which provides that the functions of local authorities include providing grants, loans guarantees or other financial aid to promote the interests of the local community, including economic interests.  Unlike rates waiver schemes, no Ministerial sanction is required for the setting up of these schemes.</p>  <p>  Taxation policy is a matter for the Minister for Finance.</p></reply>

This approach was taken in order to reduce the administrative burden for the many hundreds of community and voluntary groups registered under the scheme, who provide an excellent service for the elderly.</p>  <p>  The assessment of the tenders for the provision of alarms under the scheme, including the award of contracts, was managed separately by Pobal, following a public advertisement on eTenders on 20 October 2014.  The criteria for the tender evaluation process were a matter entirely for Pobal.  However, I understand that the evaluation process was comprehensive and objective, and centred around a designated set of procedures and disciplines.  The results of the evaluation process were submitted to Pobal senior management, who ultimately signed off on the recommendations therein.  This process was conducted in a robust manner consistent with EU and national Procurement Guidelines, and a panel of preferred suppliers was identified. </p>  <p>  The tender was broken down into 10 regional lots to ensure that potential SME suppliers were not disadvantaged due to excessively large lot sizes. A panel of regional suppliers was contracted to provide the equipment within specified regional areas while maintaining the benefits of local service provision. In accordance with the Invitation to Tender, a maximum number of three lots was set for which an interested party could tender in their own right. </p>  <p>  In addition, it was possible for companies who tendered for three lots independently to tender for up to three other lots under a consortium arrangement. Each regional lot contains a panel of ranked suppliers. The supplier ranked first is the supplier of choice for all local organisations in that lot unless they are unable to meet demand whereby the next ranked supplier will then be chosen to supply the equipment. </p>  <p>  Following a meeting in December 2014 between my predecessor and Deputy Brendan Ryan, a question arose as to whether this meeting impacted the procurement process or could render the process void. As a result, the tender process was paused by my Department pending clarification of a number of technical issues in this regard, and legal advice was sought on whether the process was impacted. </p>  <p>  In clarifying the technical issues, the focus for my Department was on ensuring that the parameters set out in the Pobal tender competition were in compliance with national and EU procurement guidelines and directives. Having considered the matter fully and taken advice, the process was found to be robust and compliant. It was agreed that Pobal would proceed with the tender process and bring it to a conclusion. The process was duly concluded and contracts awarded. </p>  <p>  Under the conditions of the tender, Pobal envisaged carrying out a re-ranking of equipment suppliers by September 2016. This was aimed at ensuring continued fairness from a competitive perspective so that those companies which finished lower down on the initial ranking would have an opportunity to improve their position. However, Pobal have advised that, for operational and strategic reasons, they have decided instead to terminate the supplier framework and undertake a general review of the scheme. The review will identify potential improvements, including technological advances. On completion of the review, a new scheme will be put in place. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that there will be no change to the valuable service provided to local community groups and elderly people during the review period. In this regard, Pobal are currently entering into temporary contracts with the existing suppliers to ensure continuity of service for up to twelve months. </p>  <p>I understand that consultation with relevant stakeholders, including local communities, service users and civic organisations, will be a key component of the review of this important scheme, the results of which will inform my Department&rsquo;s policy on the future direction of the Senior Alerts Scheme.   </p></reply>

The Scheme is open to eligible tenants, including joint tenants, of local authority houses that are available for sale under the Scheme.  To be eligible, tenants must meet certain criteria, including having a minimum reckonable income of &euro;15,000 per annum, have been in receipt of social housing support for at least 1 year and have been allocated a house under a local authority allocation scheme.</p><p>The minimum reckonable income for eligibility under the Scheme is determined by the relevant housing authority in accordance with the detailed provisions of the Ministerial Direction issued under Sections 24(3) and (4) of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014.  In the determination of the minimum reckonable income, housing authorities can include income from a number of different sources and classes, such as from employment, private pensions, maintenance payments and certain social welfare payments, including pensions, where the social welfare payment is secondary to employment income.</p><p>In determining reckonable income, the income of the tenants of the house, including adult children that are joint tenants can be included, as can the income of the spouse, civil partner or other partner/co-habitant of a tenant who lives in the house with them.</p><p>In order to ensure the sustainability of the scheme, it is essential that an applicant&rsquo;s income is of a long-term and sustainable nature.  This is necessary to ensure that the tenant purchasing the house is in a financial position, as the owner, to maintain and insure the property for the duration of the charged period, in compliance with the conditions of the order transferring the ownership of, and responsibility for, the house from the local authority to the tenant.</p><p>The Housing (Sale of Local Authority Houses) Regulations 2015 governing the Scheme provides for a number of specified classes of houses to be excluded from sale, including houses specifically designed for older persons, group Traveller housing and houses provided to facilitate people with disabilities transferring from institutional care to community-based living.  The Regulations do not exclude two bedroom houses from sale under the scheme.</p><p>Housing authorities may, within the provisions of the Regulations, exclude certain houses which, in the opinion of the authority, should not be sold for reasons such as proper stock or estate management.  It is a matter for each individual housing authority to administer the Scheme in its operational area in line with the over-arching provisions of the governing legislation for the scheme, and in a manner appropriate to its housing requirements.</p><p>The financing of any house sold under the Tenant (Incremental) Purchase Scheme is a separate matter from the eligibility criteria for the scheme.  In order to participate in the scheme, the tenant must, in the first instance, meet the eligibility criteria as set out in the relevant legislation.  If the tenant is deemed eligible under the scheme, he or she may fund the purchase of a house from one, or a combination of, own resources or a mortgage provided by a financial institution or a local authority house purchase loan.</p><p>In line with the commitment in the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government </i>and reaffirmed in <i>Rebuilding Ireland - Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, </i>I intend to undertake a review of the scheme in January 2017 following the first 12 months of operation and I will bring forward any changes to the terms and conditions of the scheme which are considered necessary based on the evidence gathered at that stage.</p></reply>

Local authorities and my Department are working closely together in order to ensure the successful implementation of the scheme.  Limerick City and County Council is currently providing a highly effective transactional shared service on behalf of all HAP local authorities.  This HAP Shared Service Centre (SSC) currently manages all HAP related rental transactions for the tenant, local authority and landlord.  Once a HAP application has been received and confirmed as valid by the relevant local authority, it is then processed by the HAP SSC.  Any rental payment arising for a given month will then be made to a landlord on the last Wednesday of that month.  HAP rental payments are payable to the landlord from the date of confirmation of receipt of a valid and complete application form.  If an applicant wishes to make an inquiry regarding an application they should contact their local authority directly.</p></reply>

The National Taking in Charge Initiative (NTICI) for residential estates, and the pilot scheme funding of &euro;10m, were announced in April 2016.  Its aim is to accelerate the taking-in-charge process of housing estates, including estates with developer-provided water services infrastructure.  The initiative draws upon data gathered from each of the 31 local authorities and collated by my Department in December 2015.  The data collected indicated that at that time, there were approximately 5,566 completed housing developments nationally which were not in the charge of local authorities.  This was as a result of both high rates of estate development over the past decade or so, and the success in resolving around 2,000 formerly unfinished housing developments, many of which are now awaiting taking in charge.</p><p>The information collected suggests that of the 5,566 developments yet to be taken in charge, there are approximately 914 estates with developer-provided infrastructure (DPI) and work is continuing on finalising this figure.  This infrastructure is mainly located within rural counties and the table below sets out the number of developments with DPIs per County and the number of associated housing units.

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost.  Participants in the Scheme contribute up to 80% of their assessable income and a maximum of 7.5% per annum of the value of assets held.  In the case of a couple, the applicant&rsquo;s means are assessed as 50% of the couple&rsquo;s combined income and assets.  The first &euro;36,000 of an individual&rsquo;s assets, or &euro;72,000 in the case of a couple, is not counted at all in the financial assessment.  The capital value of an individual&rsquo;s principal private residence is only included in the financial assessment for the first three years of their time in care. </p><p>There is no prohibition on an NHSS participant renting out their home if they wish.  Rental income is included in the overall calculation of the applicant&rsquo;s contribution towards the cost of care.  In addition, certain allowable deductions can be netted off against a person's means prior to the calculation of their contribution to care.  These include health expenses, income tax, social insurance contributions and levies required by law such as the Local Property Tax, and borrowings in respect of the principal private residence. </p><p>With regard to increasing the supply of properties in the rental market, <i>Rebuilding Ireland - Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness</i>has set out a practical and readily implementable set of actions to create a functioning and sustainable housing system.  The Plan is available at the website <i>www.rebuildingireland.ie.</i></p><p>The Plan is divided into five pillars, with each targeting a specific area of the housing system for attention. </p><p>Pillar 4 of the Plan, entitled <i><i>Improve the Rental Sector</i></i>, commits to developing a comprehensive strategy for the rental sector in Q4 2016.  The strategy will be structured around 4 key areas: security, standards, supply and services.  All issues that affect the availability of dwellings in the rental market will be considered during the development of the strategy; issues in that regard in relation to homes owned by individuals supported by the NHSS will be considered in that context.</p><p>In terms of supply, the Plan commits to the introduction of a new affordable rental scheme to enhance the capacity of the private rented sector to provide quality and affordable accommodation for households currently paying a disproportionate amount of disposable income on rent.  The objective of this scheme will be to provide long-term affordable accommodation for low to moderate income key-worker households in urban areas of high demand and provide an economic incentive to increase supply of rental accommodation.  The actions under Pillar 4 also include a commitment to examine standards, costs and feasibility of Build-to-Rent on a large scale, and commission research on ways in which further investment might be encouraged.</p><p>The overarching objective of the rental strategy will be to increase supply and support the development of a stable, strong and viable rental sector offering true choice for households, investment opportunities for providers and reflecting the rights and responsibilities of tenants and landlords.</p></reply>

The MTR has been refined since its introduction in 2013 to widen the criteria to allow for broader eligibility and more streamlined administration.  Despite this, the rate of uptake and progress on the scheme remains low.  The reasons for this are varied and can depend on the lender, the property, the household and the ability of the Approved Housing Body (AHB) sector to increase their involvement in the scheme.  To date 164 households have completed the MTR process and a further 675 cases are currently at various stages. </p><p><i>Rebuilding Ireland: An Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness</i>includes a commitment to review the MTR scheme to assess how it can assist more households in mortgage distress.  My Department will work together with the other key agents involved with the scheme, including lending institutions, and identify what further improvements or variations can be made to facilitate more households accessing the scheme.  This examination will include alternative financing and contractual arrangements to encourage greater support from AHBs, greater flexibility from lending institutions in supporting MTR as an attractive option for distressed borrowers, and the feasibility of an alternative model from the purchase of these units, including the potential for a long-term lease arrangement between local authorities and financial institutions.</p><p>As outlined in the Action Plan, the Government is committed to building on recent reforms and creating a framework that removes fear and bring predictability to a difficult process for those in mortgage arrears.  Through a range of actions, Government Departments and agencies will work together to find ways to encourage those who have not been able to engage, to reach a suitable long term debt resolution, and avoid repossession if possible.  A new national Mortgage Arrears Resolution Service will become available which will standardise supports available to borrowers in mortgage arrears, with powers and resources needed to advise, assess, negotiate and recommend solutions.  In addition, the Government will work with the Central Bank to ensure that the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears provides a strong consumer protection framework for borrowers struggling with their mortgage repayments.  This will include an assessment, to be conducted by the Central Bank, of existing sustainable restructuring solutions across all lenders and non-bank entities operating in Ireland to ensure that there are adequate sustainable restructuring solutions available to distressed borrowers.</p></reply>

In recognition that RAS tenants may have had reasonable expectations in regard to retaining access to traditional local authority rented accommodation, guidance issued by the Housing Agency in 2011 recommended that there should be a special transfer pathway for pre - 2011 RAS tenants to other forms of social housing support.  The arrangement effectively allows these households to be designated as a &lsquo;transfer&rsquo; applicant and to maintain their position for allocation as they had on the main waiting list.</p>  <p>  My Department has recently issued guidance to all local authorities on the treatment of pre - 2011 RAS tenants in the context of the 2016 Summary of Social Housing Assessments.

Cards are withdrawn when the business case no longer exists and transferred into the name of the incoming officer, as appropriate, when there is a reassignment of duties. </p><p>Credit cards are issued to private secretaries to facilitate payment for goods or services which would prove more difficult under normal invoicing arrangements, such as reserving hotel accommodation abroad.  In the cases of Met &Eacute;ireann and ICT, the credit cards are used to facilitate the purchase of ICT hardware and software licences and for the renewal of subscriptions to work-related publications.</p><p>In order to ensure there are adequate controls in place my Department has developed a credit card policy which is summarised as follows:</p><p>1. The issue of Departmental credit cards is subject to approval by my Department&rsquo;s HR and Accommodation Section.  Once approved my Department&rsquo;s Accounts Section processes the required documentation and, on receipt of the card from the bank forwards it to the applicant. </p><p>2. No person may approve the issue of, or increase the limit of, their own card or the card of a person to whom they report, nor may they approve access to a permanent cash advance facility for themselves or a person to whom they report.  No cardholder may authorise the approval of their own expenses.</p><p>3. Cardholders are responsible for the safe custody of cards and the security of card information, and are trusted to spend Departmental funds prudently.  Loss or theft of the card should be reported immediately to both the bank and the appropriate Officer in my Department&rsquo;s Accounts Section.  Cardholders are required keep a record of the bank telephone number to which they should report lost or stolen cards.  This would be especially useful where the card is lost or stolen abroad.</p><p>4. Cardholders must retain supporting documentation for all expenses incurred on their card.  Once the credit card bills are received by my Department&rsquo;s Accounts Section, they are sent to the relevant cardholders together with the requisite form to be completed by them.  Each cardholder must complete and sign the form prior to forwarding to the Accounts Section for payment.</p><p>5. Credit cards may only be used for transactions associated with the administrative and official activities of the Department.  Misuse of a Departmental credit card in breach of this policy may result in the cancellation or withdrawal of the card.  Misuse includes:</p><p>a) Using the card for a private transaction such as a personal purchase or purchases for the sole benefit of the cardholder.</p><p>b) Assigning or transferring the card to another person. </p><p>c) Using the card after the cardholder's employment or relationship has been suspended or terminated.</p><p>d) Using a Departmental credit card when not the cardholder named on the card and without the named cardholder's specific authority.</p><p>e) Using the card for a transaction in excess of budget or for which there are insufficient funds.</p><p>6. Cardholders must return their Departmental credit card permanently when: a) they leave their employment or engagement of the Department, or </p><p>b) they no longer require use of the card as part of their Departmental duties.</p><p>7. Cardholders must return their Departmental credit card temporarily for safekeeping to my Department&rsquo;s Accounts Section when they take periods of extended leave from their Departmental activities.</p><p>8. Departmental credit cards may be withdrawn or cancelled by either my Department&rsquo;s HR and Accommodation or Accounts Sections.</p><p>These controls are considered adequate and their robustness is demonstrated in the segregation of functions in the approval and payment process where the input of two business units within my Department is required in the issuing of a card and the making of a payment and is further strengthened as either business unit can independently withdraw or cancel a card where appropriate.</p></reply>

A Fire Safety Certificate is generally required before construction work is commenced in the case of a new apartment block, a new building other than a dwelling or an existing building other than a dwelling undergoing an extension, a material alteration or a material change of use.

Projects are implemented by approved housing bodies working with local authorities and funding of up to 100% of costs can be provided.  In addition, my Department supports local authorities in the development and improvement of specific accommodation that the authorities themselves provide for older persons.  I am also acutely aware of the social benefit accruing from the continued independent occupancy in their own homes by older people and people with a disability.  For that reason, my Department provides funding under the suite of Housing Adaptation Grants for Older People and People with a Disability, to assist households to have necessary repairs or improvement works carried out in order to facilitate the continued independent occupancy of their homes.  The grants are 80% funded by my Department, with a 20% contribution from the resources of each local authority.  The Housing Aid for Older People Scheme provides grants of up to &euro;8,000 to assist older people living in poor housing conditions to have necessary repairs or improvements carried out.</p><p>Grant-eligible works include structural repairs or improvements, re-wiring, repairs to or replacement of windows and doors, provision of water supply and sanitary facilities, provision of heating, cleaning, painting, etc.  The Mobility Aids Grant Scheme is available to fast track grants of up to &euro;6,000 to cover a basic suite of works to address the mobility problems of a member of a household.  Qualifying works include the provision of stair lifts, level access showers, access ramps, grab rails and some minor adaptation works.</p><p>Given the importance of housing adaptation and other grants that help older people live comfortably in their own homes for longer, my Department is committed, under <i>Rebuilding Ireland: An </i>Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, to explore how the process of accessing these grants can be streamlined and simplified into the future.</p><p>My Department oversees the housing needs assessment undertaken by local authorities to capture the social housing requirements of older citizens.  Current housing legislation requires local authorities to classify any specific accommodation requirements of a qualified household where one or more household member is aged 65 years or more.  This information is collated as part of the statutory summary of social housing assessments.</p><p>In addition, my Department is also responsible for the Seniors Alert Scheme which encourages community support for vulnerable older people in our communities.  The scheme provides funding for the purchase and installation of personal monitored alarms to enable older persons, of limited means, to continue to live securely in their homes with confidence, independence and peace of mind.  The scheme is administered by local community and voluntary groups with the support of Pobal.</p><p>Furthermore, Part M (Access and Use) of the Building Regulations aims to foster an inclusive approach to the design and construction of the built environment.  The requirements of Part M underpin the principle of Universal Design, which is defined in the Disability Act 2005 as &ldquo;the design and composition of an environment so that it may be accessed, understood and used to the greatest practicable extent, in the most independent and natural manner possible, in the widest possible range of situations and without the need for adaptation, modification, assistive devices or specialised solutions, by persons of any age or size or having any particular physical, sensory, mental health or intellectual ability or disability&rdquo;.</p><p>My Department has ongoing contact with other Departments and State bodies with regard to the areas outlined above, including with the Department of Health as lead Department in respect of the .</p><p>Contact with local authorities in relation to the implementation of these actions is also a continuous feature of my Department&rsquo;s work, in particular in relation to the provision of new sheltered housing for older people and the carrying out of improvement works to facilitate the continued independent occupancy of their homes by older people.</p></reply>

Social regeneration funding is provided to Dublin City Council (and formerly Ballymun Regeneration Ltd which has been wound-down) and the Council determines funding levels for the various groups who are involved in social regeneration activities.  This funding was paid out of my Department&rsquo;s capital budget for regeneration, which focuses predominantly on physical regeneration but with a small allocation for social regeneration activities for those areas that are actively undergoing physical regeneration.  As the physical regeneration in Ballymun reached its conclusion in 2014, my Department advised the Council in 2015 that, while it is committed to continuing to support social initiatives in the short term, funding would cease over time.  This would allow the Council and the groups that it funded adequate time to seek alternative, sustainable sources of funding for their work.  In this respect, I have made available &euro;1.7 million to Dublin City Council for funding for social regeneration activities in Ballymun during 2016.  My Department will work with the City Council on a transition over the coming years from funding provided under the Regeneration programme.</p></reply>

However, as with other private rental tenancies, the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 governs the relationship between landlord and tenant and the length of the tenancy is a matter that must be agreed between the landlord and tenant in that context.  Under the HAP scheme, tenants supported by the scheme are expected to stay in their current tenancy for a minimum period of two years, unless there are exceptional reasons for moving tenancy.  Such exceptional reasons, include moving for the purpose of employment, further education, family or health reasons.  Since 1 January 2016, landlords who rent to tenants in receipt of social housing supports such as HAP may avail of increased tax relief.  The scheme allows property owners to claim 100 per cent relief on their mortgage interest, as an expense against rental income.  The purpose of this tax relief is to incentivise landlords to maintain tenancies with social housing tenants for longer periods.  To qualify, the landlord must undertake to make the accommodation available to qualifying tenants for a minimum period of three years, and the undertaking must be registered with the Residential Tenancies Board.</p>  <p>  HAP is a form of social housing support under which local authorities will make monthly payments on behalf of tenants directly to landlords in respect of rent, subject to the terms and conditions of the scheme.  HAP tenants are required to sign a rent contribution agreement to pay a weekly rental contribution to the local authority in line with the local authority&rsquo;s differential rent scheme.  As set out in the rent contribution agreement, this weekly rental contribution must be paid by them so that they remain eligible for the HAP scheme.  If this weekly rent contribution is not paid, HAP payments to the landlord can be stopped or suspended.</p>  <p>  The HAP Shared Service Centre (SSC) manages the collection of all HAP tenants&rsquo; differential rents, on behalf of the relevant local authority, and the payment of all HAP rents to landlords on behalf of tenants supported by the HAP scheme.  The HAP SSC applies a very clear communication policy when rental arrears issues arise.  This policy includes regular and early written communication with tenants, landlords and the relevant local authority when a tenancy is being jeopardised by non-payment of rent.  To date the approach used has been very effective with minimal levels of rent arrears arising for HAP tenants, and more than 13,000 tenancies currently being supported by the HAP scheme.</p></reply>

The duty of care provisions have been augmented by the Water Services (Amendment) Act 2012 and associated regulations.  Any person whose treatment system fails an inspection or, in the absence of an inspection, considers that their treatment system constitutes, or may constitute, a risk to human health or the environment is responsible for having any necessary remediation works carried out without delay.</p><p>Local authorities carry out inspections of septic tanks and similar systems for a variety of reasons, including water quality issues at drinking water sources or within designated shellfish or bathing water catchments and arising from reports of pollution from members of the public.  Separately, inspections are carried out based on the Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s (EPA) <i>National Inspection Plan 2015 &ndash; 2017: Domestic Waste Water Treatment Systems.</i>This plan uses a risk-based methodology for the selection of systems for inspection , taking into account factors such as densities of individual treatment systems across the numerous hydrological and geological settings in Ireland and the locations of sensitive groundwater or surface water receptors.  The selection of treatment systems for inspection under the EPA plan is carried out by the local authorities using an IT system developed by the EPA.  Householders cannot request inspections of their own treatment systems, nor are inspections under the plan carried out based on third party complaints.</p><p>The Domestic Waste Water Treatment Systems (Financial Assistance) Regulations 2013 brought into operation a grant scheme to assist with the cost of remediation of septic tanks and domestic waste water treatment systems which are deemed, following inspection under the EPA National Inspection Plan, to require repair or upgrading.  The Regulations provide that, subject to the applicant meeting all qualification criteria, a local authority may pay a grant to a person who is required, following an inspection, to have repairs or upgrades to, or replacement of, a septic tank or other domestic waste water treatment system.  The grant scheme ensures that the limited financial resources available are targeted towards householders, particularly those on lower incomes, who incur expenditure directly as a result of the implementation of the Water Services (Amendment) Act 2012.  It is not proposed to introduce a further scheme in the area at this time.  Full details of the scheme, including eligibility criteria, are set out in the explanatory leaflet and application form published on my Department&rsquo;s website at: </p><p><i>. </i></p><p>Householders who do not meet the eligibility criteria for the grant under the aforementioned Regulations and who wish to remediate or upgrade their on-site treatment systems may qualify for relief under the Home Renovation Incentive (HRI) Scheme introduced pursuant to Section 5 of the Finance (No. 2) Act 2013.  The HRI Scheme covers main residence repairs, renovations and improvements, including the repair or replacement of septic tanks.  The Scheme is administered by the Revenue Commissioners and full details are published on the Revenue Commissioner&rsquo;s website at <i>www.revenue.ie.</i></p></reply>

However, HAP recipients may access other forms of social housing supports, by applying to go on the local authority transfer list.  On 16 December 2014, a statutory direction was issued to all authorities involved in the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) statutory pilot, instructing them to take the necessary steps to ensure that households benefiting from HAP can avail of a move to other forms of social housing support, should they wish to do so, through the transfer option.  Local authorities were also directed that HAP recipients, who apply to go on the transfer list, should get full credit for the time they spent on the waiting list and be placed on the transfer list with no less favourable terms than if they had remained on the waiting list.  In practice, housing authorities inform HAP recipients in writing of their entitlement to apply to go on the transfer list when they are approved for HAP.  As of 12 September 2016, 169 households have transferred from the scheme to other forms of social housing support.</p></reply>

A very limited number of exemptions from motor tax have been added over the years, including exemptions for vehicles used exclusively for mountain and cave rescue purposes and for vehicles used exclusively for underwater search and recovery purposes, introduced in the Motor Vehicle (Duties and Licences) Act 2001.  There have been no additions to the categories of vehicles exempted from motor tax since then.  While no immediate changes are proposed, I am prepared, in consultation with the Minister for Finance, to consider the proposal while at the same time carefully analysing the cost to the Exchequer and general narrowing of the motor tax base, which is a vital revenue stream for the Local Government Fund.</p></reply>

The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of income needed to provide for a household's basic needs plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country.  The limits also reflect a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn and thereby promote sustainable communities.</p><p>I am satisfied that the current income limits generally provide for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households unable to provide accommodation from their own resources.

This &euro;5.35bn investment comprises some &euro;4.5 billion in capital funding and &euro;844 million in support of programmes funded from current expenditure. </p><p>Of the 47,000 units, it is estimated at this stage that approximately 26,000 will be constructed, while 11,000 will be acquired by local authorities and AHBs directly from the market or the Housing Agency, with a portion of these being newly built units.  The 10,000 units will be leased by local authorities and AHBs, which includes an estimated 5,000 units to be sourced from the NTMA Special Purpose Vehicle and a further 5,000 properties to be secured from a combination of the Repair and Leasing Initiative that will be piloted shortly and under long-term lease arrangements by local authorities and AHBs from a range of different sources, not including Part V.  This therefore includes a mix of units from the existing housing stock and newly built units.  Overall, it is estimated that around 4,700 units could be secured for social housing from Part V agreements. </p><p>The actual breakdown of delivery will ultimately depend on many factors, including activity in the private sector, capacity of local authorities and AHBs and readiness of projects.  However, delivering the 47,000 units targeted will require concerted effort by both local authorities and AHBs, as shown in the following table.<table><tr><th>-</th><th><div>Build </div></th><th><div>Acquire </div></th><th><div>Leasing </div></th><th><div>Totals </div></th></tr><tr><td><div>LA </div></td><td><div>18,718 </div></td><td><div>2,276 </div></td><td><div>3,500 </div></td><td><div>24,494 </div></td></tr><tr><td><div>AHB </div></td><td><div>4,698 </div></td><td><div>8,652 </div></td><td></td><td><div>13,350 </div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div>LA/AHB </div></td><td><div>2,620 </div></td><td></td><td><div>6,536 </div></td><td><div>9,156 </div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><div>26,036 </div></td><td><div>10,928 </div></td><td><div>10,036 </div></td><td><div>47,000 </div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></table></p></reply>

These allocations take into account the passing of resolutions by the elected members to reduce the basic rate of LPT by 15% in each year.  As a result of the local retention of LPT, Dublin City Council, along with a number of other local authorities, received a greater level of LPT funding in 2015 and 2016 compared to the level of funding received from General Purpose Grants in 2014.</p><p>Accordingly, in 2015, Dublin City Council was required to self-fund some services in Housing and Roads areas to the value of &euro;46,928,249, thereby replacing Central Government funding for some of these services. In 2016, the self-funding requirement was &euro;43,861,135. </p><p>It is a matter for each local authority to determine its own spending priorities in the context of the annual budgetary process having regard to both locally identified needs and available resources.  It is therefore a matter for Dublin City Council to decide how to spend the remainder of the LPT allocation in this context.  The elected members of a local authority have direct responsibility in law for all reserved functions of the authority, which includes adopting the annual budget, and are democratically accountable for all expenditure by the local authority.</p><p>The LPT allocations to Dublin City Council along with details of allocations in each local authority area are published, as a matter of course, on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link:  <i><font color="#0000FF"> </font></i></p><p><i></i>.</p></reply>

A number of other proposals, that may be advanced using this approach, are currently being discussed between local authorities and my Department, as part of the informal consultation that happens at technical level in the development of new construction proposals. I expect this will lead to further take-up on this initiative over time.  I have had a number of discussions with local authorities on a range of housing issues, both with individual councils - including elected members and officials - and with gatherings of chief executives.  These discussions have included ideas to accelerate delivery of new housing and while it will ultimately be a choice for each local authority to make on a case by case basis as to whether they utilise the single-stage approval arrangement, I would also emphasise the actions that have been taken to improve all approval arrangements on social housing construction projects.  The standard approval process has been further streamlined and as it runs in parallel to the design and planning of projects by local authorities, it is a beneficial option for local authorities to avail of.  My Department has also further improved communication regarding approval processes which has included information seminars attended by over 300 staff of local authorities and approved housing bodies, supported by additional resources which have been assigned to my Department&rsquo;s housing function.   </p>  <p>As part of a further process review currently underway, consideration will be given to potential steps that may support greater use of the single-stage approval process.   </p></reply>

The strategy will be structured around 4 key areas: security, standards, supply and services.  In terms of supply, the strategy will focus on maintaining existing levels of rental stock and encouraging investment in additional supply.  All issues that affect the availability of dwellings in the rental market will be considered during the development of the strategy. </p><p>In addition, the Plan commits to the introduction of a new affordable rental scheme to enhance the capacity of the private rented sector to provide quality and affordable accommodation for households currently paying a disproportionate amount of disposable income on rent.  The objective of this scheme will be to provide long-term affordable accommodation for low to moderate income key-worker households in urban areas of high demand and provide an economic incentive to increase supply of rental accommodation.  The actions under Pillar 4 also include a commitment to examine standards, costs and feasibility of Build-to-Rent on a large scale, and commission research on ways in which further investment might be encouraged.</p><p>The overarching objective of the strategy will be to increase supply and support the development of a stable, strong and viable rental sector offering true choice for households, investment opportunities for providers and reflecting the rights and responsibilities of tenants and landlords.</p></reply>

The primary purpose of the Act is to replace the system whereby a vehicle was declared off the road retrospectively with a system under which the vehicle must be declared off the road in advance.  The system of making retrospective declarations had become a means of evasion of motor tax estimated to have cost some &euro;50m annually.  The Act provides that a vehicle can be declared off the road for a minimum period of three months and a maximum period of twelve months.  Where the owner of a vehicle wishes to make a declaration of non-use, he or she must do so during the final month of an existing tax disc or a previously made declaration of non-use.  The declaration can be made on-line at <i>www.motortax.ie</i>or through the local motor tax office, and there is no fee for doing so.  The National Vehicle and Driver File, under the auspices of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, issues renewal notices at the beginning of the final month to remind motorists that a vehicle must be either taxed or declared off the road for a further period. </p><p>Where a declaration of non-use is not made in the final month of a tax disc or previously made declaration of non-use, a vehicle must be taxed for the minimum period provided for in motor tax legislation, which is three months in most cases, and annually in instances where the annual rate of tax is less than &euro;119.  A new declaration can then be made at any stage during the final month of the new motor tax disc if the vehicle is thereafter not going to be in use in a public place.</p><p>Where an application for motor tax is being made, the owner of the vehicle must produce to a licensing authority, if so requested by that authority, evidence of insurance in respect of the vehicle.</p><p>Exemptions are not provided for in individual cases; this is to protect the new arrangement allowing owners to declare a vehicle off the road after the expiry of a current declaration of non-use would be a retrograde step and would undermine the overall objective of the legislative change. </p></reply>

A substantial volume of information has now been provided by affected homeowners in both counties, as well as from Donegal and Mayo County Councils, which will be of particular assistance in completing the necessary research to inform the preparation of the panel&rsquo;s report.   </p>  <p>  In the case of Donegal specifically, the panel visited the owners of nine affected homes during the second week of May in order to view first-hand the problems that have emerged in those homes.  Meetings with representatives from the Mica Action Group and with both the elected members and officials from Donegal County Council were also held in order to seek additional information on the nature of the problems that have emerged in the blockwork of the affected homes.  The panel also met with members of the Oireachtas from Donegal in late July to discuss the problems that have emerged in the blockwork of certain homes in the county.</p>  <p>  Separate to the panel, I have also held meetings in June last with the elected members from Donegal County Council and with representatives from the Mica Action Group in order to hear their concerns directly.  In addition, I visited three of the affected dwellings and spoke with the homeowners concerned on the very difficult and distressing situations they are facing due to the damage to their homes.  I also visited a number of affected homes in Mayo in late July and met with the homeowners to discuss the problems they are facing with regard to their homes.   </p>  <p>  Earlier this month, the panel visited twelve homes in Mayo in order to observe the problems that have emerged in those homes and to gain an insight into the damage from homeowners.  Meetings also took place with both the elected members and with officials from Mayo County Council in order to hear of their experiences in the matter.   </p>  <p>  Further meetings have taken place with a number of industry bodies and additional meetings are anticipated with other interested parties before the panel conclude their research into the problems that have emerged in the affected homes.   </p>  <p>  Ultimately, the panel&rsquo;s terms of reference aim to establish the facts behind the problems that have emerged in Donegal and Mayo and to outline technical options for addressing the problems identified in order to assist affected homeowners.  It is anticipated that the panel will complete their report before the end of the year.  In this regard, I will await the outcome of the panel&rsquo;s report before considering what further actions may be required to assist the parties directly involved in reaching a satisfactory resolution to the problems that have emerged in the two counties.   </p></reply>

My Department is not generally responsible for the provision of services to the public directly; our agencies and the local authorities administer services and schemes of this nature on our behalf.  In the area of Franchise, for example, the compilation and maintenance of the register of electors is the responsibility of local authorities as registration authorities and they are assisted in this process by the Local Government Management Agency (LGMA) via the I-Reg system.  I understand that the LGMA was fully involved in integrating Eircodes into the I-Reg system for the 2016/2017 register of electors which came into force on 15 February 2016.  The register has been populated with Eircodes so that polling cards issued to electors include the Eircode.  In addition, my Department has updated the range of electoral register application forms, many of which are prescribed or directed under the Electoral Acts, to provide for applicants to include their Eircode.</p><p>The LGMA also maintains the online system whereby people can check that they are correctly registered.  I understand from the LGMA, that the ability to check voter registration details on <i>www.checktheregister.ie</i>. via the designated Eircode is progressing and, at this time, has been included as part of the search facility in 28 of the 31 local authority sites. </p><p>My Department continues to work towards making greater use of the Eircode system.  For example, the integration and use of Eircode datasets will be incorporated into the functionality of the next generation of the Fire Services Command and Control System, currently in development.</p><p>Finally, with regard to the agencies under the aegis of my Department, all were informed of the national postcode system and those agencies use Eircodes when corresponding with households via An Post.  In some instances, agencies have encoded their address databases with Eircodes or are actively looking at mechanisms for systematically applying Eircodes to all customer records on databases.</p></reply>

Addressing poor accommodation standards in the sector is an integral part of this process.</p><p>Minimum standards for rental accommodation are prescribed in the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2008, as amended by the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) (Amendment) Regulations 2009, made under section 18 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992.  The Regulations specify requirements in relation to a range of matters, such as structural repair, sanitary facilities, heating, ventilation, natural light and safety of gas and electrical supply.  With very limited exemptions, these regulations apply to local authority and voluntary housing units as well as private rented residential accommodation.  All landlords have a legal obligation to ensure that their rented properties comply with these regulations. </p><p>Responsibility for the enforcement of the regulations rests with the relevant local authority supported by a dedicated stream of funding provided from part of the proceeds of tenancy registration fees collected by the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB).  Since the establishment of the RTB, over &euro;32 million has been paid to local authorities to assist them in the performance of their functions under the Housing Acts, including the inspection of rented accommodation.  Over 185,000 inspections have been carried out in this period.  </p><p>Following the enactment of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, local authorities have a strengthened legislative framework available to them which provides for the issuing of Improvement Notices and Prohibition Notices where landlords are in breach of their obligations.  Fines for non-compliance with the regulations were also increased; the maximum fine increased from &euro;3,000 to &euro;5,000 and the fine for each day of a continuing offence increased from &euro;250 to &euro;400.</p><p><b></b>Under section 34 of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004, a landlord may terminate a tenancy where he or she wishes to substantially refurbish or renovate the dwelling in a way which requires the dwelling to be vacated for that purpose, or where the landlord intends to change the use of the dwelling.  The Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2015 introduced additional requirements applying to such terminations.  These measures involve<i>,</i>among other things, a landlord having to provide a copy of the planning permission obtained for the works, if applicable, or where planning permission is not required, a statement specifying the details of the works, the name of the contractor employed to carry out the intended works, the dates on which the intended works are to be carried out and the proposed duration of the works.  Furthermore, the landlord is required to offer to the tenant a tenancy in the dwelling, if the dwelling becomes available for re-letting within a period of 6 months from the expiry of the period of notice given, in certain circumstances. </p><p>Where there is an abuse of the termination procedure in section 34, a tenant may bring a complaint to the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB).  On the hearing of the complaint the RTB, it if considers it proper to do so, may make a direction that damages are paid to the tenant or that the tenant be permitted to resume possession of the dwelling, or both.</p><p>With respect to local authority properties, my Department continues to provide strong support to local authorities in achieving maximum use of their stock and return units back to productive use in an energy efficient condition at a reasonable cost and for this purpose the Department provides funding of up to a maximum of &euro;30,000 per eligible unit. </p><p>Funding is allocated on an equitable and evidence based system adjudicated and weighted under a predetermined set of criteria, funding is provided in this manner so that the maximum number of units can be provided with the funds available under the programme.  This funding is on top of work undertaken by the local authorities themselves on units that become vacant through normal pre-letting works.  There is no requirement for local authorities to hold social housing stock in a vacant state for a specific period before drawing down funding support from my Department; in fact local authorities are encouraged to carry out works on all such housing units as soon as possible in order that units can be re-let speedily.</p></reply>

My Department&rsquo;s role is to ensure that there are adequate structures and supports in place to assist the authorities in providing such accommodation, including a national framework of policy, legislation and funding.  I understand that there have been no evictions from authorised traveller-specific sites.  As regards unauthorised sites, section 10 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992, as amended by section 21 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2002, sets out the powers of local authorities in respect of unauthorised Traveller encampments. It provides that:   </p>  <p>- local authorities have the power to remove an authorised Traveller encampment from a public place where it is located within five miles of an approved halting site, provided alternative accommodation is available on any approved site to which the unauthorised encampment can be moved;   </p>  <p>- subject to the same proviso regarding available alternative accommodation, local authorities have the power to remove an unauthorised encampment from a public place where this is unfit for human habitation, or is likely to interfere with public or private amenities, or constitutes a health hazard; and   </p>  <p>- where an unauthorised encampment is located in a public place within one mile of approved Traveller accommodation, it may be removed to a location which is not less than one mile from such approved accommodation, whether or not alternative accommodation is available.   </p>  <p>  While there is no statutory obligation to do so, in practice in cases involving the evictions of Travellers from unauthorised encampments, local authorities do seek to consult and negotiate with affected persons and families in advance of using eviction legislation. </p>  <p>  Local Traveller Accommodation Consultative Committees (LTACCs), which include Traveller representatives, elected Members, local authority officials and other stakeholders, have a statutory role in advising local authorities on the provision and management of accommodation for Travellers and are a liaison between Travellers and Members and officials in local authorities.  It is important they discharge their functions effectively and consistently within and across local authorities.  To this end, the National Traveller Accommodation Consultative Committee is organising a conference for 4 November 2016 for all LTACCs with a view to improving their future operational effectiveness.</p></reply>

I wish to thank Veterinary Ireland for their comprehensive review of the Control of Dogs legislation and to acknowledge their positive comments in relation to the various legislative enactments in the areas of animal health and welfare, in particular the commencement of the Dog Breeding Establishments Act 2010 and Microchipping of Dogs Regulations 2015.</p>  <p>  The overall thrust of dog control legislation is to place the onus on dog owners and those in control of dogs to act responsibly by keeping their dogs under effectual control, irrespective of breed.  Such responsible dog ownership is the key to reducing incidences of dog biting and other problem behaviours. </p>  <p>  The Control of Dogs Acts 1986 to 2010 set out a range of requirements for all dog owners or any other person in charge of a dog.  In particular, section 9 of the 1986 Act requires the owner or any other person in charge of a dog to accompany it and keep it under effectual control in any place other than the premises of the owner, the premises of the person in control of the dog, or other premises with the consent of the owner of the premises.  Section 21 of the 1986 Act provides that the owner of a dog shall be liable in damages for damage caused in an attack on any person by the dog.</p>  <p>  In addition to the foregoing, the Control of Dogs Regulations 1998 set out further requirements that owners of specific breeds of dogs have to follow, namely that such dogs must be muzzled and led, on a sufficiently strong leash or chain not exceeding 2 metres in length, by a competent person over 16 years of age when in a public place.  The specific control requirements for these restricted breeds are a balanced and workable arrangement which recognises the rights of dog owners, respects animal welfare to the extent possible, while also taking account of the needs of society to be protected from dogs with a significant capability to inflict very serious injury, or cause death. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the restrictions under the current legislative framework provide the necessary controls for the protection of society.  However, I will ask my Department to work with all relevant stakeholders to review the findings of the Veterinary Ireland policy document.</p></reply>

The Scheme is open to eligible tenants, including joint tenants, of local authority houses that are available for sale under the Scheme.  To be eligible, tenants must meet certain criteria, including having a minimum reckonable income of &euro;15,000 per annum, have been in receipt of social housing support for at least 1 year and have been allocated a house under a local authority allocation scheme.  Housing authorities may, within the provisions of the Regulations governing the scheme &ndash; the Housing (Sale of Local Authority Houses) Regulations 2015 &ndash; exclude certain houses which, in the opinion of the authority, should not be sold for reasons such as proper stock or estate management.  It is a matter for each individual housing authority to administer the scheme in its operational area in line with the over-arching provisions of the governing legislation for the scheme, and in a manner appropriate to its housing requirements.</p><p>Notwithstanding this, the provisions of Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, are designed to enable the development of mixed tenure sustainable communities.  Part V units are excluded from the Tenant (Incremental) Purchase Scheme to ensure that units delivered under this mechanism will remain available for people in need of social housing support and that the original policy goals of the legislation are not eroded over time.  The continued development of mixed tenure communities remains very important in promoting social integration.</p><p>In line with the commitment in the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government,</i>reaffirmed in <i>Rebuilding Ireland - Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness,</i>I intend to undertake a review of the scheme in January 2017 following the first 12 months of operation and I will bring forward any changes to the terms and conditions of the scheme which are considered necessary based on the evidence gathered at that stage.</p></reply>

The Plan contains a number of integrated actions to underpin land supply management, including the development of a national Land Supply Management Strategy, within the context of the new National Planning Framework. </p><p>This will involve identifying and mapping sites in local authority and public ownership with appropriate lands to be master-planned to deliver increased mixed-tenure housing, including social and more affordable housing.</p><p>In addition, it is envisaged that local authorities will be supported in acquiring housing lands in key developable areas, and strategic opportunities for urban renewal and regeneration will be identified for co-ordinated action across relevant public sector bodies.The National Planning Framework is due for publication in the second Quarter of 2017.</p><p>Furthermore, the Housing Agency, in consultation with my Department and local authorities, has already commenced the mapping of the circa 700 sites in local authority ownership and those held by the Agency under the Land Aggregation Scheme, showing their location, size, boundaries and other information.  The map will be made available in due course and will be updated to record the development and use of these lands.</p><p>In 2014, my Department, in conjunction with local authority planning departments, carried out a national survey of all lands zoned for residential development in statutory local authority development plans and local area plans across Ireland.

A Cathaoirleach is responsible, inter alia, for the conduct of business and maintenance of order at meetings of the elected council.  Major decisions of policy within local authorities rest with the elected members.  The elected members, in the exercise of this policy role, operate on a basis akin to that of a board of directors served by a full time chief executive.  The elected council also has various powers in relation to the operation of the executive role.  These allow for overview and direction of the affairs of the local authority generally, and for directing the chief executive in the performance of the executive role in certain circumstances. </p>  <p>  Section 149 of the 2001 Act requires that the functions of the chief executive shall be performed in accordance with the policy of the local authority as determined by the elected members and that the chief executive in performing his/her functions shall have regard to the views of elected members expressed at meetings of the council (at plenary, municipal district or committee level) or in written input from elected members concerning policy development.  The chief executive, when requested, must also report on actions undertaken, or planned to be undertaken, in exercise of executive functions.   </p>  <p>  In each local authority, both the elected members and the executive have the common interest of serving the community but their responsibilities are necessarily distinct within the relevant legislative framework.  The detailed working arrangements to be utilised within this framework in order to secure the effective and efficient provision of services for the community are a matter for determination at local level. </p></reply>

The Directive broadly defines a nearly zero-energy building as a building with a high energy performance where the very low amount of energy required should, to a very significant extent, be met by energy from renewable sources, including renewable energy produced onsite or nearby.  The statutory minimum energy performance standards for buildings are addressed under Part L (Conservation of Fuel and Energy) of the Building Regulations and the accompanying Technical Guidance Documents.</p>  <p>  Against this background, Ireland has been making significant progress in terms of both improving energy efficiency and reducing carbon dioxide emissions within the built environment.  Taking the energy efficiency requirements established in 2005 as the benchmark, the Building Regulations (Amendment) Regulations 2007 set the requirements necessary to achieve a 40% improvement (over the 2005 standards) in the energy and carbon performance of new dwellings.  The requirements were subsequently upgraded under the Building Regulations (Part L Amendment) Regulations 2011, which has delivered a 60% aggregate improvement (relative to 2005 standards) in both the energy and carbon performance of new dwellings.  My Department envisages one further upgrade to the Part L requirements in order to ensure Ireland meets our &lsquo;nearly zero energy&rsquo; obligation for dwellings by 31 December 2020.</p>  <p>  Part L of the Building Regulations was also revised in 2008 in respect of buildings other than dwellings which introduced the methodology (known as NEAP or the Non-domestic Energy Assessment Procedure) to measure the energy demand and carbon dioxide emissions for new buildings other than dwellings.  A further review, which is being developed in conjunction with public sector bodies, of Part L in respect of buildings other than dwellings which is now at an advanced stage will set out the statutory requirements for nearly zero energy for new non-domestic buildings, including new buildings occupied and owned by public authorities, in order to meet the requirements of the Directive.</p>  <p>  The current review of Part L (Conservation of Fuel and Energy) in respect of buildings other than dwellings will be informed by a comprehensive public consultation process which my Department intends to announce shortly.</p></reply>

This legislation provides for global valuations of utility undertakings to be carried out by the Valuation Office every five years and entered on the central valuation list.  This can result in either increases or decreases to the relevant valuation.  In 2015, the Valuation Office carried out global valuations for Gas Networks Ireland, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and telecommunications companies BT Ireland, Eircom, Vodafone, Three Ireland and Meteor.  In November 2015, the Valuation Office issued a copy of the Valuation Certificate and a schedule setting out the apportioned value for each rating authority to my Department.  The previous valuation for these utilities had taken place in 2010.  The Global Valuation Certificates showed a reduction in the combined valuations for these utilities. In addition, the reduction in the global valuation of the ESB, following an appeal to the Valuation Tribunal, reduced the rates payable by the ESB from 2016.</p>  <p>  The timing of the global valuations in 2015 caused particular difficulties for local authorities as they were published at an advanced stage of the local authority budgetary process.  In this regard, my Department engaged with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and it was agreed that there would be a once-off adjustment in support from the Local Government Fund in 2016 to local authorities affected by the global valuations.  The additional allocation provided was on an exceptional and once- off basis, solely for the 2016 budgetary period.</p>  <p>  The elected members of a local authority have direct responsibility in law for all reserved functions of the authority, which includes adopting the annual budget, and are democratically accountable for all expenditure by the local authority.  As such, it is a matter for each local authority to determine its own spending priorities in the context of the annual budgetary process having regard to both locally identified needs and available resources.</p></reply>

Once weekly earnings exceed &euro;376, the rate of employer PRSI is 10.75%.  The upper threshold for the 8.5% rate of employer PRSI was increased from &euro;356 to &euro;376 from 1 January 2016, to take account of the increase in the minimum hourly wage. This measure benefitted over 26,000 employers with employees earning between &euro;356 and &euro;376 per week.  The full-year cost of this measure was &euro;6.7 million.  It is estimated that the full year cost of reducing the lower rate of employer PRSI from 8.5% to 4.25% would be &euro;158.5m and would affect 678,400 employments.  This estimate is based on the latest available data and reflects macro-economic indicators for 2017.

A county breakdown of rent supplement recipients is provided in the attached tabular statement, this information is not maintained by local authority area.</p><p>The Deputies will be aware that the rent limits under the rent supplement scheme were recently increased effective from 1 July 2016. The review process undertaken represents a realignment of the maximum rent limits with agreed rents, with rents generally benchmarked against the 35th percentile of those rents registered with the Residential Tenancies Board.  The review&rsquo;s methodology was conducted in the same manner for all counties.  The increases provided are evidenced based and reflect the pressures on rental properties in each particular location.  The rent limits for all counties are benchmarked considering the main urban centre impacting the county&rsquo;s rental market. In county Kerry and in line with earlier rent reviews, the limits are benchmarked against the major urban centre of Tralee.  Rental prices in areas of significant tourist activity in county Kerry are both high in pricing and long term let properties are also in very short supply.  Discretion will continue to be applied by my Department&rsquo;s Community Welfare Service staff for such areas in excess of the general county limits.</p><p>In recognition of the ongoing difficulties in the rented market, my Department continues to implement a targeted, flexible, case-by-case approach where rents may exceed the maximum limits.  This ensures people at risk of homelessness through the loss of their tenancy continue to be supported under the rent supplement scheme.  Over 8,900 people at imminent risk of homelessness were supported through increased payments under the rent supplement scheme, with some 135 households assisted in County Kerry.  A county breakdown of this information is provided in the tabular statement attached.</p><p>In determining whether the applicant is a bona fide tenant, which is a key requirement for the scheme, the Department will generally require documentary evidence including; signed documentation from both landlord and tenant, proof of ownership of the property, documentation that the tenancy has been registered with the Residential Tenancies Board, details of the lease agreement and documentation detailing payments made to the landlord.  This verification process is an integral control element in the administration of the rent supplement scheme, and ensures conditions for entitlement continue to be met.  There is no direct contractual relationship between the landlord and the Department in the administration of the scheme.</p><p>Reporting on the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.</p><p><b>Tabular Statement, Table 1- Rent Supplement Recipients by County</b><table><tr><th>COUNTY</th><th>Recipients<br /><br />End Dec. 2015</th><th>Recipients<br /><br />End August 2016</th></tr><tr><td>CARLOW</td><td>962</td><td>712</td></tr><tr><td>CAVAN</td><td>403</td><td>363</td></tr><tr><td>CLARE</td><td>1,024</td><td>578</td></tr><tr><td>CORK</td><td>6,822</td><td>5,569</td></tr><tr><td>DONEGAL</td><td>1,202</td><td>581</td></tr><tr><td>DUBLIN</td><td>23,758</td><td>21,340</td></tr><tr><td>GALWAY</td><td>3,326</td><td>2,794</td></tr><tr><td>KERRY</td><td>1,633</td><td>1,585</td></tr><tr><td>KILDARE</td><td>3,396</td><td>2,847</td></tr><tr><td>KILKENNY</td><td>554</td><td>375</td></tr><tr><td>LAOIS</td><td>978</td><td>889</td></tr><tr><td>LEITRIM</td><td>331</td><td>292</td></tr><tr><td>LIMERICK</td><td>1,441</td><td>1,073</td></tr><tr><td>LONGFORD</td><td>384</td><td>375</td></tr><tr><td>LOUTH</td><td>1,462</td><td>1,058</td></tr><tr><td>MAYO</td><td>1,528</td><td>1,201</td></tr><tr><td>MEATH</td><td>1,528</td><td>1,201</td></tr><tr><td>MONAGHAN</td><td>269</td><td>213</td></tr><tr><td>OFFALY</td><td>812</td><td>633</td></tr><tr><td>ROSCOMMON</td><td>611</td><td>592</td></tr><tr><td>SLIGO</td><td>478</td><td>338</td></tr><tr><td>TIPPERARY</td><td>1,674</td><td>1,152</td></tr><tr><td>WATERFORD</td><td>958</td><td>717</td></tr><tr><td>WESTMEATH</td><td>1,426</td><td>1,315</td></tr><tr><td>WEXFORD</td><td>2,296</td><td>2,072</td></tr><tr><td>WICKLOW</td><td>1,991</td><td>1,930</td></tr><tr><td>Grand Total</td><td>61,247</td><td>51,795</td></tr></table></p><p><b>Table 2 -

It is an educational opportunities scheme for persons in receipt of certain qualifying social welfare payments wishing to pursue second or third level courses of education in order to improve their employment prospects. </p>  <p>  Entitlement to BTEA is conditional on having ongoing entitlement to the qualifying scheme payment.  The BTEA scheme has been amended in recent years to ensure that the conditions are in line with the qualifying payment.  These amendments include no longer approving third level courses of study being undertaken outside of Ireland starting from 2016.  This is in line with the rules of social assistance payments which are not payable abroad.  The only exception to this rule is where participation in the one year EU Erasmus programme is a compulsory part of the course.</p>  <p>  In addition from the 2016/17 academic year, BTEA participants with eligibility based on jobseekers, transitional jobseekers or one parent family payments who engage in part-time work will be assessed in accordance with their primary payment.  This new measure ensures that only participants who continue to satisfy the means test of their primary payment or another qualifying BTEA payment will continue to receive income support under BTEA and that resources are directed at those most in need of assistance.</p>  <p>  These amendments were introduced following the review carried out on employment supports schemes in 2012.  The BTEA was never intended to be an alternative form of funding for people entering or re-entering the third level education system.  The student universal support Ireland (SUSI) grant payable by the Department of Education and Skills represents the primary support for persons pursuing education.</p>  <p>  Overall, the priority for my Department is that the BTEA scheme will be focused, targeted and suitable for the needs of jobseekers and of the future skills needs of the economy.

This practice was abolished in 1973 when Ireland joined the EEC.  As employees in the public service generally paid a reduced rate of PRSI, which provided no cover for the State pension (contributory), the marriage bar would not generally have impacted on State pension entitlement, as they would not have qualified for that payment had they remained in public sector employment. </p>  <p>  To qualify for a State pension (contributory) a person must satisfy a number of criteria.  One of these is that they have at least 520 paid contributions (i.e. 10 years).  However this of itself does not qualify someone for a full rate contributory pension.  As with such pensions in other countries, there is a separate criterion to decide the rate of payment for those who do qualify.</p>  <p>  Since 1961, when contributory pensions were introduced in this State, the 'yearly average' contributions test has been used in calculating the rate of pension entitlement. Entitlement is banded, with the maximum rate payable to those with a yearly average of 48-52 contributions, and the minimum rate payable to those with a yearly average in the range of 10-14 contributions per year. </p>  <p>  For those who have insufficient contributions to qualify for a full State pension (contributory), there are supports available in the overall State pension system which assists qualification for a contributory payment, based on factors such as the contributions made by their spouse, and/or other factors likely to impact upon their needs.  These include</p>  <p>  - The Homemaker&rsquo;s scheme, which was introduced to make qualification for State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.</p>  <p>  - Increases for Qualified Adults.</p>  <p>  - Credits for periods of unemployment and illness.</p>  <p>  For those who do not qualify for a full rate contributory pension, they may qualify for a means-tested non-contributory pension of up to 95% of the full contributory pension. </p>  <p>  It is expected that a total contributions approach (TCA) to pension qualification will replace the yearly average contributions test for State pension (contributory) for new pensioners from 2020. The aim of this approach is to make the rate of contributory pension more closely match contributions made by a person.  An important factor in the final design of the scheme will be the treatment of homemaking periods.</p>  <p>  This is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative, and technical elements in its implementation.  When proposals are agreed, legislation will be brought forward to underpin the necessary changes.  It is important that the changes be announced well in advance of introduction, to enable those affected to include the new factors into their retirement planning.</p>  <p>  While the details of the new system have yet to be finalised, I do believe they will result in a fairer system.  However, the Deputy should note that not everyone will see their projected entitlements improve under the new scheme, and there will be some people, who have paid very little into the Social Insurance Fund, who may qualify for a lower rate of payment under TCA than they would have under the yearly average system.  People in this situation who had already retired before the introduction of TCA would strongly oppose such a change being imposed upon them, particularly if their means are such that they would not qualify for an alternative benefit at a higher rate of payment.  </p>  <p>  If, instead, we allow current pensioners to choose the most advantageous system to them, then that would have very significant Exchequer costs.  It would mean that a significant number of pensioners would have a higher rate of pension than under the &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; system, but no pensioner would have a lower rate, and the question of how to finance this would arise.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Abolishing the bereavement grant provided a significant annual saving.  This allowed the Department to protect other social welfare payments such as the State pension. </p>  <p>  There are a range of supports available for people following bereavement which provide more significant support than the grant.  These include a weekly-paid widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s (contributory and non-contributory) pensions, which are based on contributions or a means test, and a once-off widowed or surviving civil partner grant of &euro;6,000 where there is a dependent child.  A number of social welfare payments, including State pension continue in payment for six weeks following a death.  In Budget 2016, the Government increased the payment after death period to 12 weeks for carer&rsquo;s allowance.  Guardian payments are available where someone cares for an orphaned child.  A special funeral grant of &euro;850 is paid where a person dies because of an accident at work or occupational disease.</p>  <p>  Under the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme, the Department of Social Protection may make a single exceptional needs payment (ENP) to help meet essential, once-off and unforeseen expenditure including help with funeral and burial expenses which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet from their weekly income.  However, there is no automatic entitlement to such a payment.  An ENP is a means tested payment payable at the discretion of the officers administering the scheme, taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances.</p>  <p>  Any decision to restore the bereavement grant would have to be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Ireland is the best performing EU member state in reducing poverty through social transfers. The poverty reduction effect at 58.9% is the highest in Europe, almost twice the EU average.</p>  <p>  The latest poverty data are for 2014 and do not fully reflect the impact of the recovery in economic growth and employment. The unemployment rate in 2014 was 11.3%, down from a peak of 15% in 2012. Since then, the unemployment rate has fallen further, to 8.3% in August 2016. As unemployment is strongly linked to poverty, we can expect to see further decreases in basic deprivation and consistent poverty.</p>  <p>  In line with this, the Pathways to Work Strategy 2016-2020 sets out comprehensive plans to increase labour market participation and make work pay. It continues to prioritise the activation of the long-term and young unemployed people, with supports provided through the network of Intreo offices.</p>  <p>  A range of welfare and income tax measures were introduced in Budgets 2015 and 2016 to further incentivise work and improve living standards. The social impact assessment of the Budget shows greater rewards for working, with over 80% of the unemployed substantially better-off in work. The Government is committed to restoring living standards to ensure that everyone will benefit from the recovery.</p>  <p>  Looking ahead, the new Programme for a Partnership Government contains a number of significant commitments to enhance the welfare system in the years ahead, including above-inflation rate increases for pensioners.</p>  <p>  The appropriate rates of welfare supports in the year ahead will be considered by Government as part of its deliberations on the next Budget over the coming weeks.

In doing so it is hoped to promote competitiveness and productivity. </p>  <p>  Under the European Commission&rsquo;s call for proposals for preparatory actions under the 'Youth Guarantee', the Department of Social Protection obtained EU funding to pilot a Youth Guarantee Scheme in Ballymun. This was a once-off call for pilot projects. The purpose of the Ballymun Youth Guarantee (BYG) pilot project was to test key elements to inform the national roll-out of the Youth Guarantee. The project officially finished on the 31st December 2014.</p>  <p>  Lessons learned from the Ballymun Youth Guarantee pilot project have informed the national roll-out of the Youth Guarantee in a number of ways. First, the BYG project showed the importance of close engagement by case officers with young jobseekers. This has informed reforms to Intreo processes such that there is now monthly engagement with all young people by case officers to discuss and achieve personal progression plans. Second, the BYG project identified a need for a more intensive approach with disadvantaged youth distant from the labour market, to build employability and work readiness skills. This approach has been taken forward in the First Steps programme. A third learning was the importance of career guidance. Pathways to Work 2016-2020 commits to designing, developing and implementing an accredited professional development programme for Intreo case officers. This will benefit all jobseekers, including young jobseekers, and will contribute to improving the quality of Intreo services. Finally, the BYG project was progressed through partnership working at national and local levels. The scale, scope and nature of this partnership working was facilitated by extensive, pre-existing community infrastructures and relationships. It is not feasible or necessarily desirable to replicate these structures in every community in which Intreo offices operate. Nevertheless, Pathways to Work 2016-2020 contains a number of actions to strengthen local working arrangements and protocols, including for example through Regional Skills Fora, which will include a specific focus on youth. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that these measures drawn from the learning of the BYG project, together with other measures and the Government&rsquo;s strategy to tackle youth unemployment by creating the right environment for a strong economic recovery through effective policies, will continue to address youth unemployment.</p></reply>

Recipients of these payments qualify for credits where they have at least one paid contribution in the previous two years or have had credited contributions in that period.  Credits are also awarded to workers who take unpaid carer&rsquo;s leave from work.  </p>  <p>  Credits protect social insurance entitlements by bridging gaps in an employee&rsquo;s social insurance record, where they are not in a position to pay PRSI, such as during periods spent caring.  In combination with paid PRSI contributions, credits assist employees in qualifying for short-term schemes and enhance the level of benefit for long-term schemes.</p>  <p>  In addition, all carers, including those who do not qualify for a payment or for credits, may qualify for the homemaker scheme.  The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme is designed to help homemakers and carers qualify for state pension (contributory).  Years spent caring on a full-time basis (subject to a maximum of 20 years) are disregarded when calculating the state pension (contributory) rate of payment. </p>  <p>  My priority is to make progress on the commitment in our Programme regarding the level of support for carers, subject to the resources available.</p></reply>

This policy objective prioritises resources to those in receipt of qualifying welfare payments.  Accordingly, the employment services and schemes provided by the Department are focused, in the first instance, on this cohort of unemployed people.</p>  <p>  For those in receipt of Jobseekers Allowance and Jobseekers Benefit, it is a condition of their payment to engage in activation measures. Recipients of other payments, including disability allowance (DA) and the one parent family payment (OFP), can voluntarily avail of activation services and supports.  The JobBridge internship scheme, for example, is available to recipients of a wide range of payments (DA; OFP; Blind Persons Pension; Deserted Wives Allowance/ Deserted Wives Benefit; Widow&rsquo;s, Widower&rsquo;s or Surviving Civil Partner&rsquo;s contributory/non-contributory Pension). Recipients of these payments are not counted on the Live Register.</p>  <p>  In addition, unemployed persons (including those formerly self-employed) not in receipt of qualifying payments may be eligible to avail of upskilling opportunities, for example through ETB training for unemployed people (at present there are 1,009 upcoming day courses and 552 upcoming evening courses).  Although not eligible to receive a training allowance while undertaking the course, they may receive some support for expenses on travel, meals and accommodation.  Springboard and Skillnets courses for unemployed people, funded through the Department of Education and Skills, are also open to people regardless of their social welfare status. </p>  <p>  Many other services are also available to people who are not in receipt of a qualifying social welfare payment.  For example, employment services, such as advice on job-search activities and the use of online job search tools, are available to people if they register with the Department&rsquo;s employment services offices regardless of their social welfare status. </p>  <p>  An unemployed person who does not qualify for a social welfare payment due to the assessment of their means may be eligible to sign for social insurance contribution credits.  Persons who sign for credits for three months (78 days) of the last six months are eligible to participate in the JobBridge programme.  Persons signing on for credits for 12 months or longer over the previous 18 months are entitled to participate on Momentum courses through Solas, provided that they have been actively seeking work, however they will not receive any payment.  Persons signing for credits for six months or more are entitled to participate on ETB-run VTOS courses subject to availability.  In the case of VTOS courses, such participants do not receive a training allowance but may receive travel and lunch allowances. </p>  <p>  The new Pathways to Work 2016 - 2020 strategy reflects a shift in focus from &lsquo;activation in a time of recession&rsquo; to &lsquo;activation in a time of recovery and growth&rsquo;.  Taking on board extensive inputs into the strategy from a range of stakeholders, it has two main objectives:</p>  <p>  - First, to continue and consolidate the progress made to date with an initial focus on working with unemployed jobseekers, in particular people who are long-term unemployed.</p>  <p>  - Second, to extend the approach of activation to other people who, although not classified as unemployed jobseekers, have the potential and the desire to play a more active role in the labour force.</p>  <p>  Accordingly Pathways to Work 2016&ndash;2020 includes numerous, specific actions to increase labour market participation and employment progression of people who are not currently active in the labour market and to apply the concept of active inclusion as a guiding principle &ndash; particularly in the period from 2018 &ndash; 2020.</p>  <p>  In short, the Government is committed to supporting as many people as possible to participate more fully in employment and to become more self-sufficient by providing supports that address barriers they may encounter in finding and sustaining employment.  Through these efforts it is also hoped to improve their quality of life, reduce poverty and promote social inclusion.</p></reply>

It enables social welfare customers in receipt of certain payments to pursue full-time education courses and to continue to receive income support in the form of an allowance.  The BTEA is paid for the duration of the course of study, subject to the customer continuing to meet the conditions of the allowance and remaining eligible for a DSP payment.  The allowance is paid weekly and replaces the customer&rsquo;s qualifying payment.  In general, most customers will also have certain registration and related college fees paid by SUSI.</p>  <p>  The operation of the BTEA has been comprehensively revised over the past three years and I have no plans to further revise the current arrangements.  Overall, the Deputy should note that some &euro;144 million has been provided in 2016 to meet the cost of allowances paid by my Department.

Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  To ensure the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension, all contributions paid or credited over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement. </p>  <p>  One of the conditions of the State pension contributory is that a person needs a minimum of 520 weekly contributions (i.e. 10 years) paid since entering insurable employment.  If a person does not have this minimum number of contributions paid, they will not generally have an entitlement to this particular pension, either at a full or reduced rate.</p>  <p>  There are others who, while satisfying the minimum requirements for a State pension contributory, do not qualify for the full rate, and as a result claim an alternative support to which they have a higher entitlement.</p>  <p>  Since 1961, when contributory pensions were introduced, the average contributions test has been used in calculating the rate of pension entitlement.  Entitlement is banded, with the maximum rate payable to those with a yearly average of 48-52 contributions, and the minimum rate payable to those with a yearly average in the range of 10-14 contributions per year.  Even if someone has only 10 years (520 weeks) of paid reckonable contributions between their 16th and 66th birthdays, they would generally qualify for a State pension (contributory), although the rate payable would vary depending on their circumstances, and it will not always be their most advantageous payment to claim.</p>  <p>  The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme makes qualification for a higher rate of State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme, which was introduced in and took effect from 1994, allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age (or caring for incapacitated people over that age) to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes, subject to the standard qualifying conditions for State pension contributory also being satisfied. </p>  <p>  Where people who were unattached to the labour market during most of their adult lives cannot qualify for a contributory pension in their own right as they have paid few or no contributions, or cannot qualify for a full rate as a result of an intermittent PRSI record, the social protection system provides alternative methods of supporting such pensioners in old age.  Therefore, if their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension, which by default is paid directly to them.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State Pension (non-contributory), amounting up to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate. </p>  <p>  Work is under way to replace the &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; system with a &lsquo;total contributions approach&rsquo;.  Under this approach, the number of contributions recorded over a working life will be more closely reflected in the rate of pension payment received.  It is expected that the total contributions approach to pension qualification will replace the current average contributions test for State pension (contributory) for new pensioners from around 2020.  This is a very significant reform with considerable policy, legal, administrative, and technical elements to be considered in its development and implementation.  The position of women who were homemakers will be considered very carefully in this reform.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This began in January 2014 with the abolition of the State pension (transition) available from 65 for those who satisfied the qualifying conditions, thereby standardising State pension age for all at 66 years, which is the current State pension age.  This will increase to 67 in 2021 and 68 in 2028.  The changes introduced in 2011 were on foot of a Government commitment included in the National Recovery Plan published in 2010, and in the subsequent Memorandum of Understanding with the EU/ECB/IMF</p>  <p>  Each year more people are living to pension age and living longer in retirement.  As a result of this demographic change, the number of State pension recipients is increasing by approximately 17,000 annually.  This has significant implications for the future costs of State pension provision which are currently increasing by close to &euro;1 billion every 5 years.  The purpose of changes to the State pension age is to make the pension system more sustainable in the context of increasing life expectancy. </p>  <p>  The Deputy should note that there is no general retirement age in the State, and the age at which employees retire is a matter for the contract of employment between them and their employers.  There have always been people who have retired before State pension age, and none of them are forced by the State to claim other payments.  However, where they are eligible for such payments, they can make claims to them.</p>  <p>  In terms of financial supports, social welfare benefits will continue to be available to the age of 66 for those who are required to leave employment.  Jobseekers whose benefit expires in their 65th year will continue to be paid benefit up until the age of 66.  Where a jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit claim spans two benefit years, a new Governing Contribution Year requirement is not applied to the second benefit year of a claimant aged 65 (effectively this means that they may receive payment in both years based upon eligibility in the first year).</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Broadly speaking, data from the Pensions Authority indicates that approximately 340,000 public sector workers and 125,000 private sector workers are currently members of DB schemes as at end 2015.  The payment to the pensioner from a DB scheme is generally integrated with, or inclusive of, the State pension which is currently  approximately &euro;12,000 per annum.</p>  <p>  Defined Contribution (DC) pension schemes on the other hand, which are most prevalent in the private sector, are not integrated with, or inclusive of, the State pension and any payment from such schemes would be additional to any State pension entitlement.  In such schemes, the employee&rsquo;s and employer&rsquo;s contributions are invested and the total proceeds, together with any investment growth which may have accrued, can then be drawn down at retirement.  2015 end data from the Pensions Authority indicate 281,629 active members of DC schemes.  At present, the decisions as to whether to save in to a pension, and the rate of contributions to that pension, are voluntary and at the discretion of the employee and employers.  Typically speaking, the combined employer and employee contributions made to DC pensions are less than those made to DB pensions and where this is the case it would result in a more modest outcome for the member. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The 2016 Revised Estimates for my Department provide for expenditure of approximately &euro;8.6 billion on benefit schemes.</p>  <p>  A person who applies for any social insurance payment from the Department of Social Protection is subject to the conditions of that scheme, including having the required number of qualifying PRSI contributions for the scheme.  For example, to qualify for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit (JB) a person must have at least;</p>  <p>-   104 reckonable PRSI contributions paid since they entered insurable employment and satisfy either one of the following;</p>  <p>  a) Have at least 39 reckonable PRSI contributions paid or credited in the Governing Contribution Year (GCY) of which 13 of these contributions must be paid contributions or</p>  <p>  b) Have at least 26 reckonable contributions paid in both the Governing Contribution Year (GCY) and the year immediately preceding the GCY.</p>  <p>  The GCY is the year two years prior to the current year. For example the GCY for 2016 is 2014. </p>  <p>  The wide number of options in relation to combining contributions for JB allows as many people as possible to qualify for a payment. However, it is not possible to cater for every individual specific personal circumstance and as a result there will always be situations where a person will not qualify for a benefit payment.  The purpose of jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit is to ensure that those who have a close connection to workforce are supported.  Where an individual does not have entitlement under jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit, they may qualify for a means tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance payment.  </p>  <p>  Where an individual does not have entitlement under jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit or allowance, they may be eligible for the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme, which is considered the "safety net" within the overall social welfare system. The SWA scheme provides assistance to eligible people in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs and those of their dependants. The main purpose of the scheme is to provide immediate and flexible assistance for those in need who do not qualify for payment under other state schemes.</p>  <p>  Any changes to the contribution conditions for social welfare insurance based schemes could have significant cost implications for the Social Insurance Fund and would need to be carefully considered by Government in a budgetary context.</p></reply>

Two companies - Turas Nua Limited and Seetec Limited have been contracted to provide the service on behalf of my Department.   The companies deliver services directly and have also engaged a range of partners (one of which is the company in question) to deliver the service in areas where they do not have a presence.  </p>  <p>  Participants on JobPath receive intensive individual support to help them tackle barriers to employment and to assist them in finding jobs.  Each person is assigned to a personal adviser who assesses a person&rsquo;s skills, experience, challenges and work goals.  The personal adviser works with the jobseeker to agree a personal progression plan that includes a schedule of activities, actions and job focused targets.  Participants are also provided with a range of training and development supports including online modules, career advice, CV preparation and interview skills.  Participants receive the JobPath job search assistance and support service for a period of 12 months (which can be extended by up to six months to facilitate the jobseeker completing training programmes) or until such time as they find employment whichever is the soonest. If the jobseeker secures employment during this period they will continue to receive support for at least three months and up to twelve months while in employment.</p>  <p>  The JobPath providers are obliged to provide a baseline level of support to each participant but are free to increase that support in individual cases, provided that it is not unduly onerous. The JobPath contracts provide that a person should not have to travel more than 60 minutes in normal circumstances to attend an appointment. Where a person has transport difficulties the JobPath company can assist the person with travel arrangements including the reimbursement of reasonable travel costs.</p>  <p>  While there is nothing to prevent a person from applying for jobs from their own home the JobPath companies offer  expert job application advice and assistance. The JobPath companies work closely with employers to try to match jobseekers with  available jobs. It is in the interests of JobPath participants that the JobPath companies can engage with the appropriate person in a company to build a good relationship and thus enhance the prospects of securing jobs for them and other JobPath participants.    </p>  <p>  There is no legal minimum number of job applications that participants must make in order for them to continue receiving a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment. All jobseekers are required to engage with the department&rsquo;s activation service and this obligation applies irrespective of whether the service is provided by the department&rsquo;s own case officers or those employed by the Local Employment Service or by JobPath. A jobseeker&rsquo;s payment is conditional on a person seeking employment and being willing to take up suitable employment. All decisions regarding welfare entitlements of JobPath participants are taken only by departmental officials and not by the JobPath companies.   </p>  <p>  The JobPath providers are subject to regular on-site checks and inspections to ensure that JobPath is delivered in accordance with contractual obligations. My Department is also commissioning independent customer satisfaction surveys to assess if jobseekers are satisfied with the level, and quality, of service delivered by the providers. Failure by the providers  to satisfy my Department&rsquo;s inspectors or to achieve a satisfactory score in the independent survey will result in payment penalties being applied.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

However, the policy implications of such cases may be considered, if they are relevant.</p>  <p>  Simply put, the Court found that a payment related to co-raising children (in this case, the Widowed Parent&rsquo;s Allowance) should not be subject to a condition related to marriage, whereas a payment with no such child-related criterion (such as Bereavement payment) could lawfully be restricted to couples which had either married or entered a civil partnership.</p>  <p>  As I have stated, UK courts have no jurisdiction over Irish legislation.  However, even if they did, the ruling in this case would not impact upon the Irish benefits provided by this State, such as Widows Contributory Pension, as this payment does not relate to the co-raising of children. Indeed over 90% of recipients do not have dependent children. The ruling recognised the right of the UK parliament to limit other UK benefits to people who had been married or in a civil partnership, where supporting the raising of children was not the primary purpose of the payment.  </p>  <p>  I have no plans to review or change the eligibility criteria for bereavement-related benefits at this time as suggested by the Deputy.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Disability Benefit is the name previously used as a title for the scheme now known as Illness Benefit. Illness Benefit is designed to provide income support to people who cannot work due to a short term illness, mainly people who have a job but need to take a sick absence. Recipients of Illness Benefit declare themselves to be unfit for work and as such are not eligible to participate in JobBridge.</p>  <p>  I believe that economic and labour market conditions have changed for the better since JobBridge was introduced in 2011. The Deputy may be aware that, in the light of these changes, I have announced my intention to close JobBridge and, subject to my consideration of the findings of an independent evaluation of the scheme and the advice of the Labour Market Council, replace it with a new scheme to support jobseekers access jobs and/or work experience.   </p>  <p>  The suggestion made by the Deputy will be considered in developing a replacement scheme, if any, over the next few weeks.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-09-16a.2100.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016091600031#WRDD02500"><p>The State pension contributory is a very valuable benefit and is the bedrock of the Irish pension system. Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives. To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension, all contributions paid or credited over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement.</p>  <p>  One of the conditions of the State pension contributory is that a person needs a minimum of 520 weekly contributions (i.e. 10 years) paid since entering insurable employment, i.e. between their 16th and 66th birthdays.  If a person does not have this minimum number of contributions paid, they will not generally have an entitlement to this particular pension, either at a full or reduced rate. They may, however, claim an alternative support to which they have a higher entitlement.</p>  <p>  Since 1961, when contributory pensions were introduced, the average contributions test has been used in calculating the rate of pension entitlement.  Entitlement is banded, with the maximum rate payable to those with a yearly average of 48-52 contributions, and the minimum rate payable to those with a yearly average in the range of 10-14 contributions per year.  Even if someone has only 10 years (520 weeks) of paid reckonable contributions between their 16th and 66th birthdays, they would generally qualify for a State pension (contributory), although the rate payable would vary depending on their circumstances, and it will not always be their most advantageous payment to claim.</p>  <p>  The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme makes qualification for a higher rate of State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme, which was introduced in and took effect for periods from 1994, allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age (or caring for incapacitated people over that age) to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes, subject to the standard qualifying conditions for State pension contributory also being satisfied.  It should be noted, however, that the scheme does not impact upon the requirement that those in receipt of a State pension (contributory) have paid a minimum of 520 contributions.</p>  <p>  Where people who were unattached to the labour market during most of their adult lives cannot qualify for a contributory pension in their own right as they have paid few or no contributions, or cannot qualify for a full rate as a result of an intermittent PRSI record, the social protection system provides alternative methods of supporting such pensioners in old age.  For example, if their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension, which by default is paid directly to them. Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State Pension (non-contributory), amounting up to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate. </p>  <p>  Work is underway to replace the &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; system with a &lsquo;total contributions approach&rsquo;. Under this approach, the number of contributions recorded over a working life will be more closely reflected in the rate of pension payment received. It is expected that the total contributions approach to pension qualification will replace the current average contributions test for State pension (contributory) for new pensioners from around 2020. This is a very significant reform with considerable policy, legal, administrative, and technical elements to be considered in its development and implementation. The position of women who were homemakers will be considered very carefully in this reform.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

For all means-tested schemes, there is an initial amount of capital that is disregarded for means assessment purposes.  For most schemes this disregard is &euro;20,000 but, in the case of DA, it is &euro;50,000.  This means that a DA applicant with &euro;50,000 in savings (and no other means) can be assessed as having nil means and, as a result, receive the maximum rate of DA.  </p><p>Social welfare legislation provides for the disregard of certain compensation awards when assessing the means of a person for social assistance schemes, including DA.  All income derived from compensation awarded by the Hepatitis C and HIV Compensation Tribunal, by the Residential Institutions Redress Board and in relation to disability caused by thalidomide is exempt from means assessment.  Any payment made by the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Board is similarly disregarded.  In addition, <i>ex gratia </i>payments made through the Symphysiotomy Payment Scheme or to women who were admitted to and worked in the Magdalen Laundries are also disregarded in social welfare means assessments. </p><p>All other compensation or court awards which are not provided for in social welfare legislation are assessed in the normal manner.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

If the participant secures employment during this period they will continue to receive support for at least three months and up to twelve months while in employment.</p>  <p>Some 57,000 jobseekers have been referred to JobPath to date.

There is also an annual carer&rsquo;s support grant (CSG) of &euro;1,700, which is paid automatically on the first Thursday in June, to those in receipt of these payments. Other carers who are providing full-time care but are not in receipt of CB,CA or DCA may also apply for a CSG which is not means tested.</p>  <p>  In order to qualify for carer&rsquo;s allowance a person must generally reside with and provide full-time care and attention to a person who needs such care. The decision, as to whether a carer is providing full-time care and attention, is made by a deciding officer based on the evidence supplied in each a case. When an application is deemed not to satisfy the full-time care provision, the applicant may request a review of the decision and if still dissatisfied with the outcome may appeal the decision to an independent Appeals Office.  </p>  <p>  The full-time care provision is relaxed in certain circumstances, for example the carer can work or engage in training provided the aggregate hours in work and/or training does not exceed 15 hours per week.</p>  <p>  One of the conditions for receipt of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance is that a person must be available for and genuinely seeking full-time employment. If a person get part-time or casual work (up to and including 3 days per week), they may still be paid Jobseeker's Allowance for the other days.  However, they must show that you are trying to get full-time employment. </p>  <p>  In circumstances where a person does not meet either the conditions for carers allowance or for jobseekers allowance, they may apply for supplementary welfare allowance from my department.  </p>  <p>  I hope that this answers the Deputy&rsquo;s question.</p></reply>

Expenditure on pensions at approx. &euro;6.976 billion is the largest block of expenditure in the Department in the Estimate for 2016, representing approximately 35% of overall expenditure.  Due to demographic changes, my Department&rsquo;s spending on older people is increasing year on year.  Maintaining the rate of the State pension and other core payments is critical in protecting people from poverty. </p>  <p>  The decision to discontinue the telephone allowance was estimated to provide annual savings of &euro;48 million. These savings meant that my Department was able to retain the other valuable elements of the household benefits package such as the electricity and gas allowance and the television licence.  My Department will spend approximately &euro;228 million this year on these elements of the household benefits package for over 420,000 customers. </p>  <p>  The cost of the telephone allowance scheme had risen significantly each year, as the number of eligible customers grew, arising from the increased number of pension recipients. In 2007 there were some 316,000 people receiving the telephone allowance compared to almost 396,000 at the end of September 2013, an increase of 25%, or an average increase of nearly 4% per annum.  </p>  <p>  Any decision to restore the telephone allowance would have to be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The purpose of this payment is to assist these households with their energy costs.  The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household.  It is not intended to meet those costs in full.  Only one allowance is paid per household.  My Department also pays an electricity or gas allowance as part of the household benefits package to approximately 421,000 customers, at an estimated cost of &euro;228 million in 2016.  </p>  <p>  The last reduction to the fuel allowance scheme was in 2012 when the duration of the fuel allowance scheme was reduced from 32 weeks to 26 weeks, at a time when difficult decisions had to be made in light of the existing economic situation. </p>  <p>  The scheme is intended to provide some additional support for people on long-term welfare payments during the winter season which clearly does not last for 32 weeks.  By reducing the fuel season by six weeks it restored the core purpose of the payment as a winter fuel support.  There was no cut in the rate of payment of the fuel allowance and in 2016, with the improved economic conditions, the rate of fuel allowance was increased from &euro;20 per week to &euro;22.50.  The Government believed that increasing the rate during the colder 26 weeks of the year, rather than extending a lower payment into months during which recipients faced a lesser heating cost, was the correct decision to make.</p>  <p>  The best way to tackle fuel poverty in the long term is to improve the energy efficiency of the dwelling.  My Department works closely with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources on these issues and in moving forward the actions agreed in the Energy Affordability Strategy.  In that regard, the Better Energy Homes scheme provides support towards the installation of attic and wall insulation, and heating system upgrades. </p>  <p>  Any decision to extend the fuel allowance season would have to be considered in the overall budgetary negotiations. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

At almost 20 years old, the original site was showing its age.  For example, although it enabled jobseekers to search for job opportunities based on job type and location, it wasn&rsquo;t possible for employers to search for suitable jobseekers on the site &ndash; they had to rely on candidates finding and applying for a job from among the many thousands hosted on the system. </p><p>Accordingly, the Department issued a tender last year for the development and implementation of a new service that would enable both employers and jobseekers to search for each other using competencies and skillsets as well as the traditional job-type classifications.  As part of the new service, candidate profiles will be automatically matched to job specifications posted by employers with both candidate and the employer notified via e-mail and/or SMS when a suitable match is found.  Candidates can use the site to apply for the jobs advertised.  The system will also integrate with the Department of Social Protection&rsquo;s Intreo service and will include other new features such as allowing jobseekers to post CVs and video profiles if they wish.</p><p>Following the procurement process, a young Irish technology company is now building and delivering the new service.  The service is being implemented on phased basis which means, unfortunately, that there is some service disruption while work is ongoing.  There have also been some teething problems with the first phase implementation which have largely been resolved. Over 5,000 job vacancies are currently being advertised on the site.  The Department continues to work with the supplier to improve and add new functionality over the coming weeks. </p><p>Employers or any person experiencing difficulties with the website can contact the Department&rsquo;s National Contact Centre on 1890 800 024 for assistance.  Additional resources have been assigned to expedite queries.</p></reply>

Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension, all contributions paid or credited over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement.  Since 1961, when contributory pensions were introduced, the average contributions test has been used in calculating pension entitlement.  Once over 16 years of age, the date a person enters into insurable employment is the date used for averaging purposes.  In this context, even if someone has only 10 years (520 weeks) of paid reckonable contributions between their 16th and 66th birthdays, they may qualify for a State pension (contributory), although the rate payable would vary depending on their circumstances.</p>  <p>  The home-makers scheme makes qualification for a higher rate of State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme, which was introduced in and took effect for periods from 1994, allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age (or caring for incapacitated people over that age) to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes, subject to the standard qualifying conditions for State pension contributory also being satisfied.  This has the effect of increasing the yearly average of the pensioner, which is used to set the rate of their pension. </p>  <p>  Officials in my Department have estimated that the cost of extending the Homemakers scheme to allow people to avail of the full 20 years currently allowed under the scheme, encompassing periods prior to 1994, could cost &euro;286m in 2017, and this figure would rise at a faster rate than the overall cost of State pensions.</p>  <p>  Where people who were unattached to the labour market during most of their adult lives may not qualify for a contributory pension in their own right as they have paid few or no contributions, or cannot qualify for a full rate as a result of an intermittent PRSI record, the social protection system provides alternative methods of supporting such pensioners in old age.  If their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension, which by default is paid directly to them.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State Pension (non-contributory), amounting up to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Ireland&rsquo;s youth unemployment rate has been below the EU28 average every month since December 2015. Ireland&rsquo;s youth unemployment fell in August 2016 to 17.1%; the EU28 average for August 2016 is not yet available from Eurostat.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s primary strategy to tackle youth unemployment is to create the right environment for a strong economic recovery through effective policies. In doing so it is hoped to promote competitiveness and productivity. The fall in youth unemployment to date indicates that this strategy is working. </p>  <p>  The Government recognises that as the recovery continues, there is a need for additional measures to ensure that as many as possible of the jobs created are taken up by jobseekers and young jobseekers in particular. This is the rationale behind the Government&rsquo;s Pathways to Work strategy and the Youth Guarantee Implementation Plan.</p>  <p>  Within this framework, the Youth Guarantee sets a medium-term objective of ensuring that young people receive an offer of employment within four months of becoming unemployed. The main plank of the guarantee is assistance to young people in finding and securing sustainable jobs. In 2015 monthly engagement by case officers with the young unemployed was implemented. For those who do not find employment, additional offers are provided for. Most such offers (over 70%) are in further education or training. Others are in community-based employment programmes such as CE, Gateway and Tus, or through the JobsPlus employment subsidy for private employment. </p></reply>

These include increasing pensions and the living alone allowance, protecting Free Travel for pensioners and people with disabilities, and supports a rate increase for people with disabilities and for carers.  A review of the farm assist scheme has been carried out.  The Programme also outlines the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the development of a new working family payment to reduce child poverty and make work pay, ensuring that no family is better off on welfare than in work.  This is, of course, a five year programme and everything cannot be done in one or two budgets. </p>  <p>  The Programme also commits to extending social insurance coverage for the self-employed.  We believe we need a strong consensus across society on the importance of a comprehensive social welfare system, whereby the PRSI contributions and taxation paid by all workers, including the self-employed, provide adequate, sustainable and appropriate benefits when required.

PCB allows people to continue to receive a percentage of their illness benefit or invalidity pension payment while working.  There are currently in excess of 1,600 people in receipt of PCB </p>  <p>   The wage subsidy scheme (WSS) is an employment support to the private sector, which provides financial incentives to employers for the employment of people with disabilities.

The number of employees participating in the scheme currently stands at over 2,000, having increased by a third over the course of 2015. </p>  <p>  The EmployAbility programme is a national employment service dedicated to improving employment outcomes for job seekers with a disability.  EmployAbility participants are people with a disability who are able to work a minimum of 8 hours per week and who need the support of a job coach to obtain employment in the open labour market.  The number of active participants in the scheme is approximately 3,000.</p>  <p>  My Department also operates a series of private sector employment supports to assist disabled people to access and progress in employment. These are now grouped under the umbrella name of the Reasonable Accommodation Fund and include; the Employee Retention Grant Scheme( ERGS), the Workplace Equipment Adaptation Grant (WEAG), the Job Interview/Induction Interpreter Grant (JIIG) and the Personal Reader Grant(PRGS).</p>  <p>  Other employer supports in include the Disability Awareness Support Scheme(DASS) which assists the integration of disabled people into the workplace and helps to eliminate mistaken perceptions about them.  It is available to all companies in the private sector who are interested in employing, retaining or relating to people with disabilities.</p>  <p>  In addition my Department has, through Intreo, extended its full activation support service to people with disabilities who wish to avail of the service on a voluntary basis.  As part of the DSP commitments under the Comprehensive Employment Strategy (CES), co-ordinated by the Department of Justice, my Department is collaborating with the HSE, Genio and Mental Health Reform in the Integrating Employment and Mental Health Support Project (IEMHS).  The project aims to demonstrate how existing mental health and supported employment (EmployAbility) services can fulfil the best practice Individual Placement and Support (IPS) model of supported employment through improved integration. Four pilot projects have been established in Mayo, West Cork, Cavan/Monaghan and Galway. </p>  <p>  Other developments that will inform measures promoting participation of people with disabilities in the world of work include the publication of the Report of the Disability Allowance Survey 2015, and the formation of an interdepartmental group to examine the complex interaction between the tax, and benefit system and net take home pay, in the context of people with disabilities availing of employment opportunities.  The interdepartmental working group, which is charged with considering this topic, will examine the range of barriers to employment and, conversely, supports which assist people with disabilities return to work and is expected to report by end-2016.</p></reply>

This is evidenced by the continued engagement of my officials with a number of national groups and committees, including the Oversight Forum on Drugs; the National Drugs Strategy Steering Group, the Focus Group on Continuum of Care and the National Coordinating Committee for Drugs and Alcohol Task Forces  .  </p>  <p>  With regard to the issue of representation at Local Drug Task Force meetings, unfortunately due to reduced and re-structured staffing arrangements, representation on all external stakeholder groups has had to be reviewed and, in some cases, has had to be curtailed due to resource issues.  Where there is a gap in representation on a Task Force, it has been agreed that relevant issues can be progressed through meetings with Drugs and Alcohol Task Force representatives and the appropriate Assistant Principal in the relevant DSP Division.  Such meetings provide an ideal opportunity to focus directly on the key issues arising.  In addition, where upcoming issues on a Task Force agenda are relevant to DSP business, a representative can be invited to attend the particular meeting.</p>  <p>  In addition, the DSP Drug Stakeholders Group continues to progress the implementation of the new CE Drug Programme Framework.  This Framework is designed to meet the needs of participants in recovery on CE in order to maximise opportunities for re-engagement in community and working life through training and development.  Membership includes representatives from the statutory, community and voluntary sectors and also representatives from both the Co-ordinators Network of the Regional and Local Task Forces.  This Group acts as a forum to support the DSP CE response and related issues.  At the end of August this year, there were 988 rehabilitation places taken up by participants in rehabilitation. </p></reply>

The scheme allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age, or incapacitated people, to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being calculated for pension purposes.  The effect of this is to reduce the number of years by which the person&rsquo;s contributions are divided, thereby increasing their yearly average, making it easier for them to qualify for a maximum rate SPC.  However, it is important to note that the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme will not, of itself, qualify a person for a SPC.  The standard qualifying conditions for the SPC must also be satisfied.  These require a person to enter insurable employment at least ten years before pension age, pay a minimum of 520 contributions at the correct rate (credited contributions do not satisfy this condition) and achieve a yearly average of at least 10 contributions paid or credited on their record. </p>  <p>  The IT systems used to administer the State pension (contributory) do not hold the data that would be necessary to calculate or estimate the information requested by the Deputy, and so I must advise, regrettably, that the information requested is not available. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

JST provides a more generous means test than Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance, allows recipients to work any pattern thereby reducing their requirement for childcare, provides one to one access to an Intreo case office for up to 7 years with associated activation supports and allows recipients to participate in any form of education, while retaining income support.   </p>  <p>  While it is a condition of the JST scheme that recipients must continue to parent alone, this is not a qualifying condition of FIS and so this information is not maintained for FIS recipients.  From the data available on household composition within the FIS scheme, it is not possible to determine which FIS recipients, who are also lone parents, would be eligible for JST, given the specific conditionality, which applies to the JST scheme.</p>  <p>  It is worth noting that where a lone parent is currently on JST, increases their hours to at least 19 per week or 38 per fortnight they can transfer from JST to FIS.  FIS provides very significant income support especially to lone parents.  For instance a lone parent with one child who works 19 hours at the National Minimum Wage will receive a weekly FIS payment of &euro;202.  When combined with their earnings this lone parent has a weekly income of approximately &euro;375, which is in excess of the threshold for at risk of poverty. This means that FIS is very successful at lifting lone parents out of poverty. </p></reply>

Over 1,200 loans have been drawn down under the Scheme to date with an overall value of over &euro;720,000.  The average individual loan value drawn down is &euro;500.  The focus of the pilot scheme was social welfare recipients who availed of the loans from their Credit Union and were facilitated, with their consent, in the repayment of such loans through the Household Budgeting facility, operated by An Post.  The deductions from their weekly social welfare payments are then transmitted on to the relevant Credit Union. </p>  <p>  The Programme for a Partnership Government provides for the rollout and extension of the Personal Microcredit Scheme.  Following an evaluation of the pilot, the Implementation Group, which is chaired by my Department and comprises all relevant stakeholders, is working towards this aim.  Incremental progress is being made towards extending the geographical coverage of the loan scheme through efforts to recruit Credit Unions to participate in the scheme.  Engagement is continuing with the Credit Union representative bodies and individual credit unions to encourage wider participation. </p>  <p>  While the pilot scheme was targeted towards social welfare customers with access to the Household Budgeting facility, the scheme has recently been extended to social welfare recipients who receive their payment electronically into accounts in financial institutions, provided the loan repayments are made by direct debit or standing order to the credit union.  </p>  <p>  Efforts are also underway to examine ways in which the Personal Micro Credit scheme can be made available to non-social welfare low-income individuals and families.

Human rights issues are discussed on a regular basis with the Chinese authorities during both bilateral and multilateral meetings, including during the visit of Premier Li Keqiang to Ireland in May 2015.  Through the formal framework of the EU-China Human Rights Dialogue, which was established in 1995, the EU continues to share with China its experience in the field of human rights protection and promotion, and to urge China to take clear steps to improve the human rights situation.  The latest session of this dialogue took place on 30 November and 1 December 2015, and provided the EU with the opportunity to express its concerns about a wide range of human rights issues in China, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities, freedom of religion or belief, freedom of assembly and association, arbitrary detention, torture and the death penalty.  The individual case of Gao Zhisheng, a human rights defender detained for denouncing the persecution of practitioners of Falun Gong, was also raised at the dialogue. Most recently, human rights issues were discussed at the 18th   EU-China Summit which was held in Beijing on 12-13 July 2016.In 2013, officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade held a series of meetings with representatives of the Irish Falun Dafa Association and human rights lawyers.  During these meetings the Irish Falun Dafa Association discussed the issue of organ harvesting and ways in which human rights issues are raised with Chinese authorities by both Ireland and the EU.  However, it should be noted that the Chinese Government denies accusations of human rights abuses against those who practice Falun Gong.   New laws on organ donation came into force in China at the beginning of 2015 with a view to ending the practice of forced organ transplants, including from prisoners.  The Embassy of Ireland in Beijing, in co-operation with our EU partners, is monitoring the implementation of this new legislation.</p>  <p>  Ireland, together with our EU partners, will continue to address human rights issues with China, in frequent and regular dialogue, through our contacts in both Dublin and Beijing and through the relevant multilateral channels.</p></reply>

In 2004, APSO was integrated with the Department of Foreign Affairs.</p>  <p>  The pension contributions involved would therefore fall to be paid by this Department, if applicable.  The Public Service Pension Scheme for Volunteer Development Workers was introduced in 1995 by the Department of Finance.  It provided for pension contributions to be paid for qualifying public servants.  This scheme allows public servants, in defined circumstances, to have their pension contributions paid while volunteering overseas for a minimum of six consecutive months and up to a maximum of two years on an authorised leave of absence or career break from the public service.  There is a requirement that these assignments must be co-funded by Irish Aid, in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  Where the Department is satisfied from evidence provided that a qualifying assignment was undertaken since 1995, it retrospectively covers the superannuation costs involved.  Such costs are calculated by the parent Department of the volunteering public servant and are forwarded through Comhl&aacute;mh, the Association for Returned Volunteers, to my Department.  I am informed that cases have arisen where volunteers have come forward years after their assignment and in such cases, where satisfactory evidence is available, the Department has retrospectively paid the superannuation contributions involved.</p>  <p>  For overseas volunteering assignments undertaken prior to 1995, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade requires documentary evidence of an agreement with APSO to pay superannuation costs in respect of public servants who were on a career break or leave of absence at the time of their assignments.  I am informed that such an agreement is not on file in relation to this individual.  I have asked my officials to make contact with the agency he volunteered with to seek clarification and to ascertain if it has any documentation confirming that an agreement to pay these contributions existed.  I have also written to the Deputy directly in response to a recent representation on this question. </p></reply>

The Government&rsquo;s firm position is that the Good Friday Agreement, the St. Andrew&rsquo;s Agreement and subsequent agreements, must be implemented in full.  The Agreements, as well as the principles and values underpinning them, are at the core of the Government&rsquo;s approach to peace, reconciliation and prosperity on this island.Responsibility for establishing the Civic Forum lies with the Northern Ireland Executive as outlined in the Good Friday Agreement.  In addressing this commitment, the Stormont House Agreement provided for the establishment of a civic advisory panel. The purpose of this panel will be to ensure that civic voices are heard, and civic views are considered, in relation to key social, cultural and economic issues.   Work on this was advanced through the regular NI Executive Party Leaders&rsquo; meetings on implementation of the Stormont House and Fresh Start Agreements.  At the last quarterly implementation and review meeting of the Stormont House and Fresh Start Agreements held in Belfast on 29 June 2016, the Executive advised that membership of the panel is currently under consideration and that a decision is expected shortly.</p>  <p>  The Government will continue to support the early establishment by the Executive of the civic advisory panel, which will allow for stronger representation of civil society voices in policy formation in Northern Ireland.</p></reply>

In the aftermath of the coup, the people of Turkey publicly expressed their strong desire to protect and preserve democracy, in many cases coming out onto the streets to make their voices heard.</p>  <p>  I have expressed my concern that some of the actions taken since the coup are contrary to democratic norms. The large number of people detained or suspended from their jobs in the public service, judiciary and academia, the arrests of journalists and the closure of media outlets are cause for concern.  </p>  <p>  Together with our European partners, I have been deeply engaged in dialogue with Turkey to offer support during this time of crisis and to make clear that in addressing the aftermath of the coup, democracy, human rights, rule of law and freedom of the media have to be respected. I made these points directly to the Turkish Minister of European Affairs, Mr &Ouml;mer &Ccedil;elik at the meeting of EU Foreign Ministers in Bratislava on 2-3 September, and again at a specially convened meeting of Council of Europe Foreign Ministers with the Turkish Foreign Minister, Mr Mevl&uuml;t &Ccedil;avu&thorn;o&eth;lu on 7 September. </p>  <p>  On each occasion, I expressed Ireland&rsquo;s support for a democratic and stable Turkey, and also our concerns about developments on human rights, rule of law, freedom of expression and media freedom. I made it clear that the Turkish authorities, in their reaction to the attempted coup, must uphold democratic principles and the rule of law, and that the response must be proportionate and measured.</p>  <p>  I also took the opportunity to again condemn the spate of terrorist attacks in Turkey, including those carried out by so-called Islamic State/ Da&rsquo;esh, the PKK and their affiliates. </p>  <p>  Turkey is an important partner for the EU and we will continue to engage with Turkey, and to encourage a reaction to the post-coup situation that strengthens democracy and the rule of law. </p></reply>

The Government remains active and engaged on the objective of trying to achieve a two state solution in the Middle East, including a fully sovereign and free Palestinian state.  There are few western countries as consistently engaged on this issue as Ireland.  I have worked continuously to try and maintain the problems of Palestine on the EU and international agenda, despite a wave of concurrent crises in the immediate neighbourhood, and have urged stronger international actions. We will continue to do so.  I have myself recently conducted my second extensive visit to the area in just over a year, meeting the parties and trying to urge them to move forward.</p>  <p>  Ireland is also engaged on the ground in trying to combat the effects of the occupation, both through our own humanitarian work and through our support of local NGOs engaged on justice and human rights work, a number of whom are among the signatories of this letter.</p>  <p>  I fully share the frustration of the signatories, of Deputies in the House, and of others, that the process has been completely stalled in recent years, and that there is not a stronger international will to drive it forward.  I have therefore given the Government&rsquo;s full support to the current efforts by France to do just that.</p>  <p>  The letter, and the Questions posed by Deputies, make particular reference to the call for trade sanctions upon Israel. We have discussed this question on many occasions here in the House, and also with this NGO and elsewhere.  The essential point remains unchanged: I am opposed to sanctions and, in any event, there is no possibility of obtaining any support for such sanctions at EU level, which is where they would have to be implemented.  I have, however, been an advocate of measures which differentiate clearly between Israel and the illegally occupied settlements.  These include the guidelines adopted on research co-operation which exclude entities based in the settlements from benefitting from funding under the EU-Israel research agreement, and on origin of products to ensure that consumers are not misled as to the provenance of any products emanating from the settlements.</p></reply>

It has a history of open discussion on hard issues.  This is not always easy in a society as diverse as Israel, and in the geopolitical context that it is situated, and for this I have much admiration.  I would hope for this to continue.  These pieces of legislation are a deviation from this tradition, and for that reason are a source of concern.

Official credit cards may only be used for necessary transactions arising in the course of official business and the credit limit is &euro;5,000. Official credit cards are authorised by the Department&rsquo;s Chief Financial Officer.</p><p>Official credit card bills are analysed and each transaction certified as in order before payment is made.  These procedures also apply where officials recoup work related expenses charged to their personal credit cards.  All relevant supporting documentation is retained for audit purposes.  Existing procedures on the use of official credit cards are currently under review to confirm that the current controls are sufficiently strong.</p><p>There are four official credit cards operational at my Department&rsquo;s headquarters. </p><p>The total amount spent on these credit cards was: 2014 - &euro;10,596.15; 2015 - &euro;17,373.24.</p><p>The amount of bank interest paid was: 2014 - &euro;29.77; 2015 - &euro;21.26.</p><p>In addition, seven Embassies abroad have credit card facilities for use for the official business of the Embassy.  These credit cards may only be used for transactions arising in the course of official business e.g. to pay for air and train travel, hotel bookings, etc on behalf of diplomatic officers based at the Embassy.</p><p>The Department&rsquo;s Financial Management System does not record official credit card transactions separately from general payments.  Therefore a separate breakdown of costs charged in respect of each official credit card is not readily available.  Each individual transaction is charged to the relevant expense code in the Appropriations Account such as travel, accommodation, etc.</p><p>The same strict controls that apply to official credit cards held at Headquarters apply to official credit cards held at Embassies abroad.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade does not have any State agencies operating under its auspices.  </p><p>My Department provides funding to a wide range of organisations through a number of schemes and grants in order to implement our programmes and deliver on our objectives. </p><p>These organisations include,<i>inter alia</i>: UN Agencies, Multilateral and International Organisations, large International Non-Governmental  Organisations, the Red Cross,  Irish Non-Governmental and Missionary Organisations and smaller local Non-Governmental and community based organisations.</p><p>It is neither practicable nor feasible for my Department to maintain a register of all credit cards held by those organisations or a listing of credit cards assigned to employees of all organisations funded.</p><p>I can assure the Deputy that my Department operates rigorous grant management systems which ensures there is  robust procedures  and controls in place for the planning, monitoring, evaluating and auditing  of all funding provided to third party organisations.  These procedures and controls include: </p><p>- Procedures for appraising applications and approving grants;  </p><p>- Carrying out detailed assessments on the organisational capacity of newly funded entities;</p><p>- Ensuring detailed grant agreements with clearly agreed results frameworks and budgets are in place prior to disbursement, </p><p>- Ensuring regular reporting and on-going monitoring frameworks are in place for all grants funded.</p><p>- Carrying out independent evaluation of grant schemes</p><p>Expenditure by the Department is subject to audit annually by the Comptroller and Auditor General. In addition expenditure is subject to audit by the Department&rsquo;s Evaluation and Audit Unit which reports directly to the Secretary General and whose work is overseen by the Department&rsquo;s independent Audit Committee. </p></reply>

The annualised fee for a standard ten year Irish passport compares favourably with many other jurisdictions.  At &euro;8 per year, the Irish passport fee compares with approximately &euro;9.60 for a French passport, &euro;9.40 per year for a British passport, &euro;9.90 per year for an American passport and &euro;16.70 per year for an Australian passport.

It provides the framework for sustainable development globally, with universal application.  Given its universal nature, Ireland&rsquo;s implementation will not be confined to the work of our overseas development assistance programme, but will also require action to ensure domestic implementation of the SDGs.  Like many of our EU partners, we are considering the most appropriate institutional framework to support implementation of the new agenda.  My Department is engaging with the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment to establish the most appropriate institutional arrangements for implementation, monitoring and review of the SDGs at national, regional and global levels. Given that effective implementation of the 2030 Agenda at national level will require a broad and integrated domestic policy response across the economic, social and environmental pillars of sustainable development, the national implementation framework will need to provide for coordinated engagement across Government as well as outreach to a broad group of stakeholders.  This work includes consideration of the adequacy of existing governance mechanisms across Departments, based on the objective of achieving efficiency and effectiveness, coherence and inclusion.  We are also working with the Central Statistics Office which will perform a key role as part of the implementation framework and will support the development of measurable national objectives and indicators that best align with the SDGs.  </p>  <p>  My Department is also working to ensure that Irish Aid, in its programming and policy, supports the achievement of the Goals in developing countries.  I am determined that our aid programme, which is central to our foreign policy will continue to focus in particular on action to end extreme poverty, hunger and under nutrition by 2030. </p></reply>

I understand that there are still concerns about Mr. Kayed&rsquo;s health, and I hope that he makes a full recovery.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s diplomatic missions in the area have been monitoring the case.  Our Embassy in Tel Aviv has raised the case with officials from Israel&rsquo;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  Ireland has also discussed the case with the European Union Delegation in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which in turn has itself also raised the case with the Israeli authorities.</p>  <p>  I have consistently made clear my view that administrative detention (which, if it must exist at all, should only be an exceptional emergency measure) is being used far more widely against Palestinian activists than any other group.  If there are genuine security concerns about individuals, they should be charged and tried under the law.  </p>  <p>  Ireland has conveyed these views to the Israeli authorities both directly and through our interventions at UN level and, at the urging of Ireland and others, in EU Council Conclusions.  We will continue to do so. </p>  <p>  However I would also urge prisoners not to resort to hunger strikes.  There has been a series of hunger strikes in recent years in relation to administrative detention, although in all cases the prison authorities have achieved a successful resolution.  I am deeply concerned that, however much one might appreciate the frustration of persons detained without trial, such strikes, if repeated, may eventually end in a tragic outcome, and I have called on all sides to ensure this does not occur.</p></reply>

The scheme allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age, or incapacitated people, to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being calculated for pension purposes.  The effect of this is to reduce the number of years by which the person&rsquo;s contributions are divided, thereby increasing their yearly average, making it easier for them to qualify for a maximum rate SPC.  However, it is important to note that the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme will not, of itself, qualify a person for a SPC.  The standard qualifying conditions for the SPC must also be satisfied.

JST provides a more generous means test than Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance, allows recipients to work any pattern thereby reducing their requirement for childcare, provides one to one access to an Intreo case office for up to 7 years with associated activation supports and allows recipients to participate in any form of education, while retaining income support.   </p>  <p>  While it is a condition of the JST scheme that recipients must continue to parent alone, this is not a qualifying condition of FIS and so this information is not maintained for FIS recipients.  From the data available on household composition within the FIS scheme, it is not possible to determine which FIS recipients, who are also lone parents, would be eligible for JST, given the specific conditionality, which applies to the JST scheme.</p>  <p>  It is worth noting that where a lone parent is currently on JST, increases their hours to at least 19 per week or 38 per fortnight they can transfer from JST to FIS.  FIS provides very significant income support especially to lone parents.  For instance a lone parent with one child who works 19 hours at the National Minimum Wage will receive a weekly FIS payment of &euro;202.  When combined with their earnings this lone parent has a weekly income of approximately &euro;375, which is in excess of the threshold for at risk of poverty. This means that FIS is very successful at lifting lone parents out of poverty. </p></reply>

The loans under the scheme range from &euro;100 to a maximum of &euro;2,000, and have a maximum interest rate of 12% per annum.  Over 1,200 loans have been drawn down under the Scheme to date with an overall value of over &euro;720,000.  The average individual loan value drawn down is &euro;500.  The focus of the pilot scheme was social welfare recipients who availed of the loans from their Credit Union and were facilitated, with their consent, in the repayment of such loans through the Household Budgeting facility, operated by An Post.  The deductions from their weekly social welfare payments are then transmitted on to the relevant Credit Union. </p>  <p>  The Programme for a Partnership Government provides for the rollout and extension of the Personal Microcredit Scheme.  Following an evaluation of the pilot, the Implementation Group, which is chaired by my Department and comprises all relevant stakeholders, is working towards this aim.  Incremental progress is being made towards extending the geographical coverage of the loan scheme through efforts to recruit Credit Unions to participate in the scheme.  Engagement is continuing with the Credit Union representative bodies and individual credit unions to encourage wider participation. </p>  <p>  While the pilot scheme was targeted towards social welfare customers with access to the Household Budgeting facility, the scheme has recently been extended to social welfare recipients who receive their payment electronically into accounts in financial institutions, provided the loan repayments are made by direct debit or standing order to the credit union.  </p>  <p>  Efforts are also underway to examine ways in which the Personal Micro Credit scheme can be made available to non-social welfare low-income individuals and families.  The Implementation Group is working with the relevant stakeholders to find solutions, within prudential lending guidelines. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Unless the underlying issues are addressed, a renewal of destructive conflict there is almost inevitable.</p>  <p>  All sides recognise this, and all appear to wish to avoid a new conflict, but there has been no real progress since 2014 in reaching a genuine solution which could end both the Israeli blockade of Gaza and attacks from Gaza on Israel. Unfortunately none of the parties involved, for differing reasons, seem ready at this moment to try again to reach a more permanent understanding.</p>  <p>  The EU has consistently called for an end to the restrictions on Gaza, and has encouraged the efforts to achieve reconciliation on the Palestinian side. Repeated agreements to take this forward have unfortunately consistently foundered in implementation at local level.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s assistance for Gaza reconstruction, which I pledged at the Cairo conference in October 2014, has been fully discharged, and I have urged all other donors to fulfil their pledges. However, it is fair to recall that some donors may, like Ireland, have pledged a contribution over a certain timespan. And many Ministers at Cairo made clear that their willingness to contribute depended on progress in reaching agreement to ensure this conflict did not recur. Sadly, that has not happened.</p></reply>

We consider these rights as central to building a solid and resilient democracy.  Ireland supports the European Union statement of 10th August, which urged all sides to refrain from the use of force. We also welcome the recent African Union call for dialogue among all stakeholders in Ethiopia, which is the only lasting way to address the social, political and economic grievances motivating the protests.  In addition, Ireland supports the call by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights for an independent, impartial and international human rights assessment of recent events.</p>  <p>  I am following the situation in Ethiopia through our Embassy in Addis Ababa.

The Government is deeply concerned about these reports.</p>  <p>  Ireland supports the statement made by UN Special Rapporteurs, Agnes Callamard and Dainius Puras, on 18 August, which called on the authorities of the Philippines to adopt with immediate effect the necessary measures to protect all persons from targeted killings and extrajudicial executions, to put an end to any incentives to violence, and to promptly and thoroughly investigate all allegations of extrajudicial executions.</p>  <p>  Ireland also supports the statement made on September 13 by Zeid Ra&rsquo;ad Al Hussein, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, at the opening of the 33rd session of the Human Rights Council. The Commissioner said that empowering police forces to shoot to kill any individual who is suspected of drug crimes, with or without evidence, undermines justice; that the people of the Philippines have a right to judicial institutions that are impartial, and operate under due process guarantees; and they have a right to a police force that serves justice.</p>  <p>  Ireland also supports the statement by EU High Representative Federica Mogherini on the Philippines given to the European Parliament on September 15, in which she stressed that responses to drug problems must be carried out in full compliance with human rights, the rule of law and the right to due process. HR/VP Mogherini also noted that President Duterte has repeatedly expressed his administration&rsquo;s commitment to human rights and that he has warned the police against any abuse of authority. This statement highlighted that there will be several high-level meetings between the HR/VP and the Philippines to discuss human rights issues further, and a formal human rights dialogue will be established following the entry into force of a Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between the EU and the Philippines. The HR/VP is also looking at ways to provide further support to the Philippines in a comprehensive approach to combat drug trafficking in line with our shared values.</p>  <p>  In April the UN General Assembly held a Special Session on effectively addressing and countering the world drug problem. Ireland supports the recommendations contained in the outcome document of the Special Session, which sets out that States should promote proportionate policies for drug-related offences whereby the severity of penalties is proportionate to the gravity of offences, and that States should also promote and implement criminal justice responses to drug-related crimes that ensure legal guarantees and due process safeguards.</p>  <p>  Along with our counterparts in the EU, Ireland will continue to monitor the situation and to raise our concerns on this matter in the appropriate fora, including in direct contacts with the authorities in the Philippines.</p></reply>

The legal and political obligations of both the Irish and British Governments remain unchanged, regardless of the status of the UK within the EU.</p>  <p>  As reflected in the Programme for a Partnership Government, the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and subsequent agreements, including the 2014 Stormont House and the 2015 Fresh Start Agreement, is a priority for the Government.</p>  <p>  I have had a number of discussions with both the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, James Brokenshire, and the British Foreign Secretary, Boris Johnson, on the UK referendum result. Most recently, I held a detailed discussion on the implications for Northern Ireland of a UK departure from the EU during my bilateral meeting with the Secretary of State Brokenshire, in Dublin on 13 September.  At this meeting we both reiterated that the Good Friday Agreement is and will remain the foundation for cooperation between the Irish and British Governments on Northern Ireland. We agreed that all aspects of the Agreement will need to be upheld throughout the exit process, and in the final arrangements between the United Kingdom and the European Union.</p>  <p>  I also set out the Government&rsquo;s priorities, and our views on where further work and engagement will be needed, in respect of Northern Ireland. This includes the maintenance of the open border, and ensuring that the huge benefits of the peace process are not disturbed by a UK exit.</p>  <p>  I also discussed the primacy of the Good Friday Agreement in a meeting with Foreign Secretary Johnson, in Brussels on 18 July. I outlined the importance of maintaining and preserving fully the agreed institutional frameworks established under the Agreement, including the North South Ministerial Council and the British Irish Council.</p>  <p>  On the question of human rights, the UK remains a party to the European Convention of Human Rights under which the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg and the Council of Europe are established. The Convention system is separate and distinct to the European Union, and the referendum result has no impact on the UK&rsquo;s participation in that system.</p>  <p>  The protection of human rights in Northern Ireland law, incorporating the European Convention on Human Rights, is one of the key principles underpinning the Good Friday Agreement. The Good Friday Agreement is clear that there is an obligation to incorporate the European Convention on Human Rights into Northern Ireland law and this is an ongoing legal obligation.</p>  <p>  The 2015 Conservative Party manifesto contained a proposal to repeal the UK Human Rights Act - which incorporates the Convention into UK law, including for Northern Ireland - and replace it with a British Bill of Rights. In this regard, the Government has on a number of occasions stressed to the British Government the importance of fully meeting its human rights obligations under the Good Friday Agreement.</p>  <p>  On 7 September, the Secretary of State for Justice, Liz Truss, confirmed that the British Government is committed to remaining a party to the European Convention on Human Rights while also pursuing its 2015 manifesto plans to replace the UK Human Rights Act with a British Bill of Rights. I raised this matter with Secretary of State Brokenshire on 13 September, and he confirmed the British Government position that any changes to the UK Human Rights Act, would be made in a way which would be fully consistent with the British Government&rsquo;s obligations under the Good Friday Agreement.</p>  <p>  The Government will continue to monitor the situation closely. As co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, the Government takes very seriously its responsibility to safeguard its institutions and principles, including in the area of human rights. We will continue to work closely with the British Government and the Northern Ireland Executive to ensure that the protection of human rights remains at the heart of civic life, politics and ongoing societal change in Northern Ireland, with the due incorporation of the European Convention of Human Rights as provided for in the Good Friday Agreement.</p></reply>

In the Civil Service, the area of the public service for which I have direct responsibility, 4.3% of staff employed in Government Departments were reported as having a disability.  In relation to other areas of the public service, each Minister is responsible for reporting on the target set in the Disability Act 2005 for the employment of persons with disabilities in public bodies under his or her aegis.</p><p>In addition, a number of Departments and Offices in the Civil Service are participants in the Willing Able and Mentoring (WAM) Programme which is a graduate work experience programme aimed at persons with disabilities.</p><p>Recruitment to the Public sector may be conducted by various employing organisations.  However, as the Deputy will be aware, the Public Appointments Services (PAS) is an independent statutory body which provides professional recruitment and selection services when requested to the civil and public service under licence from the Commission for Public Service Appointments (CPSA).  As a public body established under the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act, 2004, PAS is also obliged, under section 34(1)(b) of that Act, to ensure that &quot;standards of probity, merit, equity and fairness&quot; apply to all of its recruitment and selection processes.</p><p>Competitions advertised by PAS are open to all applicants including people with disabilities who fulfil the eligibility requirements set out at that time.  PAS carefully considers all requests for reasonable accommodation to assist candidates with disabilities.  In considering such requests, PAS is conscious of the rights of people with disabilities and of the obligations on PAS to observe those rights and to act in accordance with the provisions of the relevant equality legislation.</p><p>To assist PAS in considering requests for reasonable accommodations in a fair and balanced way, candidates are asked to submit evidence in support of their request.  PAS will consider letters or reports from relevant professionals which clearly indicate the severity and the type of accommodation(s) that may be relevant to the person.  For example, candidates may be afforded extra time and/or alternative formats if assessment tests are part of the selection process.</p><p>The Comprehensive Employment Strategy for People with Disabilities (CES) was launched by the Government on 2 October 2015.</p><p>The Government has already taken a number of key decisions as recommended in the Strategy:</p><p>- the public service employment target for people with disabilities will be increased on a phased basis as set out in the Strategy from 3% to 6%.</p><p>- special public service competitions for people with disabilities will be arranged and we will open up alternative recruitment channels for people with disabilities.</p><p>These and other recommendations of the Strategy are being considered by a cross-party group chaired by Mr Fergus Finlay and my Department is a member of the Group.</p></reply>

Killarney is one of 27 locations (AFAs) in the South West River Basin District and 300 locations nationwide that are being assessed under the Programme, the purpose of which is to implement the EU Floods Directive and national flood policy. The area referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s question is not within the Killarney AFA boundary.</p><p>Local flooding issues are, in the first instance, a matter for each local authority to investigate and address. They may carry out flood alleviation works from their own resources or apply to the Office of Public Works (OPW) for funding under the Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme.  This purpose of this scheme is to provide funding to local authorities to undertake minor flood mitigation works or studies to address localised flooding and coastal protection problems within their administrative areas.</p><p>The scheme generally applies to relatively straightforward cases where a solution can be readily identified and achieved in a short time frame. Any application received will be considered in accordance with the scheme eligibility criteria, which comprise economic, social and environmental criteria including a requirement that any measures are cost beneficial, and having regard to the overall availability of resources for flood risk management.</p><p>The CFRAM Programme, which is being undertaken by engineering consultants on behalf of the OPW working in partnership with the local authorities, involves the production of predictive flood mapping for each location, the development of preliminary flood risk management options and the production of flood risk management plans. Public Consultation Days were held in Killarney on 23 October 2015 on the draft maps, on 8 December 2015 on preliminary options and on 5 September, 2016 on the draft plans.</p><p>The draft plans for the South Western River Basin District are available for Statutory Public Consultation from 15 July, 2016 to 23 September, 2016. Further details are available on the dedicated consultation website <i>www.opw.ie/FloodPlans</i>. Copies of the draft plans, related Environmental Assessments and an information leaflet are available at the principal offices of each local authority.  Submissions on the draft plans can be made in writing to Draft Flood Risk Management Plans Consultation, Engineering Services, OPW HQ, Jonathan Swift St., Trim, Co. Meath or by email to <i>draftplans@opw.ie.</i></p><p>Following this public consultation process, the draft plans will be finalised taking on board the comments received. The finalised plans will include a prioritised list of measures, both structural and non-structural, that can address flood risk in an environmentally sustainable and cost effective manner.  The plans, when finalised, will be sent to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform for approval.</p><p>The Government recently announced increased levels of investment in the area of flood relief as part of the overall Capital Investment Plan 2016-2021 and this investment programme will allow for consideration of measures arising from the Flood Risk Management Plans.</p></reply>

The role involves the coordination of the activities of Government Departments and agencies in the area of flood relief and risk management.</p>  <p>  The River Deel downstream of Crossmolina is part of the River Moy Catchment Drainage Scheme which was carried out by the Office of Public Works (OPW) between 1960 and 1971 under powers set out in the Arterial Drainage Act 1945.  As with other schemes carried out under the 1945 Act, the primary purpose was to provide outfall for the drainage of agricultural lands, but the scheme also contributes significantly to reducing the flood risk in urban areas which it serves.</p>  <p>  The OPW continues to have statutory responsibility for maintaining completed arterial drainage schemes, including the River Moy Catchment Drainage Scheme, in proper repair and effective condition.  Maintenance work is carried out in accordance with OPW&rsquo;s Environmental Management Protocols and Standard Operating Procedures which have been developed to minimise the potential environmental impact of the operations. The OPW has no authority to carry out maintenance works in channels, such as those upstream of Crossmolina, which are not part of the scheme.</p>  <p>  Crossmolina was identified as an area of potentially significant flood risk (known as an Area for Further Assessment, or 'AFA') under the Preliminary Flood Risk Assessment (PFRA), which is a requirement of the EU Floods Directive and was completed in 2011. As the assessment of flood risk in Crossmolina was already in-hand at the time of commissioning the CFRAM Studies, it was decided that the development of flood risk management measures for Crossmolina would continue in a project parallel to, rather than part of, the CFRAM Studies. The OPW is currently engaged in the development of a flood relief scheme for the town of Crossmolina.  As an interim measure to help mitigate any further flood damage pending the completion of a flood defence scheme, OPW and Mayo County Council are working together on a pilot project of individual property protection.  The Council has carried out a survey of households and has received expressions of interest from 60 homeowners for the installation of flood gates.  OPW is currently appointing consultants to undertake surveys of individual properties to determine their suitability for floodgates.</p></reply>

The latest update was issued to all staff earlier this month.  The notice outlines the application process along with guidelines for the use of official credit cards.  Requests for credit cards must be sanctioned at a senior management level and the request must include a statement outlining the necessity of the card.</p><p>Members of staff who hold an official credit card receive a copy of their monthly statement and are required to certify that all charges incurred are correct and official in nature.  They must certify that the appropriate approval had been obtained for the expenditure in cases where approval is required by a senior officer, the statement should be countersigned by the relevant senior officer and include receipts, in all cases. In the event that a receipt cannot be provided, the staff member is required to provide a detailed explanation of the charge. A hard copy of the statement, certified as being in order for payment, must be returned before that payment can be made.</p><p>The guidelines also cover personal purchases made by an individual officer.  Payment must be made with the monthly statement together with an explanation regarding the use of the card for the purchase.  Significant use of a departmental credit card for personal reasons would result in its withdrawal.</p><p>Credit card expenditure is subject to audit by the Internal Audit Unit and the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&amp;amp;AG) to ensure that correct procedures are being followed in relation to the issue and use of Departmental credit cards.</p><p>The Office of Public Works<table><tr><th>Description</th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th></tr><tr><td>Number of credit cards</td><td>50</td><td>77</td></tr><tr><td>Amount spent on credit cards</td><td>&euro;180,057</td><td>&euro;467,267</td></tr><tr><td>Amount of bank interest paid</td><td>&euro;0.00</td><td>&euro;0.00</td></tr></table>The controls in place to monitor the issuing of and the expenditure on cards are set out in an internal Office Notice.  These controls are subject to ongoing review and the latest Office Notice issued to all staff in July 2016.  The Office Notice identifies the internal controls in place for credit cards and identifies the individual responsibilities of Cardholders, Card Managers, Approvers and the Card Administrators.</p><p>Special EU Programmes Body (SEUPB)<table><tr><th>Description</th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th></tr><tr><td>Number of credit cards</td><td>3</td><td>3*</td></tr><tr><td>Amount spent on credit cards</td><td>&pound;8,556</td><td>&pound;12,346</td></tr><tr><td>Amount of bank interest paid</td><td>&pound;0.00</td><td>&pound;0.00</td></tr></table>(* Since August 2015, there are two credit cards remaining in issue)</p><p>The Chief Executive Officer must approve the issue of any additional cards (no new cards issued in last 8 years). Expenditure is subject to all normal checks and controls applied by the Finance Team (normally in advance), who monitor usage, inspect receipts and procurement applied etc. These cards are used predominantly for advance purchase of flights/hotel accommodation for all staff (not just for the cardholders). These cards are not generally used for other expenses by the cardholders.  All expenditure claimed as work related expenses are subject to 100% checking by finance team prior to payment, regardless of how the individual has funded the payment.  Controls in this area are reviewed on a regular basis, and amended as necessary. Auditors also regularly consider this area.</p><p>Public Appointments Service (PAS)<table><tr><th>Description</th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th></tr><tr><td>Number of credit cards</td><td>2</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Amount spent on credit cards</td><td>&euro;18,000</td><td>&euro;24,000</td></tr><tr><td>Amount of bank interest paid</td><td>&euro;0.00</td><td>&euro;0.00</td></tr></table>Each credit card has a specific credit card policy, signed by anyone with access to the credit card.  One credit card is an office credit card, which is used for all organisational credit card transactions, but is controlled by one person.  All expenditure on this card has to be signed off by two people.  Supporting documentation on all expenditure on that credit card is verified by the Finance Unit on a monthly basis.  The other credit card is retained by the CEO and any expenditure is signed off by the Personal Officer and counter signed by the Chairperson of the Board of PAS.  There are already extremely tight controls on each of the office Credit Cards and they are reviewed on an annual basis.</p><p>The State Laboratory<table><tr><th>Description</th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th></tr><tr><td>Number of credit cards</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Amount spent on credit cards</td><td>&euro;3,056</td><td>&euro;3,087</td></tr><tr><td>Amount of bank interest paid</td><td>&euro;0.00</td><td>&euro;0.00</td></tr></table>The State Laboratory have a policy on the use of credit cards.  The monthly credit card bill is reviewed by a senior member of staff.  The controls on credit card expenditure have been approved by and are audited by the internal auditor.  The C&amp;amp;AG audit the credit card account every year.</p><p>The Office of the Ombudsman<table><tr><th>Description</th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th></tr><tr><td>Number of credit cards</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Amount spent on credit cards</td><td>&euro;9,453</td><td>&euro;7,184</td></tr><tr><td>Amount of bank interest paid</td><td>&euro;0.00</td><td>&euro;0.00</td></tr></table>Receipts are provided in respect of all purchases made on the office credit card.  A credit card control sheet is completed and the receipts are reconciled with and attached to the relevant credit card statement.  The credit control sheet and the monthly credit card statement must be certified by the Director General as in order for payment, prior to payment by the Finance Unit.  Personal expenditure on the office credit card is very infrequent.  In such situations, any request for recoupment of such expenditure would be subject to the full ambit of controls contained in the procedures for processing general payments.  The credit card policy was reviewed in May of this year.</p><p>The Institute of Public Administration (IPA) do not hold any credit cards.</p><p>  There are no third party agencies funded by my Department.</p></reply>

The letters sent to Departments are published on my Department's website.  Approval for payment of an allowance to a new beneficiary pending the outcome of the review was withdrawn from 31st January 2012 and was not restored in the case where the review found that there is no business case for its payment to new beneficiaries.</p>  <p>  The Review was initiated centrally by my Department but following the Government Decision it was devolved to the relevant sectors to advance in the context of local circumstances.  Because many allowances have been discontinued for new appointees to posts, the precise figures on the number of allowances discontinued and consequently, the number currently in place, is dependent on rates of staff turnover across the public service. </p></reply>

The Guidelines on Contracts, Remuneration and Other Conditions of Chief Executives and Senior Management of Commercial State Bodies issued in 2006 provided general guidance at that time on remuneration, contracts, performance related pay and related matters for newly appointed Chief Executives of commercial state bodies.  However, terms and conditions of appointment remain a matter in each case for consent by the line Minister and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in the context of policy developments on the remuneration and conditions applicable to CEO appointees which have changed significantly from the 2006 guidelines.</p>  <p>  In particular, the Government approved a proposal in June 2011, to impose a general pay ceiling of &euro;250,000 for future appointments to CEO posts within Commercial State Companies and the position remains unchanged. In imposing the pay ceilings for new appointees, the Government recognised that in a small number of cases exceptions may be necessary.  Such exceptions will be limited to instances where the exception is for a role of substantial importance in a Commercial State Company and the person whose appointment is sought brings exceptional or scarce expertise and/or qualifications to the proposed role.  Any such exceptions are subject to the prior approval of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. In line with the decision in 2011, the Government also reconsidered the issue of Performance Related Awards in 2012 and 2013 and confirmed the decision to omit provisions regarding Performance Related Awards from contracts of renewal or appointment in respect of the Chief Executive Officer of commercial state bodies.  The recently published (effective 1 September 2016) updated Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies includes current guidelines on the contractual terms and conditions of appointment for CEOs in commercial state bodies.  The Code provides that the term of a contract of a CEO is normally limited to a single contract period of between five and seven years but there is no maximum length of service for CEO's. </p></reply>

The OPW has no responsibility for the maintenance of channels which do not form part of OPW schemes.</p><p>The flooding issues in Cong are related to a number of sources, including underground channels.  The capacity of the channel to discharge is dictated by levels in Lough Mask (upstream) and Lough Corrib (downstream).  A detailed study is required to assess the impact of increasing flow capacity through Cong on the catchment downstream.  The channel is an OPW maintainable scheme channel under the Arterial Drainage Acts and is maintained as required on an ongoing basis.  However, flow and level will always be a function of the Corrib lake levels.  It is a limited capacity channel in a highly protected area with significant fishery interests.<i></i>Mayo County Council (MCC) has retained consulting engineers to look at flooding issues in and around the village of Cong.  OPW Regional Staff have met with the Council, its consultants, residents affected by flooding and Inland Fisheries Ireland, and have also carried out a number of surveys in the area.  OPW are working with the Council in bringing forward a funding application under the Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme.  </p><p>With specific regard to tree management in the channel, OPW is currently awaiting tenders from tree management contractors to carry out a robust tree management program upstream of the village, to optimise conveyance capacity and reduce the risk of blockages from timber dislodged in flood events. OPW drainage maintenance staff will then carry out any channel maintenance operations that may be required.  These works are likely to commence in the next month or so, on completion of the tree management programme.  OPW has met with Coillte and agreed that our Offices can work together to manage any offending trees or lumber on Coillte's property.</p><p>In relation to specific works on the channel, mentioned in my reply of 12 July last, OPW staff have met landowners and have sought access to lands at the mouth of the Cong canal, with a view to raising the existing canal sluice gates, which may have reduced the conveyance capacity of the canal last winter. </p><p>With reference to the eel weir at Ashford Castle, during last winter&rsquo;s flood event the level difference between Lough Corrib (at Ashford Castle) and the water level in the village was 1.36m. The only restriction to flow between those points are the eel weir, the weed/tree island downstream of the weir and the channel itself.  The OPW is working with Ashford Castle Management (ACM) that has indicated that it is willing to co-operate by removing the weir superstructure/weir. </p><p>OPW staff are working with the Council with its efforts to bring forward a funding application under the Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme and once an application has been received it will be given every consideration.</p></reply>

All parties are working together to progress this project as quickly as possible.  MCC has carried out a survey of households in the town and has received expressions of interest from over 60 homeowners for the installation of flood gates.  OPW will shortly be appointing consultants within the next week to undertake surveys of individual properties to determine their suitability for floodgates, and to make recommendations for each property.  MCC will procure a contractor to supply and install the flood gates based on the recommendations of the consultants.</p>  <p>  Following discussions, the OPW, Inland Fisheries (IFI), and the National Parks and Wildlife Service have agreed a course of action for maintenance works in the area immediately downstream of the bridge on the right bank.  This work which involves the removal of silt build up on a stone deflector structure in the river is subject to environmental screening and this is being progressed as quickly as possible.  Tree cutting will be carried out by the OPW at different locations along the river in the environs of the town where this is environmentally feasible and of benefit and with MCC approval where required upstream of the bridge.</p>  <p>  The OPW has also approved MCC's application for funding under the OPW's Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme for a number of minor works projects in the town. The total funding approved for these minor works is &euro;189,270.  MCC has advised that a contractor started works on site on 12 September with an expected 6 week duration on site and subject to weather conditions.  </p>  <p>  In relation to the main flood defence plans for Crossmolina, a Public Information Day (PID) was held in April 2016 to inform the public and stakeholders of the current situation, and to seek views on the main options for protecting the town which are either by way of fixed flood defences in the town or a diversion channel option outside of the town.  The majority of those who attended the PID were in favour of the diversion channel option. </p>  <p>  The design team for the project is currently carrying out a detailed options assessment which cannot be completed until more detailed surveys concerning the ground conditions along the most likely route for the diversion channel have been completed.  The survey work is currently underway and is expected to be completed by the end of 2016 (weather permitting).  This will indicate whether or not the diversion channel option is feasible.  If, following the completion of the survey work, the diversion channel proves to be feasible then, subject to design work on this option progressing satisfactorily, the latest program indicates that formal Public Exhibition of this option could be held by mid- 2017.  As there is a requirement under this option to have sufficient data on low flow measurements in the river in order to properly inform the design of the channel, the program is critically dependant on having the right weather conditions to allow such measurements be taken.  If the diversion channel option does not prove feasible then it should be possible to advance the alternative scheme option of flood defence walls etc. in the town more quickly with possible commencement of construction in 2018.</p></reply>

The purpose of this scheme is to provide funding to local authorities to undertake minor works to address localised flooding and coastal protection problems within their administrative areas.  The scheme generally applies to relatively straightforward cases where a solution can be readily identified and achieved in a short time frame.  Any application received will be considered in accordance with the scheme eligibility criteria, which comprise economic, social and environmental criteria including a requirement that any measures are cost beneficial, and having regard to the overall availability of resources for flood risk management. Details are published on the OPW website www.opw.ie. </p>  <p>  The core strategy for addressing areas at potentially significant risk from flooding, is the OPW's Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme. 300 locations nationwide are being assessed under the Programme, which is being undertaken by engineering consultants on behalf of the OPW working in partnership with the local authorities. It involves the production of predictive flood mapping for each location, the development of preliminary flood risk management options and the production of flood risk management plans.  </p>  <p>  In relation to the River Erne system, Cavan Town is an Area of Further Assessment (AFA) being assessed as part of the North Western-Neagh Bann CFRAM Study. Those parts of the Erne system which affect Cavan Town have been modelled, mapped and assessed for options to manage flood risk. Public consultation events were held in Cavan Town on 19 February 2015 on the draft flood maps, on 17 February, 2016 on the preliminary options and a further event is scheduled for 27 September, 2016 on the draft plans. This event will be advertised locally.

Further details are available on the dedicated consultation website www.opw.ie/FloodPlans. Copies of the draft Plans, related Environmental Assessments and an information leaflet are available at the principal offices of each local authority.  Submissions on the draft plans can be made in writing to Draft Flood Risk Management Plans Consultation, Engineering Services, OPW HQ, Jonathan Swift St., Trim, Co.

On a monthly basis, my Department monitors voted expenditure versus profile.  The analysis of gross voted expenditure published with the end-August Exchequer Statement, shows that overall Social Protection gross voted expenditure of &euro;12.97 billion was &euro;25 million or 0.2% below profile.  Spending associated with the Live Register is largely on profile at the end of August.  This expenditure will continue to be monitored over the coming months.</p>  <p>  The Mid-Year Expenditure Report published in July, sets out the Pre-Budget Ceiling for the Department of Social Protection.  The amount included in this ceiling reflects certain demographic pressures primarily relating to the State Pension and anticipated savings from reductions in expenditure on the Live Register.  As part of the Budget Estimates process, the forecast of changes in Live Register related expenditure and changes in other Social Protection scheme expenditure is subject to reassessment.  This assessment is ongoing and will be considered in the context of the preparation of the Estimates for 2017.</p></reply>

A public consultation was commenced over the summer months in relation to the role and methodology of the Commission.  In addition, officials within my Department will be meeting with key stakeholders in the coming weeks, to further discuss these matters, in accordance with the terms of the Lansdowne Road Agreement.

The Programme for Government commits the Government to fully implementing the Agreement.</p>  <p>  The Programme also states that the Pay Commission will examine pay levels across the public service, including entry levels of pay.  It is important to emphasise that it is only within the terms of the Lansdowne Road Agreement that any further consideration of remuneration adjustment for any group of public servants, including issues relating to more recently recruited public servants, will fall to be examined.  Any measures taken will also have to comply with the terms of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts 2009 - 2015 (FEMPI) as well as delivering the necessary productivity and other workplace change that will underpin their affordability.  The issue of the incremental salary scales for those New Entrant Teachers who entered employment since February 2012 is currently being progressed in discussions with those Teacher Unions who are signed up to the Lansdowne Road Agreement.</p></reply>

This Memorandum sets out principles of how the two organisations will work together to ensure that appropriate and relevant information on completed OPW flood defence schemes is provided to insurers to facilitate, to the greatest extent possible, the availability to the public of insurance against the risk of flooding.  II members have committed to take into account all information provided by OPW when assessing exposure to flood risk within these areas.</p>  <p>  The Memorandum came into effect on 1 June, 2014 with an initial tranche of data provided by the OPW to II in respect of 12 completed flood defence schemes and showing the design, extent and nature of the protection offered by these works.  A further tranche of data was provided to II in January 2015 covering a further 4 completed flood defence schemes.  OPW will continue to provide data to II as flood defence schemes are completed.</p>  <p>  Insurance Ireland estimates that flood cover is included as standard in 98% of household insurance policies throughout the country.  II has carried out a number of surveys among its members to ascertain the extent to which flood insurance cover is available in the areas for which OPW has provided data on completed flood defence schemes.  The results of the most recent survey were provided in January of this year; they indicate that 83% of property insurance policies in these areas include cover against flood risk.  Where the defences are permanent in nature the percentage is 89%; where demountable defences are used the percentage is 78%.</p>  <p>  I met recently with Insurance Ireland to stress the need for flood victims to have the best possible chances to be able to obtain insurance cover at reasonable cost.  I highlighted that OPW schemes using demountable defences are built to the required standard and to provide robust levels of flood protection to properties.  I welcome a commitment given to me by II to assess the risk from the deployment protocols, warning systems and emergency response systems in place.  </p>  <p>  Following that meeting, II has recently written to me setting out the range of data its members require to be able to assess the risk associated with these defences.  II has sought detailed data in relation to adequacy and resourcing of flood warning systems; and mobilization, efficacy, maintenance and development of demountable defences.  My officials will be providing the data sought over the coming weeks.</p></reply>

Both are included in a list of species protected under the EU Habitats Directive.  Consequently, Ireland is obliged to monitor and report on their status, including in relation to their population, every six years.  The most recent such report was completed in 2013 and can be accessed on the website of the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department at <font color="#0000FF"></font></p><p>That report indicated a modest increase in the grey seal population nationally, while the data for harbour seal suggested that its numbers were stable. </p><p>The next national report is due in 2019 and my Department is undertaking a number of surveys, including aerial surveys, to provide up to date assessments for the populations of both the common and grey seals around the Irish coast.  All data arising from these surveys will be analysed in advance of the next report to the European Commission.  </p><p>While seals are protected under the EU Habitats Directive and the Wildlife Acts, licences may be obtained under section 42 of the Wildlife Acts to hunt seals where significant damage is being caused.  Licences are issued in response to specific applications and each application is considered on its merits.  This redress is available, for example, to individual fishermen to control damage to fisheries by seals at particular locations. </p></reply>

Under Part IV of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, each planning authority is required to include a Record of Protected Structures (RPS) in its development plan.  Inclusion on the RPS places a duty of care on the owners and occupiers of protected structures and also gives planning authorities powers to deal with development proposals affecting them and to seek to safeguard their future.</p><p>As the Deputy can appreciate, the scope for funding for the conservation of the built heritage is currently constrained by the significant demands on public finances within the context of a recovering economy that is facing a challenging national and international environment.  A number of State financial supports provide for the conservation and preservation of heritage structures in general.  However, funding available for 2016 has now been fully allocated through two schemes run by my Department, as set out.  </p><p>The Structures at Risk Fund enables conservation works to heritage structures, in both private and public ownership, which are protected under the Planning and Development Acts and are deemed to be at significant risk of deterioration.  This fund, which amounted to over &euro;900,000 in 2016 and is fully allocated, is administered through the local authorities and seeks to encourage the regeneration and reuse of heritage properties and to help to secure the preservation of protected structures which might otherwise be lost.  </p><p>I launched a new &euro;2 million scheme - the Built Heritage Investment Scheme - for the repair and conservation of protected structures on 21 October 2015.  This scheme will operate in 2016, via the local authorities, on the same model as the very successful Built Heritage Jobs Leverage Scheme, which ran in 2014.  It is expected to support a significant number of projects across the country and to create employment in the conservation and construction industries, while helping to regenerate urban and rural areas.  The scheme for this year is also fully allocated.</p><p>While no decision has been made on schemes for 2017, announcements, if any, will be made towards the end of 2016 or early in 2017 and are again likely to operate via the Local Authorities.  The Conservation or Heritage Officer in the local authority will be able to advise regarding funding available for conservation works to structures on the Record of Protected Structures, and it is advisable for interested parties to remain in contact with their local authority on an on-going basis.  </p><p>The Heritage Council, which my Department funds, also provides grants for the protection and preservation of the built heritage.  It is a matter for the Heritage Council to decide how its funding should be allocated across the range of research, education and conservation programmes it supports annually having regard to competing priorities for limited resources.  The Council recently awarded funding of over &euro;880,000 to 171 heritage projects nationwide under its 2016 Heritage Management Grant Scheme.  Further details of grant schemes available from the Heritage Council can be found at <i>www.heritagecouncil.ie</i>.</p></reply>

I forwarded the document to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs in July.</p><p>The care and management of electronic records and the preservation of digital material is a challenge for the National Cultural Institutions, all of which have digitisation programmes in place.  Developing approaches to digital records is particularly important for the National Archives.  In this regard, the National Archives joined the Digital Preservation Coalition in 2015, an international advocate body for digital preservation, to better prepare itself for the development of a digital preservation strategy and to ensure it adopts the appropriate and relevant standards in this area.  </p><p>As part of the Ireland 2016 Centenary Programme, my Department funded a number of specific digitisation projects in the National Cultural Institutions, including </p><blockquote>-the National Library project to digitise the personal papers of the signatories of the Proclamation; and <br /><br />- the National Archives projects to digitise the Chief Secretary's Office: <i>Movement of Extremists</i>collection and the Dublin Metropolitan Police records leading up to Easter 1916. </blockquote><p>My Department has also supported archiving digitising of Irish film in the Irish Film Institute.</p><p>Furthermore, the Office of Government Chief Information Officer and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform are working with the National Archives and my Department on a strategy and associated plan in relation to the electronic management and preservation of digital records across the public service.  I provided the National Archives with a special allocation of &euro;150,000 in 2016 to commence work on this project.</p><p>In addition, as part of the Decade of Commemorations programme, funding is being provided for the first phase in a capital development plan at the National Archives.  &euro;8m has been made available for the purposes of this capital development, which will shortly go to tender. </p><p>All of these initiatives are aimed at providing the enabling environment to which the Deputy refers in her Question.</p></reply>

The <i>Programme for a Partnership Government </i>contains a commitment to encourage strong, mutually beneficial links between the business community and the arts community to assist arts organisations to capitalise on sponsorship opportunities and to develop business partnerships and fundraising skills.  This is further reflected in the draft Framework Policy <i>&Eacute;ire Ild&aacute;nach/Culture 2025 </i>which I forwarded to the Oireachtas Committee on Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs in July.  Developing diverse income streams and examining ways to promote private investment are identified as priorities in <i>&Eacute;ire Ild&aacute;nach/Culture 2025</i>.</p><p>Further action in this area will build on existing initiatives.  For example, the National Cultural Institutions have a track record in attracting private investment and I also recognise the important work carried out by <i>Business to Arts </i>for which my Department provides a small amount of assistance.</p><p>In addition, the Arts Council operates the RAISE programme, which seeks to enhance fund-raising skills in arts organisations with a view to diversifying the sector's sources of funding.  It is designed to assist the sector in securing philanthropic contributions to the arts in Ireland.</p><p>My Department also operates small capital grant schemes, which requires co-funding from private or philanthropic sources. </p><p>In terms of other capital investment requiring co-funding, I have announced a new &euro;9 million investment scheme for arts and cultural centres to run over the next three years, focussed on upgrading the existing stock of such centres around the country.  The funding, which is being made available as part of the Capital Investment Framework 2016-2021, will be dependent on matching funding being secured by project promoters and will therefore provide an opportunity for philanthropists to involve themselves in the arts.  </p></reply>

However, the first National Famine Commemoration to include both local input and formal State ceremonials was held in Skibbereen in 2009.  Since then, the event has been held annually in a similar dual format in Murrisk (2010), Clones (2011), Drogheda (2012), Kilrush (2013), Strokestown (2014), Newry (2015) and Glasnevin Cemetery in Dublin (2016).</p><p>While this is the 9<sup>th</sup>consecutive year, therefore, in which the Great Famine has been marked following the decision made by the Government in 2008 to hold an annual National Famine Commemoration, there have been eight commemorations that included both local input and formal State ceremonials in the period 2009 to 2016, inclusive.

These proposals were included in the Heritage Bill 2016, which was published in January this year.</p>  <p>  I am keenly aware that we must ensure that these changes should not impact upon our populations of wild birds, including yellowhammers and many other species.  For that reason, any such burning and cutting will be subject to conditions and restrictions which will be specified in regulations in relation to hedgerow husbandry, management or maintenance to protect fauna or flora.</p>  <p>  In addition, my Department will monitor activity under the proposed new provision and an assessment of the impacts will be carried out before any decision is taken on continuing this measure beyond the pilot phase.  In that context, my Department will work towards gathering the data required to underpin such a decision.  This will include data in regard to bird nesting, and the level and impact of cutting.  I do not believe that these changes conflict with the ECJ ruling on bird species.</p>  <p>  The existing provisions relating to Section 40 of the Wildlife Acts are still in operation and any changes to the closed period are dependent on the passage of the Heritage Bill 2016 through the Oireachtas.</p></reply>

I understand that many European countries are not included in the figures, including ten EU member states.  The data for the Compendium project are provided by independent researchers and it is not a standardised system for collection of statistics.</p><p>I further understand that the Compendium itself warns that data provided by the researchers are not comparable across countries because each researcher includes different elements in the definition of culture and these elements are reflected in the figures for public expenditure.  For example, local authority expenditure on the arts, artists exemption tax relief, expenditure on public service broadcasting and the Irish language are all examples of elements not included in the Council of Europe figures for Ireland but included in the figures for some other countries.</p><p>Expenditure on the arts in Ireland comes from multiple sources, both public and private.  I understand that the CSO does not produce national statistics that capture the totality of this expenditure as a percentage of GDP.  </p><p>The issue of a definition of culture and of capturing public expenditure on culture is one that was discussed in the public consultation process held for the purpose of developing Ireland's first national Cultural Policy Framework, <i>&Eacute;ire Ild&aacute;nach/Culture 2025</i>. As I have previously stated, I do consider that further research on this issue is warranted in the context of <i>Culture 2025</i>.</p><p>In this regard, I forwarded a draft of <i>&Eacute;ire Ild&aacute;nach/Culture 2025</i>to the Oireachtas Committee on Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs in July.</p></reply>

Following consultations with the Office of Public Works, Waterways Ireland completed a re-design of the culvert.</p><p>The work to replace the culvert began during the second week in August.  This work involves extensive earthworks and includes the diversion of the stream, removal of the old culvert, installation of a new pipe culvert and wing-walls and re-building the canal and the towpaths. </p><p>It is expected that the work will be completed before the end of October 2016, subject to ground conditions, and that all boats will be able to return to their normal berths before the end of the season. </p></reply>

This fund is administered through the local authorities and seeks to encourage the regeneration and reuse of heritage properties and to help to secure the preservation of protected structures which might otherwise be lost.  Under the Structures at Risk Fund 2015, the building in question was granted, and received, funding in the sum of &euro;35,000.</p><p>I launched a new &euro;2 million scheme - the Built Heritage Investment Scheme - for the repair and conservation of protected structures on 21 October 2015.  This scheme is operating in 2016, via the local authorities, on the same model as the very successful Built Heritage Jobs Leverage Scheme, which ran in 2014.  It is expected to support a significant number of projects across the country and to create employment in the conservation and construction industries, while helping to regenerate urban and rural areas.  The building mentioned has also been approved for funding under this scheme, in the sum of &euro;10,000.</p><p>While no decision has been made on schemes for 2017, announcements, if any, will be made towards the end of 2016 or early in 2017 and are again likely to operate via the Local Authorities.  The Conservation or Heritage Officer in the relevant local authority will be able to advise regarding funding available for conservation works to structures on the Record of Protected Structures, and it is advisable for interested parties to remain in contact with their local authority on an on-going basis.  </p><p>The Heritage Council, which my Department funds, also provides grants for the protection and preservation of the built heritage.  It is a matter for the Heritage Council to decide how its funding should be allocated across the range of research, education and conservation programmes it supports annually having regard to competing priorities for limited resources.  In 2016 the Council awarded funding of over &euro;880,000 to 171 heritage projects nationwide under its 2016 Heritage Management Grant Scheme.

In the context of this assessment, my Department also provided funding of &euro;50,000 in 2014 towards the setting up and administration of a new Forum which was intended to become self-sustaining over time and act as a model which could be replicated in other areas.  This Forum subsequently applied to my Department for funding through the Rural Economic Development Zones (REDZ) initiative in 2015, and was successful in securing funding of &euro;143,600 towards path repair works in the area in question.

The scheme is currently operated on the basis of three grant rounds per year.  Applications are considered in relation to all forms of the arts as defined in the Arts Act 2003. The following basic eligibility requirements apply: </p><p>1. Applicant must be in respect of an Irish (or based in Ireland) professional artist or arts organisation;</p><p>2. The application must relate to the international presentation of non-commercial work;</p><p>4. The work to be presented must be an art form defined, under the Arts Act 2003; and</p><p>5. The event must be accessible to an open public audience.</p><p>All applications are initially examined by the staff of my Department with responsibility for operating the Culture Ireland Programme to determine whether they meet the above eligibility criteria.  The applications which meet the eligibility requirements are then commented upon by independent external experts in various artforms, drawn from a panel established on the basis of a recommendation by the Culture Ireland Expert Advisory Group (EAC) in 2014.  The panellists act as an aid to the EAC, which is comprised of arts interests and representatives of relevant State bodies (see <i>www.cultureireland.ie/about</i>for details of the membership).  The panellists&rsquo; input ensures that there is specialist expertise in different artforms available as applications are being evaluated in line with the relevant criteria, which are set out below:</p><p>1. Artistic quality of work and track record of artist/company;</p><p>2. Profile of international venue/festival;</p><p>3. Financial and operational viability of the event (including artists' fees and level of support from presenter/venue/other partners);</p><p>4. Proven capacity of applicant to present work internationally; and</p><p>5. Wider promotional and media impact.</p><p>The Embassy network is also invited to give their views in relation to the local venue and promoter and whether there might be wider benefits for Ireland arising from a proposed event. </p><p>Taking account of Embassy and expert panel views, geographic priorities and strategic impact, recommendations on funding are submitted for consideration by the EAC, who in turn submit its own recommendations for Ministerial sanction. </p><p>In the 2016 summer round, 124 applications were received seeking funding in the amount of &euro;1.4m.  A total award of &euro;626,000 was made to support 86 applicants, of which 45 had previously been awarded funding.  The projects, which include artists and companies presenting circus, dance, film, literature, music, theatre and the visual arts, will enable Irish artists to showcase and export their work to over 28 different countries around the globe.  Through this support, increasing numbers of worldwide audiences will experience the strength and diversity of Ireland's artistic excellence and Irish artists will develop relationships with their international counterparts and grow their career both at home and abroad.</p><p>On average, Culture Ireland receives 450 applications annually, of which approximately 55% are successful.  Unsuccessful applicants are provided with advice and feedback on their applications on request and officials are available to meet should an applicant wish to discuss an application.  It is, of course, open to applicants who are unsuccessful to make subsequent applications under another grant round.</p></reply>

This model has been introduced.</p><p>AIM is a programme of supports designed to ensure that children with disabilities can access the Early Childhood Care and Education Programme in mainstream pre-school settings and can participate fully in the pre-school curriculum alongside their peers.It is a child centred model involving seven levels of progressive support, moving from the universal to the targeted, based on the needs of the child and the service provider.  The model is designed to be responsive to the needs of each individual child in the context of their pre-school setting.  It will offer tailored, practical supports based on need and will not require a formal diagnosis of disability.</p><p>Levels 1 &ndash; 3 of the model involve a suite of universal supports which are designed to promote and support an inclusive culture within pre-school settings by means of a variety of educational and capacity-building initiatives for providers and practitioners.  International evidence suggests that these supports, when appropriately developed, are sufficient to support many children with disabilities.</p><p>However, where a service provider, in partnership with a parent, considers that some further additional support may be necessary to meet the needs of a particular child, they can apply for one or more targeted supports under levels 4 &ndash; 7 of the model.  Additional targeted supports could take the form of expert early childhood care and educational advice and mentoring (level 4), specialised equipment, appliances and minor alterations (level 5), therapeutic supports (level 6) or additional capitation to fund extra assistance in the ECCE pre-school room (level 7). </p><p>The model applies to all mainstream pre-school settings which are funded through the ECCE programme. In addition to mainstream settings, pre-school services are also offered in special pre-schools and early intervention classes which cater exclusively for children with disabilities.  While the underlying vision of the new model is to cater for as many children as possible in mainstream settings, it is recognised that a small number of children will continue to need specialised services.</p><p>More information on these targeted supports is provided on a dedicated AIM website at .  The relevant information and documentation required to apply for additional support can also be found on the website.</p><p>However as the Deputy's question relates to service matters, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive (HSE) for direct reply to the Deputy.  </p></reply>

In line with the National Drugs Strategy, the Health Service Executive has reoriented the addiction services in recent years so that they are capable of dealing with all substances.  The HSE is continuing to develop the spread and range of addiction services to achieve better coverage across the country, especially in areas most affected by the drug problem.  Treatment is provided through a network of statutory and non-statutory agencies, using a four tier model of service delivery.  The four tier model is based on the principle that drug treatment is best provided at the lowest level of complexity, matching the patient&rsquo;s needs and as close to the patient&rsquo;s home as possible. </p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost. </p>  <p>  Participants in the Scheme contribute up to 80% of their assessable income and a maximum of 7.5% per annum of the value of assets held.  In the case of a couple, the applicant&rsquo;s means are assessed as 50% of the couple&rsquo;s combined income and assets.  The first &euro;36,000 of an individual&rsquo;s assets, or &euro;72,000 in the case of a couple, is not counted at all in the financial assessment.  The capital value of an individual&rsquo;s principal private residence is only included in the financial assessment for the first three years of their time in care. </p>  <p>  There is no prohibition on an NHSS participant renting out their home if they wish.  Rental income is included in the overall calculation of the applicant&rsquo;s contribution towards the cost of care.  In addition, certain allowable deductions can be netted off against a person's means prior to the calculation of their contribution to care.  These include health expenses, income tax, social insurance contributions and levies required by law such as the Local Property Tax, and borrowings in respect of the principal private residence.  </p>  <p>  Where a person&rsquo;s assets include land and property in the State, the contribution based on the capital value of such assets may be deferred.  The loan can be repaid at any time but will ultimately fall due for repayment upon the applicant&rsquo;s death or sale of the asset.  A nursing home resident can apply for this deferral at any stage.</p>  <p>  There are currently no plans to amend the NHSS legislation to exclude rental income from the financial assessment.</p></reply>

(Source: Pierce, M. et al. (forthcoming). Prevalence and Projections of Dementia in Ireland, 2011. Genio Ltd., Mullingar).&rdquo;</p><p>Medication Safety is a major focus of the Department of Health and a National Medication Patient Safety Forum has been established in the Department.  However, this Medication Safety Forum has not to date specifically addressed the issues raised by the Deputy..</p><p>The National Dementia Strategy refers to the use of anti-psychotic medication as follows: </p><p>&quot;50% of patients admitted [to acute hospitals] from nursing homes were on anti-psychotic medication; and &quot;The reason for use of anti-psychotic medication was only recorded in 50% of cases; </p><p>The Strategy also states that </p><p>&quot;Dementia is often accompanied by behavioural and psychological symptoms (BPSD), (sometimes known as behaviours that challenge) such as agitation, aggression, disinhibition, wandering and sleep disturbance and these can occur at any stage of the illness. These behaviours can pose significant challenges for staff and other patients and can be dangerous and distressing for the person with dementia. While these behaviours are common, they can be transient and can sometimes be addressed by non-pharmacological interventions. There are occasions, albeit for a minority of cases, where pharmacological treatments may be required. Pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments and interventions should go hand-in-hand. People with dementia are more likely to experience psychopathology during the course of their illness and in some cases the use of psychotropic medications is appropriate in conjunction with environmental interventions. However, anti-psychotic drugs should only be used when all other non-pharmacological interventions have first been tried and exhausted (NICE Guidelines). While the use of antipsychotic medications can be effective at controlling BPSD, they are not without risk and if prescribed should be reviewed at regular intervals and discontinued when clinically indicated&quot; </p><p>Priority Action 4 of the National  Dementia Strategy states that: &quot;The Health Service Executive will develop guidance material on the appropriate management of medication for people with dementia, and in particular on psychotropic medication management, and make arrangements for this material to be made available in all relevant settings, including nursing homes.&quot;  Under the National Dementia Strategy Implementation Programme, the HSE will set up a working group to inform the development of best practice guidelines to address this priority action. </p><p>National policy on restraint, including chemical, physical and environmental restraint is set out in &ldquo;Towards a Restraint Free Environment in Nursing Homes&rdquo; , published in 2011, and available on the Department of Health website. Government policy is to  eliminate the use of restraint, or where this is not possible, to restrict the use of all forms of restraint to those exceptional emergency situations where it is absolutely necessary.  Where restraint is necessary it should only be applied in accordance with the law and best professional practice.</p><p>The Health Act 2007 (Care &amp;amp; Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations, 2013 contain provisions relating to 'Medicines and pharmaceutical services' and provide  that where restraint is used, it is used only in accordance with national policy.  All nursing homes are required to have a written policy on restraint and to keep detailed records of all occasions on which restraint is used.  These records must be available for examination by HIQA, the independent statutory body with responsibility for the registration and inspection of nursing homes.</p><p>The Regulations underpin HIQA's National Quality Standards for Residential Care Settings for Older People, which have been approved by the Minister for Health and are available on HIQA's website. Standards 14 &amp;amp; 15 set out what is required of a service provider in relation to medication management, and monitoring and review of medications. </p><p>Standard 21 sets out what a service provider should do in response to challenging behaviour, while promoting the best outcomes for the resident.  Procedures for managing challenging behaviour should be based on staff knowledge of the residents, including any communications difficulties.  Where a resident's behaviour presents a risk to himself or others, a care plan should be prepared, based on the individual's assessed needs and this should be reviewed regularly.  All staff should have the training and skills, appropriate to their role, to enable them to respond to challenging behaviour. Positive (i.e. non-restrictive and non-pharmacological) interventions are the preferred options.  Expert advice should be sought where necessary, including before beginning a course of psychotropic medication, and specific guidelines are provided on the use of psychotropic medication. </p><p>*Chemical restraint&rdquo; is defined as &quot;the intentional use of medication to control or modify a person&rsquo;s behaviour or to ensure a patient is compliant or not capable of resistance, when no medically identified condition is being treated; where the treatment is not necessary for the condition; or the intended effect of the drug is to sedate the person for convenience or for disciplinary purposes.  The appropriate use of drugs to reduce symptoms in the treatment of medical conditions such as anxiety, depression, or psychosis, does not constitute restraint. Chemical restraint is always unacceptable.&quot;</p><p>The specific questions raised by the Deputy regarding current numbers diagnosed with dementia, and those relating to the frontline management of relevant prescribing are service matters and have accordingly been referred to the HSE for direct reply.</p></reply>

The vaccine has not been available in Ireland since the end of April 2015.  The manufacturer has had difficulties in the production of the BCG vaccine.  The manufacturer has informed the HSE there will be no supply of BCG until 2017.  Consequently, BCG vaccination clinics in HSE Clinics and Maternity hospitals have been postponed until new stock arrives.</p>  <p>  There is only one licensed supplier of BCG vaccine to Ireland and to other countries within the EU.  Since this problem became apparent, the HSE National Immunisation Office has been in regular contact with the manufacturer of BCG vaccine to ascertain when the vaccine might be available.  The HSE has also asked the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA), which licenses and regulates all human medicines in Ireland, to source an alternate supplier of the BCG vaccine.  Efforts have been made to find a company who can provide the vaccine for use in Ireland which satisfies all the HPRA requirements on safety and efficacy.  To date no suitable alternative BCG product has been found.  Therefore the HSE has been unable to procure the BCG vaccine from any other source and still awaits the product from the HPRA licensed supplier of the vaccine. </p>  <p>  The supplier has indicated that supplies of the vaccine are not expected to be delivered into Ireland until early 2017.  When there is confirmation of the date of new supply a decision will be made, guided by the recommendations of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee, on who should be prioritised to receive the vaccine. </p>  <p>  In Ireland the number of cases of tuberculosis (TB)has been falling.  TB is a notifiable disease under the Infectious Diseases (Amendment) Regulations 2016 (S.I. No. 276 of 2016).  In 2015, 318 cases of TB were notified to the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, giving a national TB notification rate of 6.9 per 100,000, the lowest rate reported since surveillance commenced.  According to the World Health Organisation, the definition of a low incidence TB country is one with a national TB notification rate of less than 10 cases per 100,000, Ireland is in this category.  The risk to babies remains unchanged, even allowing for delay in getting BCG vaccine in Ireland. </p></reply>

Studies have shown reducing the availability of alcohol is an effective measure to reduce alcohol harms.  Alcohol is not an ordinary consumer product and this is recognised by the State through a licensing system and a specific excise tax.  However, when it comes to mixed retail outlets, e.g. supermarkets and convenience stores, it is frequently displayed like a regular grocery item.  The regulation of the way it is displayed for sale it is an important mechanism to highlight the harm it can cause and to protect children from overexposure.</p>  <p>  Section 9 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 2008 provided for the structural separation of alcohol products but has not been commenced. The aim was to assist in tackling the increased availability, visibility and accessibility of alcohol products. Section 20 of the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill provides for restrictions on the display and advertisement of alcohol products in mixed trade retail outlets.  Mixed trade retailers can only display and advertise alcohol products in:</p>  <p> - A separate area of the shop and/or behind the counter in a closed storage unit</p>  <p>  or</p>  <p> - Closed storage units and/or behind the counter in a closed storage unit.</p>  <p>  The range of options provided for in Section 20 of the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill address the reasonable need for flexible implementation of the requirements.  The provisions in this Bill make it easier for mixed trading outlets to comply with the requirements than those previously set out in Section 9 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008 as retailers have a number of options to achieve &lsquo;structural separation&rsquo; and no longer require a point of sale in the &lsquo;separated area&rsquo;. </p></reply>

I welcome the publication last May of the HIQA Report of the review of nutrition and hydration care in public acute hospitals.  The report has been designed to present the findings so that hospitals can share identified areas of good practice and develop opportunities for improvement in relation to nutrition and hydration for patients in hospital.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to see that during this review HIQA found that, for the most part, our hospitals are already doing a good job in relation to hospital food, with 86% of patients satisfied with the food served to them in hospitals.  HIQA also found that the majority of patients spoke positively about the quality and taste of the food served to them in hospitals and that patients who required assistance at mealtimes were offered that assistance in a prompt manner.  However, we know that there are some people arriving into hospitals already suffering from malnutrition and others who struggle to maintain a good level of nutrition so hospitals need to be aware of those people and ensure that all patients are screened on admission for risk of malnutrition and given the appropriate care and monitoring.   </p>  <p>  While I am aware that recently published follow up HIQA unannounced inspections in a number of hospitals identified a number of opportunities for improvement in the hospitals, it also found many areas of practice that worked well and that were in line with the National Standards for Safer Better Healthcare.  In particular, I welcome the fact that each of the hospitals inspected has a nutrition steering committee and that these committees were seen to be having an important role  in improving the quality of nutrition in the hospitals. </p>  <p>  I expect that all hospitals will continue to build on their areas of good practice and continue to develop the opportunities for improvement in relation to nutrition and hydration for patients in their hospital, including implementing a nutritional screening programme to identify patients at risk of malnutrition.  Work on the development of a clinical guideline on the Prevention and Treatment of Undernutrition in the Acute Care Setting, supported by the Health and Wellbeing Division in the HSE, is due to commence shortly.</p>  <p>   I understand that the HSE will ensure that the findings of the HIQA review and inspections will be used by hospitals to further improve performance in this area, to share the learning from those hospitals that are already implementing best practice in this area and provide support to those who need to raise their standards further.</p></reply>

Under the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for health services in Ireland is based primarily on residency and means.  The Act provides that persons who are unable, without undue hardship, to arrange GP services for themselves and family can qualify for a medical card.  The HSE can only award medical cards in accordance with the Health Act and, therefore, assesses applicants on the overall financial situation of the applicant and his or her spouse or partner.  The HSE gives effect to this legislation through its Medical Card National Assessment Guidelines.</p><p>Patients who are not eligible for the GMS or Long Term Illness schemes can avail of the Drugs Payment Scheme (DPS), which provides protection from excessive ongoing expenditure on medicines.  Under this scheme, an individual or family pays up to the first &euro;144 each month for approved prescription items, with any cost above that threshold paid by the State. There is no prescription charge under the DPS.</p><p>Anybody who lives in Ireland and has a personal public service number is entitled to join the DPS.  You can register at or at any community pharmacy.</p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost.</p>  <p>  The NHSS covers the cost of the standard components of long-term residential care which are:</p>  <p> - Nursing and personal care appropriate to the level of care needs of the person; </p>  <p> - Bed and board;</p>  <p> - Basic aids and appliances necessary to assist a person with the activities of daily living; and</p>  <p> - Laundry service.</p>  <p>  A person's eligibility for other schemes, such as the medical card scheme or the drugs payment scheme, is unaffected by participation in the NHSS or residence in a nursing home. </p>  <p>  Although the NHSS covers core living expenses, residents can still incur some costs in a nursing home, e.g. social programmes, newspapers or hairdressing.  In recognition of this, anyone in receipt of financial support under the NHSS retains at least 20% of their income.  The minimum amount that is retained is the equivalent of 20% of the State Pension (Non-Contributory).  An operator should not seek payment from residents for items which are covered by the NHSS, the medical card or any other existing scheme.</p>  <p>  Part 7 of the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2013 stipulates that the registered provider of the nursing home must agree a contract in writing with each resident on their admission to the nursing home.  This contract must include details of the services to be provided to that resident and the fees to be charged. Residents should never be charged fees which are not set out in the contract.  The Department of Health and the HSE are not a party to such contracts which are concluded between each resident and their nursing home.</p>  <p>  Registered providers of nursing home care are obliged to provide an accessible and effective complaints procedure.  Concerns about additional charges should in the first instance be taken up with the nursing home provider.  The Office of the Ombudsman can examine complaints about the actions of a range of public bodies and, from 24 August 2015, complaints relating to the administrative actions of private nursing homes.  The Office of the Ombudsman normally only deals with a complaint once the individual has already gone through the complaints procedure of the private nursing home concerned.  </p>  <p>  The Review of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme, published in July 2015, looked at the issue of additional costs in private nursing homes and made the following recommendations:</p>  <p> - Nursing homes should have a published fee schedule showing all the costs associated with being a  resident.</p>  <p> - Consideration should be given to introducing a new provision under the scheme to prohibit the levying of additional charges for any service or facility from which residents can not readily opt out without penalty while remaining as residents of that facility, or in which they cannot participate because of their level of dependency.</p>  <p> - Consideration should be given to including in the price contracts with facilities, details of what additional charges are proposed, of the opt-out arrangements that exist for residents and confirmation that residents will not be charged for extra services that they cannot participate in because of their dependency or lack of capacity.</p>  <p>  An Interdepartmental/Agency Working Group has been established to progress the recommendations contained in the Review.  A specific date has not been set for the Group to conclude its work, but it is in the process of reporting on its progress to date to the Cabinet Committee on Health.  This will be done shortly, in line with the Committee's own scheduling requirements.</p></reply>

Activity in the first quarter of 2016 was ahead of the same period last year as efforts continued to alleviate pressure on the acute hospital system. </p>  <p>  I am delighted that the Government has been able to respond to this demand by providing an extra &euro;40m for home care in 2016.  As a result, not only are we maintaining home care services at 2015 levels, but increasing them in 2016.  This will ensure that the HSE will provide 270,000 extra home help hours and 2,000 Home Care Packages more than what was planned for in 2015.</p>  <p>  The Programme for a Partnership Government commits to increasing provision for home care in the years ahead.  The planning and management of future health expenditure will be considered as part of the annual estimates and budgetary process which seeks to balance available funding across all service areas to achieve the best possible outcomes for the greatest number of service users. </p></reply>

The Project Brief developed by the Board in 2014 was approved by the HSE, with the prior consent of the Minister, in accordance with the statutory approval process. Design development was undertaken by the Board in accordance with the approved Project Brief, culminating in the submission of a planning application to An Bord Plean&aacute;la last August. I am delighted at the unanimous decision of An Bord Plean&aacute;la to grant planning permission for the hospital, satellite centres and related buildings as designed, clearing the way for enabling works which began this summer on the campus of St. James's Hospital. It is expected that the satellite centres at Connolly Hospital and Tallaght Hospital can open in 2018, significantly enhancing access to urgent care and outpatient services for children from the Greater Dublin Area. Building work on the main site will be completed in 2020. </p>  <p>  The previous Government committed to making &euro;200m available from the sale of the National Lottery for the new children's hospital, adding to the existing &euro;450m Exchequer funding and underlining the Government's commitment to the project.  The 2014 estimate, as set out in the approved Project Brief, affirmed delivery of the core hospital, including both satellite centres, within this envelope.  For reasons of commercial sensitivity, I do not intend to provide a detailed breakdown of cost estimates at this stage but I can confirm that they include provision for inflation, VAT and contingencies; they do not include equipment or ICT which can be purchased, licensed or leased separately. Philanthropic and commercial funding streams are to be targeted as appropriate for supporting elements of the project to include car parking, academic and research facilities.  As with any capital project, it is essential that cost estimates be reviewed and refined as appropriate, including making prudent provision for construction inflation.</p>  <p>  Ultimately, costs will be determined during the tendering process, currently underway, and is expected to be very competitive, with significant interest from contractors.</p></reply>

The AMCMB has submitted nine annual reports to the Minister for Health.  There are no plans to introduce a revised statutory code in respect of alcohol marketing and communications.  Regulation of the advertising of alcohol products and sponsorship by alcohol companies is provided for in the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill.  The Public Health (Alcohol) Bill remains a priority for this Government.  The Bill has been restored to the Seanad Order Paper and I expect that it will commence Committee Stage in October.</p></reply>

The provision of these services is regularly reviewed at national and local levels, in the context of assessed client need against resource availability and deployment.

The Report of the Review was published in July 2015.  Arising out of the Review, a number of key issues have been identified for more detailed consideration across Departments and Agencies, including the treatment of business and farm assets for the purposes of the financial assessment element of the Scheme.  In advance of the Review, submissions were sought from groups or bodies who wished to make a contribution, and the Irish Farmers' Association (IFA) made a submission in this context on which they expanded at a subsequent meeting with officials of the Department of Health.</p>  <p>  An Interdepartmental/Agency Working Group has been established to progress the recommendations contained in the Review.  This group is chaired by the Department of Health and includes representatives from the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the HSE, the Revenue Commissioners and, when required, the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  I have met with the IFA and invited them to present their submission at the next meeting of the Working Group, due to take place in October 2016. </p>  <p>  A specific date has not been set for the Working Group to conclude its work, but it is in the process of reporting on its progress to date to the Cabinet Committee on Health.  This will be done shortly, in line with the Committee's own scheduling requirements.</p>  <p>  The Programme for a Partnership Government has indeed committed to reviewing the NHSS to remove any discrimination against small business and family farms.  Any significant changes ultimately deemed necessary to the Scheme will require legislation and will accordingly be addressed together at the conclusion of the Review implementation process.</p></reply>

The Programme for Partnership Government commits the Government to ensuring that all 18 year old school leavers with intellectual and physical disabilities have continued education or training opportunities. </p>  <p>  To ensure these needs are met in 2016, &euro;7.25 million was allocated by the HSE, at the beginning of the year, to provide appropriate services and supports to approximately 1,500 young people with disabilities and autism who will require continuing health-funded supports on leaving school or rehabilitative ( life skills ) training this year. </p>  <p>  In addition, a proportion of the additional &euro;3 million secured for disability services in June has also funded new initiatives to meet the needs of this year's school leavers. Once off funding of &euro;2 million is also being provided for the refurbishment and fit-out of buildings to provide suitable service locations, based on an assessment of the physical capacity within existing services to accommodate the additional numbers.</p></reply>

The cards are held by my Private Secretary and a nominated officer in my Department's Finance Unit.  These cards are used for the purchase of a variety of goods and services where payment by credit card is required.  The use of credit cards in making payments is subject to the same authorisation and control procedures as other forms of payment. The amounts paid by the Department in respect of credit card charges for 2014 and 2015 were &euro;16,182 and &euro;16,248 respectively and included &euro;97 paid in 2015 for interest on purchases.</p><p>State agencies are established under statute, are subject to stringent fiscal controls, and are subject to inspection by the Comptroller and Auditor General. In the letter of determination issued to agencies advising them of their annual allocation, my Department advises each agency of the requirements of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's <i>Code of Practice for Governance of State Bodies, Public Spending Code</i>(Circular 13/2013), and <i>Management of and Accountability for Grants from Exchequer Funds</i>(Circular 13/2014). All State agencies under the aegis of my Department must comply with these requirements and with financial circulars issued by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform from time to time. </p><p>The detailed credit card information requested by the Deputy regarding State agencies is not routinely collected by my Department. However, each agency reports to my Department on compliance with the Code of Practice for Governance of State Bodies every year and this includes confirming that the agency has a properly constituted internal audit function or has engaged appropriate external expertise for this purpose, in order to monitor overall activities within the agency.  It also confirms that it has complied with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's remuneration policy and with circulars regarding travel and subsistence policy. </p><p>The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has issued a revised Code of Practice which came into effect on 1 September, 2016 and which strengthens current oversight requirements by Government Departments. My Department is reviewing its role in light of the revised Code and will take appropriate action as required to strengthen and enhance oversight arrangements for its agencies.</p></reply>

The Revenue Commissioners on behalf of the Minister for Finance have informed me that they received communications from the tobacco industry on the implementation of the track and trace provisions of the Tobacco Products Directive and advised them to pursue the matter with my Department which has primary responsibility for implementation of the Directive. </p>  <p>  The Tobacco Products Directive (TPD) 2014/40/EU, transposed into Irish legislation by the European Union (Manufacture, Presentation and Sale of Tobacco and Related Products) Regulations 2016 (S.I. No. 271 of 2016) introduces an EU-wide tracking and tracing system and security features for tobacco products which aims to facilitate enforcement and assist authorities and consumers to detect illicit products.  The tracking and tracing of tobacco products will be phased in, with cigarettes and roll-your-own tobacco the first required to comply in 2019, followed by all other tobacco products in 2024.</p>  <p>  In July 2016, the European Commission launched a public consultation on the implementation of a EU system for traceability and security features pursuant to Articles 15 and 16 of the TPD.  The Commission is seeking views on the relevance and impact of the policy options they have outlined in their Inception Impact Assessment.</p>  <p>  In particular the consultation aims to:</p>  <p> - gain insight into which policy options are capable of fulfilling the TPD requirements whilst at the same time imposing least burden on stakeholders concerned;</p>  <p> - gain realistic estimations of the financial impact of the envisaged policy options on stakeholders;</p>  <p> - gain insight into the impact of the envisaged policy options on SMEs; and</p>  <p> - seek the feedback of consumers regarding aspects of particular relevance for them.</p>  <p>  The submissions received by the Commission will provide important input for the ongoing implementation work on a future EU system for traceability and security features, and will feed into the preparation of the legislative acts.</p></reply>

There are currently over 530,000 patients waiting for an outpatient appointment, an in-patient or daycase procedure as of end of August 2015.  As such it is clear that the health system is currently dealing with a considerable demand for health services that must be planned for and effectively managed.  The Department and HSE are committed to driving the necessary process improvements and resources to tackle this issue.</p><p>The HSE has developed an action plan aimed at reducing the number of patients on waiting lists to be implemented in the later half of 2016.  Key actions include clinical validation of patients waiting for an in-patient or daycase procedure for over 15 months, focusing on providing procedures for the 5% of patients on inpatient and daycase waiting lists for over 18 months and driving process improvement at Hospital Group and individual hospital level.  This work will be supported by the Special Delivery Unit of the HSE.</p><p>Last week the HSE published the Winter Initiative 2016-2017 which includes a &euro;7 million fund for a targeted waiting list programme to reduce the numbers of patients waiting for orthopaedic, spinal and scoliosis procedures in designated sites.  The NTPF's recently launched Endoscopy Initiative 2016 will assist in reducing the waiting lists and waiting times for endoscopy procedures for those patients who are currently waiting over 12 months. Separately, additional 'once-off' funding of &euro;1 million has been provided to the Children's Hospital Group to address cardiac catheterisation waiting lists and assist further with scoliosis waiting lists.</p><p>The <i>Programme for Partnership Government</i>(PfPG) clearly commits &euro;50 million in 2017 for waiting list initiatives, with at least &euro;15 million of this allocated specifically to the NTPF.  The Department of Health is working closely with the HSE and the NTPF to develop specific initiatives focused on reducing waiting lists in 2017 in accordance with the PfPG's commitments.</p></reply>

The response stated that over 1,700 voluntary agencies are currently funded by the HSE and that all funded agencies in receipt of &euro;150,000 or more are obliged to furnish annual audited accounts. The HSE has confirmed to my officials that the 39 Section 38 Service Providers and the top 11 Section 39 Service Providers, which account for over 80% of overall funding, have submitted audited accounts for 2014. The process in relation to the 2015 audited accounts is ongoing at present.</p>  <p>  The HSE has informed me that, as indicated in its response to the Deputy, its online Service Provider Governance (SPG) system does not hold the information required to provide the precise details requested, although the next phase of its development, currently underway, will be able to do so for Accounts received from 2016.  The only way to provide the detailed information requested would be to ask the operational staff in the 9 Community Healthcare Organisations (CHO) to examine in the region of 2,200 documents (440 providers required to submit audited accounts each year for five years, 2011 &ndash; 2015). In addition, the Director of Compliance understands that many of these records will at this stage not be retained in current office files but will have been archived.</p>  <p>  Given the current pressures on the limited number of operational staff within each CHO who deal with Service Providers and Service Users on a daily basis, this would impose a significant additional burden on these operational staff and would be considered to be an inappropriate use of limited operational resources.</p>  <p>  However, the Director of Compliance has requested each of the 9 CHOs to confirm that the Section 38 and 39 Service Providers within their operational area who are obliged to furnish audited accounts have done so for 2014 and 2015, and when the HSE has this information to hand it will forward it to the Deputy.  </p></reply>

The management of scoliosis is complex and is determined by the severity of the curvature and skeletal maturity.</p>  <p>  Long waiting times for scoliosis surgery are not acceptable, and my Department has been working closely with the HSE to address services pressures, particularly in Our Lady's Children's Hospital Crumlin (OLCHC), which is the largest provider of scoliosis surgery for children and young people. Additional funding of &euro;1.042m was allocated under the 2015 Service Plan to increase capacity at OLCHC, and an additional orthopaedic surgeon, anaesthetist, and support staff, are now in place with recruitment of a further additional orthopaedic surgeon underway. Capital funding was also provided for a new theatre on site to expand theatre capacity further, and this is currently being commissioned.  The Children's Hospital Group is proactively working on nurse recruitment to support the opening of the new theatre. </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to work with the HSE and the relevant hospitals to ensure improvements in access to spinal surgery.</p></reply>

The infection is generally mild affecting only the skin, but can occasionally be more severe and highly debilitating.  Lyme disease is the commonest cause of tick-borne infection in Europe.</p><p>The Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) of the HSE collects and collates surveillance data on notifiable infectious diseases. Lyme borreliosis is notifiable in Ireland since 2012; the notifiable entity being the more severe neurological form of LB: Lyme neuroborreliosis.  </p><p>The number of annual neuroborreliosis notifications over the last few years is as follows: </p><p>- 2012 &ndash; 8 cases;</p><p>- 2013 &ndash; 13 cases; </p><p>- 2014 &ndash; 18 cases; </p><p>- 2015 &ndash; 12 cases.</p><p>This gives an average annual incidence rate of neuroborreliosis in Ireland of about 2.7 neuroborreliosis cases per million among the population. </p><p>Since 2013, the HPSC has held an annual &lsquo;Lyme Awareness Week&rsquo; at the beginning of the tick biting season, the purpose of which is to draw attention - particularly in the media - to Lyme disease and the ticks that can spread this disease. The week beginning May 2nd was designated as Lyme Awareness Week this year. </p><p>The literature on the HPSC website points out that that campers, walkers and certain occupational groups such as forestry workers, conservation workers, deer cullers and farmers are at particular risk of exposure to ticks (and therefore LB).  That said, anyone walking or hiking in the countryside is at risk of biting ticks.  The ticks responsible for LB are generally hard-bodied ticks (Ixodidae).  Ixodes ticks are hosted by a wide range of mammals including deer, sheep and cows, and occasionally birds; their tiny size (less than 2mm unfed) means they can remain undetected for long periods.</p><p>Ixodes ticks are most likely to be found in:</p><p>- Shady and humid woodland clearings with grass; </p><p>- Open grassland, walking paths (especially those bordered by long grasses); </p><p>- Wooded and forested areas; </p><p>- Vegetation close to lakes and seaside beaches; </p><p>- Parkland areas; and </p><p>- Open fields and bushes.</p><p>They are present in both urban and rural environments and are active from spring to autumn. Lyme cases tend to appear in Ireland with greater frequency after April, hence the choice of this time of year for Lyme Awareness Week.</p><p>The HPSC emphasise that prevention of tick bites is the most effective way to prevent LB and a comprehensive amount of which will enable the public to:</p><p>- Identify likely areas of tick infestation; </p><p>- Habits to develop to prevent tick biting them and their families; and </p><p>- Habits to develop to examine oneself (and one&rsquo;s children and pets) to remove any ticks they discover after a day in the country.</p><p>In addition, a Lyme Borreliosis Subcommittee has been established to look at methods of raising awareness especially in those areas (including recreation areas) where Lyme carrying ticks can be most expected to be found.</p></reply>

Recent figures have shown a continued increase in the number of patients waiting for appointments and/or procedures within the health system in 2016. As such it is clear that the health system is currently dealing with a considerable demand for health services that must be planned for and effectively managed.  The Department and HSE are committed to driving the necessary process improvements and resources to tackle this issue.</p><p>The HSE has developed an action plan aimed at reducing the number of patients on waiting lists to be implemented in the latter half of 2016.  Key actions include clinical validation of patients waiting for an in-patient or daycase procedure for over 15 months, focusing on providing procedures for the 5% of patients on inpatient and daycase waiting lists for over 18 months and driving process improvement at Hospital Group and individual hospital level.  This work will be supported by the Special Delivery Unit of the HSE.</p><p>Last week the HSE published the Winter Initiative 2016-2017 which includes a &euro;7 million fund for a targeted waiting list programme to reduce the numbers of patients waiting for orthopaedic, spinal and scoliosis procedures in designated sites.  The NTPF's recently launched Endoscopy Initiative 2016 will assist in reducing the waiting lists and waiting times for endoscopy procedures for those patients who are currently waiting over 12 months. Separately, additional 'once-off' funding of &euro;1 million has been provided to the Children's Hospital Group to address cardiac catheterisation waiting lists and assist further with scoliosis waiting lists. </p><p>The <i>Programme for Partnership Government</i>(PfPG) clearly commits &euro;50 million in 2017 for waiting list initiatives, with at least &euro;15 million of this allocated specifically to the NTPF.  The Department of Health is working closely with the HSE and the NTPF to develop specific initiatives focused on reducing waiting lists in 2017 in accordance with the PfPG's commitments.  </p></reply>

While waiting list numbers have increased nationally, this must be seen in the context of increased demand for care in our health system. There has been a 4% increase in inpatient and day-case activity in acute hospitals and an almost 6% increase in attendances at EDs in comparison with last year. The key issue for patients is how long they wait. Approximately 60% of patients wait less than six months for a required outpatient appointment or inpatient/day-case procedures. I note that 98% of patients have been waiting less than six months for inpatient/day-case procedures at University Hospital Kerry. </p>  <p>  The HSE has developed an action plan aimed at reducing the number of patients on waiting lists to be implemented in the latter half of 2016.  Key actions include clinical validation of patients waiting for an in-patient or day-case procedure for over 15 months, focusing on providing procedures for the 5% of patients on inpatient and day-case waiting lists for over 18 months and driving process improvement at Hospital Group and individual hospital level.  This work will be supported by the Special Delivery Unit of the HSE.</p>  <p>  The Programme for a Partnership Government (PfPG) emphasises the need for sustained commitment to improving waiting times for patients, with a particular focus on those patients waiting longest. It commits &euro;50 million in 2017 for waiting list initiatives, with at least &euro;15 million of this allocated specifically to the NTPF.  The Department of Health is working closely with the HSE and the NTPF to develop specific initiatives focused on reducing waiting lists in 2017 in accordance with the PfPG's commitments.  </p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 2004, the HSE is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. Accordingly, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly in relation to the specific service issue raised concerning University Hospital Kerry.</p></reply>

Any person, regardless of nationality, who is accepted by the Health Service Executive (HSE) as being ordinarily resident in Ireland may be eligible for a health service either on the basis of full (medical card) or limited eligibility. If a person is coming to live in Ireland or returning here to live, they must satisfy the HSE that they are "ordinarily resident" i.e. that they are living here or intend to live here for at least a year in order to be eligible for public health services.  However, if they are here for a shorter period, they are regarded as a visitor and therefore do not have any entitlement to free or subsidised health services and they should take out appropriate insurance to cover the period of their visit.</p></reply>

All HSE dental clinics prioritise emergency care for children up to 16 years of age, treatment for special needs patients and screening of children aged from 11 to 13 years, including referral for orthodontic services where necessary.  Other services, including screening of children 6 to 8 years, are provided but may be deferred in clinics where there is pressure on resources.  The Dental Treatment Service Scheme (DTSS) provides access to dental treatment for medical card holders over the age of 16.  All medical card holders are entitled to specific dental treatments e.g., an annual dental examination, two fillings in each calendar year, extractions as necessary.  Additional treatments are available to persons with specific medical conditions including persons in receipt of care or services for a disability and persons on a register of disability.</p>  <p>  The HSE prioritises the level and nature of services provided within each service or scheme within existing resources.  The services available in the DTSS are not the same as those available to children under 16.  The National Oral Health Policy, which the Department of Health is currently developing, will inform future provision of dental services.  This project is being led by the Chief Dental Officer and includes a needs assessment, a review of resources and involves consultation with stakeholders, including dental professionals and the public.</p></reply>

Minimum Unit Pricing (MUP) sets a minimum price per gram of alcohol.  The minimum price of an alcohol product would be based on the number of grams of alcohol in the product.  MUP is a targeted measure, aimed at those who drink in a harmful and hazardous manner, and designed to prevent the sale of alcohol at very cheap prices. MUP is able to target cheaper alcohol relative to its strength because the minimum price is determined by and is directly proportional to the amount of pure alcohol in the drink.  The MUP is set in the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill at 10c per gram of alcohol, which equates to a minimum price of &euro;1 per standard drink.</p>  <p>  The University of Sheffield study reported that the alcohol products most affected by this policy are those that are currently being sold very cheaply, often below cost prices, in the off-trade, i.e. supermarkets and off-licences.  The study indicated that a minimum price of 10 cent per gram will lead to an overall increase of 11.1% in the price of alcohol, with an increase of 29% in the off-trade and 0.2% in the on-trade.  This in turn, would lead to an overall decrease in consumption of 8.8%, with a decrease of 19.6% in the off-trade and an increase of 0.3% in the on-trade respectively.  Revenue to retailers is estimated to increase with the majority of this accruing in the off-trade.</p>  <p>  MUP will lead to substantial health, social and economic gains.  The study by the University of Sheffield has estimated that &euro;1.7 billion savings will be accrued cumulatively over a 20-year-period.  This figure includes reduced direct healthcare costs, savings from reduced crime and policing, savings from reduced workplace absence and a financial valuation of the health benefits measured in terms of quality-adjusted life years.  In addition, while a number of years will be needed to see savings in relation to some illnesses, such as heart disease and cancer, MUP will also have some immediate effects on health costs, crime costs and loss of productivity due to absenteeism.</p></reply>

The 'One Health' concept is a worldwide strategy for expanding interdisciplinary collaborations and communications in all aspects of health care for humans, animals and the environment.</p><p>The Lord O'Neill Report referenced by the Deputy is welcomed by Ireland and is a valuable addition to the serious debate on the worldwide threat of antimicrobial resistance.  The author's concerns about both the human and economic costs of increasing resistance to often life saving treatment in the form of antibiotics is a matter which is being addressed at international, EU and national levels.  The Report's recommendations on reducing demand for antimicrobials, improving global surveillance of drug resistance and antimicrobial consumption in humans and animals are in line with the WHO Global Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance which Ireland supports.</p><p>In relation to the setting of targets for the reduction of usage and or prescribing of antibiotics, particularly in primary care, the Director General of the HSE has set up a Taskforce to address the issue of healthcare associated infections (HCAIs) and antimicrobial resistance (AMR).  The group is tasked with addressing the above issue and is drafting an Action Plan to address aspects relating to antimicrobial resistance.  Currently, there is limited surveillance data on antimicrobial prescribing in the community, thus work on setting targets is still being progressed. </p><p>For the first time the Department's National Healthcare Quality Reporting System (NHQRS) Second Annual Report 2016 reported data on antibiotic consumption in the community.  The community antibiotic consumption dataset contains regional monthly wholesaler to retail pharmacy sales data from over 95% of the wholesalers and manufacturers in Ireland. </p><p>Prescription level data from the Primary Care Reimbursement Service (PCRS) has shown a decrease in the number of antibiotic prescriptions in recent years, and there is some indication that the quality of antibiotic prescribing in the community is improving in line with national guidelines.  The HSE is currently working towards developing and implementing a system to provide prescription-level surveillance and audit data for antimicrobial prescribing in Primary Care, which would include individual prescriber feedback to support improved prescribing practices.  </p><p>In the meantime other actions by the Executive to address this issue include:</p><p>- Updating the antimicrobial prescribing guidelines for use in primary care settings.  </p><p>- A list of &ldquo;preferred antibiotics&rdquo; has been developed for Primary Care settings and there are a series of implementation programmes underway to promote the use of a restricted number of antibiotics in community settings (including educational sessions for GPs, promotion via the HSE Medicines Management Programme, and an improvement project based in GP Out-Of-Hours centres).</p><p>- The national primary care prescribing guidelines () include recommendations around diagnostic testing for some specific conditions.</p><p>- There have been a series of public information campaigns targeting community antibiotic use between 2008 and 2014.  Post marketing surveillance has shown an improvement in public knowledge around antibiotics.</p><p>- A very successful public information website () was developed by HSE, ICGP, and IPU, and launched in 2014, promoting self-care for self-limiting illnesses and avoiding unnecessary antibiotic use. </p><p>- Ireland has taken part in European Antibiotic Awareness Day since 2008; the initiative has been linked to the launch of professional and public information campaigns.</p><p>A recent review of antibiotic prescribing via the Primary Care Reimbursement System (PCRS) has shown a reduction in the rate of antibiotic prescribing, particularly among children and young adults (who have been the principal target groups of public information campaigns in this area, and of the &ldquo;undertheweather.ie&rdquo; website).  In addition, this review has shown that the pattern of antibiotic prescribing has improved, in line with national primary care antibiotic prescribing guidelines.  Diagnostic testing at primary care level is recognised as a useful component in helping to improving prescribing practices and reducing over-prescribing of antimicrobials.  There are a number of research studies currently underway looking at novel diagnostic tools in the international setting.</p><p>The European Union at both Council and European Parliament levels supports a Community Strategy against AMR having regard to the <i>'One Health' </i>concept.  The Commission's 2012 AMR 5-year action plan has recently been revised through<i>Council Conclusions on the next steps under a &lsquo;One Health&rsquo; approach to combat AMR, </i>adopted at the Council's Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council (EPSCO) meeting on 17 June last.  Ireland has continued to support the EU drive to combat AMR and actively engaged in discussions on the new Council Conclusions.  The Council calls on Member States to have in place before mid-2017 'a national action plan against Antimicrobial resistance based on the <i>'One Health</i>' approach and in line with the objectives of the WHO Global Action Plan'.</p><p>In recognition of the serious and increasing threat of antimicrobial resistance and the requirement for a &lsquo;whole of Government&rsquo; approach to health issues, the Department of Health&rsquo;s Chief Medical Officer (CMO) and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine&rsquo;s Chief Veterinary Officer (CVO) established a high level National Interdepartmental AMR Consultative Committee in 2014 to address this issue.  The Committee meets Ireland&rsquo;s requirements to have an Intersectoral co-ordination mechanism for addressing AMR at European level, including the development of a national action plan against AMR as required of Member States in the WHO's Global Action Plan against AMR (2015).</p><p>The Committee has a clear role and mandate across the human and animal health sectors.  Committee membership consists of representatives of both Departments and of a range of relevant health and veterinary specialist agencies, including other relevant bodies with a remit across the two sectors; membership is representative of major stakeholders.  The Committee meets bi-annually and its last meeting was in April 2016.  The Committee's work plan for 2016 includes development of a national action plan against AMR, which includes ongoing engagement with all relevant stakeholders, both Committee member and others.  This work is continuing and the Committee is scheduled to meet again in late 2016 to assess progress on this major agenda item.  It is intended that the National Action Plan will be finalised by mid-2017 in line with European Council requirements.  Should the relevant Oireachtas Committee issue an invitation my Department would be happy to brief the Committee on the National Action Plan on AMR when finalised.</p><p>HCAI surveillance is complex.  Information on excess costs of HCAIs such as prolonged hospital stay, further treatments required, attributable mortality and other complications can be complex to assess, particularly to confirm that complications are directly linked to HCAI episodes and not to other factors.  National HCAI surveillance systems at European level are, however, in place and EU Member States collect routinely-generated antimicrobial susceptibility testing data in invasive infections and report to the European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) through its European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network (EARS-Net).</p><p>The ECDC assesses this data along with estimated costs of increased hospital stays and treatments. European estimates indicate that approximately 4.1 million patients are estimated to acquire a HCAI in the EU each year with 37,000 attributable deaths annually and HCAIs also contributing to an additional 110,000 deaths.  The burden of HCAI is also reflected in significant financial losses.  According to the ECDC these infections account for approximately &euro;7 billion per year.  The ECDC 2011-2012 Point Prevalence Survey of HCAIs and AMR use in European hospitals estimates that Ireland had 494 patients with a HCAI.  This equated to a mean of 9,554 beds occupied per day.  (A Point Prevalence Survey gives a snapshot picture of the number of patients with a HCAI in hospital at a particular point in time).</p><p>The National Clinical Guideline 'Prevention and Control Methicillin-Resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>(MRSA)', endorsed by the National Clinical Effectiveness Committee (NCEC) in 2013 estimated the cost of HCAI in Ireland for 2011, extrapolated from national (HSE) and international sources, at &euro;118, 257,312 with 29,388 patients acquiring a HCAI.  </p><p>Management and reduction of Healthcare Associated Infections (HCAIs) is made very challenging by the rise in antimicrobial resistance world wide.  The World Health Organisation (WHO) states that the rise in antimicrobial resistance is one of the greatest potential threats to human and animal health at global, European and national levels with possible serious consequences for public health, animal welfare and the agriculture and food sectors. </p><p>A wide range of initiatives has been put in place in the Irish health system over several years to address HCAI and AMR including improved surveillance of infections and prescribing, infection prevention and control processes, antimicrobial stewardship initiatives, public and professional awareness raising and with a significant emphasis on the education and training of healthcare professionals.</p><p>The prevention and control of healthcare associated infections (HCAIs) and AMR has been a significant patient safety and public health priority for the Department of Health Ireland for numerous years.  Ireland as a whole is fully committed to and engaged in addressing resolution of the problem of AMR and will continue to collaborate at international, EU and national levels to this end.</p></reply>

This Committee comprised expertise in the areas of epidemiology, neurology, paediatrics and paediatric neurology.   </p>  <p>  The study found that there was a 13 fold higher risk of narcolepsy in children/adolescents vaccinated with the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 vaccine compared with unvaccinated children/adolescents.</p>  <p>  The development of narcolepsy following pandemic vaccination is not a uniquely Irish issue.  The results from the Irish data concur with those observed in Finland and Sweden. </p>  <p>  All of the studies confirm a strong association between the pandemic vaccine and the development of narcolepsy in the 5 to 19 year age group.  However, this is not evidence of causation and further studies are required in order to seek explanations of the increased risk of narcolepsy in children and adolescents in certain countries.</p>  <p>  As of 7 September 2016, the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) has received 81 reports with clinical information confirming a diagnosis of narcolepsy in individuals who were vaccinated with Pandemrix (80) and Celvapan (1).  The majority of these reports relate to children/adolescents.</p>  <p>  Pandemrix accounted for 88% of pandemic influenza vaccine received and 22.5% of the population received at least one dose of Pandemrix vaccine (0.95 million out of a total population of 4.2 million).  The 5-19 age group had a significantly higher uptake with 39.8% (339,312) of that age group receiving at least one dose of Pandemrix&reg; (0.34 million out of 0.85 million).</p>  <p>  My Department, the HSE and the Department of Education and Skills continue to work together to provide a wide range of services and supports for those affected by narcolepsy following the administration of pandemic influenza vaccine.</p>  <p>  The HSE&rsquo;s Advocacy Unit acts as liaison with service and support providers and other Government Departments to facilitate access to required services.  It is in regular contact with individuals affected and regularly meets with representatives of the SOUND (sufferers of unique narcolepsy disorder).  Regional co-ordinators have been appointed to assist individuals by providing advice, information and access to local services.</p>  <p>  The ex-gratia health supports include clinical care pathways to ensure access to rapid diagnosis and treatment, multi-disciplinary assessments led by clinical experts, counselling services for both the individuals and their families, discretionary medical cards for those who have been diagnosed have been provided to allow unlimited access to GP care and any prescribed medication, ex-gratia reimbursement of vouched expenses incurred in the process of diagnosis and treatment, including travel expenses for attending medical appointments; physiotherapy, occupational therapy assessments, dental  assessments and dietary services all on a needs basis. </p>  <p>  As of 12 September 2016, legal proceedings against the Minister, the Health Services Executive and GlaxoSmithKline Biological SA have been initiated by 50 individuals.  The plaintiffs allege personal injury in which they claim the development of narcolepsy (cataplexy) resulted from the administration of the H1N1 pandemic vaccine.</p></reply>

These beds will continue to be very much needed over the coming years as the number of older people increases in line with demographic trends.  It is therefore essential that they are put on a sustainable footing and that the fabric of the buildings from which they operate is modernised and improved. </p>  <p>  The Capital Programme announced earlier this year provides for the replacement and refurbishment of 90 public nursing homes across the country over the next five years.  Significant work was undertaken by the HSE in determining the most appropriate scheduling of projects over the five-year period from 2016 to 2021, within the phased provision of funding, to achieve compliance and registration with HIQA.</p>  <p>  Under this Capital Programme it is proposed to deliver a 100 bed CNU at Connolly Hospital by 2021.  This will replace 40 existing beds where the physical environment requires significant improvement.  The additional 60 beds to be provided will assist in addressing the future needs of the catchment area.  All healthcare infrastructure developments, including this development, must comply with DPER Guidelines and EU Directives and will require a lead-in time to complete the various stages.  This includes appraisal, project brief, design feasibility, detailed design, some of which may overlap, finalisation of financing and review of costing estimates.</p></reply>

It is available free of charge from the HSE for all girls in the first year of secondary school. </p>  <p>  Each year in Ireland around 300 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer.  The HPV vaccine protects against two high risk types of HPV (16 &amp;amp; 18) that cause 73% of all cervical cancers.  Vaccinated women and girls will still be at risk from other high risk types of HPV that can cause cervical cancer and will therefore need to continue to have regular cervical smear tests.  The Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) is the regulatory authority for medicines in Ireland.  There are two licensed HPV vaccines available in Ireland (Gardasil and Cervarix).  Gardasil is the vaccine used by the HSE in the School Immunisation Programme and over 100,000 girls have received this vaccine since its introduction.  </p>  <p>  The HSE provides information for parents about diseases, the vaccines to prevent them and side effects to allow them to choose whether or not to give consent to vaccination.  All vaccination information provided to parents is prepared from the available licensed documentation for each vaccine, the Summary of Products Characteristics and Patient Information Leaflet.  The information booklets include information on the most common adverse events that can occur after each vaccination.  Seizures, muscle weakness, leg pain, joint pain and chronic fatigue are not mentioned as known side effects to Gardasil in the Patient Information Leaflet.  There are no known long term side effects to the vaccine Gardasil.  The information is presented in clear simple language and approved by the National Adult Literacy Agency so that it can be understood by all adults as the average reading age in Ireland is 12 years of age.  Parents are also given contact details for their local immunisation office and advised to speak to a member of the school immunisation team if they have any further questions. </p>  <p>  Should parents require additional information about vaccines the immunisation leaflet refers to the HSE&rsquo;s national immunisation website (www.immunisation.ie).  The national immunisation website has been accredited by the World Health Organisation for credibility, content and good information practices.  The website allows members of the public to contact the National Immunisation Office to ask a question if they require further information.  These questions, when possible, are answered by the staff of the National Immunisation Office within one working day.</p>  <p>  No medicine, including vaccines, is entirely without risk, there is therefore on-going pharmacovigilance and monitoring of medicinal products once they are authorised for use.  The safety profile of Gardasil has been continuously monitored since it was first authorised.  As part of its monitoring of the safety of medicines, the HPRA operates an adverse reaction reporting system, where healthcare professionals and patients are encouraged to report adverse reactions they consider may be associated with their treatment, through the range of options in place for reporting.  All reports received are evaluated and considered in the context of the safety profile of the product concerned, with reports followed up as necessary for further information, that may assist in the assessment of the case.</p>  <p>  In November 2015 the European Medicines Agency completed a detailed scientific review of the HPV vaccine.  The review, in which the HPRA participated, found no evidence of a causal link between the vaccine and the two conditions examined.  The review recognised that, at that time, more than 80 million girls and women worldwide have now received these vaccines, and in some European countries they have been given to 90% of the age group recommended for vaccination.  Use of these vaccines is expected to prevent many cases of cervical cancer (cancer of the neck of the womb, which is responsible for over 20,000 deaths in Europe each year) and various other cancers and conditions caused by HPV.  The benefits of HPV vaccines therefore continue to outweigh the known side effects.  The safety of these vaccines, as with all medicines, will continue to be carefully monitored and will take into account any future new evidence of side effects that becomes available.  On 12 January 2016 the European Commission endorsed the conclusion of the European Medicines Agency stating that there is no need to change the way HPV vaccines are used or to amend the product information.  This final outcome by the Commission is now binding in all member states.</p>  <p>  My Department has no plans to conduct another review.</p></reply>

The Medicinal Products (Control of Advertising) Regulations, 2007 provide for a range of restrictions on gifts and hospitality.  For example, a gift must be inexpensive and relevant to the practice of medicine or pharmacy.  Hospitality must be reasonable in level, strictly limited to the main purpose or scientific objective of the event, and not extended to persons other than health professionals.  Health professionals are also prohibited from soliciting or accepting any prohibited inducement, hospitality or sponsorship. </p>  <p>  The pharmaceutical industry operates a voluntary code of practice for the purpose of providing practical guidance to the Regulations.  Any individual who believes that a particular promotional activity is in breach of the code may submit a complaint to the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association.  Complaints are heard by committees consisting of industry representatives, independent lay members and chaired by an independent chairman. In addition to this self-regulatory system, breaches of the Regulations may be prosecuted in the courts under section 32 of the Irish Medicines Board Acts 1996 and 2006.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, there are a range of legislative provisions in place to protect patients involved in clinical trials for medicines.  Every clinical trial involving a patient in Ireland must be approved by the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA), who carry out a scientific assessment, and by a recognised ethics committee whose role is to ensure that trials are ethical and that patients&rsquo; rights are protected.</p>  <p>  Once a medicine has been authorised (licensed), a pharmaceutical company can make an application to have a medicine reimbursed under the community drugs schemes.  Decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds by the HSE on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE).  The NCPE conducts a health technology assessment of pharmaceutical products for the HSE, and can make recommendations on reimbursement to assist the HSE in its decision-making process.  In the case of oncology drugs a report is also sent to the National Cancer Control Programme (NCCP).</p>  <p>  In view of the above I am satisfied that the current system of regulation is effective in protecting patients and I hope that I have addressed the Deputy&rsquo;s concerns.</p></reply>

The management of scoliosis is complex and is determined by the severity of the curvature and skeletal maturity.</p>  <p>  Long waiting times for scoliosis surgery are not acceptable, and my Department has been working closely with the HSE to address services pressures, particularly in Our Lady's Children's Hospital Crumlin (OLCHC), which is the largest provider of scoliosis surgery for children and young people.  Additional funding of &euro;1.042m was allocated under the 2015 Service Plan to increase capacity at OLCHC, and an additional orthopaedic surgeon, anaesthetist, and support staff, are now in place with recruitment of a further additional orthopaedic surgeon underway.  Capital funding was also provided for a new theatre on site to expand theatre capacity further, and this is currently being commissioned.  The Children's Hospital Group is proactively working on nurse recruitment to support the opening of the new theatre. </p>  <p>  The recently announced  &euro;40 million additional funding for the HSE Winter Initiative 2016/2017 also includes &euro;2m provided specifically for scoliosis patients to treat 39 adolescent patients on the Tallaght waiting list and an additional 15-20 paediatric patients by year end.  My Department will continue to work with the HSE and the relevant hospitals to ensure improvements in access to spinal surgery.</p>  <p>  The scheduling of appointments is a matter for the hospital to which the patient has been referred.

However, there are many areas where constraints on resources limit the levels of service that can be given and homecare is no different.  This is unfortunate but it is going very much too far to suggest that this constitutes abuse of the elderly by the state.</p>  <p>  Home support services across the country are being stretched by demands from more people, and for more hours in the evenings and at weekends, all of which cost more.  Activity in the first quarter of 2016 was ahead of the same period last year as efforts continued to alleviate pressure on the acute hospital system.  Without additional funding this could not have been sustained and the allocations for the rest of the year would have had to be reduced.</p>  <p>  However, the Government has been able to respond to this situation by providing an extra &euro;40m for home care in 2016.  As a result, not only are we maintaining home care services at 2015 levels, but increasing them in 2016.  This will ensure that the HSE will provide 270,000 extra home help hours and 2,000 Home Care Packages more than what was planned for in 2015.</p>  <p>  The Programme for a Partnership Government commits to increasing provision for home care in the years ahead.  The planning and management of future health expenditure will be considered as part of the annual estimates and budgetary process which seeks to balance available funding across all of service areas to achieve the best possible outcomes for the greatest number of service users. </p></reply>

The management of scoliosis is complex and is determined by the severity of the curvature and skeletal maturity.</p>  <p>  Long waiting times for scoliosis surgery are not acceptable, and my Department has been working closely with the HSE to address services pressures, particularly in Our Lady's Children's Hospital Crumlin (OLCHC), which is the largest provider of scoliosis surgery for children and young people.  Additional funding of &euro;1.042m was allocated under the 2015 Service Plan to increase capacity at OLCHC, and an additional orthopaedic surgeon, anaesthetist, and support staff, are now in place with recruitment of a further additional orthopaedic surgeon underway.  Capital funding was also provided for a new theatre on site to expand theatre capacity further, and this is currently being commissioned.  The Children's Hospital Group is proactively working on nurse recruitment to support the opening of the new theatre. </p>  <p>  The HSE Winter Initiative 2016-2017, published on 9th September, also includes funding to address adolescent and paediatric scoliosis waiting lists in Cappagh and Tallaght.

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost.

In the case of a couple, the applicant&rsquo;s means are assessed as 50% of the couple&rsquo;s combined income and assets.  The first &euro;36,000 of an individual&rsquo;s assets, or &euro;72,000 in the case of a couple, is not counted at all in the financial assessment.  The capital value of an individual&rsquo;s principal private residence is only included in the financial assessment for the first three years of their time in care. </p><p>In assessing a person's non-cash assets e.g. principal private residence, property etc., the asset must be valued on the basis of the estimated market value which is defined in the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act, 2009 as the price the asset would fetch on the open market on the date on which the application for financial support is made to the HSE.  Section 44(4) of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act, 2009 provides for applications for financial support to be accompanied by valuations of assets.  In line with the Scheme's national guidelines, persons applying for financial support must submit valuations of assets with their application form.  However, under Section 10 of the legislation, the HSE does not have to accept a valuation submitted by an applicant and may seek its own independent valuation of a particular asset. </p><p>On the commencement of the Local Property Tax in 2013, the use of the Revenue Commissioners valuations for the purposes of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme was considered by the Department of Health and the HSE.  It was decided at that stage not to use the Revenue Commissioners information as it was based on valuation bands and deemed not to be an accurate valuation that an asset would fetch on the open market on the date on which the application for financial support is made to the HSE. </p><p>However, it should be noted that the property valuation process is being examined at present as part of the work associated with the Review of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme, which was published in July 2015<i>. </i>The Review recommended the consideration of options to encourage realistic valuations of declared property assets and also to liaise with the Revenue Commissions on the scope for improved validation of declaration of income/assets.<i><font color="#0000FF"> </font></i>An Interdepartmental/Agency Working Group has been established to progress the recommendations contained in the Review.  This group is chaired by the Department of Health and includes representatives from the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the HSE, the Revenue Commissioners and, when required, the National Treatment Purchase Fund. </p><p>A specific date has not been set for the Working Group to conclude its work, but it is in the process of reporting on its progress to date to the Cabinet Committee on Health.  This will be done shortly, in line with the Committee's own scheduling requirements.</p></reply>

There will be two changes made to the Primary Childhood Immunisation Schedule later this year with the introduction of Men B and Rotavirus for all babies born on or after 1 October, 2016. The HSE is currently working on the necessary preparations for the introduction of these new vaccines.  All vaccines administered through the Primary Childhood Immunisation Schedule are provided free of charge.  The Men B immunisation programme which starts in quarter 4 this year makes Ireland the second country in Europe to make the vaccine available free of charge as part of its national immunisation programme. </p>  <p>  NIAC makes many recommendations in relation to &ldquo;at risk groups&rdquo; but not all of these are included in the current immunisation schedule.  The introduction of the vaccine to the childhood immunisation programmes means that all children born on or after 1 October, 2016 will automatically receive the vaccine.  However, there are no plans at this stage to introduce a catch-up programme for older children.  Those who have a medical card are eligible to have the vaccine administered by their GP free of charge.  However the purchase of the vaccine is not covered by the medical card scheme.</p></reply>

In addition there has also been a call that family involvement in the care and treatment of such patients should be made compulsory.</p><p>The Expert Group which reviewed the Mental Health Act 2001 and published its report in 2015, looked at the former and recommended &lsquo;<i>proactive encouragement for the patient at all stages to involve his/her family/carer and/or chosen advocate in the admission process and in the development of the care and treatment plan with the patient&rsquo;s consent&rsquo;</i>.  Outcomes tend to be better when family are involved and the recommendation of the Expert Group in this regard is seen as important and is accepted by all key stakeholders.  The vast bulk of patients are satisfied to allow families to be involved.</p><p>However, there are other considerations which must be taken into account where a patient reserves the right to withhold consent to share confidential information with his or her family.</p><p>Firstly, it should be clearly stated that the Medical Council&rsquo;s Ethical Guide already specifically allows a doctor to ethically breach confidentiality if, for example, he/she believes that the patient is at risk of harming himself/herself or others.  Doctors therefore have existing powers in exceptional circumstances and do use them where they consider it necessary.  That is not to say, of course, that the prediction of risk is easy.</p><p>While encouraging family involvement in the care and treatment of mental health patients was recommended by the Expert Group, there was no such recommendation that such involvement should be made compulsory against the wishes of the patient.</p><p>There may be potentially serious downsides to such an absolute approach where those with mental illness may decide not to confide in their Doctor/medical team at all if they are strongly against involving family members involved for whatever reason.  Last week the annual St Patrick&rsquo;s Mental Health Services survey reported that 22% of people said they would not tell anyone if they were experiencing suicidal thoughts.  The worry is that some patients, if told that any of their personal health issues could be discussed with family members without their consent, would not tell anyone about possible suicide ideation or seek appropriate medical advice in the first place.  This is a legitimate concern that needs to be considered if any move was made to make family involvement compulsory.</p></reply>

In order to determine the most appropriate funding model for AHR in the State, the Health Research Board (HRB) was engaged to conduct a comprehensive review of international public funding models.  This HRB evidence review is due to be completed before the end of 2016. </p>  <p>  Officials in my Department are currently drafting the General Scheme of legislative provisions on AHR and associated research and it is envisaged that it will be published in 2017.  This comprehensive piece of legislation will regulate a range of practices for the first time, including: gamete (sperm or egg) and embryo donation for AHR and research; surrogacy; pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) of embryos; posthumous assisted reproduction; and stem cell research.  Once the General Scheme has been published, my Department will undertake a consultation process to seek the views of both the general public and stakeholder groups on the General Scheme.  In addition, the General Scheme will be submitted to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children for the purposes of pre-legislative scrutiny. </p></reply>

In relation to Hospital Group Board appointments, Chairs are in place for all Hospital Group Boards,  and Board members were appointed to three out of seven hospital groups  - Saolta University Healthcare Group, University of Limerick Hospitals Group (UL) and the Children&rsquo;s Hospital Group.  The terms of office of the Saolta University Healthcare Group and University of Limerick Hospital Group Boards are due to expire soon.  Given the scale of the change process involved in implementing Hospital Groups, the Hospital Group Boards must be populated with individuals with the expertise and competencies necessary to deliver on the strategic and change management agenda.  My Department has, through the Public Appointments Service, just advertised for expressions of interest in the position of Chairperson of the Saolta University Healthcare Group.  It will shortly seek expressions of interest for members of the UL Hospitals Group Board and other Hospital Group Boards thereafter,  excluding the Children's Hospital Group, and I expect to be in a position to start appoint Board members in the coming months.</p></reply>

Alcohol is causing significant damage across the population, in workplaces and to children in families.  It also carries a substantial burden to all in Irish society.  The Government has agreed proposals to tackle alcohol misuse which aim to reduce alcohol consumption in Ireland to 9.1 litres per person per annum by 2020 and to reduce the harms associated with the misuse of alcohol.  The Public Health (Alcohol) Bill addresses the underlying causes of alcohol misuse i.e. affordability, availability and attractiveness.  The Steering Group on a National Substance Misuse Strategy contains a number of recommendations for the provision of treatment and services to those suffering from alcohol addiction.</p><p>The HSE has advised that every patient who presents to an Emergency Department (ED) is legally entitled to as comprehensive an assessment as is necessary and that medical and nursing staff are vocationally bound to deliver this care without judgement or prejudice.  A key challenge in dealing with undiagnosed and acutely distressed patients in an ED environment is to distinguish between distress that is the result of illness and/or injury and that which is due to understandable anxiety.  This challenge is magnified in the case of deciding if someone is simply intoxicated or has a serious medical problem that became manifest after drinking alcohol.  The management of patients who have a head injury but also happen or appear to be intoxicated is just one example of why extreme caution and diligence is required in this area.  <font color="#002041">The HSE has also advised that, if, after the appropriate level of assessment, a person is found to have no medical reason to be in the ED and are causing disruption, they will be asked to leave.  Should they not do so, all necessary steps, up to and including enlisting the assistance of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, will be taken if necessary, so long as doing so does not affect the care of other patients awaiting treatment.</font></p><p>There are a number of initiatives underway in the HSE which may assist in reducing the number of intoxicated people in Emergency Departments:</p><p>-  Clinical Decision Units are areas adjacent to the ED (in some larger EDs), that provides for a short period of observation, assessment or therapy for patients who have finished the ED phase of care, but are not yet fit for discharge.  The fundamental purpose of the Clinical Decision Unit is to make safe clinical decisions on a patient who is not yet fit for discharge, but likely to be ready for discharge within 24 hours.  Patients who require observation, including those whose need for observation arises from incapacity as a result of intoxication, are one such group who benefit from a stay in these units.</p><p>-  Some EDs have successfully run occasional initiatives, in conjunction with other emergency services, whereby appropriately qualified staff are placed in facilities in areas where it is known there will be a large number of intoxicated patients, usually in inner city areas during national holidays and other celebrations.  This allows for the treatment of some injuries and other medical problems on the scene, leaving a satisfied patient and removing the need to attend the ED in some instances.</p><p>-  Such outposts are also very successfully deployed at large concerts, sporting events and, in particular marathons, where dehydration and hypo or hyperthermia may, in many instances be treated at the scene.  </p></reply>

This is the first cross-border service of its kind and represents a milestone in medical provision for the north west.</p>  <p>  The Saolta Group has appointed a Consultant Interventional Cardiologist at Letterkenny University Hospital, who will assist in delivering the pPCI service from Altnagelvin. Patients within 90 minutes&rsquo; travelling distance of Altnagelvin Hospital will now have access to 24/7 pPCI at that facility. </p>  <p>  Up to 60 patients from County Donegal suffering from a STEMI heart attack will be treated in Altnagelvin every year. Previously, patients from this region had to be transported to University Hospital Galway. This initiative therefore represents a significant improvement in terms of rapid access to pPCI for patients in County Donegal. </p></reply>

There was a grace period (of 9 months) provided up until 30 April 2015, during which time people of any age could take out health insurance without incurring loadings.  Late entry loadings of 2% per annum now apply for people who buy health insurance for the first time at the age of 35 and older. </p>  <p>  In this instance, the legislation has been applied appropriately in the same manner which applies for any individual in the State taking out health insurance, for the first time, at age 35 or over.</p></reply>

Regulations were made in 1971, 1973 and 1975 prescribing the 16 conditions that are covered by the LTI Scheme: acute leukaemia; mental handicap; cerebral palsy; mental illness (in a person under 16); cystic fibrosis; multiple sclerosis; diabetes insipidus; muscular dystrophies; diabetes mellitus; parkinsonism; epilepsy; phenylketonuria; haemophilia; spina bifida; hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide.  Under the scheme, patients receive drugs, medicines, and medical and surgical appliances directly related to the treatment of their illness, free of charge. </p>  <p>  The  list of conditions covered by the LTI Scheme has not changed since 1975. There are no plans to extend the list of conditions covered by the scheme.</p></reply>

Prior to deciding whether to reimburse a medicine, the HSE considers a range of statutory criteria, including clinical need, cost-effectiveness and the resources available. </p>  <p>  The decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds by the HSE, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE).  The NCPE conducts health technology assessments (HTAs) of pharmaceutical products for the HSE, and can make recommendations on reimbursement to assist the HSE in its decision-making process. </p>  <p>  At the request of the HSE, the NCPE is currently conducting an assessment of Vimizim for the treatment of mucopolysaccharidosis, type IVa (also known as Morquio A syndrome) in patients of all ages. Once this assessment is completed, a summary report will be published on the NCPE website.  The HSE will then consider the NCPE assessment as part of its decision-making process when considering the drug for reimbursement. </p>  <p>  As the NCPE's assessment of Vimizim is ongoing, it is not possible to provide further details at this time.</p></reply>

The Netherlands, as the Rapporteur Member State, was responsible for the initial EU evaluation.  This evaluation was then peer reviewed by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the Member States, resulting in its approval by the EU Commission and the Member States in December 2015.</p>  <p>  Flupyradifurone is approved in the United States and is seen by the US Environmental Protection Agency as an alternative to more toxic insecticides such as pyrethroids, neonicotinoids and organophosphates.  The US EPA has advised that &ldquo;As an insecticide, flupyradifurone is unusual in that laboratory-based studies indicate that the compound is practically non-toxic to adult honeybees. Studies show no adverse effect on overall bee colony performance or overwintering ability when compared to untreated colonies&rdquo;.  In addition, the Canadian Pest Management Regulatory Agency has also issued a wide-ranging approval for this active substance.   </p>  <p>  There are currently no plant protection products containing flupyradifurone in Ireland.  However, because of its environmental and human toxicology profile, it is possible that approval for its use in the amateur/home garden market in Ireland may be sought in the future.</p>  <p>  The Netherlands, on behalf of the EU are currently evaluating plant protection products containing this active substance and will finalise their deliberations in the coming months. When this evaluation has been completed, Ireland will then consider the results and will be used as part of our decision making processes.   </p></reply>

The BDGP builds on the large investment in data recording and genomics which have been made in recent years and will continue to drive further developments and improvements in this area.</p>  <p>  The BDGP has been agreed with the European Commission as part of Ireland&rsquo;s Rural Development Plan (2014-2020) alongside a number of other schemes. I am conscious of the positive effect that the programme will have on the Irish suckler herd. It will help to improve productivity, profitability and carbon efficiency in the Irish suckler herd. I firmly believe that the scheme will deliver long-term and cumulative positive effects for both suckler farmers participating in the scheme, and farmers who buy the progeny of suckler cows for further finishing. It is a significant contributor to Ireland&rsquo;s reputation as a producer of sustainable beef.</p>  <p>  In relation to any possible reopening of the scheme, this will have to be considered in the context of an assessment of budgetary priorities, the operation of the Rural Development Programme and the potential impact both upon the scheme itself and other schemes.   </p></reply>

It is known that in some cases the invoices submitted were for amounts greater than those actually paid by the participants.  </p>  <p>  Funding provided under the scheme comes partly from the EU and partly from the National Exchequer.  There is a requirement and obligation to ensure that the expenditure claimed by scheme participants reflects the reality of what took place.  For that reason my Department wrote to participants requesting alternative proof that the amounts claimed were in fact the amounts paid. </p>  <p>  The person named was written to on 10 June 2015 regarding the non-productive capital investment claim that they had submitted.  This letter requested the submission of alternative, verifiable, proof to support one of the invoices that was included in the claim for expenditure incurred.  A reply to this letter was received on 2 July 2015.</p>  <p>  My Department officials carefully examined the application in light of this reply and the information gathered following the investigation of all cases.  This examination indicated that the amount claimed had not been satisfactorily verified and that the amounts claimed were greater than the costs incurred for similar products in verified cases and the general price for such products at the time.  A letter informing the applicant of this determination, and of the proposed penalty to be imposed was issued on 5 August 2016.  This letter also offered the applicant an opportunity to have the determination reviewed within the Department and to submit additional information if they so wished not later than 26 August 2016.  A request for a review was not received.  A final decision letter issued to the person named on 7 September 2016.</p>  <p>  The file will now be processed in the light of this decision and any payments due, following the imposition of the penalties set out in this decision, will be made shortly.

The Commission has responded to these difficulties through the deployment of support measures provided for under the CAP, at first in an ad-hoc manner and then in the form of two wider packages of measures, in September 2015 and March 2016.  Ireland have played a key role in shaping these responses.</p>  <p>  Despite the two packages of measures, the market difficulties continued into the middle of 2016. </p>  <p>  The Commission presented a further package of measures at the Agri-Fish Council on 18 July.  The main component is a fund of &euro;500 million, which is in turn comprised of two elements:</p>  <p>- The first is a &euro;150 million EU-wide measure that will compensate farmers for reducing their milk output in the final quarter of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 (at a rate of 14c/kg).  The detailed rules regarding this measure were agreed at EU level on August 25th and the Commission have provided the legal provisions to give effect to this measure in early September 2016.  At national level, the scheme is in the process of implementation via cooperatives.  The closing date for applications from producers was yesterday, September 15th.</p>  <p>- The second element of the EU July 2016 package is a &euro;350 million fund that will be allocated to Member States in the form of national envelopes, which Member States can use in accordance with their domestic circumstances.  Whilst eligibility criteria will apply, Member States are afforded a large degree of flexibility in terms of the measures they might adopt.  Ireland&rsquo;s allocation from the fund will be &euro;11.09 million.  Member States will be required to notify the Commission by 1 November 2016 of the measures to be adopted.   </p>  <p>  It should be clearly noted that the above represent two distinct and separate policy responses at EU level.  Availing of one element of the package at national level is not conditional on participation in the other measure.  The Voluntary Supply Management Scheme, details of which were published recently on my Department&rsquo;s website and relayed to cooperatives, through whom the scheme will be administered, is an EU wide scheme.  The exceptional adjustment aid represents a national envelope, which stipulates various eligibility criteria that can be utilised as a basis for disbursement.  Final decisions on how Ireland will utilise this latter aid element have not yet been reached and the matter is subject to ongoing consideration in consultation with the EU and National stakeholders.  Issues such as dealing with liquidity concerns, strengthening co-operation, supporting quality schemes and providing training in financial management all offer possibilities for meaningful and innovative interventions.</p></reply>

While there are no individual sectoral targets assigned or proposed for the non-emissions trading sector, which includes agriculture, each sector must play its part towards meeting our national targets. </p>  <p>  The EU Heads of State recognised in October 2014 that there are limited cost-effective mitigation options available in agriculture; therefore, further reducing emissions will be one of the more significant challenges the sector faces.  That said, Irish agriculture emissions are currently 4.2% below 2005 levels and it is independently and internationally recognised that ours is one of the most climate resilient and resource/carbon efficient agri-food production systems in the world.  We continue to work with all stakeholders to find even greater efficiencies.   </p>  <p>  As part of the Whole of Government approach to climate policy, officials from my Department are working closely with other Departments and have engaged extensively with the Commission in order to seek an appropriate and consistent approach to EU climate and agriculture policy. </p>  <p>  Under the 2015 Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act, a National Mitigation Plan is being prepared, and my Department is currently developing the mitigation plan for the agriculture sector which will inform future climate policy as we move towards our national ambition of a low-carbon climate resilient economy. </p>  <p>  Reports such as that produced by the IIEA and RDS will add to the debate and inform thinking as we seek to establish Ireland as a climate-smart leader internationally.  Ireland has played a very prominent role at EU and international levels in the important debate on Climate Smart Agriculture, and this is acknowledged in the report.</p></reply>

This is an open access fishery and track record is not considered an appropriate management tool for the small operators in this fishery.  The Ministerial policy for Celtic Sea Herring was adopted in 2012 after more than a year of intensive consultations with stakeholders.   </p>  <p>  The 2015 quota for the Sentinel fishery was 2,212 tonnes, however only 990 tonnes were landed due to bad weather.  Because of the low catches in the Sentinel Fishery in 2015 and at the request of the National Inshore Fisheries Forum (NIFF) for increased fishing opportunities for the inshore fleet in 2016, I proposed on an exceptional basis, a once off increase of 500 tonnes for this fishery for 2016.  I sought the views of stakeholders.  In all instances, the views received fully supported the proposal.  I have accordingly transferred 500 tonnes from the Main Fisheries allocation to the Sentinel fishery for 2016.   </p>  <p>  This increase of 500 tonnes will not involve any change on Ministerial policy on the management of the Celtic Sea Herring fishery as this proposal will only be applicable to 2016.  The total allocation to the sentinel fishery for 2016 is now 2,380 tonnes.  In January 2016, a 3 week sentinel fishery operated, which recorded landings of 535 tonnes.  The available balance for the autumn is 1,845 tonnes. </p>  <p>  I asked the Celtic Sea Herring Management Advisory Committee (CSHMAC ), which represents the fishing industry, to take cognisance of the impact of the opening dates on the Sentinel fishery in 2015 when making its recommendation to me for this year.  The Committee has advised that in its experience of the fishery, the herring stock does not come close enough inshore for the small sentinel vessels to catch it until around early November.  The Committee has considered all the issues and I have receive d this week its formal advice; I am currently considering this.</p></reply>

AIM is a system covering bovine, ovine, caprine and equine animals.  The facilities for bovine animals are the most detailed as there is a requirement to register and identify animals and a comprehensive movement monitoring system is in place that includes clearance against the database prior to movement from holding to holding, entry into the food chain and export.</p>  <p>  The AIM system receives movement information from livestock marts, live export points and slaughter plants, licensed knackeries as well as from herd owners in the event of farm to farm movement, ensuring the prompt recording of all movements of cattle to and from these premises.  At slaughter plants and live export points, the origin, identity, movements and life history of the animal are checked against the database before it is permitted to enter the food chain or exported.  In order to be legally traded all bovines must bear official ear tags, be properly registered and associated with the individual moving or selling the animal(s) on the AIM system.</p>  <p>  The system provides assurances to consumers regarding the safety of beef and beef products and I am satisfied that Ireland&rsquo;s obligations under the relevant EU regulations governing the identification and movement of bovines are fully complied with.</p></reply>

This provision of the Act was specifically intended by the Oireachtas to help address the chronic deforestation that had occurred in Ireland.  By the early 1900&rsquo;s, forests covered less than 1% of Ireland&rsquo;s land area; coverage now stands at 10.5% with Government policy aiming to increase that further.</p>  <p>  The only exceptions to the replanting requirement are under a Limited Felling Licence for small projects that provide value to the community (such as playing fields for schools and community centres, etc.) or up to 0.5 ha to build a home for a landowner or for his/her immediate family.  Any project that is for commercial gain (any &lsquo;business&rsquo; such as housing developments, wind farms, farming, industrial, etc.) is required to replant the site or to plant an alternative equivalent site.  </p>  <p>  Replanting after felling is essential to prevent deforestation.  There is an obvious need to avoid deforestation.  Forestry makes a valuable contribution to jobs and growth.  It also contributes to Ireland&rsquo;s carbon storage, environment, landscape and amenity.  To permit such deforestation would counteract the benefits of Ireland&rsquo;s afforestation programme and associated public expenditure, which to date has amounted to a substantial State and European Union investment over many years. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-09-16a.4437.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016091600060#WRFFF08000"><p>The primary compensation scheme for farmers whose herds are affected by TB is the On-Farm Market Valuation Scheme under which compensation is payable for cattle removed as reactors.  The amount is based on the market value of the animal i.e. the price that might reasonably have been obtained for it, from a purchaser on the open market, if the animal had not been affected by TB. Each reactor is valued by an independent Valuer and my Department pays the difference between this valuation and the salvage value which the farmer receives directly from the slaughter plant. </p>  <p>  A review of all the TB Eradication Compensation Schemes was recently completed by my Department. Following that review the maximum ceiling limits, which are payable under the On Farm Market Valuation scheme, for any individual reactor animal removed have been substantially increased. </p>  <p>  In addition, herdowners compensated under the On Farm Market Valuation Scheme may also qualify for supplementary payments under the Depopulation, Income Supplement and Hardship Grant Schemes, subject to compliance with the relevant criteria.  These rates have also been, in some cases, significantly increased. Furthermore, qualification for the Income Supplement and Hardship Grant schemes has been expanded ensuring that some herdowners are now receiving compensation where they would not heretofore. </p>  <p>  The changes to the compensation regime apply to and benefit all herdowners including those who have had numerous TB breakdowns. </p>  <p>  I would remind the deputy that these supplementary compensation schemes are unique in Ireland and not the norm in other jurisdictions where there is a TB problem.  For example in Northern Ireland, England and Wales compensation is only payable for the value of the removed reactor.  It is worth noting also that significant progress is being made in the fight against TB which means that there are now fewer reactor numbers and fewer herds restricted than before.  This has the effect of lessening the chances of farmers being impacted by this disease.</p>  <p>  In view of the foregoing, I am satisfied that farmers, receive a level of compensation which adequately reflects the market valuation of reactors, as if they had not been affected by bovine TB and may, in addition, receive additional support where the relevant criteria are met. In light of this no further review of the scheme is warranted at this time.</p></reply>

Under the Scheme, applicants who plant new native woodlands are eligible to a grant towards the cost of establishing the woodland, and annual premiums to cover income foregone.  The grant is payable in two instalments.  The first instalment of the grant is payable when the planting and associated works are complete.  The second instalment is payable 4 years later on condition that, inter alia, the woodland has been protected and maintained in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Scheme.  Payment of the first instalment of the grant was made in November 2012.</p>  <p>  The application for payment of the second instalment of the establishment grant was received by my Department on 18th August 2016.  The application has been referred for inspection to ensure that the woodland has been protected and maintained in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Scheme.  If the inspection confirms that the woodland has been protected and maintained, and if all other conditions of the Scheme have been complied with, payment of the grant will be issued.  </p></reply>

My Department is however represented on this Group along with farmers, veterinary and other stakeholders and experts. Recent data shows that very significant progress has been made in reducing the prevalence of the disease &ndash; with the Persistently Infected (PI) birth rate falling to 0.15% in 2016 from 0.7% in 2013 (the first year of the Compulsory Programme).  I understand that a presentation on the most efficacious way forward in terms of achieving BVD eradication was made at the most recent meeting of the Group.  The details of the programme for 2017 and beyond remain to be decided by the Group.  </p>  <p>  From the middle of June 2015, following on from agreement at the BVDIG, my Department put in place a system of herd restrictions, where farmers continued to retain Persistently Infected animals beyond agreed timelines.  A total of 900 restriction notices have issued to date. Additionally my Department provides some financial assistance by way of financial support to assist in the early removal of PI animals. </p>  <p>  Unfortunately, a small number of farmers continue to retain PI animals.  On 1 September some 248 herds were retaining 363 PIs &ndash; the majority of these are 2016 born animals.  </p></reply>

Any such scheme must meet certain specific criteria laid down by Rural Development Regulation.  This scheme, in addition to the existing supports available to sheep farmers under the BPS, GLAS, ANC and TAMS, will make a vital contribution to ensuring the continuing viability and sustainability of the sheep sector in Ireland.</p>  <p>  As regards the specifics of the scheme design and operation, my Department has engaged in extensive consultation with farm organisations and industry stakeholders, and met with officials of the European Commission to discuss the proposed new scheme in the context of the specific requirements of the Rural Development Programme.  My officials are working on the details of the scheme in light of the consultation with the farming organisations and with the European Commission.  Any scheme must meet the exacting requirements of the Rural Development Regulations in terms of only compensating farmers for actions undertaken on the basis of costs incurred or income foregone.  Additionally, in any scheme where farmers must undertake actions, those actions must exceed the normal standards of husbandry practice before they can be considered as an eligible cost incurred by a farmer.</p>  <p>  I wish to stress that whilst any scheme must be acceptable to the European Commission in the context of the requirements of the Rural Development Programme, I am also anxious that such a scheme takes into account the different production systems in the Irish national sheep flock and recognises the different challenges facing both lowland flocks and hill flocks.  It is my intention that this scheme&rsquo;s design will maximise the number of participants and deliver tangible benefits to the sheep sector in terms of its impact to on- farm practices.</p></reply>

It is used in agriculture, forestry and industrial settings as well as home and garden situations.</p>  <p>  An evaluation of glyphosate was performed by Germany and peer reviewed by the European Food Safety Authority and Member State experts.  This review clearly identified safe uses and considered a recent review conducted by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) of the World Health Organisation which concluded that a carcinogenic potential existed in relation to glyphosate.  However, as regulatory authorities both inside and outside the EU have not all agreed with this IARC conclusion, and considering that the European Chemicals Agency have still to conclude their own review of glyphosate, it was considered more appropriate to extend the existing approval of glyphosate until December 2017.  This will allow sufficient time and space for all outcomes to be considered before deciding on a further period of approval.</p>  <p>  Until this happens my Department has taken a few very precautionary measures in an attempt to allay any concerns the general public may have.  These measures include the removal of certain products containing a particular co-formulant from the market place, as well as disallowing the pre-harvest use of glyphosate on crops which may enter the food chain (milling wheat, malting barley, etc.).</p></reply>

The Commission has responded to these difficulties through the deployment of support measures provided for under the CAP, at first in an ad-hoc manner and then in the form of two wider packages of measures, in September 2015 and March 2016.  Ireland has played a key role in shaping these responses. </p>  <p>  Despite the two packages of measures, the market difficulties continued into the middle of 2016. </p>  <p>  The Commission presented a further package of measures at the Agri-Fish Council on 18 July.  The main component is a fund of &euro;500 million, which is in turn comprises two elements:</p>  <p>- The first is a &euro;150 million EU-wide measure that will compensate farmers for reducing their milk output in the final quarter of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 (at a rate of 14c/kg).  The detailed rules regarding this measure were agreed at EU level on August 25th and the Commission have provided the legal provisions to give effect to this measure in early September 2016.  At national level, the scheme is in the process of implementation via cooperatives.  The closing date for applications from producers was yesterday, September 15th</p>  <p>- The second element of the EU July 2016 package is a &euro;350 million fund that will be allocated to Member States in the form of national envelopes, which Member States can use in accordance with their domestic circumstances. Whilst eligibility criteria will apply, Member States are afforded a large degree of flexibility in terms of the measures they might adopt. Ireland&rsquo;s allocation from the fund will be &euro;11.09 million. Member States will be required to notify the Commission by 1 November 2016 of the measures to be adopted. </p>  <p>  It should be clearly noted that the above represent two distinct and separate policy responses at EU level.  Availing of one element of the package at national level is not conditional on participation in the other measure.  The Voluntary Supply Management Scheme, details of which were published recently on my Department website and relayed to cooperatives, through whom the scheme will be administered, is an EU wide scheme.  The exceptional adjustment aid represents a national envelope, which stipulates various eligibility criteria that can be utilised as a basis for disbursement.  Details on how Ireland will utilise this latter aid element have not yet been finalised and the matter is subject to ongoing consideration in consultation with the EU and National stakeholders. Issues such as dealing with liquidity concerns, strengthening co-operation, supporting quality schemes and providing training in financial management all offer possibilities for meaningful and innovative interventions. </p></reply>

My Department will continue to support the sector.</p><p>It is imperative of course that those involved in the sector operate in a manner which is consistent with the relevant animal welfare codes and regulations. </p><p>Bord na gCon is responsible for the governance, regulation and development of the greyhound industry in the Republic of Ireland and for the wellbeing of greyhounds. It has developed a Code of Practice in relation to the welfare of greyhounds which sets out specific standards that all individuals engaged in the care and management of registered greyhounds are expected to meet. </p><p>The Code emphasises that owners and keepers must take full responsibility for the physical and social well-being of greyhounds in line with best welfare practice.  Oversight mechanisms in place regarding greyhound exports include inter-agency co-operation, co-operation with fellow members of International Greyhound Forums and intelligence/information which is received from Welfare Officers during the course of investigations carried out under the Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2011.  Where any breaches of welfare standards are identified under the Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2011, Bord na gCon takes stringent actions and prosecutions ensue in accordance with the Act. Details of prosecutions for non-compliance with Welfare Notices issued by Bord na gCon are published on the Bord na gCon website <font color="#2F2F2F">www.igb.ie</font><font color="#2F2F2F">.</font></p><p>Earlier this year, officials of my Department met with Bord na gCon and the welfare members of the International Greyhound Forum (represented by the ISPCA and the Dogs Trust) to consider the issues surrounding the export of greyhounds.  Bord na gCon advises all owners involved in the export of greyhounds to only export to destinations with high animal welfare standards and that provide the expected levels of greyhound care and management as defined in the Code and I strongly endorse this view.</p><p>Bord na gGon also operates an active re-homing policy through its registered charity, the Retired Greyhound Trust.  The Trust also supports private welfare re-homing agencies in Ireland in their efforts to find suitable homes for retired greyhounds. </p><p>Bord na gCon have established a Scientific Committee of national and international experts to advise it generally on matters relating to doping and medication control.  In addition it has introduced legislation to enhance its regulatory and integrity controls including providing for out of competition testing, publication of adverse analytical findings and prohibition on racing where an adverse result is found. Bord na gCon is also working closely with my Department on the drafting of a new Greyhound Industry Bill which addresses the Governance of Bord na gCon (BNG), strengthens regulatory controls in the Industry, modernises sanctions and improves integrity with a view to building a reputation for exceptional regulation in the sector.</p></reply>

The Minister outlined the new legislation that is planned and the continued implementation of the Indecon recommendations.</p>  <p>  Bord na gCon, which is responsible for the governance, regulation and development of the greyhound industry in the Republic of Ireland and the wellbeing of greyhounds, has developed a Code of Practice in relation to the welfare of greyhounds which sets out specific standards that all individuals engaged in the care and management of registered greyhounds are expected to meet.  The Code emphasises that owners and keepers must take full responsibility for the physical and social well-being of greyhounds in line with best welfare practice.  Oversight mechanisms in place regarding greyhound exports include inter-agency co-operation, co-operation with fellow members of International Greyhound Forums and intelligence/information which is received from Welfare Officers during the course of investigations carried out under the Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2011.  Where any breaches of welfare standards are identified under the Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2011, Bord na gCon takes stringent actions and prosecutions ensue in accordance with the Act.</p>  <p>  Earlier this year officials of my Department met with Bord na gCon and the welfare members of the International Greyhound Forum (represented by the ISPCA and the Dogs Trust) to consider the issues surrounding the export of greyhounds.  Bord na gCon advises all owners involved in the export of greyhounds to only export to destinations with high animal welfare standards and that provide the expected levels of greyhound care and management as defined in the Code and I strongly endorse this view.</p></reply>

The Government&rsquo;s commitment to agriculture was evidenced by the implementation of the Review&rsquo;s recommendations over the past two budgets.  This has seen a series of positive changes for Irish agriculture, especially in the areas of land mobility and succession, all of which will support the aims of Food Wise 2025 in terms of increasing the productivity of Irish farms.</p>  <p>  The Agri-taxation Review included two recommendations specifically to help address farm income volatility, both of which were introduced in Budget 2015:</p>  <p>  - Retain and enhance &lsquo;Income Averaging&rsquo; by increasing the period from 3 to 5 years, providing more scope for income smoothing within a commodity price cycle.</p>  <p>- Allow averaging to be availed of where a farmer and/or their spouse receive income from an on-farm diversification trade or profession. </p>  <p>  The Agri-taxation Review concluded that a farm deposit scheme to counteract income volatility (based on Australian and New Zealand models) would not be compatible with EU State Aid rules, which preclude supports to falling farm incomes arising from low commodity prices in the market place.  It was noted that even if a compatible scheme was devised, it would be likely to have a very significant cost.</p>  <p>  Recent difficult market conditions have brought renewed focus to this issue and there have been proposals for the introduction of various types of income deferral scheme.  The &lsquo;Programme for a Partnership Government&rsquo; states regarding agri-taxation: &ldquo;We will also investigate taxation measures aimed at supporting farmers through periods of volatility&rdquo;.

The mushroom sector, like many other exporting sectors, is particularly at risk because of the high dependency on the UK market.  </p>  <p>  I am monitoring the situation regarding Sterling volatility closely and my own Department has a dedicated unit considering the impact of Brexit.  Additionally Bord Bia is working closely with the sector on market intelligence, UK consumer research and quality assurance.  They have scheduled a currency and negotiation workshop specifically targeted at the sector in the coming weeks.   </p>  <p>I would also draw attention to support being provided to the industry through National and EU Schemes. </p>  <p>  Under the National Development Plan (NDP) 2007 &ndash; 2013 my Department implemented the Scheme of Investment Aid for the Development of the Commercial Horticulture Sector.  During this period my Department paid out &euro;4,039,629 in grant payments to mushroom growers which supported &euro;10.1 million in investment. </p>  <p>  To ensure ongoing support for the sector, my Department extended, under EU sanction, the Scheme of Investment Aid for the Development of the Commercial Horticulture Sector to run until 31 December 2019.  In 2014 and 2015 a total of &euro;1,635,190 grant aid was paid to mushroom growers.  The grant aid paid supported some &euro;4.1 million in investment by these growers. </p>  <p>Under the 2016 Scheme of Investment Aid for the Development of the Commercial Horticulture Sector, my Department issued approvals in the amount of &euro;1.33 million in aid to growers in the mushroom sector, supporting &euro;3.3 million in proposed investment.   </p>  <p>  The EU Producer Organisation Scheme is a vital support for mushroom growers, with 65% of Irish growers in a producer organisation at present.  This scheme provides an important mechanism for growers to achieve greater bargaining power in the marketplace by becoming part of a larger supply base. Between 2005 and 2015, a total of &euro;39.8 million was paid to mushroom producer organisations as part of the EU Producer Organisation scheme.</p></reply>

The BDGP builds on the large investment in data recording and genomics which have been made in recent years and will continue to drive further developments and improvements in this area.    </p>  <p>  The BDGP has been agreed with the European Commission as part of Ireland&rsquo;s Rural Development Plan (2014-2020) alongside a number of other schemes.  I am conscious of the positive effect that the programme will have on the Irish suckler herd. It will help to improve productivity, profitability and carbon efficiency in the Irish suckler herd.  I firmly believe that the scheme will deliver long-term and cumulative positive effects for both suckler farmers participating in the scheme, and farmers who buy the progeny of suckler cows for further finishing.  It is a significant contributor to Ireland&rsquo;s reputation as a producer of sustainable beef. </p>  <p>  In relation to any possible reopening of the scheme, this will have to be considered in the context of an assessment of budgetary priorities, the operation of the Rural Development Programme and the potential impact both upon the scheme itself and other schemes.  It is not possible at this stage to quantify any potential cost to the exchequer as this would depend on the number of new entrants and the contribution of EU RDP funding towards this cost within the context of the overall RDP budget.</p></reply>

The quotas agreed for beef and other food products are outlined below:</p><p><b></b>Meat</p><p>Upon entry into force of the agreement, the total duty-free access the EU will grant to Canada for fresh and frozen beef is 50,000 tonnes (expressed in carcass weight equivalent (CWE)). This is broken down into 15,000 tonnes of frozen beef, 30,838 tonnes of fresh/chilled beef and 4,162 tonnes of fresh beef that the EU had already granted to Canada as compensation in settlement of the beef hormones dispute.  The existing WTO quota for Hilton beef of 11,500 tonnes (expressed in product weight), shared between Canada and the US, will be maintained, but the in-quota duty will be brought to zero for Canada. There will also be an EU quota for 3,000 tonnes of bison.</p><p>The total duty-free access the EU will grant to Canada for pork is 75,000 tonnes CWE. To this should be added the existing WTO quota of 4,625 tonnes product weight, which will be consolidated into CETA in order to simplify the administration of this quota by customs authorities and traders. EU beef and sheepmeat market access into Canada will be fully liberalised at zero in-quota rates. </p><p>Dairy</p><p>Canada will have duty free access into the EU dairy market.</p><p>For the EU there will be a high value cheese quota of 16,800 tonnes, with provision to allow newcomers including Ireland and other Member States 30 % access to the new quota.  There will also be an industrial cheese quota of 1,700 tonnes. </p><p>An additional 800 tonnes of high quality cheese will be added to an existing WTO quota of approximately 18,000 tonnes which will be restricted to existing traditional exporters. Ireland is not included in this quota.</p><p>Tariffs on milk protein concentrate will be fully liberalised and the tariff on infant formula will be reduced from 8.7% to zero. </p><p>A balanced approach informed our view of the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement with Canada.  While increased access to the EU market was granted for Canadian beef, greater access to the Canadian market for EU dairy products, notably cheese, was also a feature.  Moreover the concessions granted by Canada on market access for EU beef will be of benefit to Irish producers.  I am satisfied that Irish farming interests are sufficiently protected under this deal.

I note the recent closures and job-losses that have been attributed to these changes, and I am of course also concerned about the potential for further impacts if a sustained period of currency volatility is experienced.  In that regard, in the immediate aftermath of the UK vote, I asked the relevant agencies, including Bord Bia and Enterprise Ireland, to provide practical guidance to SMEs. Bord Bia has already announced a number of measures to support food and drink businesses.  These measures cover areas such as managing volatility impacts, providing consumer and market insight, deepening customer engagement and extending market reach, with the aim of helping companies maintain their competitiveness.  Similar support is also being provided by Enterprise Ireland. I am in close contact with the agencies on this matter.  I have also established a consultative committee composed of stakeholders, officials and experts to provide guidance in respect of the exit negotiations to come.  </p></reply>

By the end of December 2015 approximately 1,800 tonnes of beef, with an estimated value of &euro;14 million, had been exported from Ireland to the US.  This represents an exceptionally strong start to this trade considering that the first exports only went in March 2015 and some of the plants were only approved for export in September 2015.  That amount looks likely to be surpassed in 2016, as by the end of June almost 1,200 tonnes had been exported. <b></b>These figures are available on a quarterly basis only and month by month breakdowns are not available.  </p><p>I was delighted to announce over the summer the decision of the US authorities to extend their approval for Irish beef to include manufacturing beef/beef intended for grinding (BIFG).  This marks the culmination of over a year of intensive work between my Department and its US counterparts on a range of technical matters.  This decision by the US on our enhanced access is a huge endorsement of Irish beef and our production and regulatory systems.  This recent extension of our access in the US has the capability to be a significant boost to the sector over a period of time. </p><p>US consumption of beef is estimated at 11 million tonnes, approximately 1 million of which is imported.  The potential prize for Irish operators is therefore, subject to the variables already outlined, very significant, particularly in circumstances where grass fed hormone free beef is gaining traction in the market place. </p><p>The role of my Department is to secure greater access to third country markets and not to set targets for the export of various commodities to the different individual markets.  Ultimately the volume and value of trade will be subject to market forces and depend on a range of factors such as currency exchange rates, relative commodity prices and global supply and demand patterns.</p><p>The access that we enjoy to the USA complements the other market outlets we have secured in recent years, the development of which is a key element of our Food Wise 2025 strategy.  There has also been significant progress in facilitating trade in other international markets for Irish beef and fourteen markets for Irish beef have been opened since 2011.  My Department continues to push strongly for market access to other Third Countries and we are currently in the process of trying to secure beef access to a range of other third countries.  Indeed this was a crucial component of the recent Trade Mission to Asia, conducted by myself and Minister of State Doyle, where positive progress was made in relation to beef access for China, South Korea and Vietnam.  It is my intention to continue to focus on developing as many third country markets as possible in order to provide exporters as many commercial opportunities as possible in a competitive global market place.</p></reply>

The Commission has responded to these difficulties through the deployment of support measures provided for under the CAP, at first in an ad-hoc manner and then in the form of two wider packages of measures, in September 2015 and March 2016.  Ireland have played a key role in shaping these responses.    Despite the two packages of measures, the market difficulties continued into the middle of 2016. </p>  <p>  The Commission presented a further package of measures at the Agri-Fish Council on 18 July. The main component is a fund of &euro;500 million, which is in turn comprised of two elements.</p>  <p>  The first is a &euro;150 million EU-wide measure that will compensate farmers for reducing their milk output in the final quarter of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 (at a rate of 14c/kg). The detailed rules regarding this measure were agreed at EU level on August 25 and the Commission have provided the legal provisions to give effect to this measure in early September 2016. At national level, the scheme is in the process of implementation via cooperatives. The closing date for applications from producers was yesterday, September 15.</p>  <p>  The second element of the EU July 2016 package is a &euro;350 million fund that will be allocated to Member States in the form of national envelopes, which Member States can use in accordance with their domestic circumstances.  Whilst eligibility criteria will apply, Member States are afforded a large degree of flexibility in terms of the measures they might adopt. Ireland&rsquo;s allocation from the fund will be &euro;11.09 million. Member States will be required to notify the Commission by 1 November 2016 of the measures to be adopted.   </p>  <p>  It should be clearly noted that the above represent two distinct and separate policy responses at EU level.  Availing of one element of the package at national level is not conditional on participation in the other measure.  The Voluntary Supply Management Scheme, details of which were published recently on my Department website and relayed to cooperatives, through whom the scheme will be administered, is an EU wide scheme.  The exceptional adjustment aid represents a national envelope, which stipulates various eligibility criteria that can be utilised as a basis for disbursement.  Details on how Ireland will utilise this latter aid element have not yet been finalised and these matters are subject to ongoing consideration in consultation with the EU and National stakeholders.  Issues such as dealing with liquidity concerns, strengthening co-operation, supporting quality schemes and providing training in financial management all offer possibilities for meaningful and innovative interventions.</p></reply>

Species specific analysis documents available at <i></i>provide an estimate of the economic contribution of each of the most important angling species but also identify, to some degree, which counties contain the most productive fisheries for each of these species.  </p><p>I have organised for a copy of the TDI study to be forwarded to the Deputy. If the Deputy has a particular county or region in mind I would be happy to organise for IFI to provide further information where it is available.</p><p><b>Table 14: Estimated Contribution of Angling in Ireland by Angling Type &ndash; 2014/2015</b><table><tr><th>-</th><th colspan="4">Domestic Participation Estimate</th><th colspan="4">Northern Irish Participation Estimate</th><th colspan="4">Overseas Participation Estimate</th><th colspan="3">Total Participation</th><th colspan="2">&euro; Millions</th></tr><tr><td>Angling Type</td><td>%</td><td>Number of Anglers <br /><br />Total</td><td>&euro; Total</td><td>&euro; per<br /><br />person</td><td>%</td><td>Number of<br /><br />Anglers<br /><br />Total</td><td>&euro; Total</td><td>&euro; per<br /><br />person</td><td>%</td><td>Number of Anglers<br /><br />Total</td><td>&euro; Total</td><td>&euro; per<br /><br />person</td><td>Number of<br /><br />Anglers</td><td>Gross Expenditure per Angler</td><td>Net Expenditure Per Angler</td><td>Gross Expenditure</td><td>Total (Inc.

The PRA was a very comprehensive and detailed scientific exercise which established that there was no threat to the health of the public in Ireland arising from activity at the Sellafield site.  I am satisfied with the level of progress made in the intervening years in dealing with the legacy issues at the site and with the level of cooperation being provided by the UK Authorities in this ongoing matter.  Having discussed this matter with the relevant officials in my Department, it is not considered that the investigation by the Panorama programme has uncovered any new significant matters which would cause concern for Ireland.  What Ireland wants to see in relation to Sellafield is that the current levels of progress being made on the site on the various projects dealing with the legacy issues is maintained and that there is a continued commitment, financial and otherwise, by the British Government to this work. To ensure Ireland's input into this process, on-going engagement at a technical and regulatory level through the UK Ireland Contact Group on Radiological Matters allows Ireland unprecedented access to documentation, personnel and reports about the Sellafield facility.  This access, including site visits, has informed our understanding of works and developments at the Sellafield Nuclear Plant and how each individual facility on the site interacts at a technical level, and has led to a better awareness of the challenges facing the UK authorities in managing the safe decommissioning of operations at the site.  The last site visit, by officials and experts, took place in April 2015.  Technical experts from the Office of Radiological Protection are scheduled to meet with the UK's Office for Nuclear Regulation shortly to discuss the issues raised in the Panorama programme and any remedial actions proposed to strengthen the safety culture at Sellafield.</p>  <p>  Senior officials from my Department will also meet their counterparts in the UK through the UK Ireland Contact Group on Radiological Matters, as part of their regular series of meetings.  The general issue of safety at the Sellafield site, which includes those issues specifically highlighted by the Panorama programme, will be discussed as part of the agenda of that forum.</p></reply>

The National Oil Reserves Agency (NORA) is responsible for acquiring and managing Ireland&rsquo;s emergency oil stocks.</p>  <p>  At the end of August 2016, the volume of the national oil reserve was just over 1.6 million tonnes.  The value of the stocks is about &euro;852 million.</p>  <p>  The oil is held in a number of storage facilities on the Island of Ireland and in other EU Member States. </p>  <p>  The names of the owners of the storage locations cannot be provided as this information is commercially sensitive.</p>  <p>  In 2006, 51% of NORA stocks were held in Ireland, 10% were held as physical stocks abroad, while 40% were held as stock tickets.  Since 2007, in line with IEA and Government policy, NORA has been pursuing a policy of reducing dependency on stock tickets (paper contracts to deliver oil in an emergency) as well as repatriating stocks held abroad to the island of Ireland, subject to value for money considerations.  Today 67% of NORA emergency stocks are held on the island of Ireland in 11 separate locations. 33% of stocks are held in 6 locations in other EU Member States under Bilateral Agreements or Memoranda of Understanding.  There is now no requirement for stock tickets.</p>  <p>  By successfully rebalancing its stocks in favour of  stocks on the island of Ireland, NORA helps ensure that emergency stocks are easily  accessible and available in an emergency situation.  This significantly enhances the security of Irish oil supply and is in line with EU requirements under the Oil Stocks Directive (2009/119/EC).</p></reply>

The High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at<i>www.broadband.gov.ie</i>shows the extent of the State Intervention area: </p><p>-  The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have previously indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services.  The Department continues to monitor the commercial deployment plans in the BLUE area to ensure that those services are delivered. </p><p>-  The areas marked AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the target areas for the State Intervention and includes the townland of Clonalea, County Tipperary, and the premises that the Deputy refers to in the Question is also included in that townland. Premises within this area will get services of at least 30mbps when the procurement process is completed and the network rolled out.  </p><p>The map provides information on a county by county basis with a breakdown of coverage across the townlands in every county including County Tipperary.  Individuals can check whether their premises is in a BLUE or an AMBER area by scrolling through the map online or entering their Eircode.

The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.  This is being achieved through private investment by commercial telecommunications companies and through a State intervention in areas where commercial investment is not forthcoming. The formal procurement process for the State Intervention commenced in December 2015.</p><p>The High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at <i>www.broadband.gov.ie </i>shows the extent of the State Intervention area:</p><p>-  The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or have previously indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services.  Investment decisions by the telecommunications networks providers in these areas, including the upgrading of individual exchanges are taken on commercial grounds by each network operator.  As Eir is a private company, I have no statutory authority to intervene in these matters.  My Department does, however, continue to monitor the commercial deployment plans in the BLUE area to ensure that those services are delivered and will, if necessary, include additional premises in the formal procurement process where it is evident that services will not be provided by the commercial sector. </p><p>-  The areas marked AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the target areas for the State Intervention which are the subject of the current procurement process. </p><p>The map provides information on a county by county basis with a breakdown of coverage across the townlands in every county including Co Westmeath.  Individuals can check whether their premises is in a BLUE or an AMBER area by scrolling through the map online or entering their Eircode. The Department also has a dedicated mailbox and anyone with a query in relation to the Map, or whose premises is in a BLUE area and cannot get services should email the Department, quoting their Eircode, to <i>broadband@dcenr.gov.ie.</i>I understand that officials in my Department have also been in touch directly with the Deputy's office and clarified the position in relation to Passage East and will note the issues arising in the context of the mapping process.  </p><p>Over 750,000 premises are the focus for the procurement process, which formally commenced in December 2015 with the publication of the Pre-Qualification Questionnaire (&lsquo;PQQ&rsquo;) and Project Information Memorandum.  On 5 July, I announced that my Department has also identified a further 170,000 premises which are currently marked BLUE on the High Speed Broadband Map and which are unlikely to get access to services.  Further analysis is being conducted on these additional premises with a view to including them in the formal procurement process.  This work will conclude in the coming months and will be reflected in a further update to the High Speed Broadband Map.</p><p>The Department has now moved to the third stage in the procurement process, the Invitation to Participate in Dialogue (ITPD) phase, and is now engaged in the formal dialogue process with three qualifying bidders.  The qualifying bidders have been furnished with a draft contract containing certain specifications for a quality and affordable high speed broadband network. </p><p>Following the ITPD Phase, and an invitation to bidders to submit detailed proposals, which will take a number of months, the Department will issue final tender documentation to bidders.  When final tenders have been submitted a winning bidder(s) will be selected for the contract which will comprise one or two lots as set out in the NBP Intervention Strategy.  The Department will then enter into formal contract negotiations with the winning bidder(s), prior to awarding a contract(s).</p><p>The timing of each stage of the procurement is dependent on a number of factors including the number of bidders short-listed and the complexities that may be encountered during the procurement process.  It must be noted that bidders will need several months to prepare detailed proposals and their final formal bids and get the relevant shareholder and funding approvals at these stages of the process.</p><p>As part of the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated that it could take 3-5 years to rollout a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP.  It is however open to bidder(s) to suggest more aggressive timescales as part of their bids.  As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and-or high demand.  This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network rollout plan.  A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. A detailed rollout plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place.</p><p>The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the rollout of the network once a contract is awarded.  In this regard, Minister Humphreys is leading on the establishment of two regional taskforces, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices and other relevant agencies to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded.</p><p>In the meantime, my Department continues to liaise closely with industry and relevant other Departments and agencies to assist in the commercial deployment of telecommunications networks.  The commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services. These investments are continuing to improve the coverage and quality of broadband and mobile voice and data services throughout the country. </p><p>The Programme for Government commits to the establishment of a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce to consider immediate measures to address telecommunications deficits in rural Ireland.  The Taskforce, which I co-chair with my colleague, Minister Humphreys was established in July and will recommend practical actions that can be taken in the short-term to improve mobile phone and broadband access in Ireland, working with Government Departments, Local Authorities, ComReg, State Agencies, the telecoms industry and other key stakeholders.  The work of the taskforce will also assist Local Authorities in preparing for the rollout of the new NBP network once contract(s) are in place.  I expect that Minister Humphreys and I will bring proposals to Government by the end of 2016, on foot of the Taskforce's report.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.  This is being achieved through private investment by commercial telecommunications companies and through a State intervention in areas where commercial investment is not forthcoming.  The formal procurement process for the State Intervention commenced in December 2015.</p><p>The High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at<i>www.broadband.gov.i</i><i>e</i>shows the extent of the State Intervention area:</p><p>- The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or have previously indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services. Investment decisions by the telecommunications networks providers in these areas, including the upgrading of individual exchanges are taken on commercial grounds by each network operator.  As Eir is a private company, I have no statutory authority to intervene is these matters.  My Department does however continue to monitor the commercial deployment plans in the BLUE area to ensure that those services are delivered and will, if necessary, include additional premises in the formal procurement process where it is evident that services will not be provided by the commercial sector. </p><p>- The areas marked AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the target areas for the State Intervention and includes 53% of the premises within Berrings in Co Cork, which are the subject of the current procurement process. </p><p>The following table details percentage of premises to be covered by the State Intervention and through commercial investment in the areas identified by the Deputy.<table><tr><th>County Name </th><th>Location</th><th>Townland</th><th>% Premises within the NBP Intervention Area </th><th>% Premises within Commercial Operator&rsquo;s Area </th></tr><tr><td>CORK</td><td>South Berrings</td><td>Berrings</td><td>53%</td><td>47%</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Elmgrove, Sallybrook</td><td>Riverstown</td><td></td><td>100%</td></tr></table></p><p>The map provides information on a county by county basis with a breakdown of coverage across the townlands in every county including Co Cork.  Individuals can check whether their premises is in a BLUE or an AMBER area by scrolling through the map online or entering their Eircode. </p><p>Over 750,000 premises are the focus for the procurement process, which formally commenced in December 2015 with the publication of the Pre-Qualification Questionnaire (&lsquo;PQQ&rsquo;) and Project Information Memorandum.  On 5<sup></sup>July, I announced that my Department has also identified a further 170,000 premises which are currently marked BLUE on the High Speed Broadband Map and which are unlikely to get access to services.  Further analysis is being conducted on these additional premises with a view to including them in the formal procurement process. The Department also has a dedicated mailbox and anyone with a query in relation to the Map, or whose premises is in a BLUE area and cannot get services should email the Department, quoting their Eircode, to<i>broadband@dcenr.gov.ie. </i>The Department will examine issues brought to its attention in relation to individual premises as part of the ongoing mapping process.  This mapping work will conclude in the coming months and will be reflected in a further update to the High Speed Broadband Map.</p><p>The Department has now moved to the third stage in the procurement process, the Invitation to Participate in Dialogue (ITPD) phase, and is now engaged in the formal dialogue process with three qualifying bidders.  The qualifying bidders have been furnished with a draft contract containing certain specifications for a quality and affordable high speed broadband network. </p><p>Following the ITPD Phase, and an invitation to bidders to submit detailed proposals, which will take a number of months, the Department will issue final tender documentation to bidders.  When final tenders have been submitted a winning bidder(s) will be selected for the contract which will comprise one or two lots as set out in the NBP Intervention Strategy. The Department will then enter into formal contract negotiations with the winning bidder(s), prior to awarding a contract(s).</p><p>The timing of each stage of the procurement is dependent on a number of factors including the number of bidders short-listed and the complexities that may be encountered during the procurement process.  It must be noted that bidders will need several months to prepare detailed proposals and their final formal bids and get the relevant shareholder and funding approvals at these stages of the process.</p><p>As part of the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated that it could take 3-5 years to rollout a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP.  It is however open to bidder(s) to suggest more aggressive timescales as part of their bids.  As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and-or high demand. This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network rollout plan. A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. A detailed rollout plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place.</p><p>The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the rollout of the network once a contract is awarded. In this regard, Minister Humphreys is leading on the establishment of two regional taskforces, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices and other relevant agencies to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded.</p><p>In the meantime, my Department continues to liaise closely with industry and relevant other Departments and agencies to assist in the commercial deployment of telecommunications networks.  The commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services. These investments are continuing to improve the coverage and quality of broadband and mobile voice and data services throughout the country. </p><p>The Programme for Government commits to the establishment of a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce to consider immediate measures to address telecommunications deficits in rural Ireland.  The Taskforce, which I co-chair with my colleague, Minister Humphreys was established in July and will recommend practical actions that can be taken in the short-term to improve mobile phone and broadband access in Ireland, working with Government Departments, Local Authorities, ComReg, State Agencies, the telecoms industry and other key stakeholders.  The work of the taskforce will also assist Local Authorities in preparing for the rollout of the new NBP network once contract(s) are in place.  I expect that Minister Humphreys and I will bring proposals to Government by the end of 2016, on foot of the Taskforce's report.</p></reply>

The scheme delivers a range of energy efficiency measures free of charge to low income households vulnerable to energy poverty, who meet the eligibility criteria.  The measures available include draught proofing, attic insulation, lagging jackets for hot water tanks, low energy light bulbs and cavity wall insulation.  To date the scheme has upgraded 125,000 energy poor homes, with an overall spend of more than &euro;160m in Exchequer funds.</p>  <p>  Given the limited resources allocated to the scheme and the number of homeowners eligible for support, the measures available under the scheme must reflect a balance between the cost of delivery and the number of homes that can be supported under the scheme.  More costly delivery to individual homes means that less householders can benefit from the scheme each year.</p>  <p>  As noted, attic insulation is one of the measures typically delivered under the scheme.  The provision of attic insulation is by way of quilted fibre insulation which is rolled out in the attic space to a height of 300mm.  This work requires sufficient space in the attic for the insulation to be rolled out and space for the work to be completed. It is not always possible to deliver this to homes where technical or health and safety issues arise, or where appropriate ventilation cannot be installed. </p>  <p>  Flat roofs typically do not permit rolled quilted insulation material to be installed.  Such roofs are sealed and installing insulation can involve opening up the roof, installing dry-lining and making substantial alterations to ventilation systems.  These alterations would add significantly to the cost of the delivery and as such are beyond the scope of the Warmer Homes scheme.</p></reply>

The Directive requires that certain minimum levels of monitoring are carried out for the purposes of assessment and management of air quality.</p>  <p>  The EPA monitors a range of atmospheric pollutants, based on data obtained from the 31 monitoring stations that form the national ambient air quality network.  The EPA publishes an annual report on air quality, primarily based on the monitoring requirements of the CAF&Eacute; Directive.  The most recent report, Air Quality in Ireland 2014 &ndash; Key Indicators of Ambient Air Quality, was published in September 2015 and provides an assessment of air quality in Ireland for 2014, compared to the CAF&Eacute; Directive standards, as well as assessments in relation to more stringent World Health Organisation (WHO) air quality guidelines for the protection of human health and the European Environment Agency (EEA) estimated reference levels.</p>  <p>  The report indicates that NOx values, arising primarily from the transport sector, are showing a slight increase over 2013 figures at some locations, and indicates a risk that growth in economic activity will lead to an increase in NOx levels.  Similarly, the report indicates that levels of particulates (PM2.5) and compounds (PAH) have increased at some stations. </p>  <p>  A significant contributor to the rise in NOx emissions in recent years throughout the EU has been the higher than expected emissions from the new fleet of road vehicles, particularly diesel vehicles.  Over time, discrepancies have come to light between the emissions recorded from vehicles during emissions testing and &lsquo;real&rsquo; driving.  The European Commission approach has been to revise the test cycle to be more representative of emissions from real-world driving experience (RDE).  Ireland fully supported the proposals and early implementation.  The Road Safety Authority, which is under the aegis of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, is the agency centrally involved in this issue on behalf of Ireland. </p>  <p>  Ireland supports the Commission proposals for the introduction of real driving emissions (RDEs) during the type approval testing process and will support the Commission&rsquo;s drive for implementation as early as possible.  We are also of the view that this measure should be supplemented with an enhanced regime of monitoring emission levels from vehicles.  Given the nature of both auto manufacture and the EU&rsquo;s single market, a coordinated European response across all Member States is necessary and appropriate.</p>  <p>  To help address concern at the above developments and other air quality issues, my Department has commenced work on the first ever national Clean Air Strategy which will provide an overarching strategic policy framework within which clean air policies can be formulated and given effect in a manner consistent with national, EU and international policy considerations and priorities.  The Strategy will set a progressive vision for managing and improving Ireland&rsquo;s air quality across the broad range of Government Departments and Agencies, and will seek to integrate such considerations into future sectoral policy and expenditure decisions.  The development of the strategy is especially timely, in the context of the EU&rsquo;s Clean Air Package, as it will act as a policy framework for the implementation of the provisions of the package in Ireland.  It will also complement and add value to it, by having a particular focus on national priority areas not addressed by EU legislation.</p>  <p>  The Clean Air Strategy will target priority air pollutants in Ireland in an integrated manner, addressing the relevant sectors including transport, with the aim of identifying cost-effective short, medium and long term goals and action for reducing air pollutant levels.  The strategy will seek to ensure continued and on-going compliance with current and future EU legislation, but also improved health outcomes and wider environmental benefits.  Importantly, the strategy will also aim to align relevant sectoral strategies, in particular, climate change and clean air policies, to ensure complementary actions to avoid policy conflict, maximising co-benefits and thus cost effectiveness.</p>  <p>  The setting of motor tax rates is a matter for the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.</p></reply>

In addition, biomethane, produced by removing impurities from biogas, can be used as a substitute for natural gas and can be injected directly into the gas grid.  </p><p>There are currently no grants available from my Department for the purchase or installation of AD equipment.  However, there are current tax-based support incentives which may apply.  These include the Employment and Investment Incentive Scheme which allows individual investors to obtain income tax relief on investments in renewable energy in each tax year.  Moreover, an Accelerated Capital Allowance (ACA) scheme allows companies to offset the cost of investment in qualifying renewable energy generation technologies, against their tax liabilities in year 1 rather than over a more prolonged period, thus aiding their cash flow. Information on the ACA scheme is available at<i>.</i></p><p>It should be noted that electricity and combined heat and power produced from AD are already supported under the REFIT3 scheme and biogas and biomethane, when used as a transport fuel, can be used to meet the obligations set under the Biofuel Obligation Scheme.  Though the REFIT schemes are now closed, <font color="#0D0D0D">there is a commitment in the White Paper on Energy Policy to introduce a new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) and a Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) designed to encourage the development of Ireland&rsquo;s abundant, diverse and indigenous renewable energy resources.  In-depth economic analysis is now underway to inform the actual cost of these schemes and, while no decision has been taken on the precise renewable technologies to be supported, the cost and technical viability of AD is being examined as part of the assessment process.  It is expected to have these schemes in place in 2017, subject to Government approval and State aid clearance from the European Commission. </font></p><p>In parallel, an assessment of the specific costs and benefits of biogas and biomethane is currently being undertaken by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland with a view to developing additional policy options for biogas and biomethane.  It is expected that this work will be complete later this year and will inform the development of the RHI in particular. </p></reply>

As outlined in this document, the strategy aims to ensure the continued provision of public service broadcasting that serves the needs of Irish audiences; to ensure the availability of high quality reception of Irish broadcasting services on a universal and free to air basis and to create a regulatory environment which supports a free, plural and diverse media sector in Ireland.</p><p>Part 7 of the Broadcasting Act 2009 provides for public service broadcasting in Ireland and sets out the provisions relating to the public service broadcasting corporations, RT&Eacute; and TG4, including their principal objects.  These objects provide the companies&rsquo; statutory mandates and encapsulate national policy in terms of public service broadcasting.  The Act places a range of requirements on the public service broadcasters, including the obligation that RT&Eacute; make specific amounts available each year for the commissioning of television and radio programmes from the independent production sector.  In addition to their respective Statements of Strategy, RT&Eacute; and TG4 submit public service statements, which have been informed by public consultation, every five years setting out the principles to be observed and activities to be undertaken by each corporation to fulfil their public service objects.</p><p>The Programme for a Partnership Government prioritised the publication of <i>Culture 2025</i>, as a Framework Policy to cover the whole cultural sector.  In this context, my colleague, Minister Humphreys, has recently submitted a draft document <i>&Eacute;ire Ild&aacute;nach/Culture 2025</i>to the Joint Oireachtas Committee for consideration.  My Department is currently examining the broadcasting elements of the draft document and will engage fully with the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural &amp;amp; Gaeltacht Affairs in the development of this document.</p><p>A comprehensive review of Ireland's creative sector is also to be undertaken shortly by independent consultants on behalf of the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  The study, which my Department is helping to co-fund, delivers on a commitment in the Action Plan for Jobs and will be the first major study of this sector since that done by Price Waterhouse Coopers in 2008.  The study will provide a detailed analysis of the current state of the sector in Ireland and will involve widespread consultation with industry stakeholders.  An important element of the report will be the identification of potential policy approaches to support, assist and develop the sector.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.  This is being achieved through private investment by commercial telecommunications companies and through a State intervention in areas where commercial investment is not forthcoming.  The formal procurement process for the State Intervention commenced in December 2015.</p><p>The High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at <i>www.broadband.gov.ie</i>shows the extent of the State Intervention area:</p><p>- The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have previously indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services.  The Department continues to monitor the commercial deployment plans in the BLUE area to ensure that those services are delivered. </p><p>- The areas marked AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the target areas for the State Intervention which are the subject of the current procurement process and includes Errill in the townland of Errill  in County Laois.  Premises within this area will get services of at least 30Mbps when the procurement process is completed and the network rolled out.</p><p>The map provides information on a county by county basis with a breakdown of coverage across the townlands in every county including County Laois.  Individuals can check whether their premises is in a BLUE or an AMBER area by scrolling through the map online or entering their Eircode.  The Department also has a dedicated mailbox and anyone with a query in relation to the Map should email the Department, quoting their Eircode, to <i>broadband@dcenr.gov.ie.  </i></p><p>Over 750,000 premises are the focus for the procurement process, which formally commenced in December 2015 with the publication of the Pre-Qualification Questionnaire (&lsquo;PQQ&rsquo;) and Project Information Memorandum.  On 5 July, I announced that my Department has also identified a further 170,000 premises which are currently marked BLUE on the High Speed Broadband Map and which are unlikely to get access to services.  Further analysis is being conducted on these additional premises with a view to including them in the formal procurement process.  This work will conclude in the coming months and will be reflected in a further update to the High Speed Broadband Map.</p><p>The Department has now moved to the third stage in the procurement process, the Invitation to Participate in Dialogue (ITPD) phase, and is now engaged in the formal dialogue process with three qualifying bidders.  The qualifying bidders have been furnished with a draft contract containing certain specifications for a quality and affordable high speed broadband network. </p><p>Following the ITPD Phase, and an invitation to bidders to submit detailed proposals, which will take a number of months, the Department will issue final tender documentation to bidders.  When final tenders have been submitted a winning bidder(s) will be selected for the contract which will comprise one or two lots as set out in the NBP Intervention Strategy.  The Department will then enter into formal contract negotiations with the winning bidder(s), prior to awarding a contract(s) in 2017.</p><p>As part of the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated that it could take 3-5 years to rollout a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP.  It is however open to bidder(s) to suggest more aggressive timescales as part of their bids.  As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and/or high demand.  This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network rollout plan.  A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  A detailed rollout plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place.</p><p>The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the rollout of the network once a contract is awarded.  In this regard, Minister Humphreys is leading on the establishment of two regional action groups, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices and other relevant agencies to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded.</p><p>The timing of each stage of the procurement is dependent on a number of factors including the number of bidders short-listed and the complexities that may be encountered during the procurement process.  It must be noted that bidders will need several months to prepare detailed proposals and their final formal bids and get the relevant shareholder and funding approvals at these stages of the process.</p><p>In the meantime, my Department continues to liaise closely with industry and relevant other Departments and agencies to assist in the commercial deployment of telecommunications networks.  The commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.  These investments will further improve the coverage and quality of broadband and mobile voice and data services throughout the country. </p><p>The Programme for Government commits to the establishment of a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce to consider immediate measures to address telecommunications deficits in rural Ireland.  The Taskforce, which I co-chair with Minister  Humphreys, was established in July.  The  Taskforce is now underway and will recommend practical actions that can be taken in the short-term to improve mobile phone and broadband access in Ireland, working with Government Departments, Local Authorities, ComReg, State Agencies, the telecoms industry and other key stakeholders.  The work of the taskforce will also assist Local Authorities in preparing for the rollout of the new NBP network once contract(s) are in place.  I expect that Minister Humphreys and I will bring proposals to Government by the end of 2016, on foot of the Taskforce's report.</p></reply>

The clear focus of my Department is on implementing the range of actions set out in the White Paper to meet our energy and climate change targets through cost efficient policies. Among the commitments to achieve the energy transition are to:  </p><p>-  support community participation in renewable energy, </p><p>-  provide funding and supports for community-led projects in the initial stages of development, planning and construction, </p><p>-  develop a framework for agreeing how communities share in the benefits of substantial new energy infrastructure located in their area, and </p><p>-  support the emerging energy cooperative movement as one means of facilitating community participation.</p><p>I am well aware that some communities across the country are concerned about the impact of wind farm developments, and that is why I am committed to putting in place mechanisms to ensure that the views of communities and citizens are taken into account as Ireland continues to transition to a low carbon society.  In addition, I am proposing to examine measures to ensure that communities and citizens can participate in and benefit from renewable energy projects in their locality. </p><p>Furthermore, my Department is currently developing a Renewable Electricity Policy and Development Framework which is intended to provide guidance to citizens, industry, An Bord Plean&aacute;la, and other public authorities, for use in conjunction with the Wind Energy Development Guidelines.  This work will set a clear framework for the development of renewable energy infrastructure into the future.</p><p>The delivery of projects to achieve our energy objectives cuts across several sectors, including: government, finance, regulation, engineering and the planning system.  While I understand the need for each of these independent strands to work  coherently, it is difficult to see how these strands could be merged effectively under one agency.</p><p>Onshore wind continues to be the main contributor to Ireland&rsquo;s renewable energy target and in 2015 met 21% of Ireland&rsquo;s electricity needs.  It is a proven technology and results in a lower cost of support for consumers.  While wind generation remains the dominant renewable generation technology in Ireland, the current Renewable Energy Feed-in-Tariff (REFIT) schemes do support a range of other renewable electricity technologies including hydro, biomass combustion, biomass combined heat and power, and landfill gas, which together met around 5% of Ireland's electricity needs in 2015. </p><p>While I see wind playing a role in Ireland&rsquo;s future energy transition, I am also mindful of the need to diversify our renewable generation portfolio; to this end, my Department is working on a new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme which is expected in 2017.  The <font color="#0D0D0D">new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme will seek to further encourage the development of Ireland&rsquo;s abundant and indigenous renewable energy resources.  This scheme will examine the viability of supporting a range of new renewable energy technologies in Ireland - including solar, bioenergy and ocean energy &ndash; and will help to further reduce emissions in the electricity sector.</font></p></reply>

In carrying out stock assessments the Committee draws on a number of data sets including rod and commercial catch data, fish counters and catchment wide electro-fishing. </p><p>However, the primary index for evaluation of likely returning numbers is the recorded rod (harvest or catch and release) and commercial catch (if any) averaged over the previous 5 years.  The scientific committee applies a range of rod exploitation rates for recreational fishing activity and adds the commercial catch to calculate the total run of salmon. Fish counters are particularly useful in cases where rod or commercial data is not available.  In addition, information on juvenile abundance indices derived from electro-fishing surveys carried out annually by IFI is also evaluated as an indicator of stock status. </p><p>For the 2016 season, based on rod catch and exploitation rates, the Suir was estimated to be meeting 68% of its conservation limit (CL).  Management advice is that rivers meeting &amp;gt;65% of the CL can be open for catch and release angling. For 2016 the Barrow was meeting 18% of its CL and the Nore was meeting 60% of its CL. </p><p>While the Barrow and Nore were deemed not to be meeting &amp;gt;65% of CL based on rod catch, both rivers were open for catch &amp;amp; release angling in 2016 based on salmon fry densities recorded in electro fishing surveys which were above the scientific committee's established threshold. </p><p>The estimate of the percentage of the Conservation Limit (CL) achieved on the Barrow, Nore and Suir for the last 5 years is shown in the attached table. <table><tr><th>-</th><th>% CL achieved</th><th>% CL achieved</th><th>% CL achieved</th><th>% CL achieved</th><th>% CL achieved</th></tr><tr><td>River</td><td>2016</td><td>2015</td><td>2014</td><td>2013</td><td>2012</td></tr><tr><td>Barrow and Pollmounty</td><td>18</td><td>17</td><td>29</td><td>29</td><td>41</td></tr><tr><td>Nore</td><td>60</td><td>91</td><td>121</td><td>153</td><td>140</td></tr><tr><td>Suir, Clodiagh, Lingaun, Blackwater</td><td>68</td><td>80</td><td>83</td><td>117</td><td>112</td></tr></table></p><p>The salmon assessment methodologies used in Ireland are considered internationally as best practice.  Many other countries are moving towards the development of similar scientific assessment models for salmon stock conservation.</p><p>I am advised that, given the availability of catch records on the majority of rivers, including the Suir, Nore and Barrow, and other indices, the number of fish counters in use is considered sufficient as a component within the array of methodologies available to the Standing Scientific Committee for Salmon.  However the requirement for additional counters is continually reviewed.  </p></reply>

The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.  This is being achieved through private investment by commercial telecommunications companies and through a State intervention in areas where commercial investment is not forthcoming.  The formal procurement process for the State Intervention commenced in December 2015.</p><p>The High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at <i>www.broadband.gov.ie</i>shows the extent of the State Intervention area: </p><p>-  The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have previously indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services. Investment decisions by the telecommunications networks providers in these areas, including the upgrading of individual exchanges are taken on commercial grounds by each network operator. As Eir is a private company, I have no statutory authority to intervene in these matters.  My Department does however continue to monitor the commercial deployment plans in the BLUE area to ensure that those services are delivered and will, if necessary, include additional premises in the formal procurement process where it is evident that services will not be provided by the commercial sector.  </p><p>-  The areas marked AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the target areas for the State Intervention, which are the subject of the current procurement process.  Premises within this area will get services of at least 30Mbps when the procurement process is completed and the network rolled out.</p><p>The map provides information on a county by county basis with a breakdown of coverage across the townlands in every county including County Kerry.  Individuals can check whether their premises is in a BLUE or an AMBER area by scrolling through the map online or entering their Eircode.  The Department also has a dedicated mailbox and anyone with a query in relation to the Map should email the Department, quoting their Eircode, to  </p><p>The table below details percentage of  premises to be covered by the State Intervention and through commercial investment in the areas identified by the  Deputy. <table><tr><th>County Name </th><th>Location</th><th>Townland</th><th>% Premises within the NBP Intervention Area </th><th>% Premises within Commercial Operator&rsquo;s Area </th></tr><tr><td>KERRY</td><td>Cappanacush</td><td>Cappanacush</td><td>100%</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Greenane</td><td>Greenane</td><td>100%</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Blackwater area (which spans a number of townlands)</td><td>Bealdarrig,<br /><br />Cooracoosane<br /><br />Graignagreana<br /><br />Inchinglanna </td><td>100%<br /><br />100%<br /><br />100%<br /><br />100%</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Derrymore East</td><td>Derrymore East</td><td>100%</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Lios na gCraobh<br /><br />Annascaul</td><td>Brackloon (Ed Ballinvoher)</td><td>100%</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Bunagarha</td><td>Bunagarha</td><td>100%</td><td></td></tr></table></p><p>Over 750,000 premises are the focus for the procurement process, which formally commenced in December 2015 with the publication of the Pre-Qualification Questionnaire (&lsquo;PQQ&rsquo;) and Project Information Memorandum.  On 5<sup></sup>July, I announced that my Department has also identified a further 170,000 premises which are currently marked BLUE on the High Speed Broadband Map and which are unlikely to get access to services.  Further analysis is being conducted on these additional premises with a view to including them in the formal procurement process. The Department also has a dedicated mailbox and anyone with a query in relation to the Map, or whose premises is in a BLUE area and cannot get services should email the Department, quoting their Eircode, to  <i>broadband@dcenr.gov.ie.</i>The Department will examine issues brought to its attention in relation to individual premises as part of the ongoing mapping process.  This mapping work will conclude in the coming months and will be reflected in a further update to the High Speed Broadband Map.</p><p>The Department has now moved to the third stage in the procurement process, the Invitation to Participate in Dialogue (ITPD) phase, and is now engaged in the formal dialogue process with three qualifying bidders.  The qualifying bidders have been furnished with a draft contract containing certain specifications for a quality and affordable high speed broadband network. </p><p>Following the ITPD Phase, and an invitation to bidders to submit detailed proposals, which will take a number of months, the Department will issue final tender documentation to bidders.  When final tenders have been submitted a winning bidder(s) will be selected for the contract which will comprise one or two lots as set out in the NBP Intervention Strategy.  The Department will then enter into formal contract negotiations with the winning bidder(s), prior to awarding a contract(s) in 2017.</p><p>In preparation for the procurement stage of the process my Department investigated how different technical solutions could be used to deliver high speed broadband.  In line with EU State Aid rules, the process must be &quot;technology neutral&quot; and it is not therefore possible to specify what technology should be used to build the network.  As part of the procurement process bidders will be asked to propose solutions which meet the NBP service requirements.  It is recognised however, that a significant fibre build will be required, regardless of what technology is used to provide services to individual premises.  Once the successful bidder or bidders is chosen the technology to be deployed will be made clear. </p><p>As part of the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated that it could take 3-5 years to rollout a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP.  It is however open to bidder(s) to suggest more aggressive timescales as part of their bids.  As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and / or high demand.  This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network rollout plan.  A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  A detailed rollout plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place.</p><p>The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the rollout of the network once a contract is awarded.  In this regard, Minister Humphreys is leading on the establishment of two regional action groups&rsquo; taskforces, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices and other relevant agencies to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded.</p><p>The timing of each stage of the procurement is dependent on a number of factors including the number of bidders short-listed and the complexities that may be encountered during the procurement process.  It must be noted that bidders will need several months to prepare detailed proposals and their final formal bids and get the relevant shareholder and funding approvals at these stages of the process.</p><p>In the meantime, my Department continues to liaise closely with industry and relevant other Departments and agencies to assist in the commercial deployment of telecommunications networks.  The commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.  These investments will further improve the coverage and quality of broadband and mobile voice and data services throughout the country. </p><p>The Programme for Government commits to the establishment of a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce to consider immediate measures to address telecommunications deficits in rural Ireland.  The Taskforce, which I co-chair with my colleague, Minister Humphreys, was established in July.  The Taskforce is now underway and will recommend practical actions that can be taken in the short-term to improve mobile phone and broadband access in Ireland, working with Government Departments, Local Authorities, ComReg, State Agencies, the telecoms industry and other key stakeholders.  The work of the taskforce will also assist Local Authorities in preparing for the rollout of the new NBP network once contract(s) are in place.  I expect that Minister Humphreys and I will bring proposals to Government by the end of 2016, on foot of the Taskforce's report.</p></reply>

The Agreement sets out a long-term goal to put the world on track to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees centigrade above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees.</p>  <p>  The Agreement aims to tackle 95% of global emissions through 188 Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs). Ireland will contribute to the Paris Agreement via the INDC tabled by the EU on behalf of Member States which commits to 40% reduction in EU-wide emissions by 2030 compared to 1990. The specific details of the contribution to be made by each Member State to this overall ambition remains to be finalised, and Ireland is currently examining proposals made by the European Commission in this regard.</p>  <p>  Ireland is a strong supporter of the Paris Agreement and indicated its continuing commitment by signing the Agreement, along with other EU Member States, at the signing ceremony in New York on 22 April 2016. Under Article 29.5.2 of the Irish Constitution, the approval of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann is required for Ireland to ratify the Paris Agreement and the on-going analysis of the proposed effort sharing to be agreed for 2030 will be critical to informing this debate. Within this context, Ireland is treating the ratification process as a key priority.</p></reply>

The European Commission published its draft proposals on what fair usage means earlier this month, which included capping usage at 30 consecutive days and 90 days total per year. However, these proposals have now been withdrawn by the Commission, and we await further proposals. </p>  <p>  Ireland is in favour of an economically sustainable solution which abolishes roaming charges for EU citizens travelling from one Member State to another. Officials in my Department are actively engaged in pursuing a favourable outcome at EU level and we await the forthcoming proposals with interest.</p></reply>

For the year 2020 itself, the target set for Ireland is that emissions should be 20 per cent below their value in 2005. This is jointly the most demanding 2020 reduction target allocated under the ESD and one shared only by Denmark and Luxembourg. The 2013 target is based on the average of emissions for the years 2008-2010. The target for each of the years 2014 through 2019 is on a straight-line trajectory between the targets for 2013 and 2020, and surpluses in one year can be used to cover deficits in any subsequent year.</p><p>The extent of the challenge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, in line with our EU and international commitments, is well understood by the Government, as reflected in the <i>National Policy Position on Climate Action and Low Carbon Development</i>, published in April 2014, and now underpinned by the <i>Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015</i>which was enacted in December 2015.  The National Policy Position provides a high-level policy direction for the adoption and implementation by Government of plans to enable the State to move to a low-carbon economy by 2050.  Statutory authority for the plans is set out in the Act.</p><p>Cognisant of the need to safeguard our economic recovery, there will, and must be, a strong economic dimension to the work that Ireland is carrying out to transition to a low carbon, environmentally sustainable economy, as Ireland&rsquo;s finances continue to stabilise and recover. The National Policy Position clearly identifies competitiveness as a pillar of the fundamental national objective on transition to a low-carbon economy by 2050 and, within this context, sets out a number of key issues for consideration in the on-going evolution of national climate policy, including cost-effective<font color="#1F497D">ness</font>and the need to take advantage of environmentally sustainable economic opportunities both within and outside the State.</p><p>The Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act statutorily underpins these and other key economic considerations, to be taken into account in the development of the mitigation and adaptation plans to be adopted by the Government for the purpose of progressing the national transition agenda. We must, therefore, look for economic opportunities in the low carbon transition process with policies to be adopted ideally being a spur to sustainable economic growth. </p><p>In accordance with Section 4 of the Act, and in line with responsibilities delegated to me as Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, I intend to submit a draft National Mitigation Plan for public consultation by the end of this year, followed by a final plan to be submitted to Government for approval by June 2017. Work is well underway on the development of the National Mitigation Plan, the primary objective of which will be to track implementation of measures already underway and identify additional measures in the longer term to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and progress the overall national low carbon transition agenda to 2050.  The first iteration of the National Mitigation Plan will place particular focus on putting the necessary measures in place to address the challenge to 2020, but also in terms of planning ahead to ensure that appropriate policies and measures will be in place beyond that.</p><p>A key element of the development process of the National Mitigation Plan is the identification of the most cost-effective measures with the optimal mitigation potential, which safeguard Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness and ideally support sustainable economic growth. Work is currently on-going on this complex task by all relevant Departments and will culminate in a master list of potential measures being produced from which the most appropriate measures will be selected for inclusion in the National Mitigation Plan; as the process is yet to be finalised, detailed costings are currently unavailable for the period concerned.</p><p>The ultimate objective of successive National Mitigation Plans is to incrementally achieve this low carbon transition vision by 2050. In that context, the National Mitigation Plan will have regard to Ireland&rsquo;s obligations under the current 2009 Effort Sharing Decision and any likely future EU and international obligations that may arise, including new targets to be agreed under the 2030 climate and energy package.</p></reply>

Based on currently available information, my Department estimates that the level of evasion is 13.75%. It is estimated that this level of evasion equates to a loss of approximately &euro;40m per annum to public service broadcasting.</p>  <p>  An Post administers the collection of the TV licence fee on my behalf. In terms of increasing compliance with the TV licensing requirements, An Post makes every effort to bring evaders into the licensed pool and a considerable amount of time and resources are spent in dealing specifically with this issue. An Post concentrates its initial efforts on getting people to buy the licence when due and by following up with a series of reminder notices and inspector visits. Bringing people to court is a last resort and only carried out where all other means have failed.  It is not possible to separate out the cost of tackling non-compliance from the overall cost of the service provided by An Post.</p>  <p>  I am very much aware, however, of the challenges that face the existing TV Licence system, including the current, unacceptable levels of evasion. While the rate has fallen from 15.3% at the end of 2013 to the current rate of 13.75% it is still very high.</p>  <p>  In that context, my Department has been working with An Post and RT&Eacute; on an on-going basis so that all steps are being taken to ensure the system is working as effectively as possible. Measures such as marketing campaigns, more evening and weekend inspections and appointment of additional temporary Inspectors are just some of the initiatives that have been utilized to enhance sales and improve compliance rates. </p>  <p>  My Department is also currently examining a number of additional actions that might be taken, including legislative measures, with the aim of further strengthening the system.</p></reply>

This is a common situation whereby a landlord is responsible for meeting the cost of energy efficiency improvement work, but only receives a benefit when the work increases the rental or re-sale value of the property. The tenant, who is typically responsible for paying the energy bills and would thus benefit from lower energy costs, is unlikely to invest in the work without certainty that they will remain in the property long enough that the savings will out-weigh the investment. These diverging incentives mean that energy efficiency investment is much lower in the rented sector than among homeowners.</p>  <p>  In the absence of intervention to correct this, an increasing proportion of renters will be likely to live in homes with poor energy efficiency. This has implications for the achievement of our climate goals and indeed, for energy poverty levels if incomes fall and/or energy costs rise. Therefore, the Government Strategy to Combat Energy Poverty concluded that the implementation of minimum energy efficiency standards for rented properties should be examined. </p>  <p>  Research work on this topic, commissioned by my Department along with the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, supported by SEAI, has been completed. Both Departments are now engaged in analysing the research work with a view to publishing a consultation paper, along with the research work, by the end of 2016. </p>  <p>  It is recognised that there is a need to balance improving the energy efficiency of rented properties against the supply and price of properties for rent. Any such minimum standards will need to be thoroughly consulted on, tested and developed, with implementation sufficiently phased to allow landlords the opportunity to make provision for compliance. </p>  <p>  The publication of this research work will be the start of a process that will bring together stakeholder groups in a structured engagement process with the aim of leading to agreement and providing regulatory certainty for the rented sector.</p></reply>

However, the Protocol also offers an additional means to meet targets by way of a number of market-based mechanisms, including the purchase of carbon credits.  The rules relating to the use of carbon credits to assist with meeting emissions reduction targets differ under the Kyoto Protocol and the EU 2020 Effort Sharing Decision (ESD), with the latter applying more restrictive limitations.</p>  <p>  Under the Carbon Fund Act 2007, a Carbon Fund was established to fund the purchase of carbon credits. I am responsible for the management and control of the Carbon Fund but, under the Act, the management of the Carbon Fund has been delegated to the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA).  As a result the NTMA are the purchasing agent for the State. Funding for the purchase of carbon units is provided from the Central Fund to the Carbon Fund. </p>  <p>  Some 1.2m units purchased by Ireland are known as  &lsquo;tCERs&rsquo; or temporary Certified Emissions Reductions, and they relate to emissions removals generated from land based projects such as afforestation and reforestation projects. Under the Kyoto Protocol&rsquo;s Clean Development Mechanism, such units allow Parties with Quantified Emission Limitation or Reduction Objectives, such as Ireland, to offset their emissions by supporting projects in those countries which did not take on such targets.  Ireland participates in a World Bank fund known as the BioCarbon Fund where the World Bank manages such projects on behalf of the participants from initiation through to the delivery of tCERs. The tCERs are considered to be potentially non-permanent because the emissions removals achieved by these projects are at risk of being re-emitted into the atmosphere at a future date. This could be as a result of human induced changes to land management practices, such as reversal of afforestation practices or active deforestation, or could result from fire or disease. It is not possible at present to provide a breakdown of whether the units purchased relate to forestry projects which are operated by public or private sector organisations in the countries involved (these include Brazil, China, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Chile, Colombia, India, and Moldova). </p>  <p>  The extent of the challenge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, in line with our EU and international commitments, is well understood by the Government, as reflected in the National Policy Position on Climate Action and Low Carbon Development, published in April 2014, and now underpinned by the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015, which was enacted in December 2015.  The National Policy Position provides a high-level policy direction for the adoption and implementation by Government of plans to enable the State to move to a low-carbon economy by 2050.  Statutory authority for the plans is set out in the Act.</p>  <p>  In accordance with Section 4 of the Act, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment must submit a National Mitigation Plan to Government for approval by June 2017 at the latest. Work is well underway on the development of the National Mitigation Plan, the primary objective of which will be to track implementation of measures already underway and identify additional measures in the longer term to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and progress the overall national low carbon transition agenda to 2050.</p></reply>

The REFIT support schemes are underpinned by detailed economic analysis to ensure long-term certainty for investors and overall value for money for consumers.  The REFIT schemes assure a minimum price for each unit of electricity exported to the grid over a 15 year period and cover a range of different renewable energy technologies, including wind energy, biomass and hydro-generation.</p><p>REFIT forms a key part of the Public Service Obligation (PSO). The PSO levy is charged to all electricity customers in Ireland to support national policy objectives related to renewable energy, indigenous fuels (peat) and security of energy supply. The PSO levy is determined each year by the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER). Ireland&rsquo;s REFIT schemes have proved effective in attracting investment into the renewable energy sector. In addition, the REFIT schemes have been found to be a very cost effective tool to support renewables development, as indicated by a report published by the Council of European Energy Regulators in 2015. </p><p>Each year my Department publishes a list of renewable energy technologies to be supported and the associated tariff for each. The 2015-2016 list is outlined in the following table.<table><tr><th>Tariff per MW (&euro;)</th><th>2015/2016</th></tr><tr><td>REFIT 1</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Large Wind (above 5MW)</td><td>69.72</td></tr><tr><td>Small wind (equal to or  less than 5MW</td><td>72.167</td></tr><tr><td>Hydro</td><td>88.068</td></tr><tr><td>Biomass Landfill Gas</td><td>85.622</td></tr><tr><td>Other Biomass</td><td>88.068</td></tr><tr><td>REFIT 2</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Large Wind (above 5MW)</td><td>69.72</td></tr><tr><td>Small Wind (equal to or less than 5MW</td><td>72.167</td></tr><tr><td>Hydro</td><td>88.068</td></tr><tr><td>Biomass Landfill Gas</td><td>85.622</td></tr><tr><td>REFIT 3</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Biomass Combustion</td><td>89.314</td></tr><tr><td>Biomass Combustion &ndash; Energy Crops</td><td>99.822</td></tr><tr><td>Large Biomass CHP (above 1,500 kW)</td><td>126.091</td></tr><tr><td>Small Biomass CHP (equal to or less than 1,500 kW)</td><td>147.106</td></tr><tr><td>Large Anaerobic Digestion (AD) Non CHP (above 500kW)</td><td>105.076</td></tr><tr><td>Small AD Non CHP (equal to or less than 500kW)</td><td>115.583</td></tr><tr><td>Large AD CHP (above 500kW)</td><td>136.598</td></tr><tr><td>Small AD CHP (equal to or less than 500kW)</td><td>157.613</td></tr></table></p><p>My Department is developing a new support scheme for renewable electricity and an initial consultation took place last year. In-depth economic analysis is now underway to inform the cost of any new scheme. Maintaining overall value for money for consumers, while reflecting the actual investment costs for renewable energy technologies is a key part of this work. Once the detailed economic analysis is complete, there will be a further public consultation on the design of the new scheme. The scheme is expected to become available in 2017, subject to Government approval and State Aid clearance from the European Commission.</p></reply>

The Agreement was negotiated by representatives of 195 countries and aims to hold the increase in global average temperature to well below 2&deg;C above pre-industrial levels, and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5&deg;C above pre-industrial levels. It aims to increase the ability to adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change and foster climate resilience and low greenhouse gas emissions development.</p>  <p>  The agreement is built on the premise of all parties submitting and carrying out Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) outlining the measures they will carry out to reduce their negative impacts on the environment. The European Union, as a single entity, has committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40% by 2030 compared with 1990 levels.</p>  <p>  The specific responsibilities of individual Member States contributing to this overall EU target have yet to be agreed. The Commission published draft proposals in this regard on 20 July last and analysis is on-going to assess the full implications of these for Ireland. Deliberations are also on-going within the wider EU context. The outcome of these deliberations will ultimately determine Ireland&rsquo;s contribution, which needs to reflect a level of ambition that is technically feasible, cost-effective and fair, to the overall EU 2030 effort.</p></reply>

This is due to the Port&rsquo;s complicated legal history. It technically remains part of the Fishguard and Rosslare Harbours and Railways Company: a company established by a series of statutes of the United Kingdom parliament dating from the late 19th and early 20th centuries. This unusual legal status has often been identified as an inhibiting factor in the Port&rsquo;s development.</p>  <p>  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has invested significant funds in the Port over the years. However, for the reasons outlined previously, it is the case that the Port does not enjoy the same financial autonomy as other ports in Ireland.</p>  <p>  Previous studies of the Port have outlined a number of options for its potential development, one of which has been the establishment of a separate company within CIE. The restrictive legal regime which governs the operation of the Port is, however, a significant barrier to the creation of such a body.</p>  <p>  With these issues in mind and with a view to identifying how the Port&rsquo;s interests would be best served into the future, in 2013 the Department commissioned Indecon economic consultants to conduct a strategic review of the Port. Their report concluded that the creation of an independent port authority would be extremely difficult given the Port&rsquo;s complex legal structure. Instead, it was recommended that the Port remain in public ownership and that the possibilities for increased private sector involvement be investigated. Should there be any such change in the status of the Port, its employees would, of course, be covered by all relevant employment legislation.</p>  <p>  In order to assist Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann's overall consideration of how best to move forward, it engaged consultants in late 2015 who presented interim findings to the company in early 2016. Those findings include a number of issues which require further consideration and the Department is engaging with the company and the Office of the Attorney General on those issues with a view to a satisfactory resolution.</p></reply>

Unfortunately, the current financial realities are such that the budgets proposed for the Department for 2017 indicate that capital funding will continue to be very tight, and the ability to increase allocations or progress new projects is limited. </p><p>  It is however open to the Council to fund Specific Improvement-type projects from their own resources.  The purpose of Exchequer funding is to supplement the own resources of local authorities, not to meet the full cost of schemes.</p></reply>

This decision was based on the needs of the Fingal area which registered the third highest population growth rate in the country (at 13.9%) in Census 2011 and a further 8% growth rate in the intervening 5-year period as shown in Census 2016 results.</p><p>Accordingly, funding has been made available under the Government's Capital Plan &quot;<i>Building on Recovery Infrastructure &amp;amp; Capital Investment 2016-2021&quot; </i>for planning, design and construction of new Metro North, with construction expected to commence in 2021 with a view to delivering the project by 2026/2027. The Programme for Partnership Government commits to proceeding with the New Metro North project. It is estimated that the project will cost in the region of &euro;2.4 billion (excluding VAT).</p><p>The NTA and Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) have commenced preparatory work on planning and design of new Metro North and a dedicated project Steering Group has been established.  In the meantime, the NTA has been asked to keep the interim public transport requirements of the Swords/Airport corridor over the next 10 years under review with a view to ensuring adequate capacity to meet demand and to address constraints arising along the corridor.</p><p>It is proposed that a mid-term review of the Capital Plan will be carried out in 2017. On foot of that review, and in the event that additional funding becomes available in the next few years, the groundwork that is currently being done will position us to progress the project in line with available funding.</p></reply>

If the main objective of the 2013 - 2020 Road Safety Strategy to reduce road fatalities to no more than 124 by 2020 is to remain valid, we need to re-vitalise and strenghten our efforts to reverse this trend.</p>  <p>  To that end, the RSA are currently pursuing a number of initiatives aimed at reducing fatalities and serious injuries among vulnerable road users (e.g. pedestrians and cyclists),  including a new programme for schools targeting children 13-16 years and a new intervention to highlight the danger of low level speeding (travelling a few kms above the speed limit) and the consequences of this for vulnerable road users. The Road Traffic Bill 2016, which has passed all stages in the Seanad and which I intend bringing before the D&aacute;il shortly, includes an option for local authorities to apply a 20km limit in built-up areas.  The application of this measure has the potential to improve the safety of pedestrians and all other vulnerable road users.</p>  <p>  In addition, RSA mass media campaigns, coordinated  with actions planned by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, will prioritise key issues, e.g., driver distraction, driver fatigue, drink-driving, speeding, non-seatbelt wearing, and worn tyres.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has also confirmed that enforcement measures are being taken to address the worrying trend of an apparent increase in drink driving, specifically targeted at counties with the worst road safety record.</p>  <p>  With respect to investment in road safety awareness, the Road Safety Authority (RSA) has been self-financing since 2014 and I am fully satisfied that the Authority has adequate resources available to promote road safety.</p></reply>

Participation in physical activity such as cycling has significant health benefits and helps combat sedentary behaviour amongst all age groups. </p>  <p>  In all areas of transport the highest priority for my Department is safety.  Both my Department and the Road Safety Authority (RSA) are engaged in promoting awareness of the Rules of the Road and safe practice on our roads for all road users.  This includes promoting awareness of cyclists and other vulnerable road users among motorists including drivers of heavy commercial vehicles, as well as promoting safe cycling practice among cyclists.  </p>  <p>  The current Road Safety Strategy, running from 2013 to 2020, contains a number of measures to ensure greater safety in cycling.  These include promoting the use of personal protection equipment and high visibility clothing, the provision of which is heavily funded by the RSA, and developing a standardised road safety cycling proficiency training programme for schools.  </p>  <p>  My Department is funding the development and roll-out of "Cycle Right", a new national cycling training standard through which cyclists will increase their safe journeying on the road network.  I expect that Cycle Right will roll out nationally from January 2017.  </p>  <p>  The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads are prioritised and funded from local authorities' own resources supplemented by State road grants and my Department also operates a road safety Improvement grant programme to address safety hazards.  </p>  <p>  In the Greater Dublin Area (GDA) the National Transport Authority (NTA), together with the relevant local authorities, are responsible for the planning and delivery of cycling infrastructure.  Funding of approximately &euro;37m has been allocated by the NTA for investment in cycling/walking projects, QBCs, safety integration and traffic management projects in 2016 covering the GDA and also the regional cities of Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford.</p></reply>

The driving licence elements are currently been implemented and are expected to be delivered by the end of Q4 2016. </p>  <p>  The NVDF system issues 10 million postal items annually, all of which have been modified to use Eircodes.  In addition the NVDF processes in the order of 10,000 addresses updates daily and procedures have been put in place for the public to update their Eircode in the relevant systems such as Online Motor Tax.  The NVDF will benefit from the National Post Code (Eircode) System by increasing postal delivery accuracy which is important in ensuring that key postal items such as Motor Tax disks and Penalty Point notices get delivered to the correct address.     </p>  <p>  In relation to the agencies under my Department's remit, this is a matter for the agencies themselves and I have forwarded the Deputy's question to the agencies for their direct response.

This document outlines a roadmap for the sector's future development.  With regard to future investment, there is no Exchequer funding available for port infrastructure development.  This is settled Government policy, as is stated in the National Ports Policy, the individual port companies must fund development proposals themselves without recourse to the Exchequer with funding to be sourced from a mixture of a company's own reserves, bank debt and/or potential other sources, or for example, EU funding.</p><p>The trans-European transport network (TEN-T) is the master plan for a comprehensive transport infrastructure development throughout the European Union.  Subject to certain criteria, EU funding is available for Core and Comprehensive TEN-T ports in Ireland through the EU funding instrument Connecting Europe Facility (CEF).  CEF for Transport  aims at supporting investments in building new transport infrastructure in Europe or rehabilitating and upgrading the existing one. </p><p>Co-funding under the CEF is delivered in the form of grants allocated following competitive calls for proposals. Irish port companies have been successful in obtaining approx. &euro;43m of co  funding under CEF towards their development projects since 2013. <font color="#333333"> I</font>t is expected that the next call will be open for new applications by the first week in October this year.</p><p><font color="#333333"> </font>Additionally the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI) is an initiative launched jointly by the European Investment Bank (EIB) Group and the European Commission to help overcome the current investment gap in the EU by mobilising private financing for strategic investments.  Dublin Port successfully secured &euro;100m in loan financing from the EIB in 2015 and a number of other port companies have been in talks with the European Investment Bank exploring financing options.</p></reply>

This vessel is required by the Act to be surveyed by the MSO at least once each year and requires a Class V Passenger Ship Certificate in order to operate a passenger ship on the route mentioned.</p>  <p>   Whereas the reports of surveys issued by the MSO are confidential to the owner of any  vessel, the MSO does not issue instructions or directions to owners that a particular vessel must be replaced.  This is a decision for the owner to make.  In making this decision an owner may wish to take account of the survey requirements of the MSO in relation to the vessel and in particular regarding the costs likely to be incurred in completing necessary repairs that have been identified by the MSO in connection with the ongoing survey and certification of the vessel concerned.</p>  <p>  As ships age, the extent and costs for the owner associated with compliance with the requirements of the Merchant Shipping Acts would normally be expected to increase.  The point in time when it becomes economically unviable to continue to operate a particular vessel is a commercial decision for the owner/business concerned and is not an issue for the MSO to decide upon.</p></reply>

The site acts as a matching tool for individuals looking to offer or seek lifts, on a once-off or a regular basis.  The site is free to use by individuals, sports clubs, festival or event organisers and workplaces nationwide to set up their own car sharing groups. </p><p>In line with its statutory mandate, the NTA published a Transport Strategy for the Greater Dublin Area (GDA) 2016-2035 earlier this year.  The focus in the strategy on car parking facilities concentrates on Park and Ride facilities to provide the opportunity for modal transfer from the private car to the public transport network rather than parking for car-pooling.  It is intended that Park and Ride facilities will be provided to facilitate the use of the public transport network by people living beyond the local walking catchment of rail or other public transport services.  </p><p>The provision of car parking facilities is ultimately a matter for the relevant local authority working closely with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to ensure that cars are parked in a safe and legal manner.  I understand that a number of small park and ride facilities have recently been completed in the Meath and Kildare County Council areas, are proving to be very successful, and could serve as useful models for other local authorities.</p></reply>
