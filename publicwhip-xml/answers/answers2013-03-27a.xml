The deadline for applications was the 11th May 2012 for paper based hard copy applications and 1st June for applications made online.</p><p>  The Department received 2,170 applications for funding under the 2012 Sports Capital Programme, the highest number of applications ever received. The allocations were announced last December. There were 648 allocations totalling &#8364;31m.</p><p>  All successful applicants have received a letter of provisional allocation which states <i>inter alia</i> that grantees must complete a substantial amount of progress on their projects before 31 January 2015, otherwise the Department will withdraw the grant offer after that date.</p><p>  An internal review of the 2012 round of the Sports Capital Programme is currently underway. This review will examine all aspects of the operation of the 2012 round. The outcome of the review will obviously be taken into account in the design and operation of the next round of the Programme.</p><p>  No decision has been taken on the timing of the next round. Any such decision will of course have to be taken in the context of the likely capital provision for the subhead in future years.</p></reply>

However, our next most important European market, Germany, produced over 448,000 visits, an increase of 6% on 2011, while North America, our second most important market overall, grew 3% to over a million visits while spend grew 9% to &euro;742 million.</p><p>  Tourism Ireland's Business Plan for 2013 targets a further 5.2% growth in visits, from all of our significant markets including Great Britain and Germany, and highlights the potential impact of the Gathering Ireland 2013. It is important to focus on markets with best prospects for growth but it is necessary to balance this and not ignore opportunities in other markets, particularly one as significant as Britain. To help achieve the targets, I have allocated over &euro;37 million this year for overseas tourism marketing which allows Tourism Ireland to implement its Plan, as well as funding F&aacute;ilte Ireland's enterprise supports and product development.  These actions, along with continued implementation of other measures such as the lower VAT rate for tourism services, provide a platform on which the tourism industry, in partnership with the agencies, can deliver growth.</p><p>  With regard to Britain, I welcomed the report of the Tourism Recovery Taskforce, entitled &quot;GB Path to Growth&quot;, and its recommendations for restoring growth from Britain which are reflected in the 2013 plans of the tourism agencies.  For example, Tourism Ireland is refining its approach to targeting potential visitors receptive to the experiences that Ireland can offer, and is conducting an extensive promotional programme this year in Britain.</p><p>  More generally, the balance of marketing spend across markets is an operational matter for Tourism Ireland, acting in accordance with Business Plans and Corporate Plans approved by the North/South Ministerial Council.  However, the opportunities presented by the different markets, I believe, need to be factored into not only their plans but the plans of tourism enterprises and F&aacute;ilte Ireland and I believe it is a matter that should be considered in the course of the tourism policy review which my Department is to commence this year.</p></reply>

That will provide further opportunity for stakeholder input before the adoption of the policy in early 2014.</p></reply>

This report clearly highlighted that the international experience of tendering for PSO type services has been favourable. Furthermore, the report indicated that tendering for PSO services showed benefits accruing to the State and to the commuting public in terms of (i) improved service quality, (ii) a more integrated transport system and (iii) greater value for taxpayer&rsquo;s money.</p></reply>

It is a matter for the IRFU to prepare and submit a bid. A feasibility study commissioned by the IRFU on the potential for hosting the tournament is being finalised and will be presented to me by the IRFU shortly. I looked forward to receiving it and and considering the findings.  The support of other sporting organisations would be an important element in the bid process and I am pleased to note that delegates at last weekend's GAA Congress approved a motion which would allow the inclusion of Croke Park and other GAA grounds in the list of venues that would be used for matches if Ireland was selected as the host country for the tournament.</p><p>  The Programme for Government includes a commitment that event tourism will be prioritised in order to continue to bring major events to Ireland. As well as bringing spectators to our shores, the hosting of sports events can provide a great showcase for Ireland.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland continues to support the holding of sports and other events that can boost tourism and, where appropriate, will provide advice and assistance to the sporting body which is seeking to secure an international event.  I understand that F&aacute;ilte Ireland has engaged with the IRFU in this regard.  The bid has also been discussed with the Northern Ireland Minister for Tourism, Arlene Foster MLA, and Minister for Culture, Arts and Leisure, Car&aacute;l N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n MLA, and they have met with the IRFU and  have also indicated their support for a bid.</p></reply>

Specifically the NTA has national responsibility in the areas of passenger bus route licensing, bus and rail services provided under public service contract and the regulation of taxi services.  In November, 2010 the NTA published guidelines for the licensing of public bus services which set out the basis for a reformed licensing system for commercial bus passenger services in the State.  I also refer the Deputy to my reply to a priority question answered earlier. This sets out the position in relation to the Public Service Contracts awarded by the NTA for the provison of bus services.</p><p>  The regulation of rail services is predominantly based on  legislation of the European Union.  In January this year, the European Commission adopted a further set of proposals for reform of rail regulation - the &quot;Fourth Rail Package&quot;-  which envisages, among other things, the liberalisation of domestic rail passenger services and mandatory tendering for public service contracts for rail passenger services from 2019. These proposals are being considered by my Department.  Finally, with regard to small public service vehicle services, the regulatory framework was reviewed by the Taxi Regulation Review Group, the report of which was published in January last year.  The recommendations are being followed up,  partly through initiatives being taken by the NTA within the existing legislative framework and through the proposed reform of that framework as provided for in the Taxi Regulation Bill 2012 which is before the Seanad.</p></reply>

It also provides for the restructuring of the ports sector to suit the varying circumstances of our ports.  I look forward to working with all stakeholders in implementing the policy.</p></reply>

A transport system that supports and enhances both domestic and export driven growth will be vital in supporting our agenda of renewed and sustainable economic growth. With this in mind my Department have commenced work on a Strategic Framework for Investment in Land Transport.</p><p>  This work is aimed at supporting medium term considerations by Government around the appropriate levels of public expenditure on land transport, and priorities for future investment. This will serve to inform the preparation of the Government&#8217;s Capital programme for 2017-2021 as well as longer term priorities for land transport in Ireland.</p><p>  The issues that need to be addressed in such a framework are extremely complex, for example, the difficulty of projecting the scale of future transport demand, the importance of land use and planning policy for transport, the specific importance of freight and commercial movements to our economy, and the need to embed environmental sustainability in any such plan. </p><p>  The work will comprise four broad work areas (i) analysing the evidence base for economic and socio-economic impacts of transport investment (ii) considering the scale of necessary future investment in transport (iii) considering delivery models and (iv) identifying strategic priorities. A steering group has been put in place to guide this work. It is likely the framework will take at least 18 months to complete. A public consultation will take place when sufficient progress is made to ensure that the interests of all stakeholders are fully taken into account.  <i> </i></p></reply>

The 2013 Estimates allocations to Failte Ireland include a special provision of &euro;7 million, specifically provided to fund the promotion, development and legacy of the Gathering.</p><p>  As of the end of last week, there were 3,300 individual Gatherings confirmed on the Gathering website. These include clan gatherings, festivals, special sporting events and concerts taking place all across the country throughout the year. A county breakdown can be viewed on this website. Along with well-established events and festivals, we are also supporting a specially targeted set of events for the Gathering, such as the very successful New Year's Eve Event in Dublin. The People's Parade was the Gathering element of the recent  St. Patrick's Festival and was a great success with almost 6,000 overseas visitors joining the parade.</p><p>  The ambitious targets for overseas visits and associated revenue can only be achieved if people in our main source tourism markets are aware of the initiative. Tourism Ireland continues to mount a major consumer campaign to promote The Gathering to people across the world linked by family, friends or otherwise with Ireland. The agency is undertaking cooperative activity with major airlines and ferry operators to highlight the value fares on offer. Print, online and TV advertising is being used to promote the initiative while the recent programme of overseas Ministerial visits during the St. Patrick's Day period highlighted this special year for Irish tourism. I understand that the feedback from the diaspora in the markets has been extremely positive. Tourism Ireland has announced 2013 as Ireland's Family History Year and are encouraging people throughout the world to research their family history and connections with  Ireland.</p><p>  While progress to date has been encouraging, I have previously stated that all tourism stakeholders must continue to work hard to ensure that our targets are achieved.  If we do so, I have no doubt that the benefits of participation in the event will have longer term positive consequences in terms of additional annual events as well as the strengthened connections being established as a result of the initiative.</p></reply>

The NTA is the lead agency with responsibility for implementation of the recommendations of the Taxi Regulation Review Report 2011. </p><p>  The NTA carried out a consultation on vehicle standards as part of the Taxi Regulation Review which gave rise to recommendations for strengthening vehicle standards Action 10 of the Review Report recommends retention of the 9 year vehicle age limit that applies at licence issue or renewal for all new vehicles entering the fleet. For existing vehicles in the fleet licensed prior to 1 January 2009, these can operate up to the 15th annniversary of each vehicle's first registration subject to 6-monthly NCT testing and NTA licence renewal assessment. It is envisaged therefore that, over time, all vehicles older than nine years will gradually transition from the taxi and hackney fleet.</p><p>  A number of other recommendations of the Taxi Review aim to address the transport requirements in SPSVs for people with disability and reduced mobility. In particular, Action 20 of the Taxi Regulation Review Report recommended the review of existing specifications for WAVs with view to assisting in the increase in availability of accessible SPSVs. Action 18 proposes a single contact centre for ordering wheelchair accessible taxi services, which is to be introduced on a pilot basis. These actions are being developed by the NTA with a view to implementation later this year. </p></reply>

Currently, the Programme is administered by Pobal in conjunction with the NTA as part of the Programme transition. Thirty-five groups covering thirty-six geographical areas nationwide are currently being funded under the Programme. Louth Linx (Louth Leader) is one of these groups.</p><p>  An overall budget of &euro;9.133 million has been allocated by the Department of Transport, Tourism &amp; Sport to the Programme for 2013.  This represents a small decrease on the 2012 allocation of &euro;9.77 million, at a very difficult time financially.  &euro;78,670.50 of the 2013 RTP budget has been allocated to Louth Linx from January to June 2013, with a further proposed allocation of &euro;78,670.00 from July to December.

This represents a total 2013 allocation of combined RTP and FTP funding of &euro;189,766.50, for the provision of the RTP service across County Louth. This funding allocation covers the planned 2013 RTP service level, which anticipates over 26,000 passenger trips, or 1,185 service trips, by means of two daily services, 18 weekly services and one fortnightly and monthly service.</p><p>  I have been advised that Louth Linx RTP bus services 502 and 701, Carlingford to Dundalk and Dundalk to Omeath respectively, are currently operational and it is planned that they will remain in operation during 2013.

In relation to the US, the market for air services between the EU and the US was liberalised under the EU-US Open Skies agreement in 2007.  This means that EU and US airlines are free to provide whatever services they wish in these markets based on their own commercial judgements.  The market for air services in and out of Ireland is highly competitive with a very significant number of airlines operating.</p><p>  Tourism Ireland continues to invest in cooperative marketing activity with airlines.  Additional capacity has been secured between Ireland and the US for the summer 2013 season with up to 133 departures, providing just over 31,000 seats in each direction per week.  This represents a 26.6% increase in capacity, or just over 6,500 additional seats per week, compared to summer 2012.  Furthermore additional connectivity direct to/from Dublin has been achieved through Emirates and Etihad's services from Dubai and Abu Dhabi respectively which provide greater ease of access to Ireland from Australia as well as the emerging tourism markets in the Middle East and Asia.  These long-haul markets are particularly important for Irish tourism as tourists from these destinations tend to stay longer and spend more.  In addition to this, Irish airports offer discounted charges to airlines providing new routes.</p><p>  Negotiations are ongoing with a number of carriers for additional capacity linked both to general traffic demand and the increased traffic expected over the course of The Gathering Ireland 2013.</p></reply>

The Programme is managed by Pobal in conjunction with the NTA as part of the Programme transition.  Thirty-five groups covering thirty-six geographical areas nationwide are currently being funded under the Programme. </p><p>  Since becoming Minister for Public and Commuter Transport, my aim has been to strengthen the RTP by ensuring a more efficient delivery structure by maximising integration with other state transport services and by making the Programme a sustainable part of the public transport system.  This is in line with the Programme for Government commitment to maintain and extend the RTP with other local transport services.</p><p>  Given that resources are limited and that the Value for Money and Policy Review of the RTP, published last year, recommended organisational restructuring to achieve efficiencies and the better alignment of the 35 RTP groups with local authorities, it is necessary that the current delivery mechanisms and structures are examined and revised.  The current structures of the RTP are not sustainable if the required efficiencies and savings are to be achieved.  If these are not achieved then with the limited resources available services will decline.  I am not prepared to allow that to happen.</p><p>  Work is under way to determine the optimal structure for the delivery of rural transport from an efficiency and service perspective.  Discussions are taking place with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, the County and City Managers Association and the Rural Transport Network in the context of aligning the new structure with the local authority structure.  Evaluation of this structure will include consideration of various criteria, such as, cost benefit analysis as well as measures to achieve greater efficiencies and the potential impact and consequences of the new structure.  Central to any new structure will be an acknowledgement of the significant role that the Programme currently plays in combatting rural isolation and enhancing mobility, accessibility and community participation of local people, particularly those at risk of social exclusion.</p><p>  I would emphasis that no decision has been taken but I am hopeful that I will be in a position to recommend a new structure later this year which will allow for the maximising of spend on services and the reduction of administration costs.</p></reply>

The Plan will build on the progress made under the 2012 Action Plan and continue to improve supports for job-creating businesses and remove the barriers to employment-creation across the economy.</p><p>  The further development of the tourism sector has been an important element of the Government's economic policy, supported by measures such as the 9% reduced VAT rate, the cut in employers' PRSI and the fuel rebate for coach operators. The Action Plan for Jobs enhances my Department&rsquo;s strong focus on pro-tourism and pro-job policies.  The Plan also includes a range of other transport and tourism related measures.</p><p>  My Department and our agencies will continue to play a central part in the delivery of the above initiatives not just under the Action Plan but also under the Programme for Government and the Department's Statement of Strategy,  all of which are designed to contribute to economic recovery.My Department is in constant liaison with our agencies about the delivery of their commitments under these various programmes and plans.</p><p>  In relation to transport costs and arising from an EU initiative to reduce administrative costs to business, I announced in January 2013 that more than 300,000 Irish businesses and sole traders will see the cost of compliance with transport regulation cut as new Departmental and Road Safety Authority computer systems go live later this year.

Both CIE and its subsidiary, Ianrod Eireann will remain in State ownership.</p><p>  My Department and the National Transport Authority are working with Iarnrod Eireann to increase the efficiency and attractiveness of existing rail services.</p><p>  The Government continues to provide substantial Exchequer investment in the rail network despite the significant financial challenges.  In the past two years a total of almost &euro;385 million has been invested in Iarnrod Eireann and further investment of over &euro;130 million will take place this year.  The overall investment in railway safety is in excess of &euro;1.5 billion since 1999 when the Railway Safety Programme commenced.  There has also been significant investment in rolling stock, on upgrading the Kildare Route and opening new routes such as the Cork Commuter Route, Navan Phase 1 and Phase 1 of the Western Rail Corridor.</p><p>  The investment regime for Iarnrod Eireann for 2014 is currently being reviewed having regard to the anticipated completion of the Railway Safety Programme by the end of 2013 and new EU mandated infrastructure management contract requirements, allied to the need to ensure value for money in the spending of constrained Exchequer funding.  It is envisaged that, from 2014 onwards, investment in Iarnrod Eireann will concentrate on maintaining and renewing a fit for purpose rail network, augmented by some targetted investment enhancements which will be limited due to the overall level of resources available for transport investment up to 2016.</p><p>  On 24 July last, the Government decided to provide additional PSO funding of &euro;36 million to the CIE companies.  This brought the total subvention paid to CIE in 2012 to &euro;278 million, of which &euro;166.4 million was paid to Iarnrod Eireann.  CIE is progressing a 5-year Business Plan to address the underlying financial challenges facing CIE so that the CIE's rail and bus services can be provided efficiently and cost effectively over the Plan period.</p></reply>

Few, if any, other countries have a national day which is so widely known and celebrated across the entire globe. As a country we should maximise the value we get from such global attention and goodwill.  The purpose of these visits is threefold:</p><p>   Firstly, to promote Irish economic and cultural links overseas.</p><p>  Secondly, to use the opportunity of St Patrick's Day to strengthen our bi-lateral relationship with other states.</p><p>  Thirdly, to connect with our diaspora overseas as well as those individuals with a strong connection or affinity with Ireland.</p><p>  With regard to bi-lateral relations, I met with Minister for Culture, Tourism and Sport and the Minister for Patriots and Veterans Affairs  in Korea.  While in Japan, I met with the Minister for Land, Infrastructure and Transport and the Minister for Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology. I also had the privilege in Japan of attending a meeting of the Japan Ireland Parliamentary Friendship League in their parliament. These meetings gave me an opportunity to discuss matters relating to matters of mutual interest between our two countries and also to promote key Irish interests in Korea and Japan.</p><p>  In relation to the promotion of Irish economic and cultural interests, I undertook a number of events with the Enterprise Ireland and the IDA offices in Korea and Japan, meeting with IDA client companies with investments in Ireland or those considering an investment. I also met with Enterprise Ireland clients exporting into these economies, as well as meeting with a variety of tourism trade interests in Japan.</p><p>  With regard to Korea, I was pleased to be able to attend our National Day event in Seoul, as well as to meet separately with members of the Irish community in Korea and members of the Global Irish Network. In Japan, I attended the National Day events in Tokyo and Osaka, and participated in the St Patrick's Day Parades in Yokohama and Tokyo. These events gave me an opportunity to express my Government's support for our links with the diaspora, as well as to learn as to how we can better improve our relationship with Japan and Korea.  In relation to matters specifically under my Department's remit, I used the opportunity of engagements with our diaspora and those with a connection to Ireland to promote Irish tourism, particularly in this, the year of the Gathering, as well as holding a briefing for the tourism trade and media in Japan. Furthermore, I held meetings with Ministerial colleagues who cover areas relating to transport, tourism and sport in order to develop co-operation in a variety of areas of mutual interest. Finally, as part of my promotion of Irish economic interests, I also had meetings with companies that produce rolling stock for Irish Rail and arrange finance for transport companies.</p></reply>

My Department continues to work with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation on the Heads of the new Bill to provide for the merger of the airport with a restructured Shannon Development in a new, commercial, State-owned entity and this legislation will be advanced during the first half of this year.  When the Heads of the Bill are ready, they will be referred to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Transport for their consideration prior to drafting. It is my hope, subject to enactment of the Bill, that the new Shannon entity could be established mid-year, although I appreciate that this will be challenging. It will then be a matter for the new entity to proceed with the development and expansion of the aviation services centre in Shannon. In January, I appointed Rose Hynes as Chairman of the SAA and in that context I expect her to take on the role of Chairman designate for the NewCo which is in the process of being established.  More recently, I have made four further appointments to the board of the SAA, including two employee representatives nominated by ICTU. A process to recruit a Chief Executive for the Shannon Airport Authority and the new Shannon entity (NewCo) is also currently under way.</p><p>  The Steering Group comprising representatives of the Department of Finance, Public Expenditure and Report, Environment, Community and Local Government, Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and my Department is meeting on a regular basis to oversee the implementation of the Government decision in all its elements.</p></reply>

The 57th session of the Commission on the Status of Women took place in New York from 4 to 15 March 2013.  The priority theme for the session was the elimination and prevention of all forms of violence against women and girls.  The outcome aimed for in this regard was a set of Agreed Conclusions, which are negotiated by all states and, in accordance with normal practice, adopted on the basis of consensus. </p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s official delegation to the CSW was led by Ms Kathleen Lynch T.D., Minister of State at the Department of Health and the Department of Justice and Equality with responsibility for Disability, Equality, Mental Health and Older People.  It included officials from the Department of Justice and Equality and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  In addition, representatives from civil society organisations were part of the delegation.</p><p>  The EU was represented in the negotiations on the Agreed Conclusions by the EU Delegation, supported by the Irish Presidency.  Following extensive negotiations, consensus on the Agreed Conclusions was reached on 15 March 2013.  Ireland, working closely with EU and other likeminded partners, contributed actively to what has been widely received as a positive outcome.  Previously identified national priorities are clearly reflected in the Agreed Conclusions, including a strong condemnation all forms of violence against women and girls; recognition of the linkages with gender inequality and discrimination; a commitment to end impunity; and references to women, peace and security, women human rights defenders, and the need for coordinated, multisectoral services.  New elements incorporated into the Agreed Conclusions include the role of men and boys in addressing the issue, and the role which victims and survivors can play as agents for change.</p><p>  The Agreed Conclusions (currently in unedited format) are available on the website of the 57th Session of the CSW.</p><p>  In addition to the negotiations on the agreed conclusions, the Minister of State chaired a number of side events.  The first of these, entitled &ldquo;Mobilising communities to prevent and respond to violence against women &ndash; lessons learnt from Uganda&rdquo;, looked at Irish Aid&rsquo;s work in Uganda.  The second, entitled &ldquo;Addressing Gender Based Violence in post conflict and fragile states &ndash; a case study of Sierra Leone&rdquo;, presented the results of research carried out by the Irish Consortium on Gender Based Violence.  The Minister of State also participated in a European Union event, at which she outlined the National Strategy developed by Cosc, and a side event organised by the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts.</p><p>  Additionally, the Minister of State participated in a high-level consultation on &ldquo;Accelerating Zero-Tolerance to Gender Based Violence through the HIV response&rdquo; which was organised by UN Women and UNAIDS and co-sponsored by Ireland.  Her programme also included a series of bilateral contacts with a number of other Ministers and officials.</p><p>  Ireland also co-sponsored an event with Amnesty International and the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights which focused on the risks faced by women human rights defenders and at which our Permanent Representative in New York was a panellist.  We co-sponsored a further event organised by the Uganda-based NGO, Raising Voices, which looked at implementing an evidence-based approach in addressing violence against women and girls.  An event supported by Australia, South Africa and Ireland explored the potential of new media in supporting survivors of violence against women.  The range of side events contributed to raising awareness around these issues among those attending CSW while also showcasing Ireland&rsquo;s engagement in efforts to eliminate violence against women and girls both domestically and internationally.</p></reply>

We continue to work in close cooperation with our EU partners in accordance with the common EU guidelines on the issue of the death penalty, to seek its universal abolition.</p><p>  The EU guidelines, adopted in 1998, set out clearly the common EU position on the use of the death penalty.  These guidelines seek, in the first instance, the universal abolition of the death penalty and state that where the death penalty still exists, the EU will continue to press for its use to be progressively restricted.  The EU utilises every possible occasion to voice its concerns regarding the use of the death penalty and intervenes in cases which fall under the criteria set out in the EU Guidelines on the Death Penalty.  Ireland strongly supports these efforts.</p></reply>

The nature of Iran&rsquo;s nuclear programme, as well as the secrecy attaching to it, have given rise to widespread international concerns about the aims of the programme.  It is difficult to understand many aspects of the programme and of the Iranian authorities&rsquo; actions in relation to it other than as an effort to achieve a covert nuclear weapons capability.  Concerns about Iran&rsquo;s intentions have been voiced not only by the United States and Israel but by a very wide group of countries including the member States of the European Union, Russia, China, and Iran&rsquo;s Arab neighbours.</p></reply>

This is not the case, as is illustrated by the fact that over 200 people have been charged with a variety of offences since the protests began. </p><p>  There is however an ongoing debate regarding the extent, if any, to which existing legislation needs to be strengthened to enhance the remit of the Commission in these matters.  There is no cross community consensus on this matter.  Indeed, some unionist community representatives, far from wanting the Commission&rsquo;s role extended, want it abolished completely.</p><p>  What is important at present is that where the Parades Commission has jurisdiction all parties cooperate with it and respect its determinations.  The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and I are fully in agreement on this issue.  Furthermore, we are agreed that the police should be fully supported in their attempts to maintain public order. </p><p>  My understanding is that the current debate will be further informed by the outcome of the  recent judicial review proceedings which have been instituted by a resident in the nationalist Short Strand Community in Belfast &ndash; an area which has been greatly affected by the flags dispute.  In the circumstances I think it would be inappropriate for me to comment further.</p></reply>

We continue to urge all the parties in the Assembly to engage in constructive discussion with a view to reaching agreement on the substance of a Bill of Rights.</p><p>  A Bill of Rights drawn up by agreement between the main parties of the Assembly could set out precisely and formally the rights upon which a shared future for the people of Northern Ireland can be based. </p><p>  All parties to the Good Friday Agreement recognised the importance of respect, understanding and tolerance in relation to linguistic diversity, including in Northern Ireland, the Irish language and the languages of the various ethnic communities, as part of the cultural wealth of the island of Ireland.  </p><p>  In the St Andrews Agreement, the British government committed to introducing an Irish Language Act reflecting on the experience of Wales and Ireland and to working with the Executive to enhance and protect the development of the Irish Language.  </p><p>  It also called on the incoming Northern Ireland Executive to work to enhance and protect the development of the Irish language. The British legislation giving effect to the St. Andrews Agreement included a specific requirement on the Executive to adopt a strategy setting out     how it proposed to enhance and protect the development of the Irish language.  </p><p>  Since the restoration of the devolved Institutions on 8 May 2007, the question of an Irish Language Act for Northern Ireland is a devolved matter and is the responsibility of the Northern Ireland Executive. In that regard, my colleagues the Minister for Arts, Heritage &amp; the Gaeltacht, Mr Jimmy Deenihan T.D. and Minister of State Dinny McGinley T.D. have had ongoing discussions on the matter with their counterpart, the Northern Ireland Minister for Culture, Arts and Leisure, Ms Car&aacute;l N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n MLA.  On 11 July 2012, Minister N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n launched a consultation process which concluded on 27 November on strategies for the Irish language and Ulster Scots.  Inputs from the consultation process are now being considered.</p><p>  Last November I visited An Chult&uacute;rlann in Belfast which is a very impressive Irish language and cultural centre.  I had the opportunity to meet with some of the city&rsquo;s leading Irish language activists and to hear their concerns regarding the promotion of the Irish language including their views on an Irish language act for Northern Ireland.  Officials in my Department maintain regular and ongoing contact with the Irish language community in Northern Ireland, most recently when they attended the official opening of Gael&aacute;ras Mhic Ardghail in Newry on Monday 18 February.</p><p>  The Government continues to follow developments closely in relation to the proposed Act, as well as the overall enhancement and protection of the Irish Language in Northern Ireland. </p><p>  The Good Friday Agreement also provided for the establishment of a Consultative Civic Forum  as a consultative mechanism in Northern Ireland on social, economic and cultural issues.</p><p>  The St Andrews Agreement provided that the Northern Ireland Executive would support the establishment of an independent North/South Consultative Forum appointed by the two administrations and representative of civil society.  In September 2008 the Irish Government submitted proposals for the role, format, membership and operation of a North South Consultative Forum to the Executive for its consideration, and facilitated three consultative conferences, the most recent of which was in January 2011.  The review of the Civic Forum by the Northern Ireland Executive has not yet been completed.  At its meeting on 2 November 2012, the North-South Ministerial Council noted the current position on a North South Consultative Forum and agreed to review the issue at a future NSMC Plenary.</p><p>  I hope that we can take this opportunity of the 15th  Anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement to recall the vision of a shared society which inspired that Agreement and re-dedicate ourselves to the achievement of that goal.  While there are undoubtedly challenges ahead, we should not lose sight of the progress that continues to be made, including, most recently though the establishment of the North South Inter Parliamentary Association.</p></reply>

Simply because an individual is described as a &#8220;contractor&#8221; does not necessarily mean that such individual is a self-employed contractor.</p><p>  Depending on the facts and circumstances of a case, an individual may be a full-time employee, a part-time employee, a temporary employee, a casual employee or, indeed, may be self-employed. </p><p>  The question of whether an individual is engaged under either a contract of service (i.e. an employee) or a contract for services (i.e. self-employed) is a question of fact and of general law.   Regardless of how the parties to an engagement may describe themselves, all the possible factors (including written, oral and implied details) that bear on the relationship between the parties must be examined, given their proper weight and a decision made on their overall effect.   To try to provide some clarity as to whether an individual is employed or self-employed, the Employment Status Group (set up under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness) published a <i>Code of Practice for determining Employment or Self-employment status of Individuals (</i>  updated in June 2010).  </p><p>  My officials inform me that this <i>Code of Practice</i> is not solely a Revenue document but was compiled in conjunction with the  Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, the National Employment Rights Authority, the Department of Social Protection,  the Small Firms Association, the Construction Industry Federation, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Irish Business and Employers Confederation and my Department.  Of course, at the end of the day, the <i>Code of Practice </i>  is for guidance only and the status (employed or self-employed) of an individual in relation to an engagement may, in some instances, have to be determined by the Courts.</p><p>  The purpose of the <i>Code of Practice</i> &#8220;<i>is to eliminate misconceptions and provide clarity</i>  &#8221;.

Accordingly, the increase in the standard DIRT rate from 27% to 30% and in the higher DIRT rate from 30% to 33%, announced in December 2011, applied to deposit interest that was paid or credited to an account on or after 1 January 2012.  Similarly, the increase in the standard DIRT rate from 30% to 33% and in the higher DIRT rates from 33% to 36%, which was announced in December 2012, applied to deposit interest that was paid or credited to an account on or after 1 January 2013.</p><p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the rate of DIRT that is applicable to a payment or crediting of deposit interest is the rate in operation on the date the deposit interest is paid or credited to the account, irrespective of the fact that part of that interest may have accrued before the date the rate was changed.  This means there is no apportionment of the interest between the amount accrued before the date of the rate change and the amount due after that date.

The introduction of a value based property tax is part of our obligation under the EU/IMF programme. Actions for the ninth Troika review, which was to be completed by the end of the 2012, included the introduction of a value based property tax for 2013.</p><p>  These measures are deemed necessary in order to reduce further the deficit in the public finances and so as to ensure continued adherence to fiscal targets set as part of the EU/IMF Programme. While the Government has some scope within the Programme to use alternative methods to achieve Programme targets, the yield anticipated from the Local Property Tax could only have been achieved by other measures which would have significantly reduced overall expenditure on vital public services or increased taxation on incomes and spending.  This Government did not want to add to the already necessary cuts in public expenditure or to place additional costs on job creation.</p><p>  It should be noted that the arguments in favour of a property tax go beyond our obligations under the EU/IMF programme.  The introduction of a property tax is part of a broader approach to the taxation of property. The aim is to replace some of the revenue from transaction based taxes, which have proven to be an unstable source of Government revenue, with an annual recurring property tax, which international experience has shown to be a stable source of funding.</p><p>  The taxation of property through a recurring annual tax is less economically distortionary than the imposition of tax on either income or capital. This is supported by economic literature and recent OECD analysis. The OECD has highlighted that annual taxes on land and buildings have a relatively small adverse impact on economic performance.</p><p>  As the Deputy is aware the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended by the Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act 2013) was enacted into law, following its signature by the President on 26 December 2012 with the first liability date being the 1 May 2013.  As I have previously outlined to this House, in designing the local property tax the Inter-Departmental Expert Group chaired by Dr Don Thornhill (the &#8220;Thornhill Group&#8221;) had due regard to issues such as ability to pay and considered the provision of waivers or deferrals for households unable to pay the tax or where a payment requirement would cause hardship.  For individuals on low incomes, the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 provides for the possibility of deferring the charge to LPT in certain cases.  To qualify for a deferral, the residential property must be occupied as a sole or main residence.  The income thresholds for a full deferral will be &#8364;15,000 for a single person and &#8364;25,000 for a couple, whether married persons, civil partners or cohabitants.  A person may claim a deferral if their income will not, &#8220;as can reasonably be foreseen at the liability date&#8221; exceed these thresholds in that year.</p><p>  An increased income threshold applies in the case of properties occupied as a sole or main residence and subject to a mortgage.  In such cases, the gross income thresholds may be increased by 80% of the mortgage interest payments.  A deferral option in qualifying cases in this regard will apply until the end of 2017 and will assist individuals currently in mortgage distress.</p><p>  A deferral of up to 50% of the LPT liability will be possible where the gross income of the liable person does not exceed &#8364;25,000 for a single person or &#8364;35,000 for married persons/civil partners/cohabitants.  A deferral of 50% of the LPT will also be available where gross income does not exceed the above thresholds (&#8364;25,000 single, &#8364;35,000 couple) as increased by 80% of the gross mortgage interest payments that a liable person expects to make by the end of the year for which the gross income is being estimated. This type of deferral will also be available until 31 December 2017.</p><p>  Where a liable person no longer satisfies the necessary conditions, amounts deferred prior to the date on which eligibility ceased may continue to be deferred.  Interest of c. 4% per annum will apply to any amounts deferred. The deferred amount, including interest, will attach to the property and will have to be paid before the property is sold or transferred.</p><p>  The thresholds were based on the recommendations of the Thornhill Group. The Government accepted the income thresholds for a full deferral and adapted the income thresholds for a partial deferral so that they are &#8364;10,000 rather than &#8364;5,000 above the thresholds for a full deferral.  To determine whether deferral applies for 2013, a person is required to estimate on 1 May 2013 what his or her total gross income for 2013 will be. Gross income from all sources consists of total income before any deductions, allowances or reliefs that may be taken off for income tax purposes and includes income that is exempt from income tax and income from the Department of Social Protection but excludes Child Benefit.</p><p>  I appreciate that some property owners may find themselves unable to pay Local Property Tax but do not qualify for a deferral under the existing legislation.  For this reason, the Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act 2013 provides that a person who has entered into an insolvency arrangement under the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 may apply for deferral of the LPT that is due during the period for which the insolvency arrangement is in effect.  The 2013 Act also provides that a person who suffers both an unexpected and unavoidable significant financial loss or expense, as a result of which he or she is unable to pay their LPT without causing financial hardship, may apply for full or partial deferral.  Claims for this type of deferral will require full disclosure of the person&#8217;s financial circumstances, supporting documentation and any other information required by Revenue and following an examination of the information provided, Revenue will determine whether deferral should be granted.  The detail of how this type of deferral will operate and the criteria that will be used to determine eligibility will be set out in guidelines due to be published by the Revenue Commissioners shortly.</p><p>  Details of the deferral arrangements are available on Revenue&#8217;s website <i><font color="#0000FF">www.revenue.ie</font></i>, where the Commissioners have recently published a useful Guide to Local Property Tax.</p></reply>

The remit of these independent monitors is to ensure that financial information provided by debtors is consistent with the underlying books and records, particularly in terms of accounting for all rents receivable by the debtor from property held as security by NAMA and for the proper application of all approved expenses, working capital and capital expenditure and to evaluate and report to NAMA on the achievement of milestones agreed as part of the debtor&rsquo;s commitment to repay amounts due to NAMA and in turn the taxpayer.  These appointments are made by the debtors subject to NAMA&rsquo;s satisfaction with the appointees and the debtor&rsquo;s selection process, the level of proposed fees and the completion of a duty of care agreement with NAMA.</p><p>  In a very limited number of cases, NAMA has also recommended  and the debtor has agreed to the appointment of additional directors as a measure to enhance corporate governance.  In such cases, NAMA may endorse a proposed board appointee by a debtor but the responsibilities of that appointee are as determined by company law.</p><p>  NAMA is prohibited under Sections 99 and 202 of the NAMA Act from disclosing confidential information, which is specifically defined to include information relating to its debtors.  Accordingly, the provision of information sought on debtor companies to which monitors and directors have been appointed by debtors would be in contravention of the NAMA Act. </p></reply>

Section 7 of the 2012 Act provides that local authorities will be liable to pay the LPT on their properties in the same way as any other residential property owner, unless the properties in question are used to accommodate people with special housing needs such as the elderly or people with disabilities.  A key aspect of the work undertaken by Revenue was the development of a comprehensive Register of residential properties in the State.  The Register was developed using data drawn from a range of sources including Revenue&rsquo;s own databases, the Local Government Management Agency database and data from utility companies.  Data from the various sources has been cross-checked to ensure that the Register is as accurate as possible.  The Register is being used to issue correspondence to property owners and work is still in progress to refine it.</p><p>  I am advised that in developing the Register, Revenue collaborated with all local authorities and social housing bodies to establish details of properties owned by these organisations in order that they could be excluded, in the first instance, from the general issue of returns, so as to ensure that tenants of local authority properties did not receive an LPT return.  While every effort has been made to match local authority owned properties with the LPT Register, in a certain number of cases, that matching process has not been successful and some tenants of these properties will inadvertently receive the Return from Revenue. </p><p>  I am further advised that this particular possibility is covered extensively in the letter and the information booklet that accompanies the LPT Return. The correspondence advises anyone who receives an LPT Return from Revenue, but who is not the liable person in respect of a property, what steps they should take.  It is important that they should not ignore the Return.  </p><p>  This means that a tenant who receives a Return in error should advise Revenue that they are local authority tenants and this will allow Revenue to match the details to the local authority data and correct the LPT Register. I am advised by Revenue that local authority tenants who are receiving LPT Returns in error are advising the Revenue Commissioners, who are updating the Register accordingly. </p><p>  I can confirm to the Deputy that in the circumstances outlined, the tenant is not liable to pay the LPT in these cases and that the local authority in question is the liable person.  I can also confirm that Revenue has corrected the LPT Register in this case on the basis of the information supplied by the Deputy.  It is essential, in any other similar cases, that local authority tenants contact Revenue to ensure the Register is corrected.</p></reply>

For the year 2013, the liability date is 1 May 2013, and for the year 2014 the liability date is 1 November 2013.  This means that the owner of a residential property on 1 May 2013, is liable for LPT on that property for 2013 and, the owner of the property on 1 November 2013 is liable for the 2014 LPT charge.  Therefore Deputy, in relation to the specific circumstances posed by you in your question, a liable person who sells his or her residential property between 1 November 2013 and 31 December 2013, provided that they owned the property on 1 November 2013, will be liable to pay LPT on that property for 2014.

One payment option allows persons to pay the LPT by cash through one of the three approved payment service providers, which are An Post TaxPay, Payzone and Omnivend. I am further advised by the Commissioners that, although the LPT Return only provides the option to pay LPT by cash in weekly or monthly instalments through the payment service providers, customers are free to choose whether to make their cash payments in one lump sum or spread their payments in equal instalments between July and December 2013.  Accordingly, liable persons wishing to pay their LPT liability in cash, should choose the weekly or monthly option on the LPT Return, even where they intend to make one lump sum payment in cash.</p><p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that in cases where a liable person wishes to pay their LPT in full using cash, all payment service providers have been informed to accept the lump sum payment.

The SIF will seek matching commercial investment from the private sector in order to maximise the resources of the NPRF.  The immediate priority for the Government is to put NewERA on a statutory footing and reorient the NPRF into a Strategic Investment Fund which will make strategic investments to support economic activity and employment in Ireland.  Officials of my Department are liaising with the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA), in preparing the necessary Heads of Bill to achieve this objective.  I expect to bring these proposals to Government shortly.</p><p>  The NPRF continues to work on assembling and developing a pipeline of additional commercial opportunities for the Strategic Investment Fund, which is taking place in parallel with the legislative amendment process.

The NPRF has committed to invest in infrastructure (&euro;250 million), PPP projects (&euro;118 million) and finance for the SME sector (&euro;500 million) and has entered into a collaborative relationship with Silicon Valley Bank.

In the case of adaptations to a property, the exemption will only apply where the cost of the adaptations exceeds 25% of the market value of the property before it is adapted.  The exemption ends if the property is sold and the incapacitated individual no longer occupies it as his or her sole or main residence.</p><p>  Section 15A of the 2012 Act (as amended) provides for a reduction in the market value of a residential property that has been adapted for occupation by a disabled person where the adaptation has been grant-aided by a local authority.

The reduction in value is limited to the lesser of the chargeable value attributable to the adaptation work carried out on the property and the maximum grant payable under the relevant local authority scheme.</p><p>  The relief is dependent on local authority grant aid being paid under S.I. 607 of 2001 or S.I. 670 of 2007.

SNAs are allocated to schools in order to provide for the care needs of children with special educational needs attending such schools.  The policy of my Department in relation to the SNA scheme is set out in Circular 07/02, which also provides details regarding the role and duties of an SNA.</p><p>  The NCSE operates within my Department's established criteria for the allocation of Special Education supports and the staffing resources available to my Department.  I wish to advise the Deputy that SNAs are not allocated to individual pupils.  The NCSE allocates a quantum of SNA support for each school annually taking into account the care needs of all of the qualifying children enrolled in the school, and on the basis of the assessed care needs of the children.  It is a matter for schools to then allocate and manage these resources to assist children as their needs arise.</p><p>  It is expected that, for many pupils, as they mature and develop, their care needs will also correspondingly diminish.  Therefore not all pupils who have had access to SNA support in primary school will continue to need support in post primary school.  However, students who have continuing care needs in secondary school may qualify for access for SNA support.  Any such applications for support will be considered by the NCSE.  The NCSE has asked all schools to forward applications for SNA for the 2013/14 school year to the NCSE by 15th March, 2013 and schools will be advised of their new allocations in advance of the coming school year.</p></reply>

A total of 10 proposals were received.  These proposals were examined by an independent selection panel against the evaluation criteria which were an integral part of the Expression of Interest procedure. </p><p>  On the basis of the review carried out by the panel at the initial stage of the process, four proposals were short-listed for oral presentation. Following oral presentation these proposals were assigned a ranking depending on their relative strengths under each of the evaluation criteria leading to the preferred proposal.</p><p>  The selection panel evaluated the proposals under each of the following criteria:</p><p>- Organisational capacity to perform the function</p><p>- Experience in dealing with comparable schemes/services</p><p>- Existing core management, expertise and resources available to be deployed to the function.</p><p>- Capacity to deliver strong cost and efficiency benefits</p><p>- Overall quality of the proposal for delivery of a central student grants function.</p><p>  Following this process, the selection panel made a recommendation to the Minister for Education and Skills on the preferred proposal which was the City of Dublin VEC proposal to establish Student Universal Support Ireland (SUSI) as a unit of that VEC.  While indicative delivery costs were provided by each of the bodies, they were not as such tender prices, as this was an expression of interest process. These indicative costs were considered under the evaluation criteria which examined the capacity of the bodies to deliver strong cost and efficiency benefits. Each of the short - listed proposals was marked under all of the evaluation criteria heading. An external review of Student Universal Support Ireland's business processes is currently being undertaken to inform improvements in the system for the 2013/14 academic year. The proposed timeline for completion of the review is the end of this month.</p></reply>

The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September. The allocation process for the 2013/14 school year is currently underway in my Department and the staffing arrangements, including the appeals process, for primary schools have been published on the Department website. The final staffing position for all schools will not be known until later in the year when the allocation process will be fully completed and all appeals to the Staffing Appeals Board will have been considered.</p><p>  As part of the Budget 2012 decisions, the number of pupils required to gain and retain a classroom teaching post in small primary schools is being gradually increased between September 2012 and September 2014. During this period the pupil threshold for a 2-classroom school is being increased to 20 pupils. In these extremely challenging times, all public servants are being asked to deliver our public services on a reduced level of resources and teachers in small schools cannot be immune from this requirement. The phasing of these measures can provide the schools concerned with time to consider the potential for amalgamation with other schools where this is feasible. If amalgamations do take place, they will be voluntary and follow decisions taken by local communities and not by the Department.</p><p>  The Government recognises that small schools are an important part of the social fabric of rural communities and my Department has expanded the existing appeals process so that it is accessible to the small schools that are affected by the budget measure. In this regard small schools will not lose their classroom post if they are projecting sustainable increased enrolments in September 2013 that would be sufficient to allow them to retain their existing classroom posts over the longer term.</p><p>  The detailed arrangements in relation to the appeals process are set in the Department's Staffing Circular 0013/2013. The Appeals Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.</p></reply>

In order to facilitate the required 5% reduction in 2012, it is necessary to complete a review of allowances and premium payments early this year.  To this end, this Department is providing the requisite information on allowances to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and it is understood that it is intended to complete the review by the end of February 2012.</p><p>  Allowances payable to Teachers, Principals and Deputy Principals</p><p>  3. Pending the outcome of the review by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, allowances are not payable to new beneficiaries; ie those who became eligible for receipt of the allowance in question on or after 1 February 2012.

Importantly, the new licence is being designed to align interests between the new<font color="#000080"> </font>operator and the State with the objective of maximising contributions to be paid to good causes over the life of the next licence.  </p><p>  Therefore it is intended that good causes contributions under the new licence will be linked to a percentage of Gross Gaming Revenues (Sales less Prizes) over the period of the new licence. This will offer the new licensee greater flexibility and scope for the growth and development of lottery games and distribution channels. Growth in Good Cause Revenues will ensure contributions to Good Causes are maximised over the period of the new licence. </p><p>  Our aim is to maximise the annual payment to Good Causes over the period of the new licence.  This will be determined prior to the launch of the licence competition when a number of other matters in relation to the licence structure and licence competition have been determined.

In addition, Departments have been asked to identify other allowances, including legacy allowances, for elimination from current beneficiaries.  Departments are now directly engaging with staff representatives on the allowances specific to their areas.  In cases where no agreement can be reached, the timebound mechanism for dispute resolution through in the existing industrial relations systems by the Public Sector Agreement 2010-2014, is available. </p><p>  The Labour Relations Commission proposals in relation to the new Public Service Agreement contain a provision that there will be full co-operation from all parties with the follow-up measures to be undertaken by sectoral management related to the Review of Allowances.</p></reply>

Should the person be selected, the rate of payment will be calculated on the basis of their existing rate of social welfare payment plus &euro;20 per week.  The basis of calculation differs from the position prior to the 17th  September 2012 under which the rate of RSS payment was calculated on the basis of a personal payment of &euro;188 per week, adjusted for dependant circumstances and with &euro;20 per week added.  The methodology now in place means that pay is not now calculated on the basis of a personal payment but on the basis of the value of the social welfare payment prior to joining the scheme, as with community employment and T&uacute;s.  According to information held by my department, the person referred to is currently in receipt of a jobseeker's payment of &euro;220.90 per week, including provision for dependants.

The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer. There are currently approximately 87,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided &euro;403 million for 2013.</p><p>  Under the legislative provisions governing rent supplement, the Department&rsquo;s relationship is with the tenant; the tenant makes the application for rent supplement and payment is made to the tenant. Rent supplement is specifically for the benefit of tenants to assist them with their accommodation needs. There is no direct relationship between the landlord and the Department in the administration of the scheme. However, Social Welfare legislation provides for the payment of a rent supplement payment to a nominated payee such a landlord on behalf of the tenant.  This arrangement is entered at the tenant&rsquo;s request and subject to the consent of the Department. The department official dealing with the request will take into account all the relevant circumstances of the particular case and the tenant&rsquo;s preference will be accommodated where possible. </p><p>  Within the timeframe available, I have not been able to ascertain whether any Court decisions have imposed a civil liability on this Department for loss or damage arising from tenancy contracts as a result of rent supplement issues or whether any associated legal advice has been received.  The Department will advise the Deputy further on the matter in due course.  </p><p>  It is open to the landlord to bring to the attention of the Department any instance where they suspect that a tenant is receiving rent supplement and is not paying their rent. Where the Department becomes aware that a person is not using rent supplement to meet the accommodation costs, payment of the supplement is suspended and the matter investigated. Where a landlord has a grievance in relation to the non-payment of rent by a tenant, s/he may apply to the Private Residential Tenancies Board to have the dispute resolved through the Board&rsquo;s dispute resolution process. </p><p>  The Department&rsquo;s circulars regarding rent supplement do not place any legal obligation in relation to decisions on the payment of rent supplement but are designed to provide guidance to departmental staff in the exercise of their powers having regard to the requirements of the legislation.</p></reply>

Non-Irish citizens made up 18% of the total persons at work, according to the Census in 2011.</p><p>   The Government&rsquo;s primary strategy with regard to tackling the numbers on the live register, regardless of nationality, is to create the environment for a strong economic recovery by promoting competitiveness and productivity. Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth.  </p><p>  While the main approach of Government is the alleviation of long-term unemployment through the Pathways to Work initiative (the details of which have been set out in response to previous parliamentary questions), EURES Ireland also takes an active role in the support and integration of immigrant workers and helps create relevant networks to address any labour market related issues facing non-Irish job-seekers in Ireland.  For instance, the DIALOG platform hosted an event in Dublin in February for Polish job-seekers.</p><p>  It should also be noted that freedom of movement is one of the fundamental rights of the EU and benefits Irish workers as well as foreign-nationals. Also, from the perspective of benefit entitlement, the majority of foreign nationals on the Live Register would have contributed to tax and social insurance systems here.</p></reply>

As the Deputy can appreciate, however, the scope for funding for the conservation of the built heritage is currently constrained by the significant reduction in the public finances.  Shortly, I will announce details of the 2013 <i>Structures at Risk Fund</i>, which has been set up to assist with urgent works to safeguard structures, in private and civic ownership, protected under the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, and in certain cases, works to structures within Architectural Conservation Areas. Such structures include private houses, follies and places of worship. Typical works funded include roof repairs, structural consolidation and measures to halt water ingress. This scheme, which is administered by the local authorities on behalf of my Department, has been in operation since 2011. It has encouraged regeneration and reuse of heritage properties, and helped to secure the preservation of protected structures which may otherwise have been lost. Since 2011, over 70 structures have been funded under this scheme. </p><p>  The Heritage Council, which my Department funds, administers a number of heritage grants schemes. It is a matter for the Heritage Council to allocate its funding appropriately, given competing priorities within the heritage sector. In addition, the Heritage Council, in partnership with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, also administers a grants scheme to REPS 4 participants on the conservation and repair of traditional farm buildings, known as the Traditional Farm Buildings Grant Scheme. I am advised that grants are available under this scheme to carry out approved conservation works to the exterior of farm outbuildings, including roofs.  I am also advised that the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government administers a grant scheme for the renewal or repair of thatched roofs of owner occupied houses.</p></reply>

These provisions are not geographically specific and apply to all areas in the State.  The purpose of these provisions is to protect bird life during the nesting season, to prevent forest fires, and to protect vegetation and wildlife habitats during the months of growth and reproduction.  I have no current plans to extend the period for hedge cutting.</p><p>  While hedgerows and scrub are important as wildlife habitats, they need to be managed in the interests of both farming and biodiversity.   Accordingly, I included a commitment in the National Biodiversity Plan 2011-2016 to review the overall policy in this area.  The commitment is to review, in co-operation with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, both hedgerow and scrub regulation with a view to producing guidelines to encourage best practice for hedgerow and scrub management for wildlife. As part of that review, the potential for setting the relevant dates by statutory instrument, rather than in primary legislation, as is the position currently, will be examined.</p></reply>

The total cost of all applicable fees for the bodies funded by my Department's Vote Group for the most recent full year for which figures are available - 2012 - is approximately &euro;468,000.</p><p>  I am working to reduce this figure and, in this context, have taken a number of actions including the introduction of a significant reform to end the payment of fees for all organisations under the aegis of my Department which were comprehended by the Government's Public Service Reform Plan. Arising from the Government decision of October 31st last, fees for membership of boards, committees and advisory councils at these organisations - where they previously applied - will not apply in the future and members will serve pro bono. Whilst legislative change will be required to implement this decision in a number of cases, I have written to all organisations to ask them to implement this decision on an administrative basis pending statutory implementation.  In addition, from January 2013 there has also been a reduction of 100% in fees for membership of the Irish Film Board.</p><p>  The Deputy should note that the figure above does not include the cost of fees applicable to board members in two bodies, Foras na Gaeilge and the Ulster Scots Agency, operating under the aegis of the North South Ministerial Council where the total cost of funding the bodies is shared with the Northern Ireland Executive. In the case of Foras na Gaeilge, 75% is paid by the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and 25% is paid by the Department of Culture Arts and Leisure in Northern Ireland.  In the case of the Ulster-Scots Agency, 25% is paid by the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and 75% is paid by the Department of Culture Arts and Leisure in Northern Ireland.</p><p>An exemption from the local property tax applies to those unfinished housing developments listed in the schedule to the Finance (Local Property Tax) Regulations 2013. There is no general exemption for estates that have not been taken in charge. </p><p>  Section 180 of the Planning and Development Act, 2000 applies to estates which have been granted planning permission and includes the construction of two or more houses (which as defined in the Act includes apartments) and the provision of new roads, open spaces, car parks, sewers, watermains or drains.In relation to estates which have been completed to the satisfaction of the planning authority in accordance with the permission, section 180 provides that the planning authority must if requested to do so by the developer or by the majority of the qualified electors who are owners of the houses involved, initiate the procedures in section 11 of the Roads Act 1993 for declaring the road(s) to be public roads, for whose maintenance the local authority will then be responsible.</p><p>  Section 11 of the Roads Act empowers a local authority to, by order, declare any road over which a public right of way exists to be a public road. Before making an order the local authority must be satisfied the road is of general public utility, consider the financial implications of taking the road in charge and consult with the public/consider any objections received. The consideration of the objections and the making of the order declaring the road to be a public road is a reserved function, so that the decision whether to take the road in charge is ultimately one for the discretion of the elected members.</p><p>  In relation to estates which have not been completed to the satisfaction of the planning authority and enforcement proceedings have not been commenced within the relevant period section 180 also provides that the planning authority must, if requested to do so by the majority of the owners, initiate the procedures in section 11 of the Roads Act. However, in this case the section provides that the provision in section 11 of the Roads Act requiring the authority to consider the financial implications of taking the road in charge is to be disregarded.</p><p>  Section 180 also provides that where a planning authority, in complying with section 180, makes an order under section 11 of the Roads Act, it must also take in charge any open spaces, car parks, sewers, watermains, or drains within the attendant grounds of the development.</p><p>  Section 180 was amended in the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2010 to provide that a planning authority <i>may</i> take in charge an unfinished estate, at the request of the owners of the housing units, <i>at any time</i> after the expiration of the planning permission, in situations where enforcement actions have commenced or where the planning authority consider that enforcement action will not result in the satisfactory completion of the estate by the developer. Planning authorities have also been empowered to take in charge part of an estate or some, but not all, of the facilities in an estate.</p></reply>

In 2013, the Arts Council will receive an allocation from my Department of some &euro;60.7 million in current, capital and EU Presidency funding.  I am very well aware of the important role played by the organisation to which the Deputies refer in promoting a varied arts and culture programme.  Under the Arts Act 2003, however, the provision of funding is a matter in the sole remit of the Arts Council and I am precluded by statute from intervening in the Council's decisions on funding.  There are, of course, other sources of funding and, in the case of venues, many arts organisations throughout the State receive funding for the administration and maintenance of their venues from their local authorities.</p><p>  If the organisation in question were to seek to increase its programming expenditure, it could consider applying for funding under my Department's Philanthropy Initiative on condition that it is prepared to raise matching private sector funding.  This initiative is designed to encourage philanthropic sponsorship and endowment funding of the arts from private sources and to maximise investment in the arts by unlocking many multiples of the funding put up by the taxpayer.  It also provides an incentive to arts organisations to proactively seek new and multi-annual relationships with sponsors which deliver private sector financial support, thereby increasing overall funding available to the arts.  Details in this regard are available on my Department's website at www.ahg.gov.ie and at the following link: .  The application form is available at: </p><p>.</p></reply>

The scheme provides financial assistance to households who wish to improve the energy performance of their homes.  Fixed grants are allocated towards the cost of a range of measures including attic insulation, wall insulation, heating systems upgrades, solar thermal panels and accompanying Building Energy Rating (BER) assessment.</p><p>Exchequer funding of &euro;18million has been allocated to the Scheme for 2013.  It is anticipated that this funding will support the delivery of energy efficiency measures to approximately 15,800 homes in 2013.  Since commencement in March 2009 the scheme has disbursed over &euro;150m in grants and supported the installation of over 355,000 such measures in 139,000 homes.  Over the past 4 years the scheme has undergone a number of reviews including the most recent in December 2011 where some of the grant amounts were reduced in line with falling market prices.</p><p>The following table is a summary of the number of measures applied for by year.</p><p><table><tr><th><b>Measure</b></th><th><div><b>2009</b></div></th><th><div><b>2010</b></div></th><th><div><b>2011</b></div></th><th><div><b>2012</b></div></th></tr><tr><td>Cavity</td><td><div>25,812</div></td><td><div>49,580</div></td><td><div>36,750</div></td><td><div>12,813</div></td></tr><tr><td>Dry-Lining Insulation</td><td><div>5,275</div></td><td><div>6,233</div></td><td><div>4,921</div></td><td><div>1,558</div></td></tr><tr><td>External Insulation</td><td><div>1,737</div></td><td><div>3,372</div></td><td><div>7,162</div></td><td><div>2,925</div></td></tr><tr><td>Heating Controls Upgrade only</td><td><div>3,854</div></td><td><div>5,051</div></td><td><div>3,195</div></td><td><div>1,138</div></td></tr><tr><td>High Efficiency Gas Boiler with Heating Controls Upgrade</td><td><div>7,382</div></td><td><div>10,472</div></td><td><div>7,647</div></td><td><div>3,802</div></td></tr><tr><td>High Efficiency Oil Boiler with Heating Controls Upgrade</td><td><div>9,332</div></td><td><div>10,713</div></td><td><div>6,124</div></td><td><div>2,127</div></td></tr><tr><td>Roof Insulation</td><td><div>32,410</div></td><td><div>57,858</div></td><td><div>44,127</div></td><td><div>15,466</div></td></tr><tr><td>Solar Heating</td><td></td><td></td><td><div>3,786</div></td><td><div>3,189</div></td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td><div>85,802</div></td><td><div>143,279</div></td><td><div>113,712</div></td><td><div>43,018</div></td></tr></table></p><p>The table indicates that there has been a similar level of reduced uptake across all measures and not just those measures that have been adjusted in line with falling market prices.  While it is difficult to ascertain with any certainty the reasons for falling applications a number of contributory factors include economic constraints for householders and recent milder winters.  Additionally, the majority of interested homeowners may by now have already participated in the scheme.  The SEAI is working on a number of measures to increase traffic to the scheme, including customer surveys and marketing initiatives.</p><p>In relation to the post 2013 position, the Programme for Government includes a commitment to roll out a Better Energy: Financing (Pay-As-You-Save) energy retrofit scheme for domestic buildings after 2013.  This would see the current suite of Exchequer funded grants for energy efficiency measures, excluding the low-income housing retrofit programme, replaced by a comprehensive national energy efficiency scheme that would be open to households.  This scheme would allow consumers to secure upfront financing for energy efficiency upgrades, the repayment of which would be funded from savings on their energy bill generated from the retrofit.  It is anticipated that by providing up front financing under the new Better Energy: Financing model that this would stimulate further activity in the energy retrofit industry after 2013 and in the subsequent years.</p></reply>

I have no statutory function in the setting of electricity supply contracts in the business or domestic sectors.</p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s electricity and gas markets, both wholesale and retail, are characterised by vigorous competition and are regulated by the CER.  The setting of supply contracts is a day to day operational matter for electricity supply companies.  Such contracts are governed by the CER&rsquo;s guidelines for suppliers&rsquo; Codes of Practice, Customer Charter and Terms and Conditions of Supply for Household Customers.</p><p>  Energy suppliers have always had requirements regarding the provision of deposits in advance but, due to the general economic situation, it is possible that suppliers are strictly applying these requirements as standard, whereas in the past they may have waived them.  I understand from the CER that one of the main reasons that electricity and gas suppliers require deposits is that their customers consume the energy supplied in advance and pay in arrears.  Therefore suppliers must always meet the cost of providing the energy in advance of payment and consequently they run the risk of non-payment from their customers.  This is in contrast to suppliers of other energy products, such as heating oil or Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG), as customers are required by the suppliers to pay for these products in advance.</p></reply>

However, in this case the section provides that the provision in section 11 of the Roads Act requiring the authority to consider the financial implications of taking the road in charge is to be disregarded.</p><p>  Section 180 also provides that where a planning authority, in complying with section 180, makes an order under section 11 of the Roads Act, it must also take in charge any open spaces, car parks, sewers, watermains, or drains within the attendant grounds of the development.</p><p>  Section 180 was amended in the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2010 to provide that a planning authority <i>may</i> take in charge an unfinished estate, at the request of the owners of the housing units, <i>at any time</i> after the expiration of the planning permission, in situations where enforcement actions have commenced or where the planning authority consider that enforcement action will not result in the satisfactory completion of the estate by the developer.

The Local Government (Household Charge) Act 2011 provides that income from the household charge is paid into the Local Government Fund. </p><p>  Under section 157 of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012, commencing in 2014, the Minister for Finance will pay into the Local Government Fund an amount equivalent to the Local Property Tax paid into the Central Fund during that year. The Government has recently accepted, in principle, a policy position that from 2014 80% of all Local Property Tax receipts should be retained within the local authority area where the Tax is raised. The remaining 20% of the Tax collected nationally will be re-distributed on an equalised basis to local authorities within the context of the annual allocations of General Purpose Grants.   </p><p>  I expect the Local Property Tax to have multiple benefits, including, a more sustainable and resilient system of funding for local authorities and therefore a sounder financial footing for the provision of essential local services; greater local scope for financial decision making concerning service provision - in particular, the inclusion of the local variation mechanism from 2015 will further increase the autonomy of local authorities; and, a strengthening of democracy at local level and a more active relationship between local authorities and local electorates. A stronger democratic relationship and clearer lines of accountability can only have a beneficial impact on service provision from the perspective of the service user.</p></reply>

From 01 January 2013, CO 2 Band A has been broken into four separate bands and the B band has been split into two for both motor tax and VRT.  For motor tax only, a new zero band has been introduced for electric vehicles with a lower annual tax of &euro;120 applying.</p><p>The revised banding recognises that ever more fuel efficient cars are becoming available and allows for the differentiation of the environmental incentive in favour of the most environmentally friendly vehicles.  It is expected there will be an increase in the coming years in the number of vehicles falling into the lower emitting A bands as vehicle technology continues to evolve &ndash; in Band A registrations for 2009, the first full year of the new CO 2 based system, comprise 14.8% of the total CO 2   fleet.

There is no general exemption for estates that have not been taken in charge. </p><p>  Section 180 of the Planning and Development Act, 2000 applies to estates which have been granted planning permission and includes the construction of two or more houses (which as defined in the Act includes apartments) and the provision of new roads, open spaces, car parks, sewers, watermains or drains.In relation to estates which have been completed to the satisfaction of the planning authority in accordance with the permission, section 180 provides that the planning authority must if requested to do so by the developer or by the majority of the qualified electors who are owners of the houses involved, initiate the procedures in section 11 of the Roads Act 1993 for declaring the road(s) to be public roads, for whose maintenance the local authority will then be responsible.</p><p>  Section 11 of the Roads Act empowers a local authority to, by order, declare any road over which a public right of way exists to be a public road. Before making an order the local authority must be satisfied the road is of general public utility, consider the financial implications of taking the road in charge and consult with the public/consider any objections received. The consideration of the objections and the making of the order declaring the road to be a public road is a reserved function, so that the decision whether to take the road in charge is ultimately one for the discretion of the elected members.</p><p>  In relation to estates which have not been completed to the satisfaction of the planning authority and enforcement proceedings have not been commenced within the relevant period section 180 also provides that the planning authority must, if requested to do so by the majority of the owners, initiate the procedures in section 11 of the Roads Act. However, in this case the section provides that the provision in section 11 of the Roads Act requiring the authority to consider the financial implications of taking the road in charge is to be disregarded.</p><p>  Section 180 also provides that where a planning authority, in complying with section 180, makes an order under section 11 of the Roads Act, it must also take in charge any open spaces, car parks, sewers, watermains, or drains within the attendant grounds of the development.</p><p>  Section 180 was amended in the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2010 to provide that a planning authority <i>may</i> take in charge an unfinished estate, at the request of the owners of the housing units, <i>at any time</i> after the expiration of the planning permission, in situations where enforcement actions have commenced or where the planning authority consider that enforcement action will not result in the satisfactory completion of the estate by the developer. Planning authorities have also been empowered to take in charge part of an estate or some, but not all, of the facilities in an estate.</p></reply>

The prisoner had previously been granted an escorted visit, again accompanied by an Acting Chief Officer and a Chaplain, to view the remains of their parent, in private, away from the public and other family members at the funeral home. The prisoner did not attend the funeral mass or burial. It should also be noted that the escort only took a few hours and was on condition that the staff resources were available to carry out same.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that it is open to all prisoners to apply for compassionate temporary release or for escorted visits, in the company of prison staff, for significant family occurrences such as funerals, communions or confirmations etc. All requests for temporary release or escorted outings are considered on a case by case basis and subject to appropriate security considerations.</p><p>  Prisoners may be approved escorted visits on compassionate/humanitarian grounds to the graveside of a close family member in the event of a bereavement at a later stage if they are not permitted to attend the funeral. A number of criteria is considered prior to granting the applications including the prisoners remission date, behaviour in prison and engagement with the therapeutic services within the prison. The safety of the public and any possible victim issues are also taken into account.</p><p>  In this case the prisoner is due for release early next year and their behaviour and engagement with services, in particular the Psychology Service is very good. Their was no risk to the public and the local Garda&iacute; were informed prior to the escort taking place.</p><p>  The need to escort prisoners outside prisons arises routinely in a number of contexts and prison staff are assigned to carry out these duties as part of their day to day work. Therefore, I can advise the Deputy that no additional expenditure would have been incurred as a result of this escort. </p></reply>

I refer, in particular, to the  cross border task forces in place to specifically target the distribution of illegal fuels and tobacco products.</p><p>  These task forces comprise representatives from the PSNI, HM Revenue Customs, Serious Organised Crime Agency (UK), the Revenue Commissioners, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Criminal Assets Bureau and have had considerable successes in tackling this form of criminality.</p><p>  With regard to the question of further legislative proposals, the Deputy will appreciate that primary legislation concerning revenue offences does not fall under the remit of my Department. Having said that, I can inform the Deputy that in the context of reviewing the overall legislative response in place to tackle organised crime, my Department is currently undertaking a specific review of the provisions of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009 to see if its provisions can be strengthened and the views of the Garda Commissioner have been sought in this regard<b>.</b></p><p>  Finally, while I note that the Report calls for the establishment of an interdepartmental group, under the auspices of the Department of an Taoiseach, to deal with fraud affecting the retail trade, I am satisfied that the existing structures for achieving multi-agency co-operation represent the most effective approach.</p></reply>

That earlier categorisation related largely to the level of on-site activity at the time the 2011 survey was carried out and had less to do with the physical character of a development.

That earlier categorisation related largely to the level of on-site activity at the time the 2011 survey was carried out and had less to do with the physical character of a development. The 2012 survey was based purely and objectively on the actual state of completion of a development. Only developments that were deemed by local authorities to be in a &ldquo;seriously problematic condition&rdquo;, regardless of whether a developer was on or off site, were included.</p><p>  For purposes of preparing the final list of developments to which the exemption from the local property tax would apply local authorities were asked by my Department to confirm or update the then existing list as appropriate.</p><p><b><font color="#000080"> </font></b>I can advise the Deputy that the prisoner referred to was afforded an escorted visit, in the company of an Acting Chief Officer and a prison Chaplain, to a family grave on the 21 March 2013. The prisoner had previously been granted an escorted visit, again accompanied by an Acting Chief Officer and a Chaplain, to view the remains of their parent, in private, away from the public and other family members at the funeral home. The prisoner did not attend the funeral mass or burial. It should also be noted that the escort only took a few hours and was on condition that the staff resources were available to carry out same.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that it is open to all prisoners to apply for compassionate temporary release or for escorted visits, in the company of prison staff, for significant family occurrences such as funerals, communions or confirmations etc. All requests for temporary release or escorted outings are considered on a case by case basis and subject to appropriate security considerations.</p><p>  Prisoners may be approved escorted visits on compassionate/humanitarian grounds to the graveside of a close family member in the event of a bereavement at a later stage if they are not permitted to attend the funeral. A number of criteria is considered prior to granting the applications including the prisoners remission date, behaviour in prison and engagement with the therapeutic services within the prison. The safety of the public and any possible victim issues are also taken into account.</p><p>  In this case the prisoner is due for release early next year and their behaviour and engagement with services, in particular the Psychology Service is very good. Their was no risk to the public and the local Garda&iacute; were informed prior to the escort taking place.</p><p>  The need to escort prisoners outside prisons arises routinely in a number of contexts and prison staff are assigned to carry out these duties as part of their day to day work. Therefore, I can advise the Deputy that no additional expenditure would have been incurred as a result of this escort. </p></reply>

Its function is to provide accommodation and ancillary services to those who have sought international protection and who otherwise have no means of supporting themselves.</p><p>  In relation to the information provided below which is collated from the RIA database, it is important to note that it is not possible to specify exactly how long each person has resided in RIA accommodation.  Protection applicants are not required to live in RIA accommodation and in many cases, may move in and out of the direct provision system as their circumstances change.  The following information relates to the length of time that has elapsed since applicants for international protection who are in the direct provision system first made their application.  Therefore, it does not necessarily mean that those persons have lived in RIA accommodation for all of that period.</p><p>  Subject to the important clarifications as indicated above, the information sought by the Deputy is as follows: number of persons in RIA accommodation for up to one year since they lodged their application is 593, between one year and two years is 489, between two years and three years is 533, between three and four years is 622, between four and five years is 806 and in excess of five years 1,712.</p><p>  I acknowledge that the length of time spent in direct provision is an issue to be addressed and I have taken a number of steps to speed up the processing of applications including redeployment of resources and the establishment of a legal panel to assist INIS in processing a cohort of repatriation cases.  I would expect to see significant dividends, in terms of cases finalised, from this initiative in the coming months. Further, I plan to republish the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2010 to create a single procedure for the processing of applications.  These steps will reduce the time a person spends in direct provision while they await a final decision on their case.</p><p>  Finally, it should be noted that there are significant numbers of persons living in RIA accommodation who may have exhausted the protection process but who await the outcome of court proceedings on aspects of their cases.</p></reply>

The Protocol provides that Ireland may opt-in to a measure to which the Protocol applies. Ireland did not participate in the adoption and application of the 2003 Directive and there are currently no plans to exercise an opt-in in relation to it.</p><p>  The principal reason for Ireland's position is the provisions of Article 11 of the 2003 Directive which deals with access to the labour market for asylum seekers. Article 11 provides that if a decision at first instance has not been taken within one year of the presentation of an application for asylum, and this delay cannot be attributed to the applicant, Member States shall decide the conditions for granting access to the labour market for the applicant.</p><p>  This is contrary to the existing statutory position in Ireland which provides that an asylum seeker shall not seek or enter employment. This prohibition in Irish law is maintained in the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill, which I intend to republish.</p><p>  Extending the right to work to asylum seekers would almost certainly have a profoundly negative impact on application numbers, as was experienced in the aftermath of the July 1999 decision to do so. The immediate effect of that measure was a threefold increase in the average number of applications per month leading to a figure of 1,217 applications in December 1999 compared with an average of 364 per month for the period January to July 1999.</p><p>  Any change in public policy in this area would have to have regard to the very large numbers of people unemployed in this country.</p></reply>

During the period 2005 to 2012, there have been 39 deaths of asylum seekers who were residing in direct provision accommodation prior to their deaths.</p><p>While RIA may have general knowledge of the cause of death - perhaps by way of information arising from the specified medical needs of the resident concerned prior to his or her death - it does not, indeed cannot, hold or have access to death certificates.  In most cases, the deaths would have occurred outside the asylum centres themselves e.g. in hospitals.  If the HSE or a Coroner were to raise an issue relating to the accommodation in which a deceased person lived prior to their death - and this has never happened - then RIA would respond accordingly.  Where information is provided to centre managers by relatives or friends of the deceased, this is recorded by RIA and indicates that the causes of death ranged from cancers, heart conditions to traffic accidents and, in the case of deaths of children under the age of five, it is believed that a number were suspected cot deaths and still births.  Given previous misinterpretations of statistics provided in this respect, it is important to say that only one of these deaths can with certainty be said to be a suicide and that involved a newly arrived asylum seeker taking his own life in 2008 while in hospital.</p><p>The number of asylum seekers who died between 2005 and 2012 while being provided with accommodation by RIA in direct provision centres is set out in the following table.</p><p><table><tr><th><div>Year</div></th><th><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>Number of Deaths</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></th></tr><tr><td><div>2005</div></td><td><div>6</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2006</div></td><td><div>4</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2007</div></td><td><div>8</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2008</div></td><td><div>7</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2009</div></td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2010</div></td><td><div>6</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2011</div></td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2012</div></td><td><div>6</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Total</div></td><td><div>39</div></td></tr></table><pli0>  </pli0></p><p>While all of these deaths are, of course, tragic, RIA has provided accommodation for over 50,000 persons over the course of the twelve years the direct provision policy has been in place, and the numbers of deaths need to be viewed proportionately and against this background.</p><p>It needs to be recorded that the above relates only to asylum seekers living in the Direct Provision system.  Some asylum seekers choose not to avail of the Direct Provision system and stay with friends or relatives. It is possible that, during the period in question, there could have been deaths among this cohort but such data is not available to RIA.</p></reply>

The prisoner had previously been granted an escorted visit, again accompanied by an Acting Chief Officer and a Chaplain, to view the remains of their parent, in private, away from the public and other family members at the funeral home. The prisoner did not attend the funeral mass or burial. It should also be noted that the escort only took a few hours and was on condition that the staff resources were available to carry out same.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that it is open to all prisoners to apply for compassionate temporary release or for escorted visits, in the company of prison staff, for significant family occurrences such as funerals, communions or confirmations etc. All requests for temporary release or escorted outings are considered on a case by case basis and subject to appropriate security considerations.</p><p>  Prisoners may be approved escorted visits on compassionate/humanitarian grounds to the graveside of a close family member in the event of a bereavement at a later stage if they are not permitted to attend the funeral. A number of criteria is considered prior to granting the applications including the prisoners remission date, behaviour in prison and engagement with the therapeutic services within the prison. The safety of the public and any possible victim issues are also taken into account.</p><p>  In this case the prisoner is due for release early next year and their behaviour and engagement with services, in particular the Psychology Service is very good. Their was no risk to the public and the local Garda&iacute; were informed prior to the escort taking place.</p><p>  The need to escort prisoners outside prisons arises routinely in a number of contexts and prison staff are assigned to carry out these duties as part of their day to day work. Therefore, I can advise the Deputy that no additional expenditure would have been incurred as a result of this escort. </p></reply>

I refer, in particular, to the  cross border task forces in place to specifically target the distribution of illegal fuels and tobacco products.</p><p>  These task forces comprise representatives from the PSNI, HM Revenue Customs, Serious Organised Crime Agency (UK), the Revenue Commissioners, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Criminal Assets Bureau and have had considerable successes in tackling this form of criminality.</p><p>  With regard to the question of further legislative proposals, the Deputy will appreciate that primary legislation concerning revenue offences does not fall under the remit of my Department. Having said that, I can inform the Deputy that in the context of reviewing the overall legislative response in place to tackle organised crime, my Department is currently undertaking a specific review of the provisions of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009 to see if its provisions can be strengthened and the views of the Garda Commissioner have been sought in this regard<b>.</b></p><p>  Finally, while I note that the Report calls for the establishment of an interdepartmental group, under the auspices of the Department of an Taoiseach, to deal with fraud affecting the retail trade, I am satisfied that the existing structures for achieving multi-agency co-operation represent the most effective approach.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-03-27a.657.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013032700085#WRY01800"><p>I expect to be in a position quite soon to provide the information sought by the Deputy on the methods to be used to identify and protect minors in relation to gambling. However, I am unable to do so at this point since I have not yet obtained the Government's approval for my proposals. The proposals are in the General Scheme of the proposed Gambling Control Bill which I hope to present to the Government within the coming weeks. I plan to make the Scheme available on my Department's website once it has been approved.</p><p>  I can, however, say at this stage that the new legislation will strengthen the protections available to consumers generally, with additional measures being included that are aimed at protecting vulnerable persons; that term refers primarily to persons under 18 years and to persons who have developed gambling problems, including addiction.</p><p>  I envisage a new inspection team whose major task will be to monitor compliance by licence holders with the terms of their licence and with the new legislation generally. It will have strong enforcement powers. Licence holders, for their part, will be required to train staff on how to spot problem or excessive gambling and on how and when to intervene.There will be prohibitions on the employment of young persons, they will not be permitted to participate in gambling, there will be arrangements for age verification checks.</p><p>  I believe that the industry must accept greater responsibility for the down - side of gambling. One of the ways in which this will be done is to require licence holders to contribute to a social responsibility fund, the aim of the fund being to support research, education and treatment programmes. I will also be proposing restrictions on advertising, promoting and sponsoring of events by licence holders if these activities are targeted at young people.</p><p>  The examples I have mentioned give an indication of the comprehensive scale of the planned measures. However, we are all aware that regardless of whatever the law might provide, there will be particular difficulties in enforcing age and identity checks in the case of online gambling, much of which will be done from home. It therefore seems clear to me that the effective enforcement of rules and procedures for online gambling will require the active involvement of parents and others, particularly teachers. This may mean that parents must monitor the young person's internet and telephone usage and they must never share their PIN or similar number with anyone under 18 years.</p><p>  I have requested information on the number of inspections by Garda&iacute; of gaming establishments. I will communicate with the Deputy when it becomes available.</p><p>  The Deputy's question appears to suggest some linkage between the discharge by the Gardai of their functions and the existence of a particular unit in my Department. It is very important that there should be clarity about the respective roles and functions of the Garda&iacute; and of the named unit, or any other part of the Department. I have already referred to the creation of, in effect, a new, dedicated inspectorate under the new legislation; it will probably take over many of the roles currently assigned to the Garda&iacute; and others. However, pending the enactment and coming into force of the new systems, the enforcement of the current law will continue to be a matter primarily for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, although the Revenue Commissioners also have certain functions.The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is, of course, independent in the discharge of the duties imposed on it by law. It makes its own determinations on operational grounds, taking account of general priorities, the resources available and other relevant factors.</p><p>  The Casino and Gaming Control Section in my Department, on the other hand, has no function in relation to law enforcement. Its functions include advising me of developments in the sector, formulating general policy, conducting consultations, such as the public consultation in 2010, the preparation of draft legislation, as well as specific statutory functions such as the preparation of Certificates of Personal Fitness in the case of certain applicants for bookmakers' licences under the Betting Act 1931. The Section operates in accordance with the practices and procedures applicable to the public service generally.</p></reply>

These children are generally placed in a foster care family placement, although some older children are placed in regulated residential facilities that cater for small numbers.

Such complaints can be made to centre management or to RIA. Where a resident has issues with their diet, they can provide a diet sheet from their doctor to centre management and those needs are addressed. Where necessary, diet sheets and supporting medical documents may be forwarded by RIA to an independent medical referee for review and advice on how best to address specific needs. While such information may be held at the accommodation centre or on the person's file in RIA, statistics in relation to certified dietary requirements are not compiled.</p><p>  In relation to the dietary element of direct provision, all accommodation centres are contractually obliged to ensure that menus reflect different ethnic tastes or requirements and are cycled on at least a seven day basis to ensure variety.

A growing number of centres &ndash; at least 15 to date &ndash; have obtained a &lsquo;Q&rsquo; Quality Mark (or equivalent), which involves considerable examination of quality and procedures.  It should be noted that it is not a contractual requirement to obtain such awards.  Mechanisms for making and addressing complaints about centre operations, including food complaints, are outlined in considerable detail in RIA House Rules and Procedures, which are widely available in centres and on the websites of the Department of Justice and Equality and the Reception &amp; Integration Agency.  The House Rules were extensively launched by RIA with opportunities made available to all residents to attend explanatory presentations on the document. </p><p>  RIA conducts inspections and other formal and unannounced visits to all centres throughout the year which focus, inter alia, on food, food hygiene, HACCP standards and other quality checks.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-03-27a.688.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013032700085#WRAA00500"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 258 and 259 together.</p><p>  As the Deputy is aware, under the provisions of the Courts Service Act 1998, management of the courts is the responsibility of the Courts Service which is independent in exercising its functions, including the provision and maintenance of accommodation for court sittings.  As I informed the Deputy in my reply to Question No. 453 on 12 March, the contract between the Courts Service and the Public Private Partnership Company (PPPCo) provides for a single monthly unitary charge payment to cover the design, construction, financing and service provision in the Criminal Courts of Justice.  The financial model underpinning the monthly unitary charge formed a central element of the extensive negotiations undertaken by the Service prior to entering into the contract with the PPPCo.  I am further informed that this information is commercially sensitive and its release would have implications for the Courts Service's negotiating position for future public private partnership projects.  As previously stated, the CCJ contract is between the Courts Service and the PPPCo and ongoing amounts paid by the PPPCo to its subcontractor G4S for the provision of services are part of their internal financial and contractual arrangements.  The services provided by the PPPCo through its subcontractor G4S include security, cleaning, maintenance, facilities management, energy and utilities management, health and safety, helpdesk and portering.</p><p>  Under the terms of the contract, the PPPCo has to provide the facilities and the services in the Criminal Courts of Justice to a required standard and in accordance with a performance regime as set out in the contract.  Failure to meet these standards or failure to have all or part of the Criminal Courts of Justice available for use during the course of the contract period will result in financial penalties being incurred by the PPPCo.  As the Criminal Courts of Justice will be handed over to the Courts Service in an "as built"&rsquo; condition in 2035, the contract provides that the PPPCo is responsible for the ongoing maintenance, including replacement costs for the fabric, contents and equipment in the Criminal Courts of Justice.  In the 2011 Annual Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, the total expenditure to February 2035 was projected at &euro;625.4 million.  The current annual commitment for the Criminal Courts of Justice base unitary charge is &euro;21.9 million (including VAT).  In 2013, annual indexation provisions increased the unitary charge by approximately &euro;200,000.  In future years, any increases or decreases will depend on the CPI published by the Central Statistics Office on an annual basis.  Therefore, it is not possible to predict this in advance.  However, I understand the projected costs of the project mentioned above assumed an inflation rate of 2% over the period of the project.</p><p>  The total amount paid on volume related items, such as jury minding and jury meals, will be based on the usage for these items over the lifetime of the contract.  As a consequence, the Courts Service has informed me that it is not possible to predict in any meaningful manner expenditure to 2035 on such items.  Expenditure will depend on unpredictable factors such as the number and length of jury trials.  In addition, the Courts Service has indicated that it can discontinue the use of the PPPCo for the provision of such services once the contracted notice period is provided.  Expenditure on volume related items in 2012 was &euro;650,000, including VAT.  As I mentioned in my reply of 12 March, there have ongoing operational savings for other criminal justice agencies, including the Irish Prison Service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na resulting in more members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na being released for front line duties, in addition to considerable savings on lease costs.  Finally, as stated previously, this PPP contract was dealt with in detail by the Comptroller and Auditor General in his 2008 Annual Report and was also examined by the Committee of Public Accounts in July 2010.</p></reply>

The basic legal requirement is that animals, which die on farms, must generally be disposed of through approved rendering plants.</p><p>  My Department provided substantial funding towards the collection and destruction of all fallen bovines for a number of years until 2009. This was justified as part of Ireland&rsquo;s response to the BSE crisis and as a means of protecting our valuable beef industry. In view of budgetary constraints and the greatly reduced incidence of BSE, the revised TSE Subsidy Scheme which was introduced in April 2009 was designed to subsidise the cost of collection and rendering only of fallen bovines which need to be BSE tested as required by EU regulations. </p><p>  The current subsidy level for the collection of bovines over 48 months of age, for sampling, as required under the ongoing national BSE surveillance programme, is &euro;30 (excluding VAT) for collection and &euro;58 (excluding VAT) for rendering, per animal. Expenditure during 2012 was &euro;5.778m and the budget for 2013 is &euro;5.89m. It is not considered appropriate or necessary at this point to reintroduce funding for the collection and rendering of fallen bovines which do not require to be BSE tested.</p></reply>

They also form an important part of the local environment from the point of view of bio-diversity, wildlife, amenities and economic returns e.g. tourism. However, there is a substantial risk of land abandonment as under-grazing become more of a problem. </p><p>  Under-grazing leads to an increase in ineligible land under Direct Aid and Agri-Environment Schemes and leads to risk of financial corrections being imposed by EU Commission. It is vital, therefore, to maintain the commonages in GAEC, or where there is under-grazing, to return the habitat to GAEC. It is my stated aim that this will be achieved by working with the farmers directly managing the lands, relevant State Agencies, the farming organisations and all other interested stakeholders.</p><p>  I readily acknowledge that it will not be an easy task, but it is achievable if we all work in a co-operative basis. If action is not taken now, the areas will continue to deteriorate and will lead to more land abandonment. If this is allowed to happen, we will lose a valuable resource from the point of view of farming, rural economy, bio-diversity and wildlife. While grazing is the only method of managing these lands, the task facing us is how to ensure that these grazing levels are appropriate to the individual commonages.</p><p>  In order to ensure that we achieve this objective, as already stated, we need the input of individual shareholders. Grazing plans, at the level of each commonage, will allow for greater flexibility for shareholders and will enable the active farmers to increase their stock to cater for dormant and inactive persons. It will be matter for agreement between the shareholders &ndash; as was always the case &ndash; to decide how best to reach the stocking levels. Professional assistance will be required, in particular where the commonage has been damaged by under-grazing.</p><p>  The Grazing Plan will have to cater the traditional farming methods for the area, with provision made for sheep and other animals, such as cattle, providing that they are appropriate to the habitat. An appropriate time-scale will have to be put in place but the Plan should include the incremental steps to achieve GAEC. The whole concept will be output driven, in that the assessment of the Plans will be based on whether the commonage is in GAEC or not or whether the appropriate progress has been achieved.  </p><p>  Apart from ensuring that the Grazing Plan is valid, there are a number of other complications, including:</p><p>- Dormant shareholders &ndash; in the majority of cases, these persons are no longer farming; and</p><p>- Current claimants on the commonages, who do not farm or manage the lands.</p><p>The issue of whether the latter claimants will continue to be eligible for payment will have to be examined.</p><p>  There are other issues that will need to be considered. These include the fact that many commonage habitats have been significantly damaged by under-grazing, with resulting problems that must be addressed including land abandonment, spread of scrub and invasive species.</p></reply>

This support is provided through the provision of two targeted childcare support programmes - the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme and the Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programme - and the universal Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme.  These support programmes are available to parents who enrol their children in childcare services which are approved to participate in the programmes.</p><p>  The CCS programme provides funding to community-based childcare services to enable them to provide childcare at reduced rates to parents in receipt of social welfare payments or on low incomes.  For the purpose of the CCS programme, eligibility is determined by reference to a range of means-tested allowances and payments including receipt of a social welfare payment, Family Income Supplement (FIS) and qualification for a medical or GP visit card.  Eligibility for a GP visit card is based on net income and takes account of outgoings such as rent and mortgage repayments and other expenses including childcare costs and travelling expenses.  As a result, middle and low income working parents may also qualify for support.  Parents who qualify for the top rate of subvention under the programme receive &#8364;95 per week towards full-day childcare costs.</p><p>  The CETS<b></b>programme provides &#8364;145 towards the weekly cost of full time childcare places to participating childcare services for trainees and students who are deemed qualified by F&Aacute;S or the VEC.  Students on part-time courses are funded on a pro rata basis.  The ECCE programme provides one free  pre-school year to all eligible children in the year before commencing primary school.  Children aged between 3 years 2 months and 4 years 6 months at 1 September in the relevant year qualify for a maximum of 15 hours per week free pre-school provision over a 38 week period.  This is a universal programme to which all children have access.</p><p>  In 2013, the total expenditure by my Department on these three programmes is expected to be in the region &#8364;260 million.  These programmes have been maintained despite the ongoing need to reduce Government expenditure and they represent a significant investment in supporting parents with the cost of childcare.  You may also be aware that, as part of Budget 2013, I announced with my colleague the Minister for Social Protection, a joint school age childcare initiative which will provide further additional support to both the community and private childcare sector.  This initiative, which represents an annual investment of &#8364;14 million, will provide important support to parents in low income families wishing to take up employment, along with ensuring that quality after-school care is in place to support children's development.  </p><p>  Future developments relating to early years care and education will be considered during preparation of the new National Early Years Strategy which is currently being developed by my Department.  This Strategy will cover a range of issues affecting children in their first years of life such as health, family support, learning and development and care and education and will identify the structures and policies needed to improve early year's experience in Ireland. </p></reply>

Up to 2012 the allocations were distributed to the youth projects through 39 administering agencies/bodies that held funding administration status.  These include VECs, national youth organisations and 11 other bodies including some county councils.  The City of Dublin Youth Service Board (CDYSB), a statutory board established in 1942, under the City of Dublin VEC, is one such body.  The CDYSB, on behalf of CDVEC, has for several years, undertaken the administration of over 50 youth projects in the Dublin City area and has developed a strong track record in managing these payments.   </p><p>  My Department is seeking to streamline the tasks associated with the financial management of funding for projects to achieve greater transparency and efficiency in the administration of funding.  For these reasons, from January 2013, it was decided to transfer the administration of the allocated funding for some 30 youth projects, involving six national organisations, including Youth Work Ireland, to CDYSB.  The new administration process will be monitored during 2013 for efficiency and effectiveness for the Department and for the projects concerned.  Discussions have taken place between officials of my Department and the Irish Vocational Education Association (IVEA) on this issue and it is intended that further meetings will take place.  </p><p>  It is expected that the successful streamlining of the administration of the funding for the youth projects will deliver benefits in terms of saving on the administration costs incurred under the present arrangements and efficiencies for both the Department and projects themselves.  It is not possible to identify such savings at this early stage of the process.  All such efficiencies are important in a context where significant savings are being sought on the &euro;51.423m funding provided in 2013 for youth programmes and youth projects and services throughout the country.  Every effort is being made by my Department to ensure that, in the administration of the funding allocations in the present challenging budgetary situation, the focus is maintained on the provision of the front line services for young people.</p></reply>

Minimum Benefit Regulations, made under the Health Insurance Acts, require insurers to offer a minimum benefit to every insured person.  The key purpose of the Regulations is to ensure the continued availability of the type of broad hospital cover traditionally held as a minimum by the insured population and to ensure that individuals do not significantly under-insure.  The inclusion of primary care services in health insurance products is not a statutory requirement, as the primary purpose of current health insurance legislation is to provide cover for hospital treatment within an appropriate regulatory system. </p><p>  This Government is committed to a single-tier health service, supported by universal health insurance (UHI), which provides equal access based on need, not ability to pay, and which delivers the best health outcomes for everyone.  Under UHI, everyone will be insured for a standard package of curative services comprising primary and hospital care services, including mental health services.  Health insurance will be mandatory, with a system of financial support ensuring affordability by paying or subsidising the cost of insurance premiums for all those who qualify.  The system will be founded on principles of social solidarity, including  financial protection, open enrolment, lifetime cover and community rating. </p><p>  The introduction of UHI will see the purchasing of primary and hospital care largely devolved to insurers.  Health insurers will commission care for their members from primary care providers, independent not-for-profit Hospital Trusts and private hospitals.  In doing this, they will have a duty to use their purchasing role to ensure that quality, continuous care is provided at the lowest level of complexity that is safe, timely, efficient and as close to a person's home as possible.  Furthermore, in line with the fundamental principle of social solidarity, neither insurers nor providers operating within the UHI system will be allowed to sell faster access to services covered by the UHI standard package of care.  While it is envisaged that supplementary insurance may be purchased for items not covered by the standard package, this may not interfere with the fundamental overriding principle of access to care being based on need. </p><p>  My Department is currently undertaking detailed work in relation to the preparation of a White Paper on Universal Health Insurance.  This White Paper will provide further detail on the UHI model for Ireland in addition to the estimated costs and financing mechanisms associated with its introduction.  The work involved is both complex and technical and  demands a wide-range of specialised legal and financial expertise.  My Department has recently engaged specialised legal expertise to support work in relation to the design of the UHI model and work in this area is underway.</p></reply>

It is currently engaged in a reconfiguration of existing therapy resources to geographic based teams for children (0-18 years) as part of the National Programme on Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People (0-18 years).  The Programme is organised at national, regional and local level and includes representatives from the health and education sectors, service providers (both statutory and non-statutory) and parents. These stakeholders are working together to see how current services can be reorganised in line with agreed policy. The HSE has stated that it is is very cognisant of stakeholder's views particularly of parents within this context. It has also worked to ensure that information about the Programme is made widely available.</p><p>  The Executive is working very closely with the education sector, which is fully involved in the development of the Programme, to ensure that, from the children&rsquo;s and parents&rsquo; perspective, the services provided by each sector in so far as possible areintegrated. Detailed Local Area action plans are being implemented with the following objectives:</p><p> - One clear pathway to services for all children with disabilities according to need,</p><p> - Resources used to the greatest benefit for all children and families, and</p><p> - Health and Education working together to support children to achieve their potential.</p><p>  The purpose of the reconfiguration of existing therapy resources is to ensure that the resources available are used to best effect, in order to provide health supports and ongoing therapy to all children (0-18 years) in line with their prioritised needs.  In particular, it will mean that all children, regardless of where they receive their education services will have equitable access to services based on their needs.  Decisions in relation to the local reorganisation of services will be made by Local Implementation Groups, which include representatives of all the service providers in the local area, parents and the education sector. They have a complex task which includes agreeing the principles which should underpin all disability services, mapping of existing services and gaps, consideration of the changes needed in structures and a detailed plan of how to advance.  This plan will include issues of timing and the phasing of proposed changes.  My Department has asked the HSE to provide the Deputy with detailed information on the implementation of the Programme in Kerry which he has referred to in his question.</p></reply>

Dealing with the current high levels of suicide and deliberate self harm is a priority for this Government.  <i>Reach Out </i>our National Strategy for Action on suicide Prevention makes a number of recommendations in relation to fast track referrals to community-based mental health services, effective response to deliberate self harm, training, stigma reduction, etc.  Consequently, the HSE's National Office for Suicide Prevention (NOSP) has developed a range of initiatives to support people who are suicidal and also supporting their families, friends and peers in recognising and responding appropriately to signs of emotional distress and suicidal thoughts.</p><p>  It is not accurate to state that suicidal thinking in females will be legitimised by the State by legislation.  As the Deputy will know, last December the Government approved the implementation of the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in the <i>A, B and C v. Ireland</i> case by way of legislation with regulations, within the parameters of Article 40.3.3 of the Constitution as interpreted by the Supreme Court in the <i>X</i> case.  It also agreed to make appropriate amendments to the criminal law in this area.  The aim of the Bill is solely to regulate access to lawful termination of pregnancy in accordance with Article 40.3.3 of the Constitution as interpreted in the <i>X </i>case.</p><p>  As the Deputy is aware, Article 40.3.3&deg; of the Constitution was inserted by the Eighth Amendment in 1983 and is as follows:<blockquote>The State acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right.</blockquote>In <i>Attorney General v. X</i>, the Supreme Court considered the meaning of the Eighth Amendment in the circumstances that arose in the case.  The case concerned a girl of 14 years of age and the threat to her life was from suicide.  The Supreme Court analysed and interpreted the text of Article 40.3.3 and decided that the Constitution permitted abortion in certain limited and particular circumstances, namely, where there was a real and substantial risk to the life of the woman, which could only be removed by terminating the pregnancy.  Article 40.3.3&deg; of the Constitution as interpreted in the <i>X </i>case judgment is the law of the State and the Oireachtas is legally bound to adhere to this interpretation.  In order for the risk of suicide to be removed as a ground for lawful abortion, a referendum must be held.  Indeed, two referendums have been held to attempt to remove the risk of suicide as a ground for lawful abortion and they were both defeated.</p></reply>

In 2012, a special allocation of &#8364;35 million was provided for mental health to be used primarily to further strengthen Community Mental Health Teams in both adult and children's mental health services, to advance activities in the area of suicide prevention, to initiate the provision of psychological and counselling services in primary care, and to facilitate the transfer of mental health service users from institutional to community based care.</p><p>  Recruitment of over 330 of the additional 414 posts approved in 2012 has been completed and the HSE is aiming to fill the remaining posts in the very near future.  A further &#8364;35 million was provided in budget 2013 for the continued development of mental health services across a range of headings, including the further ongoing development of community services and 477 posts have been approved to implement these measures.  Discussions are ongoing within the HSE, and in consultation with the Department of Health to finalise the allocation of these resources and commence recruitment.

The NOSP has also produced a number of information resources in several languages in order to support different communities to look after their mental health.</p><p>  Finally, the Director of the NOSP welcomes a dialogue with the representatives from any group in Irish society that has evidence that members of their community may be at risk of suicide or self harm. The NOSP can advise and support such vulnerable groups using proven evidence approaches that have worked with other population groups in Ireland e.g. LGBT and Traveller communities.</p></reply>

The role of NOSP is to oversee the implementation of <i>Reach Out</i> and to coordinate suicide prevention initiatives around the country.  The National Office is advised and guided by an advisory group comprising individuals with considerable knowledge and expertise in the areas of suicide prevention, mental health promotion and bereavement support.  In addition NOSP publishes an Annual Report outlining its activities and work each year so it is fully accountable.  I believe that a commitment to evidence based programmes and partnerships with a common purpose is what is required to address the issue of suicide and this role is being carried out at present by the National Office.</p><p>  Earlier this year, the NOSP established a Group to review the current activities in the area of suicide prevention and to determine the priorities within this area to ensure that we maximise available resources.  The Group will also review current national and international evidence on effective approaches in suicide prevention and will consider how the emerging evidence base can be used to inform the remaining period of the <i>Reach Out</i> strategy and influence new policy on suicide prevention  beyond 2014.</p><p>  The Government has increased the annual budget for suicide prevention this year to over &#8364;13m, with &#8364;8.1m available to the NOSP to fund voluntary and statutory agencies delivering services in the area of prevention, intervention, postvention and research and the remaining &#8364;5m available regionally to fund Resource Officers for Suicide Prevention, Self-Harm Liaison Nurses in Hospital Emergency Departments and local suicide prevention initiatives.  I have no plans to establish  an organisation such as the Road Safety Authority, however, the Department of Health is currently in discussions with the NOSP to agree a strategy for suicide prevention in 2013 having regard to the increased funding available this year and the concerns around suicide generally.  Priority initiatives will include the further development of existing National Mental Health Awareness campaigns to promote help seeking; increased training for GPs and practice staff; the training of acute hospital staff on suicide and self harm intervention; the development of the SCAN (Suicide Crisis Assessment Nurse) model which allows for crisis interventions at primary care and continued investment in voluntary agencies providing frontline services.</p></reply>

At present, and until September next, local authorities will continue to process driver licence applications and non-digital photographs will be accepted.  The operation of the tender processes for the outsourced elements was a matter for the RSA, I had no power to intervene in it, and the contractors have already been procured.</p></reply>

From a regulatory perspective my Department aims to ensure that there are no legal or regulatory impediments to the introduction of air services by negotiating bilateral air services agreements with third countries where necessary.  The market for air services in and out of Ireland is highly competitive with a very significant number of airlines operating.</p><p>  Tourism Ireland, the agency with responsibility for the overseas promotion of Ireland as a tourist destination, continues to invest in cooperative marketing activity with airlines.  Additional capacity has been secured between Ireland and the US and current indications are that transatlantic capacity for summer 2013 will be higher than summer 2012, with up to 133 departures per week, providing just over 31,000 seats in each direction. This represents a 26.6% increase in capacity, or just over 6,500 additional seats per week, compared to summer 2012. Furthermore  additional connectivity  direct  from  Dublin has been achieved through Emirates&rsquo; hub in Dubai which  provides  greater ease of access to Ireland from Australia as well as the emerging tourism markets in the Middle East and Asia. </p><p>  I will continue to act as a champion for improved air access to Ireland, be it increased capacity on existing routes or the development of new routes. Negotiations are ongoing with a number of carriers for additional capacity linked both to general traffic demand and the increased traffic expected over the course of &lsquo;The Gathering Ireland 2013&rsquo;.</p></reply>

All ferry companies servicing these routes are commercial companies and, as such, their services are market driven. </p><p>  Competition in the sector is encouraged and I expect services to develop and expand to meet any increased market demands in the future. In the past, ferry operators have responded to market developments and demands for increased capacity when required, as shown in their response to the Volcanic Ash crisis in 2010. My Department through its agency, the Irish Maritime Development Office (IMDO), works closely with all existing operators and continues to promote Ireland as a location for new services. </p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, this is a particularly important year for Irish tourism with The Gathering Ireland 2013 now underway and over 3,000 individual gatherings confirmed on the Gathering website. The overall target is to attract at least 325,000 extra overseas visits to Ireland in 2013. Tourism Ireland continues to mount a major consumer campaign to promote The Gathering to people overseas that feel linked by family, friends or otherwise with Ireland. In this regard the agency is undertaking cooperative activity with the major airlines and ferry operators to highlight the value fares that are on offer. This activity will continue throughout 2013.</p></reply>

A key initiative for the new merged Shannon entity will be the development of an international aviation services centre in and around the airport.</p><p>  In a wider national context, the Deputy may be aware that I have launched a process to develop a national aviation policy.  Taking account of the issues that were raised at an initial Conference late last year, I published an Issues paper for consultation on my Department's website on 1 March 2013.  Rather than stating any preferred options, I have invited contributions from the industry and all stakeholders about what measures should be included in a new aviation policy to facilitate the continued development of all aspects of the sector in Ireland and to maximise its contribution to the economy.  </p><p>  Following receipt of submissions, a draft National Aviation Policy Statement will be issued in the second half of 2013. That will provide further opportunity for stakeholder input before the adoption of the policy in early 2014. </p></reply>
