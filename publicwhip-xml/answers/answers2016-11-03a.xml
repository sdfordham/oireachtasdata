The conditions of the various Government supports under JobPath are therefore a matter for the Department of Social Protection.</p>  <p>  Conditions attached to the grants made by my Department&rsquo;s agencies do not preclude participation in JobPath; agency client companies are therefore open to accessing DSP data on persons on the Live Register who may be suitably qualified for job opportunities within their companies.</p>  <p>  Under Pathways to Work 2013, which is led by DSP, a Protocol on co-operation between the Department of Social Protection (DSP), my Department and the enterprise agencies was agreed.  This includes IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland (EI), the Local Enterprise Offices (or LEOs) and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta. The aim of the Protocol is to maximise the recruitment of suitably skilled personnel from the Live Register by the enterprise agencies client companies. </p>  <p>  IDA Ireland works with DSP, EI and other agencies to help provide job opportunities for unemployed people in IDA client companies.  Areas of cooperation include participation in jobs fairs, sharing information on job announcements and Skillnets initiatives in areas like med tech, bio pharma and engineering.</p>  <p>  Co-operation between employers and the education and training system is crucial in developing effective responses to skills needs.  This co-operation is being strengthened through the new Regional Skills Fora to connect employers, enterprise development agencies and education and training providers.</p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s agencies do not collate data on the number of persons taken on by client companies under JobPath &ndash; these statistics are collated by DSP. </p>  <p>  I would therefore suggest that the Deputy make contact with DSP for any further detailed information on the JobPath scheme.</p></reply>

Ensuring Ireland is a competitive location to establish and run a business is essential for job creation.  Brexit means we must do more across a wide range of policy areas to enhance our attractiveness as a location to start and locate a business relative to the UK.  The most recent data from the World Bank&rsquo;s Ease of Doing Business shows that Ireland is ahead of the UK in terms of ease of starting a business and paying tax but is behind the UK in the overall rankings.</p>  <p>  To improve business competitiveness we must consolidate Ireland&rsquo;s traditional strengths and address those areas where we lag behind the UK. </p>  <p>  We are stepping up investment in infrastructure and SMEs access to finance is improving.  We are reforming our tax system to encourage enterprise growth.  We are driving the implementation of our research strategy Innovation 2020.  As part of the Budget my Department secured additional resources for our enterprise agencies to put more people on the ground in foreign markets to attract investment and to help Irish business who export to the UK and helping others diversify into new markets.  I have asked that Enterprise Ireland intensify its work with clients exporting to the UK by providing support to improve their competitiveness in the market through its management capability and development programmes such as LEAN.  I will ensure that the 2017 Action Plan for Jobs provides a sharp focus on specific aspects of the competitiveness agenda, particularly in the area of costs and ease of doing business.</p></reply>

I am working closely with the Minister for Social Protection to ensure we can provide every opportunity for those unemployed to secure a job.</p>  <p>  In September 2013, in the context of maximising the employment of appropriately skilled people from the Live Register by enterprise agency clients, a protocol was agreed for co-operation between the Department of Social Protection and my Department, EI, IDA and the LEOs.  'Pathways to Work&rsquo; contains a commitment for my Department and the enterprise development agencies to continually monitor recruitment from the Live Register, working with the CSO. </p>  <p>  In relation to the recording the jobs figures in firms supported by the enterprise agencies, my Department undertakes an Annual Employment Survey of client companies of EI, IDA and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  The survey, in existence since 1972, is a census of employment in the agency supported firms.  It is a voluntary survey and elicits the limited necessary employment numbers in response to two short questions, with minimum administrative burden for the 8,000 companies surveyed.  It is not designed to report on jobs supported by the activities of other Government Departments.</p></reply>

This will include an assessment of the possibility of a reduced overall fund if and when the UK&rsquo;s contribution to the EU is withdrawn at some point.  This work is being led by my Department in association with other Government Departments and relevant state agencies which fund research. </p>  <p>  In addition, I have secured &euro;162.5 million for Science Foundation Ireland in 2017, an increase of &euro;5.5 million over 2016 levels.</p>  <p>  The full impact of the UK&rsquo;s departure on the EU Research and Innovation budget will depend on the conclusion of negotiations between the UK and the EU. </p>  <p>  My officials continue to maintain regular contact with the European Commission and Member States to maximise the commitment of EU funding to Research and Innovation.

Once a loan is approved, it is important to note that it is entirely a commercial matter for the SME to decide whether or not the loan will actually be drawn down in whole or part. </p><p>While the benefit of a guarantee is offered to a borrower under the scheme, some borrowers do not proceed with the guarantee.  A significant number of cases are listed as &lsquo;Pending&rsquo; by the participating lenders, and the operator only holds partial information on such cases.  </p><p>The Government is committed to ensuring that our SMEs have access to appropriate finance for their business needs either from banking or non-banking sources, which will ensure that they continue to grow and develop.  </p><p>The CGS is a central element of those supports which when combined with other Government initiatives such as Microfinance Ireland, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, the Credit Review Office and the Prompt Payment Code should enable companies to expand, service new markets and grow employment.</p><p><b>CGS 2012 - County split</b><table><tr><th>County</th><th>Total &euro;</th></tr><tr><td>Carlow</td><td><div>1,770,000</div></td></tr><tr><td>Cavan</td><td><div>350,000</div></td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td><div>732,000</div></td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td><div>4,008,000</div></td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td><div>197,000</div></td></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td><div>26,963,000</div></td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td><div>2,366,500</div></td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td><div>960,000</div></td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td><div>4,565,000</div></td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td><div>295,000</div></td></tr><tr><td>Laois</td><td><div>2,306,950</div></td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim</td><td><div>1,100,000</div></td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td><div>4,520,344</div></td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td><div>1,460,000</div></td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td><div>933,100</div></td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan</td><td><div>250,000</div></td></tr><tr><td>Offaly</td><td><div>640,000</div></td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon</td><td><div>80,000</div></td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td><div>57,000</div></td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary</td><td><div>1,071,000</div></td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td><div>750,000</div></td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath</td><td><div>1,057,000</div></td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td><div>1,266,000</div></td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td><div>1,551,000</div></td></tr><tr><td>County to be confirmed by Participating Lender</td><td>2,619,000</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td><div>61,867,894</div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

Both I, as Minister, and the industrial relations institutions of the State will continue to strive for improvements in this area.</p>  <p>  It is not current Government policy to create a new body to intervene in industrial relations disputes.  The Programme for Partnership Government states that the Government will respect the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court as the proper forum for state intervention in industrial relation disputes and will ensure that both bodies are supported and adequately resourced to fulfil their roles</p>  <p>  I consider that the creation of a Labour Employer Conference as previously existed to intervene in protracted industrial relations disputes runs the risk of undermining the role of the WRC and the Labour Court.  While high profile disputes can lead to such calls, there are very many other disputes each year resolved by the WRC and Labour Court without disruption.  Parties to many of these disputes might feel that they had not exhausted the IR process or done the upmost for their members if they did not have the matter considered in some way by this type of higher body.  </p>  <p>  There has been significant progress made in recent years in improving, reforming and enhancing both the industrial relations institutions of the State and the industrial relations legislative framework utilised by workers and employers.  I consider that these are working well as evidenced by the resolution of many difficult and protracted disputes in recent times and the flexibility displayed.</p></reply>

Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s 31.67% stake in the ownership of Ardmore Studios is a legacy shareholding acquired as a result of an equity investment and a loan by Nadcorp (a predecessor State Agency) under an Agreement that dates back to 27 August 1986.</p>  <p>  The sale of the Ardmore Studios is a commercial decision by the owners of the Studios.  </p>  <p>  As a passive investor, Enterprise Ireland has not been involved in the day-to-day business of running Ardmore Studios.  Furthermore while Enterprise Ireland offers supports to exporting companies involved in film and the creative sector, policy responsibility for the development of the film industry rests with my colleague, Ms Heather Humphreys, T.D., Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.</p>  <p>  Ardmore Studios is being placed on the market for sale as a going concern.

We are very much at the start of a process that will lead to the UK renegotiating its relationship with the EU and it is unclear how, or when, this will be finalised.</p>  <p>  What is clear is that any changes in the UK&rsquo;s relationship with the EU will present both challenges and opportunities for the Irish economy.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2017, I secured the largest capital provision made to my Department over the past fifteen years.  This increase will be used to fund additional measures to support companies impacted by Brexit, as well new competitive funds for the Regions focused on job creation.</p>  <p>  I also secured additional Pay monies which will provide for 50+ new posts for the Department and its agencies to respond to Brexit and to work with companies to help them respond to the challenges and opportunities of Brexit. </p>  <p>  In terms of FDI, IDA Ireland is constantly engaged with clients across its entire portfolio and in the months leading up to the UK referendum it engaged with clients and prospective clients in relation to the potential impact of BREXIT.  IDA Ireland believes there are potential FDI opportunities for Ireland as a result of the UK vote to leave the EU.  These opportunities are likely to be found along differing timelines, partially influenced by sector . I am confident that Ireland is well positioned to maximise any opportunities that Brexit may present from an FDI perspective.</p>  <p>  However, of particular concern to me right now are the immediate challenges being faced by Irish SMEs due to a weakened sterling.  Many of the sectors particularly exposed, such as food, construction, retail, tourism and traditional manufacturing, have deep roots across the regions and they provide significant employment. </p>  <p>  From a strategic perspective Enterprise Ireland is assisting companies to maintain and grow UK exports and extend their international reach, as well as helping companies to enhance their competitiveness.  The Local Enterprise Offices are also working closely with those clients likely to be impacted by Brexit.</p>  <p>  I am working across Government to ensure that as Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, any actions that are taken in response to Brexit are tailored, targeted and evidence based.  </p></reply>

The Action Plan for Job is delivering on these targets.</p>  <p>  There is demand for a range of skills and experienced professionals across the economy.

Section 9 (5) of the Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014 provides that the Commission is independent in the performance of its functions, including carrying out investigations of alleged anti-competitive practices.  As investigations and enforcement matters generally are part of the day-to-day operational work of the Commission, I, as Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, have no direct function in these matters.</p>  <p>  However, the CCPC has advised that it is currently conducting 5 investigations into alleged anti-competitive practices.  Two of these relate to alleged price fixing/bid-rigging activities.  In addition, a case that the CCPC has sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions is scheduled to come up for trial in April 2017.  Ultimately, it is a matter for the Courts to determine if criminal sanctions are warranted in any specific case.</p>  <p>  During 2015, the CCPC received 74 allegations of competition law breaches (both civil and criminal) and opened two large scale investigations in respect of anti-competitive agreements, one of which involved searches at five premises in the bagged cement sector.  This is in addition to the opening of a cartel investigation into allegations of a criminal breach of competition law in the aviation sector and the closing of two additional investigations. </p>  <p>  I understand from the CCPC that, in addition to a bid rigging cartel case that is currently before the courts, in 2016 the CCPC has already conducted 21 searches of companies suspected of bid-rigging.  This investigation is ongoing. In addition the CCPC routinely screens complaints alleging cartel activity and, where there is sufficient evidence, progresses these to investigation stage.  While those with evidence can approach the CCPC confidentially, in order for a criminal case to proceed, those with information must be prepared to give evidence in court.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the CCPC investigates other infringements of competition law, not just hard-core cartel activities, which also may restrict competition. </p>  <p>  If the Deputy is aware of any alleged anti-competitive behaviour that is being practised (be it price-fixing or bid-rigging), I would urge him to forward details to the CCPC for their attention.</p></reply>

The Action Plan for Jobs is working. More than 176,000 people are at work today than in 2012 when the first Plan was launched.  36,000 new jobs were created in the first six months of 2016.</p>  <p>  While the Action Plan is a whole of Government approach to support job creation, I am responsible for developing the 2017 Plan.  My priority is to deliver on this Government&rsquo;s goal to help create 200,000 additional jobs by 2020, including 135,000 jobs outside Dublin.</p>  <p>  The Action Plans are monitored on a quarterly basis.  At the end of March 2016, 14 of 77 measures were delayed. All but 2 have since been completed.  The delayed actions are a review of the appropriateness of the sub-minima rates which currently apply by the Low Pay Commission and the publication of the Foreign Languages Strategy by the Department of Education and Skills.  It is expected that these actions will be completed by the end of the year.</p>  <p>  I will be working with Ministerial colleagues to ensure that the 2017 Plan is ambitious and impactful and keeps us on track to deliver on our 2020 targets.</p></reply>

It will end limitations in access to public contracts, open up markets for services and offer predictable conditions for investors.</p>  <p>  Irish firms will also benefit from the recognition of product standards and certification, thus saving on &lsquo;double testing&rsquo; on both sides of the Atlantic.  These are some of the benefits of the trade deal with Canada as well as providing new market opportunities in many sectors for Irish firms.</p>  <p>  Given the position taken by Ireland and other Member States, the Commission submitted CETA to the Council for decision as a mixed Agreement.  That is one requiring both EU and individual Member States ratification.  As this process may take a number of years to complete the Agreement provides for provisional application.  However, following a decision by the Council with the consent of the Parliament, it will be possible to provisionally apply CETA.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that investment protection and investment dispute settlement provisions have been specifically carved out from the provisional application of CETA.  This means these provisions will not come into being until voted for by the D&aacute;il.</p>  <p>  In addition to meet the political concerns of certain Member States, the Commission and Canada have agreed a Joint Interpretative Instrument to provide further assurances in relation to public services, labour rights and environmental standards and investment.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, the Government supports provisional application as we are keen to see Irish firms enjoy the tariff free benefits and new business opportunities as soon as possible.</p></reply>

In this respect, work is well advanced on developing a policy response to the University of Limerick (UL) study on zero hour contracts and low hour contracts.  It should be remembered that the UL study found that zero hour contracts, as defined within current Irish employment rights legislation, are not extensively used in Ireland.  It found low working hours can arise in different forms in employment contracts.</p>  <p>  The policy response is being informed by the UL study itself and also the extensive material and practical examples provided by respondents to the public consultation conducted by my Department.  Our proposals will address the issue of workers on low hour contracts who consistently work more hours each week but whose contracts do not reflect the reality of their hours.  The proposals will also seek to ensure that employees are better informed about the nature of their employment arrangements and their core terms and conditions at an early stage in their employment.  Furthermore, I intend to include provisions aimed particularly at low-paid, more vulnerable workers.</p>  <p>My Department is currently engaged in a dialogue process with ICTU and IBEC to   secure broad agreement before proposals are finalised.

The publication was compiled by independent consultants and commissioned by the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (PIAB).</p>  <p>  The revised Book of Quantum is based on a detailed analysis of 51,000 closed personal injury claims from 2013 and 2014 and includes compensation awards from Court cases, insurance company settlements, State Claims Agency cases and data relating to awards of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board.  It also contains more granular detail on injuries and new injury types and more narrowly defined compensation bands.  The revised Book of Quantum constitutes solid research on prevailing levels of damages in personal injuries claims.</p>  <p>  The Book of Quantum sets out the amounts that may be awarded or assessed in personal injury claims for workplace, public liability and road accidents.  It does not set personal injury award levels. It reflects settlements arrived at by insurance companies, PIAB, the State Claims Agency and the Courts so that all stakeholders involved in settling personal injury claims have an independent reference guide when assessing claims.  Therefore, this should not have any inflationary effect on insurance costs.</p>  <p>  In order for the economy to grow, and maintain competitiveness, it is vital to address insurance costs.  The Book of Quantum should allow for earlier settlement of claims and have a stabilising effect on compensation awards across the market.  Universal application of the revised Book by all stakeholders will bring consistency in settlements.  This should reduce the volume of litigation and help reduce the cost of insurance.  This measure supports the work of Minister of State Murphy on the Cost of Insurance Working Group, aimed at tackling increasing insurance costs. </p></reply>

The result of this work was a roadmap to ratification, which was published on 21 October 2015 and which outlines the considerable legislative changes to be undertaken to enable Ireland to ratify the Convention, along with the estimated deadline of end-2016 for ratification.  The Roadmap to Ratification, which is available on my Department's website, sets out the substantial legislative agenda required for ratification.  Since publication of the Roadmap, work has continued on a bilateral basis between my Department and the other relevant Departments to progress each of the specific issues identified.</p>  <p>  Considerable progress has already been made to overcome barriers to Ireland's ratification.  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 was signed into law on 30 December 2015 and is a comprehensive reform of the law on decision-making capacity. The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill 2015 commenced its second stage reading in the D&aacute;il on 5 October.  When enacted, the Bill will reform Section 5 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 to facilitate the full participation in family life of persons with intellectual disabilities and the full expression of their human rights.  Achieving the necessary balance between those rights and ensuring appropriate protection is crucial.</p>  <p>  Work is underway on drawing up an Equality/Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill to progress miscellaneous legislative amendments necessary to proceed to ratification. It is intended that the Bill will address issues such as the Convention's requirements in relation to reasonable accommodation and deprivation of liberty, as well as removing archaic references in existing legislation relating to mental health.  The General Scheme of the Equality/Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill is available on the Department's website.

I regard as appropriate that the WRC should continue to deal with the full range of issues relating to discrimination.  This includes alleged discrimination in relation to the provision of Housing Assistance Payment and rent allowance as provided for in the Equality (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2015.  I do not propose to change those arrangements.  It is important to understand that there will be no relationship of landlord and tenant between the parties in a case where a prospective tenant alleges discrimination on the basis of being or not being in receipt of either of the payments specified and the Residential Tenancies Board would therefore not be the appropriate body for such cases.</p>  <p>  Members of the public may obtain advice from the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission if they feel that they have been discriminated against contrary to equality legislation, including advice on how to take a claim to the WRC, which provides a free and accessible adjudication service.  </p></reply>

The International Protection Act 2015 provides for such a procedure.  My Department is currently preparing all of the steps necessary to commence the Act which responds to some 26 of the Working Group&rsquo;s recommendations and can be expected to positively address the crucial issue of the length of time that applicants spend in the protection process and by extension in the Direct Provision system.</p>  <p>  On this particular point, significant efforts have been made to deal with those who are longest in the system and at this stage the vast majority of those who are over 5 years in the system and who do not have any impediments to progress, such as pending judicial challenges, have now had their cases processed to completion.  This has been a key achievement that has had a real impact on many people and families in the protection process.</p>  <p>  A transition Task Force was established in 2015 and put in place important supports to facilitate people with status to integrate into the community.  The Task Force reported that 87% of people granted status had moved into the wider community within six months.</p>  <p>  Tangible progress in improving the daily lives of asylum seekers living in Ireland while their application is being processed is also being made.  In January last, the former T&aacute;naiste announced an increase to the Direct Provision Allowance for children, the first such increase since the introduction of the payment some sixteen years ago.  Prescription fees for all those in receipt of the Direct Provision allowance, including children, have also been waived.  The Minister for Education and Skills has also announced a second year of their pilot support scheme for students in the protection system for the academic year 2016/2017.</p>  <p>  The Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) of my Department, which is responsible for the management and administration of accommodation and ancillary services to protection applicants in state provided accommodation, is actively progressing the implementation of other recommendations in the Report around access to cooking facilities and the increase in living space for those who avail of State provided accommodation.  Pilot projects are being undertaken in a number of centres to ensure the best approach to realising these objectives and ensuring that those residing in the direct provision system continue to be treated with respect and dignity.</p>  <p>  RIA are also working on the development of standards for the provision and maintenance of services in accommodation centres, enhancing the complaints mechanisms for residents of those centres and the provision of ongoing diversity and equality training and awareness programmes across all centres.</p>  <p>  In relation to legal advice, all applicants are provided with information in relation to the services of the Legal Aid Board once they have made their claim for asylum and have been admitted to the asylum process. Of course, some persons may prefer to access legal advice independent of the Legal Aid Board and they are free to do so. Accordingly, the establishment of legal clinics in centres does not arise.</p></reply>

Under this programme, the Government has pledged to accept a total of 4,000 persons into the State by the end of 2017, through a combination of the EU relocation mechanism established by two EU Council Decisions in 2015 to assist Italy and Greece, and the UNHCR-led refugee resettlement programme currently focused on resettling refugees from camps in Lebanon.  Persons accepted here under these Programmes will also have an entitlement to family reunification, thereby further increasing the numbers accepted by Ireland.  </p>  <p>  Significant resources are currently being invested in these humanitarian efforts through the offices of the Irish Refugee Protection Programme, the Office of the Promotion of Migrant Integration and the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner.  As a result we have developed mechanisms and associated expertise to deal with resettlement and relocation.  Our response to the migrant crisis in terms of accepting refugees is through the IRPP and all available resources are being directed to that Programme in order to meet the commitment entered into and  I have no plans, at this point, to introduce any additional  admission programmes.  </p></reply>

The intention to backdate this tax incentive to this date was announced at that time with a view to avoiding any potential interruption in house sales, by purchasers who may otherwise have deferred purchases, pending the commencement of the incentive.</p>  <p>  There are currently no plans to extend eligibility for the scheme further back than the date of its initial announcement.  To do so would consist entirely of deadweight, as individuals who signed contracts to purchase new homes or who drew down the first tranche of their mortgage in respect of a self-build home, in advance of the original announcement did not need the assistance of the State to fund the required deposit. Such individuals made their purchasing decisions on the basis of the information available to them at the time of purchase, and could not have expected a subsequently introduced tax relief to be available to them.</p>  <p>  As with all time bound reliefs, there will always be those who just miss out on qualification.  I do not intend to extend the parameters of this new measure any further as it would become less targeted and more costly.</p></reply>

Consequently, I have established a Cost of Insurance Working Group chaired by Minister of State Eoghan Murphy T.D.  The Working Group brings together all the relevant Departments and Offices involved with the process.  Its objective is to identify immediate and longer term measures which can address increasing costs, while bearing in mind the need to maintain a stable insurance sector.</p><p>The core areas being examined by the Working Group in the first phase are:</p><p>- The motor insurance sector generally, at present and in recent years;</p><p>- The effects of legal costs and litigation processes on insurance costs;</p><p>- The current claims compensation arrangements and the cost of claims;</p><p>- Insurance data and information;</p><p>- The impact of accident rates;</p><p>- The impact of unlawful activity on the insurance sector; and</p><p>- Other market issues.</p><p>A number of additional issues which impact on consumers and the business sector in relation to motor insurance are also being considered.  These include the issue motor insurance costs for emigrants returning back to reside here.</p><p>On 28 October, the Working Group provided the Minister for Finance with an update report setting out the recommendations emerging from its work to date.  During November and December, the Working Group will be developing an action plan to enable the relevant Government Departments and Offices to commence the implementation of agreed priority actions.</p><p>It may be of interest to the Deputy that a person, who is unable to obtain a quotation for motor insurance or who feels that the premium proposed or the terms are so excessive that it amounts to a refusal to give them motor insurance, can contact Insurance Ireland, 5 Harbourmaster Place, IFSC, Dublin 1, Telephone +353 1 6761820quoting the Declined Cases Agreement.</p></reply>

Included in the 2016 TSG Income Tax &amp;amp; USC paper are details of the distributional burden of these tax proposals, an analysis of potential impacts upon different groups arising from a range of possible reform options and international comparisons.  The TSG papers were circulated to the Oireachtas Committees in July, well in advance of the Budget, facilitating the Committee's consideration of the distributional issues which arose.  They were subsequently published on my Department's website.</p>  <p>  A number of new innovations and improved features were included in this year's Budget documentation.  These included a description of the "Social Impact and Equality Analysis" in chapter five, of the Budget book, which sets out the stages in the budget process at which equality and distributional issues are explicitly addressed and outlines recent developments in these areas.</p>  <p>  My Department, independently and in conjunction with other Departments also conducts a series of analyses to examine the distributional impact of possible Budget options and of the final Budget package.  These provide an evidence base on equality issues, which can be integrated alongside other budgetary considerations.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Budget book contains a distributional analysis of budget measures on a variety of household types across a range of income levels.  Furthermore, the development of average effective tax rates and income tax progressivity issues are also considered in the accompanying material.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, the new Social Impact Assessment (SIA) framework, developed by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, in order to facilitate a more comprehensive assessment of budgetary policies on household living standards, is described in the 2017 Expenditure Report and accompanying papers.  This new SIA framework will complement the existing Department of Social Protection SIA publication which focuses on the effect of income tax and welfare measures using the ESRI's SWITCH model.  The new framework expands the assessment to consider the effects of expenditure on public services.  The first of the new SIA papers, examining the General Medical Services Scheme and Targeted Childcare Scheme, also accompany the Expenditure Report.</p>  <p>  Finally, I would like to reassure the Deputy that this Government takes consideration of equality issues very seriously.  This starts with Cabinet procedures requiring a whole range of impacts to be covered in every decision proposed to Government.  This ensures that the impact of policy proposals on gender equality, rural communities, North-South/East-West Relations, employment, persons experiencing or at risk of poverty or social exclusion, people with disabilities and industry costs are taken into account.</p></reply>

A previous Government reduced the salaries and allowances payable to all new entrants to public service recruitment grades by 10% with effect from 1 January 2011.  This decision also required that such new entrants would start on the first point of the applicable salary scale, which in the case of teachers had the effect of reducing their starting pay by a further 4-5%.  Later in 2011, the Government placed a cap on the overall level of qualification allowances that could be earned by teachers.</p>  <p>  Subsequently in 2012, following the public service-wide review of allowances, the Government withdrew qualification allowances for new teachers altogether.  However, the Government partially compensated for this by deciding that new entrant teachers would henceforth commence on a new salary scale which had a starting point higher than the starting point of the old scale.</p>  <p>  The recent agreement reached with TUI and INTO in effect reverses the decision to withdraw qualification allowances from post-1 February 2012 entrant teachers.  The estimated value of these increases over a teacher&rsquo;s career is &euro;135,000.  This new arrangement will apply to members of the teacher unions which have signed up to the Lansdowne Road Agreement i.e. TUI and INTO.</p>  <p>  When other Lansdowne Road increases are also factored in, there will be a 15% increase in the starting pay of new entrant teachers between 31 August 2016 and 1 January 2018 (from &euro;31,009 to &euro;35,602).  For an individual TUI/INTO member who started teaching in September 2015, they will see a 22% increase in their pay (including increment) between 31 August 2016 and 1 January 2018 (from &euro;31,009 to &euro;37,723).</p>  <p>  In addition to this, it must be borne in mind that the pay reduction for post-2011 entrants to the public service applied to all public servants and not just teachers, and that any restoration of these measures in respect of teachers would be expected to be applied elsewhere across the public service.  While I am not in a position to provide an estimate of the total cost of restoring all post-1 January 2011 entrants in all areas of the public service to the pre-2011 pay scale arrangements, I can say that in the case of education and training sector employees, including teachers, the estimated cost would be between &euro;65 and &euro;70 million per annum.  Clearly, the cost across the entire public service would be substantially higher.</p>  <p>  The agreement on new entrant pay shows what is possible through dialogue and negotiation within the Lansdowne Road Agreement.  The Government is wholly committed to the implementation of the Lansdowne Road Agreement as the most appropriate way for progress to be made on pay restoration and reform of our public services into the future.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Government has committed to establishing a Public Service Pay Commission to examine pay levels across the public service, including entry levels of pay.  The Government also supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants.</p></reply>

Therefore it is a matter for the institutes themselves to set admissions requirements for individual programmes of education and training and to ensure that students meet those requirements before commencing their studies.  However, I understand from Dublin Institute of Technology (DIT) that the following is the position in this instant case.</p><p>This case relates to a student wishing to progress onto a level 8 engineering programme following completion of a level 7 programme.  The conditions of entry are ratified by Engineers Ireland and stipulations are put in place to ensure that students progressing are likely to succeed in the higher level programmes.  To be eligible to progress to the level 8 programme, the prospective student with a Level 7 award, is required to meet one of four conditions, as set out below:</p><p>- An Upper Merit or Distinction (60 % or above) in the level 7 graduate award;</p><p>- A Lower Merit award (50-59 %) together with 70% or above in mathematics in the award year (Engineers Ireland criterion);</p><p>- A Lower Merit award (50-59 %) together with &amp;lt; 70 % in mathematics in the award year and a successful interview before a DIT panel.</p><p><i>Generally, the criterion here is that the applicant should demonstrate by their results in the award year of the ordinary degree and performance at interview that they are likely to succeed in the honours degree.  Aspects considered include (i) strong performance in mathematics and / or analytical modules (ii) an outstanding performance (in comparison with their peers) in the design project or electrical distribution and control and (iii) a Merit Upper or Distinction performance in a series of individual modules while not achieving Merit Upper or Distinction in the overall grade;</i></p><p>- For those returning with work experience but with Lower Merit and &amp;lt; 70 % in mathematics advanced entry is allowed provided candidates have (i) a minimum of one year (12 calendar months) post qualification relevant design experience (ii) a report (endorsed by their employer) detailing their experience in the discipline (iii) a successful interview before a DIT panel;</p><p>- Based on Level 7 results achieved, formal offers are made to eligible students for places on the level 8 programme during the summer - in 2016, offers were made by 01 July 2016, with acceptance required within two weeks of the offer.  Following acceptance of the offer, the students are then invited to register in time for the academic year.  In the case of students sitting supplemental exams, notification of such eligibility and offer of a place, where applicable, occurs mid September, i.e. after the commencement of the academic year;</p><p>In this specific case, the student did not meet the advanced entry criteria and thus was not offered a place or made eligible to register for the programme in the 2016/17 academic year.  Under the conditions of entry of the course the only option available to him was Option 4 as outlined above.  Furthermore, the assistance of the Careers Service in DIT has been made available to the student.</p></reply>

The increase in apprentice registration is primarily being driven by employers in the electrical, engineering and motor sectors, with modest growth occurring in the construction related apprenticeships.</p><p>The Programme for Government commits to providing 50,000 apprenticeship and traineeship places up to 2020.  SOLAS and the Apprenticeship Council are preparing a detailed 3 year plan to deliver on this commitment, which will include managing the pipeline of new apprenticeships and setting out the timing and nature of new calls for proposals.  This plan will be published shortly and will set out specific annual targets as well as bringing forward a range of specific actions to enable and support the development of new apprenticeships and traineeships.</p><p>A campaign to promote apprenticeship is currently being developed by SOLAS in consultation with key partners including the Apprenticeship Council.  The campaign will raise awareness and promote the value of apprenticeship for individual apprentices and for employers and it will cover both existing apprenticeships and the new apprenticeships now coming on stream.<table><tr><th>-</th><th><b>Forecast Registrations 2016</b></th><th><b> Actual Registrations as at October 31st '16</b></th><th><b>Forecast Registrations 2017</b></th><th><b>Forecast Registrations 2018</b></th><th><b>Forecast Registrations 2019</b></th><th><b>Forecast Registrations 2020</b></th></tr><tr><td>Construction </td><td>989</td><td>742</td><td>1319</td><td>1724</td><td>2024</td><td>2434</td></tr><tr><td>Electrical</td><td>1194</td><td>1241</td><td>1554</td><td>1659</td><td>1709</td><td>1754</td></tr><tr><td><b>ENGINEERING</b></td><td>537</td><td>392</td><td>512</td><td>542</td><td>577</td><td>622</td></tr><tr><td>Motor</td><td>662</td><td>626</td><td>750</td><td>760</td><td>765</td><td>765</td></tr><tr><td>Print Media</td><td>8</td><td>2</td><td>12</td><td>12</td><td>12</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td><b>OVERALL TOTAL</b></td><td><b> 3,390 </b></td><td><b> 3,003 </b></td><td><b> 4,147 </b></td><td><b>4,697 </b></td><td><b> 5,087 </b></td><td><b> 5,587 </b></td></tr></table></p></reply>

A new Repair and Leasing Scheme (RLS) has been developed to assist private property owners and local authorities or Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) to harness this potential, and bring these vacant houses into social housing use to provide homes for families on local authority waiting lists.</p><p>The new scheme was launched in Waterford and Carlow on a pilot basis in October, and depending on the take-up from private property owners, will be rolled out to further local authorities early in 2017.  The purpose of the pilot is to ensure that the scheme is workable from local authorities&rsquo; and AHBs&rsquo; perspectives. It is anticipated that other local authorities will come into the scheme on a rolling basis, with full roll-out expected within 6 months.  My Department is engaging with individual local authorities , including Louth County Council, in order to arrange a schedule for the roll-out of the new scheme nationally.</p><p>AHBs have a proven record in managing the refurbishment of properties and being good landlords puts them in an excellent position to play a key role in the success of the scheme. Several AHBs will be working together with Waterford and Carlow local authorities to manage the scheme in those particular areas.  As the scheme is rolled out in other local authority areas, more AHBs around the country will become involved with local authorities in the delivery of the scheme.</p><p>The scheme is targeted at owners of vacant properties who cannot afford or access the funding required to bring them up to the standard for rental property.  Subject to the suitability of the property for social housing, and the agreement of the property owner, the cost of the necessary repairs will be met up-front by the local authority or the AHB.  This allows for the property owner to sign-up to a lease arrangement for a length that is linked to the value of the repairs, subject to a minimum of 10 years.  The value of the repairs will then be offset incrementally against the agreed rental payment over a defined period within the lease.</p><p>A property owner can either choose to arrange a contractor to carry out the repairs themselves, or the local authority or AHB can arrange this instead.  Property owners will not be required to take on landlord responsibilities and the local authority or AHB will have on-going management and maintenance responsibilities in respect of the properties.</p><p>The local authority will determine the eligibility for the scheme having regard to the location and the suitability of the property for social housing and also taking into consideration the extent of the repairs that may be required.  The maximum costs of repairs allowable under this initiative will be &euro;40,000. </p><p>Early estimates are that at least 150 units will be secured in 2017 and up to 3,500 properties will be targeted over the next five years.  I have provided &euro;6 million in capital funding in 2017 for the cost of the repairs, and &euro;140 million over the lifetime of the <i>Rebuilding Ireland</i>Action Plan. </p></reply>

A planning authority may, for the purposes of section 180, hold a plebiscite to ascertain the wishes of the house-owners.</p><p>My Department, by way of Circular letter PD 1/2008 dated 26 February 2008, issued updated policy guidance to planning authorities on <i>Taking in Charge of Residential Developments/Management Arrangements</i>.  This advised each planning authority to develop or update, as appropriate, its policy on taking in charge by the end of June 2008, based on the following principles (among others):</p><p>-  Certain core facilities/infrastructure to be taken in charge on request</p><p>- public roads and footpaths, unallocated surface parking areas, public lighting, public water supply, foul and storm water drainage and public open spaces;</p><p>-  The procedures for taking in charge to begin promptly on foot of a request by the majority of the residents in the development or by the developer, as appropriate. Protocols, including time frames, must be set out by planning authorities to respond to requests for taking in charge.</p><p>Each planning authority&rsquo;s policy on taking in charge is required to be made available to the public and published on its website, and the policy is reported on to the elected members on a regular basis, and at least once annually.</p><p>In addition, my Department has launched in April 2016 a National Taking in Charge Initiative (NTICI) with a pilot scheme funding of &euro;10 million.  The aim of the NTICI is to accelerate the taking-in-charge process of housing estates and to develop new working methods from the pilot funding that can be deployed in tackling further taking-in-charge requirements into the future.</p><p>The initiative draws upon data gathered from each of the 31 local authorities and collated by my Department in December 2015, following which funding was allocated for a number of developments on the basis of proposals submitted to my Department by the local authorities.</p><p>The information collated in December 2015 indicated that of the 5,566 developments yet to be taken in charge, there are approximately 914 estates with developer-provided infrastructure (DPI) and work is continuing on finalising this figure.</p><p>Under the terms of the NTICI, only those developments subject to valid taking-in-charge applications were eligible for inclusion in the call for proposals for pilot funding, but it is my Department&rsquo;s intention that the knowledge and experience gained under the Initiative will be applied to deal with further estates to be taken in charge over time.</p><p>Further information on NTICI can be found on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: </p></reply>

The Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland report on the <i>Real Cost of New House Delivery</i>, published in May 2016, outlined the costs of delivering a 113 square metre 3-bed semi-detached house to the market based on a study of a number of projects in the Greater Dublin Area.</p><p>In addition to measures such as reduced development contributions, a development contribution rebate scheme, changes to the Part V regime and new apartment guidelines, the <i>Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness</i>published on 19 July 2016, sets out a broad range of further measures to tackle, among other things, some of the costs associated with the provision of housing in the interests of reducing construction overheads in order to facilitate an increased level of housing output into the future.</p><p>In particular, a &euro;200 million Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund (LIHAF) will provide much needed enabling infrastructure on key sites to open up lands for development from early 2017 onwards.  In addition, the NTMA, through the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF), is developing proposals to offer competitive financing on a commercial basis, and in line with ISIF&rsquo;s statutory mandate, to meet other infrastructure requirements on large development sites. </p><p>The Action Plan also contains a commitment to undertake a detailed analysis, in conjunction with the construction sector, to benchmark housing delivery input costs in Ireland. A working group, chaired by my Department, will begin work on this task over the coming weeks with representatives from the Construction Industry Council. </p><p>In the context of social housing provision, my Department undertakes analysis in respect of the average costs associated with the delivery of a range of differently sized social housing units, both in terms of construction costs and &lsquo;all-in&rsquo; costs.  These costs are based on an analysis of returned data from local authorities on social housing schemes.</p><p>My Department has also input into work led by the Department of Finance in relation to construction costs which was undertaken under the <i>Construction 2020</i>Strategy.  In addition, costs are examined in the context of proposed legislative changes, particularly in relation to Building Regulations and a cost benefit analysis and regulatory impact analysis is carried out on any proposed amendments. </p></reply>

A new Repair and Leasing Scheme (RLS) has been developed to assist private property owners and local authorities or Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) to harness this potential, and bring these vacant houses into social housing use to provide homes for families on local authority waiting lists.</p><p>The new scheme has just been launched in Waterford and Carlow on a pilot basis, and depending on the take-up from private property owners, will be rolled out to further local authorities early in 2017.  The purpose of the pilot is to ensure that the scheme is workable from local authorities&rsquo; and AHBs&rsquo; perspectives. It is anticipated that other local authorities will come into the scheme on a rolling basis, with full roll-out expected within 6 months.</p><p>AHBs have a proven record in managing the refurbishment of properties and being good landlords puts them in an excellent position to play a key role in the success of the scheme.  Several AHBs will be working together with Waterford and Carlow local authorities to manage the scheme in those particular areas.  As the scheme is rolled out in other local authority areas, more AHBs around the country will become involved with local authorities in the delivery of the scheme.</p><p>The scheme is targeted at owners of vacant properties who cannot afford or access the funding required to bring them up to the standard for rental property.  Subject to the suitability of the property for social housing, and the agreement of the property owner, the cost of the necessary repairs will be met up-front by the local authority or the AHB.  This allows for the property owner to sign-up to a lease arrangement for a length that is linked to the value of the repairs, subject to a minimum of 10 years.  The value of the repairs will then be offset incrementally against the agreed rental payment over a defined period within the lease.</p><p>A property owner can either choose to arrange a contractor to carry out the repairs themselves, or the local authority or AHB can arrange this instead.  Property owners will not be required to take on landlord responsibilities and the local authority or AHB will have ongoing management and maintenance responsibilities in respect of the properties.</p><p>The local authority will determine the eligibility for the scheme having regard to the location and the suitability of the property for social housing and also taking into consideration the extent of the repairs that may be required. The maximum costs of repairs allowable under this initiative will be &euro;40,000. </p><p>Early estimates are that at least 150 units will be secured in 2017 and up to 3,500 properties will be targeted over the next five years. I have provided &euro;6 million in capital funding in 2017 for the cost of the repairs, and &euro;140 million over the lifetime of the <i>Rebuilding Ireland</i>Action Plan. </p></reply>

They provide a mechanism by which developers can contribute to the cost of providing public infrastructure and facilities that benefit development in the area and are expended on public infrastructure defined under the Planning Acts.  These include the provision of open spaces, recreational and community facilities, roads, some water services, public transport, schools, school sites, broadband and flood relief works.  The adoption of these schemes is a reserved function of the locally elected members of each planning authority.  It is a matter for the members to determine (i) the level of contribution and the types of development to which they will apply and (ii) the expenditure of contributions within the confines of their scheme-conditions. </p><p>Arising from the Government&rsquo;s effort to meet commitments in relation to the general government deficit limit, the local government sector&rsquo;s impact on the General Government Balance (GGB) is currently required to deliver a neutral position each year.  The precise manner in which capital and current accounts are managed in order to achieve the overall balance necessary is a matter for individual local authorities themselves.  However, within these overall limits, there is additional capacity for new non-mortgage borrowing and the expenditure of capital balances on hand by local authorities, which must be sanctioned by my Department.  In reviewing requests for sanction, consideration is given to ensuring that priority infrastructural investment can proceed; that contractual commitments and on-going projects can proceed; and that development contributions already collected and aligned to specific capital projects can be utilised efficiently.  </p><p>Local authorities are obliged to include data on current and long-term development contribution debtors in their Annual Financial Statements.  As the audited figures for 2015 are not yet available, figures from the audited Annual Financial Statements for 2011 to 2014 are set out in the table below.</p><p>Current debtors are debts due within a year and are shown before any adjustment for bad debt provisions in the Annual Financial Statements.  Total bad debt provisions for all current debtors are reported within the notes to the Annual Financial Statements but do not separately identify the portion relating to current development contribution debtors.  Long term debtors are debts due in respect of periods greater than one year.  Long-term development contribution debtors are matched in the Annual Financial Statement by deferred income.  This acknowledges that the debts of long term debtors are not income in the current period, and are thus deferred to future periods and may or may not become due depending on the progress of individual developments.</p><p>It should be noted that local authorities operate on an accrual accounting basis and therefore recognise income as earned or billed and not just as cash received.  Audited data in relation to 2015 should be available later this year. <table><tr><th>-</th><th>-</th><th>2011 </th><th>2012 </th><th>2013 </th><th>2014 </th></tr><tr><td>Fingal County Council </td><td></td><td>&euro;</td><td>&euro;</td><td>&euro;</td><td>&euro;</td></tr><tr><td>Current Development Levy Debtors * </td><td></td><td>115,144,987 </td><td>101,864,648 </td><td>50,058,710 </td><td>53,678,246 </td></tr><tr><td>Long Term Development Levy Debtors ** </td><td></td><td>642,274 </td><td>834,106 </td><td>30,881,531 </td><td>5,455,117 </td></tr><tr><td>Dublin City Council </td><td></td><td>&euro;</td><td>&euro;</td><td>&euro;</td><td>&euro;</td></tr><tr><td>Current Development Levy Debtors * </td><td></td><td>38,470,033 </td><td>35,165,301 </td><td>22,227,479 </td><td>17,966,035 </td></tr><tr><td>Long Term Development Levy Debtors ** </td><td></td><td>48,456,370 </td><td>35,289,748 </td><td>15,155,717 </td><td>15,161,373 </td></tr></table></p><p>* Current Development Levy Debtors &ndash; Source: audited local authority Annual Financial Statements, Note 5</p><p>** Long Term Development Levy Debtors &ndash; Source: audited local authority Annual Financial Statements, Note 3 </p></reply>

The means test also ensures that the amount of rent supplement payable is appropriate to their family circumstances, less a minimum contribution that recipients are required to pay from their own resources.  The current weekly minimum contribution is &euro;30 for a single adult household and &euro;40 for coupled households.  Many recipients pay more than this amount because recipients are also required, subject to income disregards, to contribute any additional assessable means that they have over and above the appropriate basic SWA rate towards their accommodation costs. </p>  <p>  The rent supplement assessment provides for a gradual withdrawal of payment as hours of employment or earnings increase.  Income from employment and family income supplement </p>  <p>  (FIS) in excess of the standard SWA weekly rate of payment attract an additional income disregard and are assessed as follows; the first &euro;75 of such additional income together with 25% of any additional income above &euro;75 is disregarded for means assessment purposes. </p>  <p>  Persons in receipt of the One-Parent Family or Jobseeker's Transitional payments are not excluded from receiving rent supplement, however restrictions do exist in respect of persons engaged in full-time education.  In general, persons engaged in full-time education are excluded from receiving rent supplement.  It is the case that those participating in approved courses under the back-to-education allowance (BTEA) or the vocational training opportunities scheme (VTOS) may retain entitlement to rent supplement, subject to meeting all other conditions of the scheme. </p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s overall policy direction is to return rent supplement to its original purpose as short-term income support by transferring responsibility for persons with long-term housing needs to the local authorities under the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) under the auspices of the Department of Housing, Planning, Community &amp;amp; Local Government. </p>  <p>  Policy regarding the assessment of means under the HAP or the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) as operated by the local authorities is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This includes ensuring that applications are processed and that decisions on entitlement are made as quickly as possible.</p>  <p>  The current processing times for Carers Allowance (CA) applications is 14 weeks and for Domiciliary Care Allowance (DCA) applications is 16 weeks.  Both schemes have seen a considerable increase in applications in recent years.  Applications for DCA in 2015 were 33% higher than in 2013.  Applications for CA in 2015 were 25% higher than in 2013.  These increases, together with the need to introduce new revised decision making processes in early 2014, to demonstrate compliance with a High Court decision, have impacted on the volumes of applications processed within the set target.</p>  <p>  Reducing these waiting times is a priority for the Department and we are working hard to make this happen.  As part of its programme of service delivery modernisation, a range of initiatives aimed at streamlining the processing of claims, supported by modern technology, have been implemented by the Department in recent years.  Operational processes, procedures and the organisation of work are continually reviewed to ensure that processing capability is maximised. </p>  <p>  In addition, staffing needs are regularly reviewed, having regard to workloads and the competing demands arising, to ensure that the best use is made of all available resources.  Where additional staffing is deployed to a scheme, such as has happened for carer&rsquo;s allowance, there is a time-lag involved while those staff are trained and build up expertise.  The Department has seen a significant reduction in CA processing from 22 weeks at the end of May to 14 weeks at the end of September and expects the processing times for both schemes to reduce further, as recently assigned staff get up to speed with the work involved in claim processing.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

In addition to measures to tackle paramilitarism, criminality and organised crime through enhanced police and justice cooperation, the Agreement recognised that community engagement and support for change would be required.  This included a commitment to develop a strategy on disbanding paramilitary groups.</p>  <p>  Progress on implementing the provisions of the Fresh Start and Stormont House Agreements are considered at quarterly review meetings. These are attended by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, the First and deputy First Ministers and, where relevant to her portfolio, the Northern Ireland Minister for Justice.  I represent the Government at these meetings.  The last review was held on 29 June 2016, with dates for the next meeting under active discussion. </p>  <p>  The June quarterly review meeting discussed the report of a three-person panel, established on foot of the Fresh Start Agreement to recommend the elements of a strategy for the disbandment of paramilitary groups. This panel, comprising Lord John Alderdice, Monica McWilliams, and John McBurney, made over forty recommendations.  The Northern Ireland Executive updated the review meeting on its then draft Action Plan to take these recommendations forward.   In July, the Northern Ireland Executive published its Action Plan on Tackling Paramilitary Activity, Criminality and Organised Crime. </p>  <p>  The Northern Ireland Executive is committed to carrying out research into the social costs and implications of paramilitarism; to undertake a public awareness campaign on the harms done by paramilitarism and organised crime; and to report on efforts to tackle paramilitarism which will be linked to wider cross-Departmental and statutory agency work programmes aimed at reducing community divisions and the causes of sectarianism.</p>  <p>  Under the Fresh Start Agreement, the UK Government committed to providing an additional &pound;25 million over five years to tackle continuing paramilitary activity, with the Northern Ireland Executive to match this amount.  I understand that the Northern Ireland Executive has already begun its drawdown towards implementation of the Action Plan and related commitments.</p>  <p>  On 13 September, I signed an international agreement with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland to establish the Independent Reporting Commission (IRC), which the Fresh Start Agreement states will report annually on the progress towards ending continuing paramilitary activity connected with Northern Ireland.

On 27 October 2016, officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade met with a representative of the Irish Falun Dafa Association and two human rights defenders during which the issue of organ harvesting was discussed.</p>  <p>  Human rights issues are discussed on a regular basis with the Chinese authorities during both bilateral and multilateral meetings, including during the visit of Premier Li Keqiang to Ireland in May 2015.</p>  <p>  Through the formal framework of the EU-China Human Rights Dialogue, which was established in 1995, the EU continues to share with China its experience in the field of human rights protection and promotion, and to urge China to take clear steps to improve the human rights situation.  The latest session of this dialogue took place on 30 November and 1 December 2015, and provided the EU with the opportunity to express its concerns about a wide range of human rights issues in China, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities, freedom of religion or belief, freedom of assembly and association, arbitrary detention, torture and the death penalty.  The individual case of Gao Zhisheng, a human rights defender detained for denouncing the persecution of practitioners of Falun Gong, was also raised at the dialogue.  Most recently, human rights issues were discussed at the 18th EU-China Summit which was held in Beijing on 12-13 July 2016. The next session of the EU-China Human Rights Dialogue is scheduled to take place before the end of 2016.  The matter of alleged organ harvesting in China is due to be among the range of topics which will be discussed.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that the Chinese Government denies accusations of human rights abuses against those who practice Falun Gong.  It should also be noted that China has embarked on reforms in the area of organ donation with a view to stamping out illegal and unethical practices.  However, the Embassy of Ireland in Beijing, in cooperation with our EU partners, is monitoring the Chinese reform efforts in the area of organ donation.</p>  <p>  Trafficking of human organs is a deplorable activity which has developed into a global problem which violates the fundamental human rights and dignity of individuals.  International cooperation is the only way to combat this crime, prosecute those behind it and protect vulnerable citizens who may be at risk of becoming victims of trafficking in human organs.  In 2015 Ireland signed the Council of Europe Convention against Trafficking in Human Organs.</p>  <p>  The Irish Government, together with our EU partners, will continue to address human rights issues with China, in frequent and regular dialogue, through our contacts in both Dublin and Beijing and through the relevant multilateral channels.</p></reply>

This is a targeted measure, aimed at those who drink in a harmful and hazardous manner, and designed to prevent the sale of alcohol at very cheap prices.  MUP is able to target cheaper alcohol relative to its strength because the minimum price is determined by and is directly proportional to the amount of pure alcohol in the drink.</p>  <p>  My Department is in contact with its counterparts in the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety on the matter.

However, on the more general issue, I can confirm that the population of Wexford have access to a Catherisation Laboratory in University Hospital Waterford (UHW), or St James's or St Vincent's Hospitals in Dublin.    </p>  <p>  The Deputy will, of course, be aware that an independent clinical review of the need for a 2nd Catherisation Laboratory in UHW was published recently.  That review, which was undertaken by Dr Niall Herity a Belfast based cardiologist, looked at the population of the South East and examined hospital admissions for cardiac catherisation and percutaneous coronary intervention, by county of residence.  The report indicates that some 69% of patients from Wexford, who require coronary procedures, attend UHW.  In that context, the Deputy may wish to note that implementation of the recommendations of the Herity Report will enhance the cardiology services for patients in the region, by increasing the number of weekly sessions currently provided in UHW which will address waiting times and provide improved access.  The additional investment required to implement the report is being considered in the context of the National Service Plan 2017.</p></reply>

Key priorities to be addressed in the HSE's 2017 Service Plan include youth mental health, further improvement to child &amp;amp; adolescent and adult services, older people's services and further enhanced out of hours response for those in need of urgent services.  Recognising the time lag in new staff taking up posts and the completion of preparations for the introduction of these services, it is estimated that the revenue spend in 2017 associated with this increased allocation will be some &euro;15 million.  There will also be a further additional spend of &euro;9.7 million in mental health associated with increased pay rates. </p></reply>

This commitment is outlined in the Programme for Partnership Government, which is guided by two principles: equality of opportunity and improving the quality of life for people with disabilities. </p>  <p>  In June 2011, the Report &ldquo;Time to Move on from Congregated Settings&rdquo; was published by the Health Service Executive (HSE), which identified that in 2008 approximately 4000 individuals with disabilities lived in congregated type settings.  These are places where ten or more people reside in a single living unit or are campus based.  It found that, notwithstanding the commitment and initiative of dedicated staff and management, there were a significant number of people still experiencing institutional living conditions where they lacked basic privacy and dignity, and lived their lives apart from any community and family. </p>  <p>  Currently, 2725 people live in congregated settings and our objective is to reduce this figure by one-third by 2021 and ultimately, to eliminate all congregated settings. </p>  <p>  St John of God Services in Kerry has been identified as one of the priority sites for de-congregation.  The HSE is committed to working with St John of God Services to transition 17 residents in ward style accommodation from the current unsuitable accommodation on campus to more appropriate settings in the local community.  Comprehensive transition plans will ensure that there is extensive engagement with the person themselves, their families, carers and advocates, as well as the service provider, to ensure successful and sustainable transitions into the community.</p>  <p>  Some of the existing residents will benefit from greater opportunities to participate in local communities and will, over time and with proper planning, move to living in the community.  It is important to point out that it is Government and HSE policy to move on from these congregated settings in the best interests of patients but this will be done in a planned and phased way and with due regard to the personal choices of every individual.  The welfare and dignity of residents is absolutely paramount, and the needs of the individual will be the first consideration.</p>  <p>  The focus of the HSE has been on enhancing the quality of life of residents and highlighting the residents who would most obviously benefit from the opportunity to move to community living.  In doing so, the HSE are recognising that for some individuals with significant disabilities, this move presents greater challenges and will not be considered for some time. </p>  <p>  The Chief Officer has arranged to meet in early November with St John of God management to ensure that communication and engagement with families is improved and that the appropriate discovery processes are in place in advance of plans for any individuals to move to community living, and with the family representatives group to ensure their concerns are being heard and that there is a process in place to work together with them and the service provider into the future in the best interests of the residents. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the appropriate level of engagement is now underway between St John of Gods and the HSE with the residents, their advocates, and their families.  It would be appropriate to allow this process to conclude before considering a visit to the Beaufort campus.</p>  <p>  As the HSE is responsible for leading out on the recommendations on "Time to Move on from Congregated Settings - A Strategy for Community Inclusion", I have arranged for the Deputy's question to be referred to the HSE for direct reply to the Deputy.</p></reply>

At present, that means an upper limit of &euro;177.60 per week. </p>  <p>  -  Secondly, the charges are structured to ensure that those paying them retain a reasonable income for personal use: at least &euro;33 per week for those paying Class 1 rates and at least &euro;64 per week for those paying Class 2 rates. </p>  <p>  -  Thirdly, the Act provides that the HSE may reduce or waive a charge imposed on a person if necessary to avoid undue financial hardship. </p>  <p>  To assist in the fair application of the provisions of the 2005 Act and Regulations, the HSE has developed national guidelines for the determination of long-stay charges for inpatient services.  These include the need to have regard to the individual circumstances of each service user and his or her dependants.  The guidelines ensure that the applicable charge is determined taking account of each person&rsquo;s income and necessary outgoings while receiving care, including reasonable regular financial commitments.  This avoids any unfair burden on the service user or his or her dependants.</p>  <p>  As the issue raised by the Deputy relates to an individual case, this is a service matter for the Health Service Executive.  I have asked the HSE to look into the particular matter raised and to reply directly to the Deputy.  If you have not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days please contact my private office and they will follow up the matter with them.</p></reply>

Hospital Groups must increasingly focus on networks of service provision with smaller hospitals managing routine, urgent or planned care locally, more complex care managed in the larger hospitals and better linkages with primary, continuing and social care.</p>  <p>  A number of developments at the hospital have been funded in recent years including the refurbishment of the Emergency Department and upgrade of general theatres and Central Sterile Services.  There has also been an increase in day surgical activity, with surgeons from the Mater Misercordiae University Hospital carrying out day surgery in Navan.  Further developments in relation to surgery and other clinical services are being considered by the Group.  There is significant potential for enhancing the hospital&rsquo;s role as a constituent hospital within the Hospital Group. As a smaller hospital, the challenge is to make sure that Navan provides more of the right type of services, which can safely be delivered, so that we maximise the benefit to patients.  </p>  <p>  Any proposed change to services provided at Navan Hospital, will need to take account of existing patient flows, demands in other hospitals and the need to develop particular services in the context of overall service reorganisation in the Hospital Group. </p></reply>

I am advised that an appeal was received by the Agriculture Appeals Office for the person concerned on 2 December 2015 in relation to non-valuation aspects of the On-Farm Valuation Scheme for TB and Brucellosis Reactors.  An oral hearing was held on 25 May 2016 and the person named was notified in writing on 14 July 2016 that the appeal was partially allowed.  Following that decision my Department requested a review of the Appeals Officer's decision.  Under the provisions of the Appeals legislation, the independent review may only be performed by the Director of Agriculture Appeals.  There are a number of appeals currently requiring independent review by the Director and I am informed that every effort is being made to ensure the expeditious finalisation of such reviews. </p></reply>

The objective of the review was to deliver a policy which would ensure an economically and biologically sustainable fishery.  As a result 20 sets of proposals and comments in relation to herring stocks management were received.  It was very clear from this that there was no agreement within the industry as to how the future herring fishing opportunities should be managed.  Taking account as far as possible of the views of stakeholders, a draft policy document was  prepared and published for consultation.  49 submissions were received, again often conflicting and a further meeting with  those who had made submissions was held in February 2012 regarding the draft policy, again there was no consensus.  </p>  <p>  Having considered all views and having regard to the sustainability of the fisheries, the Minister came to a decision setting down a detailed policy, which I believe provides for the proper and effective management and conservation and rational exploitation of the herring stocks.  In order to provide for the needs of inshore herring fishers, which did not have the required track record under the policy, smaller vessels under 20m in length have access to an open herring  fishery in the North West of up to 5% of the Area 6A South adjusted quota.  </p>  <p>  Periodic allocations are made available for operators covered by these arrangements.  When there is a commercial  TAC set for the area, each month I would expect to receive recommendations from industry representatives at the Quota Management Advisory Committee in relation to the monthly amounts available to the small boat herring fisheries. </p>  <p>  The International Council for the Exploration of the Seas - ICES recommended a Zero Total Allowable Catch in area 6A South in 2015 and initially in 2016.  In order to provide for the collection of scientific data, the EU Council set a TAC of 1,630 tonnes for Area 6A South, involving an Irish quota of 1,482t. </p>  <p>  A public consultation took place on a recommendation from the four Producer Organisations and the Inshore Fisheries Forum to provide for the necessary scientific data sampling.  Having considered all submissions made, I approved the industry recommendation.  Allocations made on this basis in 2016 are done on an exceptional basis for data collection purposes.  If a non scientific TAC is set in future years the arrangements set down in the 2012 herring policy will continue to apply.</p></reply>

One of my priorities is to support the provision of lower-cost flexible finance so I was pleased to announce plans for a &euro;150 million fund for 'Agri Cash Flow Support' as part of the recent Budget. </p>  <p>  The provision of &euro;11.1 million in EU funding for milk and other livestock farmers under the exceptional adjustment aid package, will be supplemented by &euro;14 million in national funding from my Department. The &euro;25 million total will enable the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) to leverage a fund of &euro;150 million, thereby maximising the support for farmers from the available public funding.  The extra national funding will enable loans to be made available to non-livestock sectors, including tillage and horticulture, under &ldquo;de minimis&rdquo; State Aid provisions.</p>  <p>  This fund will support highly flexible loans for up to six years, for amounts up to &euro;150,000, at an interest rate of 2.95%, which will represent a significant saving to farmers when compared with other forms of finance currently available.  The loan fund is part of a &ldquo;three pillar strategy&rdquo; in response to income volatility that I announced in the recent Budget, along with additional tax measures and farm payments. </p>  <p>Further details of the loan fund will be provided shortly but it is expected that it will be operational as soon as possible.  The SBCI will make an open call for lending institutions to participate and I have spoken to the main banks to encourage them to make this facility available to their customers. Normal lending assessment criteria will apply although the loans will be &lsquo;unsecured&rsquo; in nature, thereby facilitating a more straightforward application process. </p></reply>

Specifically, the Regulations provide for the quotas of fish that can be harvested by commercial fishing engines and rod and line from those rivers identified in the Schedule to the Regulations.</p>  <p>  The Wild Salmon and Sea Trout Tagging Scheme Regulations are revised on an annual basis, taking account of advice from Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI), the Standing Scientific Committee for Salmon (SSCS) and any submissions received from the 30 day public consultation.</p>  <p>  I will be commencing the 30 day public consultation for the 2017 Regulations later this month in order to facilitate a suite of new secondary legislation regulating Ireland&rsquo;s wild salmon and sea trout fishery being in place for 1 January 2017.</p>  <p>  In 2006 the Government affirmed its commitment to manage the wild salmon fishery in line with the scientific advice from 2007 onwards in the interests of conservation of stocks. International best practice for the management of Atlantic Salmon requires the adoption of the precautionary approach and the cessation of indiscriminate mixed stock fisheries.  Since 2007, the harvest of salmon, by commercial and recreational (angling) means, has been restricted to those stocks of rivers that are meeting their conservation limits. </p>  <p>  The individual river management strategy is based on the fact that each of Ireland&rsquo;s salmon rivers has its own unique stock of salmon which migrates to sea as juveniles and returns to the same river in adulthood to spawn and create the next generation of fish exclusive to that river. Fisheries are only considered in rivers where the estimated returns are above the conservation limit for the river. </p>  <p>  The SSCS is a statutorily independent committee comprised of scientists from IFI, Bord Iascaigh Mhara, the Loughs Agency, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the Marine Institute, the Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute (Northern Ireland), and other State bodies and third level institutions.  The SSCS provides independent advice to IFI as regards the annual individual stock assessments for Ireland&rsquo;s wild salmon rivers.  This independent scientific advice underpins the management decisions and advice of IFI as regards all aspects of the angling and commercial season for salmon on an individual river basis.</p>  <p>  The model and processes used by the SSCS are recognised internationally as best practice. Delegations from a number of countries have visited IFI and the SSCS to examine and seek to learn from the Irish approach to Salmon management. The North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organisation (NASCO) also recognises Ireland as a leader in this area.</p>  <p>  The commercial (draftnet and snapnet) season commences in May each year and conservation measures for the fishery (including the determination of the number of licences available) will be introduced in advance of the season under the Control of Fishing for Salmon Order and associated bye-laws.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.  This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment by the telecommunications sector and through a State intervention in those areas where commercial investment has not  been fully demonstrated. The Programme for a Partnership Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.  The  formal procurement process for the State Intervention commenced in December 2015.  The High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at shows the extent of the State Intervention area:</p><p>- The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have previously indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services. </p><p>- The areas marked AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the target areas for the State Intervention which are the subject of the current procurement process. </p><p>The townlands of Newtownwhite and Ballysakerry in County Mayo fall within the AMBER area and therefore will be part of the State Intervention procurement process.  Individuals can check whether their premises is in a BLUE or an AMBER area by scrolling through the map online or entering their Eircode.  The Department also has a dedicated mailbox and anyone with a query in relation to the Map should email the Department, quoting their Eircode, to </p><p>The Department is now in a formal procurement process to select a company or companies to roll-out a new high speed broadband network in the State Intervention Area comprising over 750,000 premises including over 50,000 premises in County Mayo, covering 100,000km of road network and 96% of the land area of Ireland.  Since bidders were invited to participate in dialogue with the Department, there have been approximately 150 hours of meetings, with considerable more interaction to follow over the coming months.  In the course of this dialogue, the three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution.  Householders and businesses may potentially get speeds not just of 30Mbps but up to 1000 Mbps with businesses potentially availing of symmetrical upload and download speeds.</p><p>Earlier this year, before I came into office, the Department announced that it would be June 2017 before contract(s) were awarded under the NBP.  The bidders in the process have recently indicated that they may need more time to conclude the procurement process.  The timing of each stage of the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team, and bidders, during the procurement process.  Bidders need adequate time to prepare detailed proposals and their final formal bids and get the relevant shareholder and funding approvals at key stages of the process.  It is also important to ensure that risks in this multi-million euro procurement are carefully managed.  I do not propose to comment any further at this juncture, given that discussions are ongoing in the procurement process.  I can assure the Deputy however, that the procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years.  The Government considers the NBP to be one of the most significant investments in rural Ireland for decades, and one which will transform society, akin to rural electrification in the last century.  </p><p>During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated that it could take 3-5 years to roll out a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP.  It is however open to bidder(s) to suggest more aggressive timescales as part of their bids. </p><p>As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best roll-out strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and-or high demand.  This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network roll-out plan.  A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  A detailed roll-out plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place.</p><p>The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the roll-out of the network once a contract is awarded. In this regard, Minister Humphreys is leading on the establishment of two regional action groups, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices and other relevant agencies to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded.  </p></reply>

The power station is a Heavy Fuel Station that commenced operations in 1969 under the ownership of the ESB and was originally scheduled to close in 2010 due to its advanced age, inefficiency and its use of a heavily polluting fuel.  Before its closure, it was purchased by Endesa who sought and were granted planning permission to develop and build a modern and efficient electricity power plant fuelled by gas.  That company subsequently sold the plant to SSE. </p>  <p>  In the liberalised energy market, it is a commercial decision for the company to take in regard to the future of the plant.

It is necessary to have a standardised and up to date inventory of these assets, and I understand Local Authorities are well advanced on this task. Good progress has also been made on the critical issue of the technical specifications for these upgrades by the CCMA, TII and ESB Networks.  This work is allowing the CCMA to proceed with designing a national procurement of energy efficiency upgrades. </p>  <p>  The action to which the Deputy refers was part of an earlier, exploratory, phase of the strategy to upgrade public lighting.  The strategy has now evolved from this regional project to a coordinated national approach.  Such an approach is necessary to develop optimal technical solutions, achieve economies of scale in procurement and ensure that, as one of the largest users of energy in the public sector, Local Authorities make their contribution to the achievement of the target on the public sector to improve its energy efficiency by 33% by 2020. </p></reply>

There have been instances in recent years whereby some commercial services have been reconfigured leaving certain  areas without the desired level of public transport provision.  In  response, the NTA has used its powers under the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008 to ensure continued public transport services through the provision of subvented Public Service Obligation (PSO) services.</p></reply>

I have already stated that I will bring the report to Cabinet and then immediately arrange for its publication and commencement of a public consultation process to be conducted by the National Transport Authority.  I intend to do so next week.</p>  <p>  The review identifies a funding gap for Irish Rail based on the projected allocations prior to Budget 2017. In the meantime, decisions on Budget 2017 provide for additional funding of over &euro;50 million to Irish Rail next year.</p>  <p>  This significant increase in funding for next year allows for increasing investment in maintenance and renewal of the network and the rolling stock, and also to provide more funding for safety projects.  It is also encouraging to note that Irish Rail is experiencing business growth with increasing passenger journeys.  The re-opening of the Phoenix Park tunnel in the coming weeks for commuter services from the Kildare line to the stations between Connolly and Grand Canal Dock and the expansion of DART services to a ten minute frequency will also help to grow the business.</p>  <p>  While there has been much speculation regarding the future of individual rail lines, I want to stress that no decisions will be taken on any of the options identified in the Review in advance of the full process of public consultation.  The public consultation will give the public and other interested parties the opportunity to see the analysis on rail funding and to contribute to all aspects of the debate on the future of rail.</p></reply>

There are currently approximately 853,000 customers with direct eligibility with an annual allocation of &euro;80 million.</p>  <p>  In 2012, the Department of Social Protection set up an interdepartmental working group to review the free travel scheme.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-11-03a.555.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1272" speakername="Pat Breen" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016110300060#WRH05800"><p>The Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) was established to reduce inordinate delays of up to 2 years in the hearing of cases in some bodies that it replaced, and remove the dysfunction of having multiple first instance avenues of redress for the same workplace incident.  This reform was overdue. Established on 1 October last year, the WRC incorporates the functions of the Labour Relations Commission (including the Rights Commissioner Service), the Equality Tribunal, the Employment Appeals Tribunal (first instance jurisdiction), and the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA).  All first instance complaints are now dealt with by the WRC.</p>  <p>  The collective and specialist services of the Commission all play a vital role in contributing towards industrial peace, public service reform, maintaining and sustaining enterprise efficiency and productivity and engaging with employers and trade unions on issues of employee pay and rewards.  Ensuring fair, impartial, effective employment rights and adjudication services, together with appropriate levels of enforcement are vital and important components of a well-functioning and fair labour market.</p>  <p>  It is worth noting that the WRC has been successful in resolving a number of high profile disputes over the past year and that overall the Conciliation Service enjoys a success rate of over 80 per cent.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, over the last year:</p>  <p>  -  the Inspection Services of the WRC has undertaken around 3,400 inspections and recovered nearly one million Euro in unpaid wages for employees;  </p>  <p>  -  the WRC information service has handled 50,000 calls from individuals looking for assistance on specific employment rights;  </p>  <p>  -  the Adjudication Service has received almost 14,000 specific complaints and held over 2,600 hearings with individual complainants about breaches of their employment rights.  Complainants are receiving a hearing on average between 12 and 16 weeks of sending in the complaint and a decision on average 8 weeks later.  Requests by parties or their representatives to delay the scheduling of a hearing, pending the availability of key witnesses or to facilitate discussions regarding a potential settlement, are outside the control of the WRC, but obviously can impact on timelines for hearings. </p>  <p>  -  the Service has also reduced by almost a half the number of inherited complaints. </p>  <p>  While there has been some comment about initial teething problems with the administration of the Adjudication Service, I am satisfied that overall, stakeholders are very supportive of the WRCs multi-year programme of change approach and that the WRC is fully committed to working through, in a constructive manner any issues that arise as the new structures continue to bed down.</p></reply>

By encouraging the development of new economic activities, Research, Development and Innovation policy-measures strengthen Ireland&rsquo;s competitive advantage and build potential new areas of economic activity.  The impacts of our investment in innovation and research include increased competitiveness, the creation and maintenance of high-value jobs and the attraction of foreign direct investment.</p><p>We know that investment in R&amp;amp;D translates into improved job creation and enterprise performance.  Firms that invested in R&amp;amp;D grew employment by 14% between 2000 and 2014 while those that did not invest in R&amp;amp;D saw employment decline by 40%.  Similarly, R&amp;amp;D performing companies grew exports by 181% between 2003 and 2014 compared to a loss of 42% in exports for non-R&amp;amp;D performing companies over the same period.</p><p>Innovation 2020 the Government&rsquo;s strategy for research and development, science and technology emphasises the importance of innovation and technology in driving productivity growth and fostering competitiveness in a global market place.  The strategy also calls attention to the role of innovation in contributing to employment, export and investment growth, as well as to the competitiveness of indigenous enterprise and in attracting and embedding Foreign Direct Investment in Ireland.</p><p>Enterprise Ireland (EI) plays a particularly important role in supporting job creation in Ireland. In 2015 EI helped in the maintenance and creation of 300,000 Irish jobs both directly and in-directly.  Support for innovation and technology played a crucial role in delivering this result. </p><p>Enterprise Ireland offers commercialisation and technology transfer supports directed at generating spinout companies, boosting entrepreneurship and increasing licensing into industry.  These supports include EI&rsquo;s Commercialisation Fund and Campus Incubators as well as the Technology Transfer Strengthening Initiative which is overseen by Knowledge Transfer Ireland.</p><p>In addition, Enterprise Ireland operates a range of supports to help companies engage with third level researchers to undertake collaborative research for the benefit of companies.  These collaborations are delivering impact and creating significant opportunities.  A direct correlation has been found between collaboration activities, increased entrepreneurship and quantifiable increases in job creation. </p><p>Enterprise Ireland supports collaboration activities through a number of its initiatives - innovation voucher schemes, innovation partnerships, Technology Centres and Technology Gateways.  In 2015 Enterprise Ireland supported 896 collaborative projects between business and Higher Education. </p><p>Enterprise Ireland has recently launched its Small Business Innovation Research Initiative (SBIR), a mechanism which enables public sector bodies to connect with innovative ideas and technologies, to provide novel solutions for specific public sector challenges and needs. SBIR is particularly suited to small and medium-sized business as contracts are of relatively low value and operate in short timescales.  </p><p><b></b>IDA Ireland&rsquo;s main objective is to encourage investment into Ireland by foreign-owned companies.  Investments approved by IDA Ireland in the first half of 2016 will lead to the creation of 9,100 jobs as companies roll out their plans over the coming months and years. This performance is on a par with the first half of 2015 which was one of Ireland&rsquo;s best years for Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). </p><p>The area of research, development and innovation (RDI) is of strategic importance to IDA Ireland.  A company decision to invest in RDI may be to support improvement in productivity; to develop a strengthened reputation for quality or to develop new products and services.</p><p>IDA Ireland&rsquo;s strategy Winning FDI 2015-2019 outlines a plan to support clients in creating 80,000new jobs and increase employment in the client portfolio to 209,000 by 2019.  Support for RDI will be key to achieving these targets. Research, development and innovation investments not only embed existing FDI operations and employment but pave the way for future investment, job creation and export growth.  As the global battle for FDI intensifies, our investment in research and development will become even more critical to attracting and retaining FDI companies. </p><p>The increase in RDI investment since 2000 has improved our attractiveness as an FDI location. 60% (just under &euro;60m) of IDA&rsquo;s total grant-aid budget is allocated to RDI projects each year.  This investment leverages RDI expenditure of &euro;500m by IDA clients for these approved projects and an overall annual spend by MNCs of &euro;1.4bn per annum on RDI.  This has the effect of anchoring FDI clients and securing sustainable employment and related benefits to the Irish economy.</p><p>The National Support System for Horizon 2020, the EU Framework Programme for research and innovation, is coordinated by Enterprise Ireland.  Horizon 2020 is part of the drive to create new growth and jobs in Europe, has a budget of almost &euro;75 billion and runs over the period 2014-2020.  Both Ireland&rsquo;s indigenous and FDI companies are active users of Horizon 2020.  Irish companies that compete successfully for funding from Horizon 2020 will boost their innovative capability and competitiveness which in turn will deliver strong national economic impacts, including job creation. </p><p>Demand for the Framework Programme from Irish companies has been high.  In the first 33 months Ireland's draw down was &euro;336.6 million, placing Ireland on target to meet its goal of securing &euro;1.25bn from Horizon 2020 by 2020.  Of this funding, over &euro;104 million went to companies and &euro;73.6 million of this went to SMEs.  Ireland has the highest success rate in Europe for the Horizon 2020 SME Instrument with a 16% success rate, compared to a European average of 6%. Innovative Irish SMEs have secured &euro;26.5 million.  Enterprise Ireland client companies account for 56% of all company funding with IDA Ireland clients securing 21%.</p><p>70% of the Horizon 2020 budget (&euro;52 billion) is to be allocated between 2017 and 2020, which gives Irish companies the opportunity to continue availing of these supports. </p><p>The recent national ex-post evaluation of the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development (FP7) estimated that the European Commission contribution of &euro;625M to Ireland from 2007 to 2013 would lead to an estimated 2,000 jobs created per year.  It is expected that such figures will grow considerably in the context of Ireland&rsquo;s current target to double participation in the period 2014-2020.</p></reply>

Our aim is that Ireland will be recognised as the place where businesses are innovative, competitive and productive &ndash; leading to growth that is sustainable and results in employment opportunities and a higher standard of living for all.  These strategies set out the framework for investment over the coming decade to ensure that Ireland remains equally attractive to foreign direct investment and to Irish entrepreneurs and growth businesses in the context of an intensely competitive international environment. </p>  <p>  The KDB complements the existing suite of initiatives and supports available to companies that undertake R&amp;D activities in Ireland across the lifecycle of research and development &ndash; including R&amp;D tax credits, RD&amp;I grant supports, support for technology acquisition (S291A), significant state investments in National Research Centres and knowledge transfer infrastructures, and advisory supports for accessing Horizon 2020 funding &ndash; providing a competitive proposition for business investment. </p>  <p>  The OECD nexus approach sets out the principles and guidelines under which income arising from IP assets can qualify for a lower rate of tax under a KDB initiative.  Ireland&rsquo;s KDB rate is 6.25 percent (half of the corporation tax rate of 12.5 percent) and is internationally competitive. </p>  <p>  I received Cabinet approval last week for the publication of a Bill entitled Knowledge Development Box (Certification of Inventions) Bill 2016 to allow small and medium sized companies to avail of the Knowledge Development Box.  Under the new scheme, the Patents Office will be the body certifying applications for inventions under the new certification scheme to check that they meet the criteria of being novel, useful and non-obvious.</p>  <p>  The Bill is intended to open up the opportunity for companies across a broad spectrum to pay lower taxes on profits from Irish-based research and development activities.  This includes companies in incubation units right through to high-potential start-ups in all industry sectors once they are generating income resulting from research and development activities. The scheme should serve to significantly boost Irish innovation and investment in research and development. </p></reply>

Ireland&rsquo;s corporate tax rate of 12.5% on trading income is an important part of the Government&rsquo;s strategy of creating an enterprise friendly environment to support enterprise and entrepreneurship and to attract jobs and investment to Ireland, countrywide.  The 12.5% rate is absolutely written in stone.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s international tax strategy (October 2016) states that the cornerstone of our competitive offering remains the 12.5% Corporation Tax rate.  Our 12.5% corporate tax is underpinned by a competitive regime. Our world class research and development tax credit and our best in class OECD compliant knowledge development box are there to make sure that we are competitive. Our low rate applied to a broad base ensures sustainable economic growth which will maintain tax revenues. Our corporate tax trading rate 12.5% applies to a broad base to ensure sustainable economic growth which will maintain tax revenues. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that tax is but one part of Ireland&rsquo;s enterprise policy and our ability to attract foreign direct investment, to stimulate entrepreneurship and to support Irish owned enterprises in their ambition to internationalise and to scale. Our investments in developing our RD&amp;I infrastructures, in our education system and in helping to create attractive places throughout Ireland in which to invest, live and work are all part of Ireland&rsquo;s offering. Over the past decades, Ireland has built a comparative advantage in a number of sectors, including ICT, Medical Devices, Biopharma and a strong international reputation in Food, Business Services and Internationally Traded Financial Services. Our national enterprise policy, Enterprise 2025, has set out a clear vision and suite of actions to ensure that future economic growth and investment is sustainable over the longer term &ndash; built on the foundations of competitiveness, innovation and productivity.    </p></reply>

ITI assists businesses, both north and south, to help foster growth and job creation through the provision of various enterprise programmes.  ITI will also have an important role to play in the time ahead in helping companies involved in cross-border trade to address and overcome any hurdles associated with Brexit. </p>  <p>  With regard to attracting Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), IDA Ireland and Invest Northern Ireland (INI) do in some instances compete to win new projects, just as they compete with other investment promotion authorities from all over the world.  However, both Agencies also have a track record of working together, including cooperating on company visits where both jurisdictions are being considered by foreign companies.  Furthermore, given that both our economies have highly educated and talented workforces, the IDA highlights this to prospective investors considering locating or expanding in the border area.  In this way, the skills pool available on both side of the border is therefore an advantage for both jurisdictions when it comes to securing new investment on the island of Ireland.   </p></reply>

Inadequate investment can dampen productivity growth, increase costs and limit regional and sector opportunities for indigenous enterprise development and for FDI.  However, investment in infrastructures throughout the country has suffered during the economic downturn and needs to be redressed.</p><p>The reality is that we operate within EU fiscal rules and macro-economic stability remains key.  Nevertheless and notwithstanding the welcome additional commitment to capital investment in Budget 2017, planned investment over the immediate term remains lower than we would like. In this context, our priorities must focus on the needs of the productive enterprise sector, to: </p><p>-protect prior investment in infrastructure (maintenance; asset renewal);</p><p>-address infrastructure bottlenecks which hinder productive activity;</p><p>-minimise the likelihood of new bottlenecks emerging; and </p><p>-provide additional infrastructure capacity and/or improved services in areas of likely economic development. </p><p>Taken together, this will help unlock the potential of the regions throughout Ireland  .</p><p>My Department plays a key role in advocating on behalf of enterprise to ensure that enterprise infrastructure needs are identified and investment prioritised.  My Departments and its agencies are continually engaged with relevant stakeholders on the particular infrastructure needs required to support enterprise development and job creation &ndash; both nationally and through mechanisms such as the Regional Action Plans for Jobs.  The stakeholders include other Government Departments with direct responsibility, regulatory bodies and public and private infrastructure providers.

Its principal function is, once each year, to examine the national minimum hourly rate of pay and to make a recommendation to the Minister respecting the rate, ensuring that all decisions are evidence based, fair and sustainable, and do not create significant adverse consequences for employment or competitiveness.</p>  <p>  The Commission submitted its first report in July 2015. Its recommendation to increase the minimum wage from &euro;8.65 to &euro;9.15 per hour was accepted by Government and the increase came into effect on 1 January last.</p>  <p>The Commission&rsquo;s second report was submitted to Government in July and the recommendation made by the Commission for an increase to &euro;9.25 per hour was approved by Government on 11 October.  I signed the Order on 13 October to effect the increase from 1 January next. </p>  <p>  The Living Wage concept is grounded in the idea that a person&rsquo;s wage should be sufficient to maintain a safe, decent standard of living.  At an individual level the resources required to achieve a minimum essential standard of living is very dependent on family circumstances and thus the interaction of individual earnings with household income and State-provided supports such as Child Benefit, Family Income Supplement as well as supports available in relation to housing, education and health all contribute to an individual&rsquo;s standard of living. </p>  <p>  It is important that Ireland&rsquo;s statutory National Minimum Wage and the Living Wage concept are not conflated.  The Living Wage is a voluntary societal initiative centred on the social, business and economic case to ensure that, wherever it can be afforded, employers will pay a rate of pay that provides an income that is sufficient to meet an individual&rsquo;s basic needs, such as housing, food, clothing, transport and healthcare.  The Living Wage is voluntary and has no legislative basis and is therefore not a statutory entitlement. It is different to the National Minimum Wage which is a statutory entitlement and has a legislative basis. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Partnership Government contains a commitment to reduce poverty levels by supporting an increase in the minimum wage to &euro;10.50 per hour over the next five years and rely on the annual recommendations of the Low Pay Commission on the level of adjustment each year.</p>  <p>  The independence of the Low Pay Commission is firmly established in the National Minimum Wage (Low Pay Commission) Act 2015 (the Act).  The Commission can only operate in accordance with that statutory remit and make recommendations to the Minister in accordance with the criteria that are clearly and explicitly set out in the Act. </p>  <p>  There are no plans to make any changes to the legislation as it currently stands.</p></reply>

Galway.  The Commission has publicly stated that a sample of the site is being excavated to resolve a number of queries that the Commission has in relation to the interment of human remains at this location.  The Commission has also clarified that only a fraction of the site will be excavated through test trenches, the location of which have been informed by a Geophysical Survey carried out at the site in October 2015.</p><p>It is important to stress that the statutory Commission is independent in the conduct of its investigations.  It has significant legal powers to assist in these enquiries.  Therefore, the precise approach to its investigation is a matter for the Commission to decide and progress.  I do not have any role or influence in these decisions.</p><p>If the Deputy, or any person, has information which they believe can assist the investigation, then I would encourage them to contact the Commission directly by email at or on the confidential freephone number at 1800 80-66-88. </p></reply>

Since receiving the Report I have met with the three members of the Commission to discuss the Report and the general progress being made with the investigation. </p>  <p>  Given the scope of the Commission's work a number of topics in the Report extend beyond the remit of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  For this reason, I am consulting with Cabinet colleagues and the Attorney General with a view to publishing the Report in conjunction with Government's response to the findings of the Report.  </p>  <p>  I am sensitive to the expectations of former residents and hope to conclude this process as quickly as possible. </p></reply>

As such, there are no specific arrangements currently in place for recruiting medical officers internally from within the Defence Forces. However, there is no prohibition on same occurring and the matter is currently under active consideration.  In addition, a new scheme for training medical graduates in military medicine is currently being finalised.  The<b></b>Terms and Conditions for suitably qualified members of the Permanent Defence Force to fill Medical Officer positions are currently under discussion within the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme.  The Deputy will appreciate that as discussions under the Scheme are confidential to that process, it would be inappropriate for me to make any comment at this time.</p></reply>
