The measures had a focus in particular in protecting as far as possible DEIS schools </p><p>  One aspect of the budgetary decisions was to increase the pupil teacher ratio for fee-charging schools. Fee-charging schools have the resources, through fees charged, to employ teachers privately, an option which is not available to schools in the free education scheme. </p><p>  The Government recognises the importance of ensuring that students from a Protestant background can attend a school that reflects their denominational ethos, while at the same time ensuring that funding arrangements are in accordance with the provisions of the constitution.</p></reply>

It is anticipated that when the accommodation brief is finalised, the project concerned will be considered for progression into the architectural planning process.</p><p>  As the Deputy will understand, due to the competing demands on my Department's capital budget imposed by the need to prioritise the limited funding available for the provision of essential additional school accommodation to meet increasing demographic requirements, it is not possible at this point to provide an indicative timeframe for the provision of an extension to the school in question.</p></reply>

Given the requirement to meet the need for additional school places over the years 2012 to 2016, it was deemed unlikely that Minor Works Grant funding would be available during that period. </p><p>  However, the grant did issue to schools in November 2011 for the 2011/12 school year, and last November for the 2013/14 school year.  The advice to schools which accompanied the grant to schools last November made very clear that &quot;the grant will only be paid in future years as funding permits&quot;.   I cannot yet give any commitment to restore this payment to an annual basis.</p></reply>

Commissioning of this report is currently underway.</p><p>  A key priority in the current economic climate is to prioritise and target resources at schools with the most concentrated levels of educational disadvantage.   In these circumstances the opportunities for increasing expenditure on current programmes are limited and exclude the capacity for a reclassification of schools within the DEIS programme.</p></reply>

Accordingly the accompanying circular allowed schools a period up to last Easter to make the necessary arrangements, including consultations with the school community.</p><p>  All schools should by now have completed this process. I would urge Parents' Associations to contact their school if they have not yet received a copy of the school's anti-bullying policy.</p><p>  Arising from commitments made in the Action Plan on Bullying, my Department's Inspectorate is placing a stronger focus on the actions schools take to create a positive school culture and to prevent and tackle bullying. For example, parent and student questionnaires issued as part of whole school evaluations,  include, since January 2014, additional questions to get a clearer picture of how the school deals with bullying.  Furthermore, the Inspectorate's plan for the current school year provides for a focussed evaluation to be conducted in a sample of schools to examine the school's work to create and sustain safe and healthy environments.</p></reply>

The Council has a broad remit to support and enhance human capital development, in particular at postgraduate and early stage postdoctoral levels. Its remit covers the full range of disciplines spanning the humanities, social sciences, business, law, sciences, engineering and technology.</p><p>  The Council's main postgraduate and postdoctoral schemes categorise applications from a) humanities and social sciences, and b) engineering and technology separately, and each applicant only competes with applications from a similar cohort of student. Awards are made in each category on the basis of excellence following assessment by expert independent panels, whose membership is primarily international.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-10-08a.26.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1078" speakername="Damien English" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014100800067#WRA02500"><p>I can appreciate that supporting a student through third level education can be challenging.  The decision to abolish the Gaeltacht Placement grants, from September 2012, has to be viewed in the context of the prevailing requirement to reduce costs and achieve efficiencies where possible.  Priority was given to protecting resources for front line education services as far as possible in the coming years, which is especially challenging with rising numbers of school-going children.</p><p>  To assist with the costs of the Gaeltacht placement, students in receipt of a student grant which includes a 100% fee grant, or who would have qualified for a full fee grant but for the Free Fees Schemes, can apply for funding towards travel and accommodation costs under the field trip element of a fee grant, subject to the normal terms and conditions of the scheme.</p><p>  Apart from the student grant system, in circumstances of particular need students may apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund. </p><p>  I am not in a position to reinstate the funding to this area.</p></reply>

Between this year and last year this has involved an increase of around 2,300 teachers.</p><p>  In my pre-budget discussions with the education partners I expressed the hope that continued improvement in the economy will take us to a position where we can make improvements. However, as I have earlier noted my focus in preparing for Budget 2015 has to be to seek the funding necessary to meet this demographic growth, and not on additional spending measures such as that proposed by the Deputy.  If in future years there is funding available to reduce class sizes my preference is that it would be targeted at reducing class sizes at the infant years.</p></reply>

My Department does not require schools to report to it on the amounts involved and I have no plans to require such reporting &ndash; with 4,000 schools in our education system, doing so would seem to create a very significant administrative burden, both on schools and on the Department.<br/><br/>However, I believe that schools need to be accountable to parents and we need greater levels of communication, engagement and transparency in how schools serve their communities. Better information for parents, including information in relation to the collection and use of voluntary contributions, is an issue that I will be looking at in the context of my Department's work on developing plans for a Parents' and Students' Charter.</p></reply>

The PSC is designed to replace other cards within the public sector such as the free travel pass and the social services card and to make it easy for providers of public services to verify the identity of customers. <br/><br/>A PSC is currently issued following a registration process which involves the capture of an individual&rsquo;s photograph and signature and the verification of identity data already held by the Department of Social Protection.<br/><br/>Face-to-Face registration is taking place countrywide in 80 offices of the Department for individual applicants for a Personal Public Service (PPS) Number and people applying for, or in receipt of, social protection payments or benefits, including Jobseeker payments, Free Travel entitlement, Child Benefit payments, State Pensions, and One Parent Family payments. <br/><br/>Selected low-risk customers have also been invited to avail of a &lsquo;postal&rsquo; registration process which involves utilisation, with consent, of information already provided to other Government agencies, for example, a photograph supplied in connection with an application for a passport. <br/><br/>In addition, selected pensioners over 66 who collect their payments at a Post Office are being invited to register by post. This process includes the person providing two passport-standard photographs.<br/><br/>The Department is currently finalising the development of a mobile registration facility that is suitable for the registration of persons who wish to register for a PSC but cannot avail of other registration options referred to above. This option may be offered to elderly persons who are in long stay nursing homes and wish to register for a PSC.<b></b><br/><br/>It should be noted that a person&rsquo;s entitlement to a social welfare benefit will not be adversely affected if he/she is legitimately unable, for health or mobility reasons, to complete the PSC registration process. </p></reply>

However, in order to protect the core weekly payments which people receive, including disability payments, pensions and carer&rsquo;s allowance, the Government had to look very carefully at other additional payments, including the respite care grant. This approach to protecting core weekly payments still applies.</p><p>  It is worth making the point that the rate of the respite care grant at &euro;1,375 is still more than twice what it was in 2002 when it was &euro;635, and higher than it was in 2006 at the height of the economic boom, when it was &euro;1,200. </p><p>  It should also be noted that such an annual payment - in a single lump sum with no requirement to satisfy a means test - is not available for any other group nor indeed is there an equivalent payment for carers in any other country in Europe.</p></reply>

Expenditure on pensions at approx. &euro;6.5 billion is the largest block of expenditure in the Department in the Estimate for 2014, representing approx. 33% of overall expenditure.  Because of demographic changes the Department&rsquo;s spending on older people is increasing year on year.  In 2013, the Department had to make provision for an additional &euro;190 million for the increasing number of pensioners.  Maintaining the rate of the State pension and other core payments is critical in protecting people from poverty. </p><p>  The fuel allowance scheme and the free travel pass have also been protected for older people and people with disabilities. The living alone allowance has been maintained at &euro;7.70 per week.</p><p>  The adjustments made to the household benefits package in recent years have made it much easier for customers to switch to cheaper energy suppliers, without the loss of any credits they may have built up.  The decision to discontinue the telephone allowance provided annual savings of &euro;48 million and meant that the Department was able to retain the other elements of the household benefits package such as the electricity and gas allowance and the television licence. These are valuable supports for recipients. The Department will spend &euro;230 million this year on these elements of the household benefits package for over 411,000 customers. </p><p>  In 2010 the monthly value of the free electricity allowance was &euro;40.70.  It is currently &euro;35.00.  Restoring the allowance to 2010 levels would cost an additional &euro;28 million for 411,000 customers.  </p><p>  In 2010 the monthly value of the telephone allowance was &euro;26.  The telephone allowance was discontinued in 2014.  Restoring the telephone allowance to 2010 levels would cost an additional &euro;128 million.  </p><p>  The Government has already announced that from 2015 the household benefits package will also include a quarterly water support payment of &euro;25.  The estimated cost of this new water support payment of &euro;100 per annum will be in the region of &euro;42 million in 2015.</p><p>  The appropriate levels of weekly social welfare rates of payment, including any changes to household benefits, are being considered in the context of the forthcoming Budget which will be announced on Tuesday, October 14.</p></reply>

Accordingly, the banking facilities of an individual customer, or organisation, is a matter entirely for that individual, or organisation, to arrange. A Relationship Framework has been specified that defines the nature of the relationship between the Minister for Finance and each bank. These Frameworks were published on 30 March 2012 and can be found at: . <br/><br/>Notwithstanding this, officials in my Department have referred the issue to Bank of Ireland and have received the following comment in this regard:<br/><br/>&quot;The US Government has a restrictive trade embargo against Cuba. The US legislative and regulatory measures include an embargo on making or receiving payments from Cuba and/or facilitating the making or receiving of payments from Cuba.<br/><br/>Bank of Ireland depends on correspondent banks for the processing of our national, European and international transactions, including our SEPA (Single European Payment Area) transactions. We are reliant on our correspondent banks because they process and facilitate all such transactions on our behalf. The current issue has arisen as a result of the transition to SEPA. As it happens, our principal correspondent bank for SEPA transactions is a leading US bank who must comply with its own regulatory requirements and obligations to avoid a possible exposure to regulatory sanctions and penalties.<br/><br/>As a result, we are not in a position to process such transactions. This affects all international payments to or from Cuba and also any related SEPA payments.&quot;<br/><br/>The Deputy may be aware that a breach of the relevant regulatory requirements can have severe consequences for an institution and the following link refers to one recent high profile case, which was reported in the international financial media, in this regard:<br/><br/><br/><br/>Finally, I have also been asked previously if I, as Minister for Finance, would challenge relevant U.S. policy. My response, which has not changed, is to highlight that US policy in this regard is not restricted to Ireland and extends worldwide and accordingly I do not intend to challenge this policy as I would not expect a positive outcome to such an action.  In the same vein neither do I believe it to be appropriate for me to undertake a prosecution in relation to this matter as you suggest.</p></reply>

The Bank undertook to sell the combined portfolio of the FRNs and the fixed rate bond as soon as possible provided the conditions of financial stability permit.</p><p>  The Bank also indicated that, as a minimum, it will make sales in accordance with the following schedule: to end 2014 (&euro;0.5 billion), 2015-2018 (&euro;0.5 billion per annum), 2019-2023 (&euro;1 billion per annum), and 2024 on (&euro;2 billion per annum until all bonds are sold).  The current schedule would see all of the bonds held by the CBI sold by c.2034.  The Bank's recent Annual Report notes that sales have been made from this combined portfolio, with the Bank selling &euro;350mn of its holdings of the Government 2025 Fixed Rate Bond in 2013.  The Central Bank does not provide updates on bond sales outside of their annual report.</p><p>  Under the original Promissory Note arrangement, the Government was scheduled to make annual payments of &euro;3.1 billion thereby putting significant upward pressure on the amounts to be funded from the market. Following a long period of negotiation the notes were replaced in February 2013 with a portfolio of Irish Government bonds (as outlined above).  The provision of these long-term non-amortising Government bonds to replace the amortising Promissory Notes has therefore had significant benefits from a market perspective as it ensures that there will be much less issuance of Irish Government bonds into the market over the next decade and beyond than would otherwise have been the case.</p><p>  The market continues to react positively to the restructuring and we have recently seen further reduction of the 10 year bond yields to 1.65%, far lower than had been the case before the State entered the EU/IMF programme and thus enabling the State to substantially reduce its cost of borrowings.</p><p>  The Central Bank is independent in respect of its decisions to sell the bonds held by them as a consequence of the promissory note exchange, however, as outlined above, the current schedule would see all of the bonds held by the CBI sold by c.2034.</p><p>  In summary, the timing of the sales and the management of its investment holdings are matters for the Central Bank and it is independent in the exercise of its functions and therefore, neither I nor the Department of Finance have any role in the matter. </p></reply>

In this regard, EU VAT law specifically provides that all digitised publications, including e-books, are treated as the supply of a service liable at the standard rate of VAT, which in Ireland is 23%. </p><p>  The VAT charged on electronically supplied services was always the standard VAT rate, and is not related to the changes being made on 1 January 2015. The 2015 changes relate to the country in which tax is to be charged, and not the rate of VAT that is to be charged.  From 1 January 2015, electronically supplied services, including e-books, will be liable to VAT in the country of the consumer and not the country of the supplier, as is currently the case.  This means that an e-book purchased by a person in Ireland will be charged at the Irish standard VAT rate, and not the standard VAT rate of the Member State of the supplier.  This is known as the destination principle, and it is designed to remove the competitive advantage gained by Member States charging lower rates of VAT; as under the destination principle a customer in Ireland purchasing an e-book from any EU Member State will be charged Irish VAT on that service.</p><p>  As stated previously, while Ireland applies a zero VAT rate to printed books including atlases, children's picture, drawing and colouring books and books of music, by virtue of a derogation under the VAT Directive for such exceptional treatment, there is no option under EU VAT Law to either exempt e-books from VAT or to apply the zero VAT rate or a reduced VAT rate to such products.  The different VAT treatment of printed books and e-books reflects the nature of these products, the latter being a richer product often providing content beyond simple text to include embedded digital music, software, film and internet links. </p><p>  In 2012, France and Luxembourg unilaterally made the decision to defy the well-established and recognised EU VAT position in relation to the VAT rate charged on electronic supplies of e-books, by applying a reduced VAT rate to these services.  The EU Commission took both Member States to the European Court of Justice in 2013 because of this breach of law. A judgement in the case has not yet been made.  This is separate from the K Oy European Court of Justice Case C-219/13 which dealt specifically with the VAT treatment of printed and audio books, but did not deal with e-books. </p></reply>

Revenue has made great progress in tackling the problem of diesel laundering over the past three years, and reports now indicate the emergence of another form of fuel fraud, commonly referred to as petrol stretching.  This involves the illegal addition of a low tax commodity to petrol to defraud the exchequer and the motorist.</p><p>  Petrol stretching is an offence under section 102 (IA) of the Finance Act 1999.  It carries a penalty on summary conviction of a fine of &euro;5,000 or a term of imprisonment not exceeding 12 months, or both a fine and imprisonment.  Where conviction occurs on indictment, a fine of up to &euro;126,970, or a term  of imprisonment of up to 5 years, or both a fine and imprisonment, may be imposed.</p><p>  I am advised by Revenue that they are investigating the recent reports concerning petrol stretching and that they have been in contact with the motor and oil trades.  I understand also that they have taken samples from a number of filling stations that it has been claimed may have been sources of adulterated fuel, and that they will undertake any further enquiries that are required as a result of reports or information that they receive.  These enquiries will seek to establish if there is evidence that petrol stretching has occurred, and whether there is evidence to support a prosecution.  The analysis of petrol samples is time consuming and results for the samples recently taken is awaited.</p><p>  Revenue and the oil sector have cooperated very successfully to tackle diesel laundering and I am confident that, with this cooperation and with the supply chain information available to Revenue, the problem of petrol stretching can also be tackled successfully.  It is essential that petrol distributors report any reduction in the pattern of legitimate supplies of fuel to the retail trade which may indicate that specific retailers are shifting some of their sourcing to laundered or &quot;stretched&quot; fuel.</p><p>  Motorists themselves should take care about where they source their petrol and report to Revenue any suspicions concerning the source of adulterated petrol that may have damaged their engines.  Revenue will investigate such reports and pursue prosecutions where possible.  In that regard, Revenue has recently launched a dedicated section of its website specifically on the black economy and this includes an electronic reporting facility for anyone who has information about shadow economy practices including  petrol stretching.</p><p>  I would also like to advise the Deputy that the first point of contact for motorists whose vehicles have been affected should be the insurance companies they hold their policies with.   Further to that, those affected should also contact the point of purchase and seek redress through them.  If they remain unsatisfied they may have recourse to civil remedies and as such could seek legal advice.</p></reply>

Where an instrument was executed in 2002 stamp duty was generally payable within 30 days of its execution.  Interest and penalties were applicable where an instrument was not stamped within this time limit. The person accountable for payment of stamp duty was the purchaser or  transferee. </p><p>  I take it the Deputy's  question  relates to a number of arrangements, such as the use of resting in contract, building licences and agreements for lease, whereby developers could, in effect, acquire and develop land without incurring a liability to stamp duty.  Legislation was introduced in Section 110 of Finance Act 2007 to address these matters, subject to a commencement order.  The then Minister for Finance commissioned a report on the potential effects of commencing these provisions.  The report recommended that, on balance, the section should not be commenced at that time as it would have led to a rise in land prices with a knock-on increase in house prices, especially for first-time buyers, and possibly risked exacerbating the downturn in the property market.  </p><p>  The legislation was further amended by Section 82 of Finance (No 2) Act 2008, taking on board the recommendation of the report.  The redrafted provision exempted public private partnership arrangements from the scope of the legislation and commencement was again made subject to commencement from a date to be appointed by the Minister for Finance. In the light of the economic climate at the time, commencement of the legislation was deferred.  </p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that, having regard to the subsequent reduction in the rates of Stamp Duty from up to 9% down to 1% to 2% and having regard to the economic climate in 2013, I introduced legislation (Section 78 of Finance Act 2013) which contained similar provisions to those not commenced in 2008.  The effect of these provisions is that if any of these arrangements were entered into on or after 13 February 2013, stamp duty would be payable on foot of the arrangements.</p></reply>

These controls require all licensed fuel traders, whether dealing in road fuel or marked fuel, to make monthly electronic returns to Revenue of their fuel transactions.  Revenue is using this data to identify suspicious or anomalous transactions and patterns of distribution that will support follow-up enforcement action where necessary, and</p><p>  - An intensified targeting, in co-operation with other law enforcement agencies on both sides of the border, of enforcement action against suspected fuel laundering operations.</p><p>  In addition to the measures implemented to date, Revenue and Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs in the UK completed an Invitation to Make Submissions process to identify a more effective fuel marker and it is expected that a new marker will be introduced in both jurisdictions early in 2015, following consultation with the oil industry and other stakeholders.</p><p>  To support further the integrity of the distribution system and minimise the risk of fraud, I introduced a provision in the Finance (No. 2) Act 2013 that will make a supplier who is reckless in supplying rebated fuel for a use connected with excise fraud liable for the duty at the standard rate of tax.  This new provision will strengthen Revenue's hand in dealing with those traders supplying rebated fuel recklessly to dubious customers and will provide a further disincentive to such activity. Revenue has published guidelines for mineral oil traders which will assist them in identifying and avoiding such transactions.</p><p>  Revenue works very closely with fuel sector representative bodies in tackling the problem and these bodies have been very supportive of the measures introduced to combat fuel laundering.  Revenue chairs the Hidden Economy Monitoring Group to facilitate traders reporting suspicious matters through their representative associations on a confidential basis.  This information can assist Revenue in closing down the illicit trade by identifying traders supplying fuel to launderers and by identifying outlets that are selling laundered diesel. </p><p>  I am advised also that the Revenue Commissioners work in close cooperation with other enforcement authorities, in this jurisdiction and in Northern Ireland, in combating this all-island problem.  The Cross Border Fuel Fraud Enforcement Group, which includes representatives of the Revenue Commissioners, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs and the Police Service of Northern Ireland and other relevant organisations, was established to facilitate this cooperation, and has proven effective in supporting the identification and targeting of the organised crime gangs, many of whom have links to paramilitaries and former paramilitaries, that are responsible for the bulk of fuel fraud.  All enforcement authorities engaged in combatting fuel fraud are committed to working closely together on an ongoing basis in this important work. Revenue's enforcement strategy in the fuel sector has already yielded significant results.  Since the beginning of 2011, over 3 million litres of fuel have been seized and 29 oil laundries detected and closed down, including 9 oil laundries in 2013.  In addition, over 130 filling stations have been closed in that period. In the past 18 months Revenue has secured 6 convictions for mineral oil offences and a further 16 prosecution cases are underway.  </p><p>  The evidence available to Revenue, in terms of feedback from the legitimate trade and increased consumption of road diesel, indicates that the strategy has been effective. The legitimate trade indicates that the incidence of laundered diesel on the market has dropped significantly and that they have experienced an increase in road diesel sales.  This is supported by tax data which shows road diesel consumption has increased significantly over the past couple of years.</p></reply>

The measure was designed to boost tourism and create additional jobs in that sector. The 9% rate applies to the supply of food and drink (excluding alcohol, soft drinks and bottled water) in the course of catering.  I also provided for the abolition of the Air Travel Tax in Budget 2014 to further assist the tourism sector.</p><p>  In relation to cross-border shopping, the most recent cross-border price survey carried out by the Revenue Commissioners in July 2014 can be found online on the Revenue website.  The survey compares prices in the off-trade rather than the on-trade, and does not support the attached correspondence's contention that a price difference of 35% in respect of beer, wine and spirits exists between prices in Northern Ireland and the State.</p></reply>

The survey shows that over the past three years there have been a total of 43,255 new jobs created in IDA Ireland client companies (including companies that were formerly clients of Shannon Development).  Details of the number of jobs created in the three year period 2011 to 2013 inclusive, is set out in the attached tabular statement (A).  Employment data for 2014 will not be available until early next year.<br/><br/>I am informed by IDA Ireland that during 2011, 2012, 2013 and to the end of September 2014 there were a total of 1,353 IDA Ireland sponsored site visits by potential investors to various locations across the country.  Details of the number of site visits during this period are set out in the attached tabular statement (B).<br/><br/>There are many complex factors influencing decision location making, such as the increasing preference of investors globally for cities of scale with 1 million plus populations, significant challenges from lower cost locations in Eastern Europe and the Far East and attractive regional aid. While IDA Ireland does attempt to influence the choice of location the final decision as to where to visit and ultimately where to locate is taken in all cases by the investor. <br/><br/>The Action Plan for Jobs 2014 includes a commitment to develop a framework for a Regional Enterprise Strategy to better integrate the efforts of the enterprise development agencies and other regional stakeholders in supporting enterprises.  My intention is that the framework will be developed on a pilot basis initially, focusing on the Midlands region, and involving the agencies under the remit of my own Department &ndash; Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and the Local Enterprise Offices.  The objective is to enhance synergies between the agencies and their client companies and build on the competitive strengths of the region to maximise the potential for job creation.  The role which other public bodies in the region can play in working towards this objective will also be examined as the project develops.  The aim is that this framework will serve as a model for other regions of the country.<br/><br/><b>Table shows the number of IDA Ireland jobs created in 2011, 2012 and 2013 (A)</b><table><tr><th>County</th><th>New jobs created in 2011</th><th>New jobs created in 2012</th><th>New jobs created in 2013</th></tr><tr><td>Carlow</td><td>197</td><td>132</td><td>91</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan</td><td>5</td><td>10</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>77</td><td>76</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>2,179</td><td>2,388</td><td>2,143</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>277</td><td>164</td><td>177</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>7,351</td><td>8,464</td><td>6,862</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>1,921</td><td>923</td><td>1,098</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>171</td><td>120</td><td>101</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>349</td><td>546</td><td>276</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td>1</td><td>125</td><td>80</td></tr><tr><td>Laois</td><td>2</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim</td><td>24</td><td>0</td><td>31</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>253</td><td>556</td><td>560</td></tr><tr><td>Longford</td><td>6</td><td>44</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td>242</td><td>401</td><td>595</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td>152</td><td>96</td><td>242</td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td>88</td><td>53</td><td>68</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan</td><td>0</td><td>7</td><td>29</td></tr><tr><td>Offaly</td><td>41</td><td>54</td><td>21</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon</td><td>96</td><td>59</td><td>28</td></tr><tr><td>Shannon Transfers 2013</td><td>327</td><td>260</td><td>185</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td>187</td><td>163</td><td>184</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary North Riding</td><td>22</td><td>1</td><td>21</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary South Riding</td><td>25</td><td>67</td><td>180</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>144</td><td>117</td><td>172</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath</td><td>162</td><td>177</td><td>132</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>111</td><td>100</td><td>149</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>84</td><td>106</td><td>72</td></tr><tr><td>Total excluding Shannon</td><td>14,167</td><td>14,949</td><td>13,367</td></tr><tr><td>Total including Shannon</td><td>14,494</td><td>15,209</td><td>13,552</td></tr></table><br/><br/><b>Table showing the number of IDA Ireland sponsored site visits, on a county by county basis in 2011, 2012, 2013 and to the end of September 2014 (B)</b><table><tr><th>County</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th><th>Jan - Sept 2014</th></tr><tr><td>Carlow</td><td>2</td><td>4</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan </td><td>0</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>15</td><td>14</td><td>5</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>Cork </td><td>27</td><td>38</td><td>31</td><td>26</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal </td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>7</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>150</td><td>196</td><td>180</td><td>184</td></tr><tr><td>Galway </td><td>35</td><td>18</td><td>15</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td>0</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Laois</td><td>2</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim </td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>40</td><td>30</td><td>23</td><td>21</td></tr><tr><td>Longford</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Louth </td><td>26</td><td>12</td><td>4</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo </td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Meath </td><td>2</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan </td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Offaly</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>4</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo </td><td>3</td><td>6</td><td>10</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary</td><td>1</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>11</td><td>26</td><td>14</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath </td><td>15</td><td>7</td><td>9</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>0</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>3</td><td>6</td><td>1</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>341</td><td>378</td><td>326</td><td>308</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Intra - Community trade in sheep is governed by the provisions of Council Directive 2003/50/EC which amends Council Directive 91/68/EEC.  These controls apply to breeding sheep whether they are imported or exported and all sheep must be certified with regard to their health status.<br/><br/>Breeding and fattening sheep must be certified as having been continuously resident on a holding of origin for at least 30 days prior to export including a standstill period of 21 days prior to export during which time no sheep have been introduced on to the holding.  A derogation applies where sheep introduced during the standstill period are completely isolated from all other animals on the holding.  <br/><br/>Breeding sheep must have been obtained from a holding and must only have been in contact with animals from such a holding in which in the previous 6 months contagious agalactia of sheep , in the previous 12 months paratubercuosis or caseous lymphadenitis, and in the previous 3 years pulmonary adenomatosis or Maedi Visna,have not been clinically diagnosed.  <br/><br/>Breeding rams must also come from a holding on which no case of contagious epididymitis (Brucella Ovis) has been recorded in the last 12 months and they must have been kept permanently on the holding for 60 days prior to export.  Breeding rams must also be tested for contagious epididymitis (Brucella Ovis) with a negative result, within 30 days prior to export.<br/><br/>The rules in relation to Scrapie are that all breeding sheep must either be of the ARR/ARR prion protein genotype, or have been kept in a scrapie monitored flock for at least 3 years with no cases of scrapie being confirmed during this period.<blockquote><i>Under EU Regulation 630/2013 all flocks participating in the Scrapie Monitored Scheme have to be classified as &ldquo;controlled risk&rdquo; or &ldquo;negligible risk&rdquo;.  A holding may be recognized as having a controlled risk for classical scrapie provided it has complied with the conditions specified in the Regulation for at least 3 years.  Achieving the negligible risk status will be a continuation of the controlled risk status for an increased period of time.</i><br /><br /><i>Only animals from holdings with a higher status may be introduced into the holding and at a minimum, they must come from holdings of at least the same status.  Animals may also be traded to holdings of at least the same or lower status both within Ireland and to other Member States.</i><br /><br /><i>Most of the current members of the Scrapie Monitored Scheme have automatically achieved controlled risk status.</i></blockquote></p></reply>

The Strategy provides a co-ordinated and comprehensive response to issue of drug misuse and is very much founded on a partnership approach. Drug law enforcement remains a fundamental feature of our overall approach and continues to be a key priority area. This is very much reflected in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s Policing Plan for 2014 which highlights a strong focus in combating serious crime in all its forms, in particular organised crime and its close links with drug trafficking.  </p><p>  The specific strategies put in place by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to address the sale, supply, importation and distribution of illegal drugs include the establishment of targeted intelligence led operations focused on specific facets of the drugs trade. A further feature of the Garda response is the continued and close co-operation with the Revenue Commissioners (Customs Service) and with other national drug law enforcement agencies, such as the Health Products Regulatory Authority in tackling drug supply. </p></reply>

Specifically, under Section 9 of the Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act, it is an offence to possess any knife or any other article which has a blade or which is sharply pointed in any public place, without having good reason or lawful authority.  </p><p>  I can advise that a comprehensive and robust legal framework is now in place in this area including heavy penalties for breaches of the laws concerned.  The Garda Commissioner, in 2008, made recommendations in relation to knives and sharply pointed or bladed weapons, and subsequently the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 was enacted, further strengthening the law and responding to Garda concerns about knife crime.  The maximum penalty for possessing a knife in a public place without good reason or lawful authority has been increased from one to five years, and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na were given an extended power of search without warrant in relation to knives and offensive weapons.  In tandem with the new legislation, samurai swords were generally banned from importation and sale. </p><p>  I wish to assure the Deputy that I am in ongoing contact with the Garda Commissioner in relation to a wide range of crime and policing concerns, including knife and other violent crime. At an operational level,  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na pro-actively target public disorder and anti-social behaviour, including knife related crime through the strategic deployment of Garda resources. In this regard, areas identified as public order hot-spots by local Garda management are the subject of additional foot and mobile patrols. In addition, Detective Units and Divisional Crime Task Forces may be utilised to provide a high visibility presence in areas such as late night bars, clubs etc, particularly when people are exiting, to deter and detect anti-social behaviour and possible altercations. However, it should be noted that many knife crimes occur in domestic settings and often with a degree of spontaneity, which increases the challenges for preventative policing and enforcement. </p><p>  In relation to the investigation of specific knife-related crimes, I am assured that all appropriate resources, including any necessary technical and forensic facilities are employed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to secure detections and identify perpetrators of these crimes.   </p><p>In addition to these enforcement measures, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are involved in a number of awareness measures relating to knife crime, and I understand that the Garda Schools Programme is utilised to include talks on knives and other weapons for secondary school pupils, emphasising the dangers involved and the need for care, vigilance and social responsibility.</p><p>  There are at present no plans to hold a knife amnesty.</p></reply>

The Act provides, inter alia, for the protection of the public in its dealings with nurses and midwives and the enhancement of their high standards of professional education and competencies. The Department of Health is responsible for oversight of the governance of the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland (NMBI). The Department has no role in setting or approving registration fees.</p><p>  The Board is an independent body, answerable to the Oireachtas, with the responsibility to ensure that it has the financial capacity to undertake all its legal obligations.  The cost of enacting the additional requirements under the Nurses and Midwives Act 20141 was set out in the Regulatory Impact Analysis that was carried out prior to the enactment of the legislation.  These costs include an enhanced regulatory process with supporting systems for continued professional development and certain education and training requirements for the professions.</p><p>  It was also made clear at the time of the legislation that the Board would continue to be self-funding and needed to plan and cost how it would fulfil its legal obligations.  Following detailed negotiations with the Executive and Board members in 2013 it was agreed in October 2013 that an initial once-off sum of &euro;1.6m would be granted by the Department to the Board to cover 2013/2014 costs, but that the Board would have to increase its income in 2015 to undertake its commitments in the legislation.  The Board of the NMBI made the decision to increase the annual registration fee at its meeting on 17th September, 2014.  A helpline, email address and website information page have been made available by the NMBI to provide clarification for registrants who may have queries on this matter. Any potential implications for nurse staffing levels arising from the increase in registration fees will be kept under review by the HSE.</p></reply>

Complementary and alternative therapies and are not funded through the public health system and are not regulated by the Department. All regulated healthcare professionals are required to practice in accordance with their respective professional and ethical codes of conduct and the use by these regulated professionals of such therapies has to be in accordance with the requirements of the respective regulators.<br/><br/>General policy on complementary therapy is informed by the National Working Group on the Regulation of Complementary Therapists which reported in 2005. Their report is available athttp://health.gov.ie/blog/publications/report-of-the-national-working-group-on-the-regulation-of-complementary-therapists-to-the-minister-for-health-and-children. In line with a recommendation of the National Working Group, the Department of Health supports greater voluntary self-regulation of complementary therapy. <br/><br/>While those providing complementary therapies are not subject to professional statutory regulation, they are subject to a range of legislation and regulation, similar to other practitioners including consumer legislation, competition, contract and criminal law.<br/><br/>People should be supported and empowered to make informed choices about how they can best look after their own and their families health and wellbeing. It is important that people have access to current, accurate and reliable information about health and health-related services and products, and that they consult relevant healthcare professionals for advice about their health needs.<br/><br/>The Department also produced an information leaflet to help consumers make an informed health choice on complementary medicine. It is on the Departments website </p></reply>

This has resulted in reductions in the price of thousands of medicines.  Price reductions of the order of 30% per item reimbursed have been achieved between 2009 and 2013; the average cost per items reimbursed is now running at 2001/2002 levels. <br/><br/>A major new deal on the cost of originator drugs in the State was concluded with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA) in October 2012.  It will deliver a number of important benefits, including, significant reductions for patients in the cost of drugs, a lowering of the drugs bill to the State, timely access for patients to new cutting-edge drugs for certain conditions, and reducing the cost base of the health system into the future.<br/><br/>The IPHA agreement provides that prices are referenced to the currency adjusted average price to wholesaler in nine EU member states (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Netherlands, Spain, and UK)and these are the maximum prices paid by the HSE for originator drugs supplied through the community drug schemes.<br/><br/>The gross savings arising from this deal will be in excess of &euro;400 million over 3 years. &euro;210 million from the gross savings will be available to fund new drugs. <br/><br/>The IPHA agreement provides for a mid-term review in 2014. As the outcome of this review is dependent on negotiations with IPHA further comment at this stage would not be appropriate.<br/><br/>A  new agreement was also reached with the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers in Ireland (APMI), which represents the generic drugs industry, in 2012.  Under this Agreement the maximum price the HSE pays for generic products was 50% of the initial price of an originator medicine, this was further reduced to 40% from 1 May 2014.  This has resulted in the price differential between off-patent drugs and most generic equivalents increasing from 5% to approximately 20%.<br/><br/>The Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 provides that from June 2013 the maximum price of all new medicinal products reimbursed under the community drug schemes will be set in accordance with the criteria set out in the Act.The Act introduces a system of generic substitution and reference pricing.  Reference pricing involves the setting of a common reimbursement price, or reference price, for a group of interchangeable medicines. This is the maximum price that the HSE will reimburse to pharmacies for all medicines in the group, regardless of the individual medicine&rsquo;s prices.  It is estimated that reference pricing will yield &euro;50 million in savings in 2014.<br/><br/>In the case of drugs and medicines which are paid for by the HSE, prices are set in accordance with the provisions of the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 or the terms of the framework agreements between the Department of Health and the HSE and the representative bodies for pharmaceutical manufacturers in Ireland. However, neither the Minister for Health nor the HSE has any power to set the prices of drugs and medicines purchased by private patients.  It would nonetheless be disappointing if all pharmacists were not passing on the benefits of lower prices to patients. <br/><br/>The HSE advises the public that if they are being charged prices which exceed the reimbursement price listed on the HSE website (), plus a dispensing fee of between &euro;3.50 and &euro;5, then they should discuss the differential with their pharmacist to ensure they get the best possible price for the medicine concerned. <br/><br/>In addition, measures have been taken to increase price transparency among retail pharmacies. In March of this year the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland issued guidelines to pharmacists on procedures and minimum standards of information to be provided to customers, including a requirement to provide an itemised receipt of purchase of medicines.</p></reply>

The total budget for long-term residential care is &euro;939m in 2014. A number of people covered by funding arrangements which preceded the Scheme are also covered by this funding. However, &euro;23m has been transferred from the Nursing Homes Support Scheme to provide additional community services, with a view to allowing more older people to be supported in their own homes and communities for longer in line with both Government policy and with the expressed wishes of older people.The target in the HSE's Service Plan 2014 is for 22,061 persons to be in receipt of financial support for long-term residential care by year end.  </p><p>  The HSE operates a national placement list for the Nursing Homes Support Scheme to enable it to operate within budget. All applicants who are approved for funding are put on the placement list in chronological order by the date of determination of their application, and funding issues to applicants in this chronological order to ensure equity nationally.  Funding is released by the HSE on a weekly basis to ensure those on the placement list receive it as soon as possible. </p><p>  Funding for the Nursing Homes Support Scheme will be considered in the context of the Estimates Process 2015, which is currently underway. The funding that  becomes available must be balanced across all of the various service areas in a way that achieves the best possible outcomes for the greatest number of service users and prioritises areas of greatest need as far as possible.</p></reply>

The PSI established in 2007 replaced the previous professional regulatory body of the same name.</p><p>  The PSI regulates approximately 5,250 pharmacists, 1,800 pharmacies and 450 pharmaceutical assistants. The Act provides for a formal system of registration and inspection of retail pharmacy businesses (pharmacies), a registration system for pharmacists which takes account of the obligations imposed by a statutory Code of Conduct for pharmacists, disciplinary procedures and mandatory continuing professional development, and a registration system for pharmaceutical assistants.</p><p>  Pharmaceutical assistants are a grade of pharmacy professionals that are permitted under section 30(1) of the Act to act on behalf of a registered pharmacist during the temporary absence of the registered pharmacist.</p><p>  In December 1994, the &quot;old PSI&quot; and the Pharmaceutical Assistants Association agreed a Code of Practice governing temporary absence.  This Code does not place restrictions on what may or may not be done by a pharmaceutical assistant in the temporary absence of pharmacists, but provides a framework for the interpretation of the phrase &quot;temporary absence&quot;. Section 5(6)(b) of the Pharmacy Act provides that in any contract or other agreement to which the old society was a party, the Society is substituted for the old Society. This Code of Practice has been in place since that time and the PSI has operated it in so far as practicable, in accordance with its terms.</p><p>  Section 30(2) of the Act provides for the PSI Council to make rules (with the consent of the Minister) defining temporary absence and also what may or may not be done by a pharmaceutical assistant when acting on behalf of a registered pharmacist.</p><p>  The PSI is aware of the concerns raised by pharmaceutical assistants regarding the current employment environment and continues to engage with pharmaceutical assistants and the Pharmaceutical Assistants Association. This engagement will inform the development of policy and an applicable legislative framework that may be established under section 30(2) of the Act. This process is ongoing, and the PSI is committed to expediting this work as quickly as possible.</p></reply>

This was the 18th Plenary meeting of the NSMC.   At the meeting, discussions covered a wide range of financial, economic and EU matters including the employment situation in both jurisdictions and measures to encourage job creation.  Also discussed were actions to build trade links with developing markets, attraction of foreign direct investment and issues relating to banking, in particular lending to Small and Medium-sized Enterprises, economic and budgetary challenges facing both administrations and measures aimed at rebalancing the Northern Ireland economy.  Progress on the disposal of NAMA&rsquo;s Northern Ireland portfolio was welcomed by the Council.</p><p>  Ministers also welcomed the success of the Giro d&rsquo;Italia cycling event which secured widespread global media coverage.  We also noted the opportunities for tourism and trade through the hosting of all-island events and agreed to continue to cooperate on a joint bid for the 2023 Rugby World Cup. </p><p>  We noted that the draft Programmes for the new INTERREG V and PEACE IV Programmes for the period 2014 &ndash; 2020 have been submitted to the EU Commission.  As several other new European programmes may present opportunities for cooperation to maximize the drawdown of EU funding to the island, we agreed that these should be further examined.</p><p>  With regard to the St Andrews Agreement Review, the Council noted that discussions on Sectoral Priorities have now taken place, following the decisions taken at the last NSMC Plenary in November 2013 and the NSMC Institutional meeting in January 2014.  These discussions focused on efforts to support economic recovery, job creation, ensuring the best use of public funds and the most effective delivery of services for citizens.</p><p>  Ministers agreed that it had been useful to review progress and identify opportunities within the existing agreed work programmes and noted that a report on other priorities identified during the Ministerial discussions will be brought to the next NSMC Institutional Meeting.</p><p>  The Council also reviewed the progress made on the areas of co-operation by the North/South Bodies and in the other areas for co-operation, and noted the current position on a North South Consultative Forum.</p><p>  We also discussed the North West Gateway Initiative noting the conclusion of the consultation process that had been carried out with regional stakeholders and agreed that further consultation with relevant Government Departments should be undertaken on the issues identified during the consultation process and that there should be a meeting of Ministers in the North West to consider strategic approaches to the development of the region. </p><p>  The Government is firmly committed to developing North South cooperation in every possible respect and I am looking forward to continuing to work with our Northern colleagues in the North South Ministerial Council. </p></reply>

Our policy on International Development, &ldquo;One World, One Future&rdquo; restates the Programme for Government commitment to achieving the UN target of providing 0.7% of Gross National Product (GNP) for Official Development Assistance (ODA), when economic circumstances permit.</p><p>  Since coming to office, the Government has successfully managed to stabilise the budget for development assistance. This is a significant achievement, particularly in light of the difficult budgetary circumstances we faced. It is a clear demonstration of our commitment to the aid programme.  Since 2011 we have allocated in excess of &euro;2.5 billion to ODA, providing &euro;657 million in 2011, &euro;629 million in 2012, and &euro;637 million last year. For 2014 we expect to provide in excess of &euro;600 million for ODA.  These are substantial allocations of public funds and represent a genuine investment on behalf of the Irish people to assist those less fortunate than ourselves.   </p><p>  The estimates process for Budget 2015 is now in its final stages.  As with allocations to all Government Departments, the 2015 budget for Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme will be framed in the context of our policy commitments and the overall budgetary circumstances we face.   The final allocation to ODA is ultimately a decision for Government, and will be announced by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform on Budget Day.   As the Deputy can appreciate I am not in position to announce next year&rsquo;s allocation but, as I have repeatedly stated publicly, and in response to previous Questions, I and the Minster for Foreign Affairs and Trade have made, and will continue to make, the strongest case possible for the allocation to the development assistance programme. </p><p>  I am determined to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s aid proagrmme continues to be recognised as a world leader, focusing relentlessly on delivering real and sustainable results that provide lasting improvements to the lives of some the world&rsquo;s poorest people.</p></reply>

However, following on from the Apprenticeship Review an Apprenticeship Implementation Plan was published in June 2014.   As part of this plan a new Apprenticeship Council is in the process of being established. The Council will be enterprise led and will have representatives from business, trade unions, as well as further and higher education bodies. The first job of work of the new Apprenticeship Council will be to develop a call for proposals from industry for new apprenticeships.  Alongside this work, the curricula for current apprenticeships will continue to be reviewed under existing structures.</p><p>  Furthermore, in addition to the SOLAS Further Education and Training Strategy 2014-2019, SOLAS has published the first ever  integrated Further Education and Training Services Plan for 2014.  The plan provides information on the range of further education and training funded by the Irish Government and it sets out in detail how the State's investment in 2014 will be used by SOLAS and the Education and Training Boards to meet the skills needs of learners and employers. The plan is available on the SOLAS website, www.solas.ie.  The process to develop the 2015 services plan will begin shortly and each Education and Training Board will develop proposals to SOLAS on its planned training programmes based on local skills demands, patterns of unemployment, overall demand for programmes and the resources available.  The process is also informed by skills demand forecasts produced at a national level.</p></reply>

Initial teacher education providers have responsibility for quality assuring the content, teaching and assessment of the Gaeltacht element of initial teacher education programmes. Any concerns in this regard should be taken up directly with the provider in the first instance and/or the Teaching Council.  My Department supports the changes as contributing to overall quality improvement in initial teacher education.</p><p>  A decision was made to abolish payments by my Department towards the cost of attendance at Gaeltacht courses by initial teacher education students with effect from September 2012. In making difficult decisions such as this, priority was given to protecting resources for front line education services as far as possible in the coming years, which is especially challenging with rising numbers of school-going children. The changes to the gaeltacht placement grant were publicised in advance of implementation so that students would be aware of the new arrangements before embarking on Initial Teacher Education programmes.</p><p>  I can appreciate that supporting a student through third level education can be challenging.

We have a growing population of young people in this country and despite the difficult financial circumstances we face as a country, we prioritised education so that the number of teachers we have in the system has also grown in order to protect existing pupil teacher ratios. Between this year and last year this has involved an increase of around 2,300 teachers in our primary and post-primary schools. This is a very significant investment at a time of scarce resources. There is no funding available for additional teachers to reduce class sizes and it is premature within our budgetary context to be looking for this to be done.</p><p>  If in future years there is funding available to reduce class sizes my preference is that it would be targeted at reducing class sizes at the infant years. </p></reply>

The agenda for meetings are agreed with employer representatives and span the full range of education and training provision from school level through further education and onto higher education participation and research.</p><p>  At school level, there are a range of subjects which foster workplace skills.  As the new Junior Cycle is being introduced to schools, key skills are being built into every subject.  These include skills such as communicating, working with other and managing information and thinking.  Over the course of the three year Junior Cycle, every student should have an opportunity to &quot;take initiative, be innovative and develop Entrepreneurial skills&quot;.</p><p>  In Transition Year as well as the opportunity for work placement, students can take part in enterprise units and in student enterprise competitions such as the Student Enterprise award and the mini company &quot;Get up and Go&quot; competition.  The latter  is specifically for transition year students with an emphasis on team work.  The mini-company involves students in research, planning, establishing a business, perhaps experiencing some risks and some failures &ndash; before you get it right, marketing, making or providing a service/product, drafting accounts, writing a report and finally winding down the company.</p><p>  In Senior Cycle students taking the Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme and the Leaving Certificate Applied are provided with specific opportunities to acquire enterprise skills.  These programmes place a strong focus on active learning, community-based approaches, personal development and teamwork.  Students also engage in work experience.</p><p>  My Department has a number of strategies and initiatives in place to ensure that further education and training meets the skills requirements of the workplace. SOLAS with the assistance of relevant experts such as the ESRI,  employers and local and national organisations have  published a five year strategy for the further education and training sector which provides us with a strategic roadmap for this crucial element of the education and training system. The strategy includes a vision of a flexible, quality-driven, labour market-relevant, integrated and responsive sector that supports learner progression, transitions into employment and personal development. In addition to the 5 year Strategy, SOLAS has published a first ever  integrated Further Education and Training Services Plan for 2014 and it will provide information on the range of further education and training funded by the Irish Government and it will set out in detail how the State's investment in 2014 will be used by SOLAS and the Education and Training Boards to meet the skills needs of learners and employers.</p><p>  Following on from the Apprenticeship Review an Apprenticeship Implementation Plan was published in June 2014.   As part of this plan a new Apprenticeship Council is in the process of being established. The Council will be enterprise led and have representatives from business, trade unions, further and higher education bodies. The first job of work of the new Apprenticeship Council will be a call for proposals from industry for new apprenticeships. Along side this work, the curricula for current apprenticeships will continue to be reviewed under existing structures.</p><p>  In the Higher Education Sector, engagement with enterprise is one of the core pillars of the National Strategy for Higher Education and provides a detailed framework and range of recommendations to ensure the system continues to respond to enterprise needs.  This includes structured employer surveys and interaction, alignment of funding to national priorities, including skills needs, increased work placement opportunities, staff mobility into enterprise ,a focus on the development of generic skills in undergraduate programmes and the establishment of higher education institutional clusters at a regional level to support enterprise development and employment needs. In the Higher Education Sector, to address specific skills needs of enterprise and support jobseekers into employment my Department funds the Springboard and the ICT Conversion Programmes under the ICT Action Plan.</p><p>  My Department, in conjunction with the Department of An Taoiseach, the Department of Social Protection and the relevant agencies&ndash; has developed an awareness campaign targeted at both the unemployed and employers - which brings together some of the range of enterprise-focused re-skilling initiatives that have been introduced in recent years. The 'brand' is entitled 'Skills to Work' and has been rolled out at various roadshows in recent months.</p></reply>

This is an increase of 390 posts on the previous cap of 10,575 posts. This is the highest level of SNA allocation that we have ever had. The policy of the Government is that every child who is assessed as needing SNA support will receive access to such support.</p><p>  I want to assure the Deputy of my commitment to continue to provide appropriate high quality resources to schools for the education of children with special educational needs.</p></reply>

In circumstances where children with special educational need require more specialised interventions, special school or special class places are also available.</p><p>  All State funded primary and post primary schools have been allocated additional resources to provide for children with special educational needs enrolled in school. For children for whom mainstream provision is not appropriate, placement may be made in one of the 125 special schools which have approximately 1,000 teachers and approximately 860 special classes and units located around the country.</p><p>  Primary and Post Primary schools have a permanent allocation of additional teaching supports to provide for children whose educational psychological assessment places them in the high incidence, or less complex, disability category.</p><p>  Separately, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) allocates Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) for children with additional care needs, as outlined in Circular 00030/2014 and additional resource teaching hours to schools for children who have been assessed within the low incidence, or more complex, category of special need, as defined by my Department's Circular Sp Ed 02/05. The NCSE operates within my Department's established criteria for the allocation of Special Education supports and the staffing resources available to my Department.</p><p>  The total number of Resource Teaching posts which the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) may allocate to schools to support children with special educational needs for the 2014/15 school year is presently set at 6,225 WTE posts.</p><p>  The NCSE are continuing to process applications for Resource Teaching support for the 2014/15 school year, where the necessary supporting documentation was not made available for the 26 March 2014 deadline. Decisions in relation to the remaining applications received by 22 September 2014 are expected to issue to schools in mid October.</p><p>  To date, the NCSE has allocated over 10,900 Special Needs Assistant (SNA) posts to schools supporting students with special educational needs for the 2014/2015 school year. As the SNA allocation process is still ongoing, the exact numbers of SNAs and pupils being supported will become clear following the finalisation of enrolments of students in mainstream schools as at 30th September.</p><p>  Should a school wish to make an application for additional SNA support for a child who was not previously considered for SNA support or who is due to enrol to a school, they may do so to the NCSE.</p><p>  All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.</p><p>  It is a matter for schools to monitor and utilise their allocation of additional staffing resources to best support the needs of identified pupils, in accordance with my Department's guidance.</p></reply>

Many pupils with special educational needs will be able to attend a local mainstream school, whereas for pupils who have needs which require more specialist interventions, special class and special school placements are provided for.</p><p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), is responsible for establishing special classes in various geographical areas as required. The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.</p><p>  SENOs engage with schools annually in order to plan for, and to open, new special classes each year, in order to ensure there are sufficient special class placements available at primary and post primary school level to meet demand in a given area.</p><p>  Details of all of the special classes for children with special educational needs which are attached to mainstream schools are published each year the NCSE website www.ncse.ie. This list details the number of classes which are available on a per county basis.</p><p>  I can advise that there were 40 special classes attached to primary schools and 9 special classes attached to post primary schools in Co. Kildare for the 2013/14 school year.</p><p>  SENOs have been working with local schools on a national basis over the past number of months to plan and establish special classes for children with special educational needs who require such placements for 2014/2015. The details of the total classes which will be provided for the 2014/15 school year are currently being finalised by the NCSE and will shortly be published on their website.</p></reply>

Schools have autonomy in relation to the deployment of classroom teachers to individual classes. My Department's guidance to schools is that the number of pupils in any class is kept as low as possible taking all relevant contextual factors into account (e.g. classroom accommodation, fluctuating enrolment etc.). School authorities are also requested, where possible, to use their autonomy under the staffing schedule to implement smaller class sizes for junior classes. The Staffing Schedule includes the provison where schools experiencing rapid increases in enrolment can apply for additional permanent mainstream posts on developing grounds. The staffing appeals process has been extended for the current school year to include a new appeals criterion for those schools that make a significant contribution to the provision of school places which assists the response to demographic growth within their area and as a result are under significant pressure on their class sizes at infants level.</p><p>  The context for any discussion about class sizes is that my Department, like all other Government Departments, is operating within a budgetary programme that is designed to return the Government finances to a sustainable basis. This budgetary programme has helped Ireland to return to a position where we are seeing some economic growth. It is a continuing improvement in our economic growth that will enable us to move to a point in future budgets where we can look again at providing for additional teacher resources in schools which could bring about an improvement in PTR and class size.</p><p>  In the meantime, my Department's focus is on targeting any available resources to cater for the continued increase in student numbers across primary, post-primary and third level.</p></reply>

The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that Irish Water is responsible for public water services and that it shall collect charges from its customers in receipt of water services provided by it. The Act also provides that responsibility for the independent economic regulation of the water sector is assigned to the Commission for Energy Regulation, the CER, which has been given statutory responsibility for protecting the interests of customers of Irish Water.<br/><br/>In advance of the introduction of domestic water charges, the Government made certain decisions on 6 May 2014 relating to the structure of water charges including, inter alia, a free allowance per household and an additional free allowance for children on the same qualifying conditions as the Child Benefit payment from the Department of Social Protection. <br/><br/>As these allowances are to be funded by Government, Irish Water needs to ensure it has the appropriate and sufficient information to reflect these entitlements. Irish Water is a specified body under the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, as amended by Section 20 of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2014, and is therefore permitted to request Personal Public Services (PPS) numbers to authenticate the identity of the person being provided with an allowance.<br/><br/>Irish Water will treat applicants&rsquo; personal data in accordance with the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003. In complying with these Acts, Irish Water must ensure that the data is only used for the purpose for which it was collected and must also ensure that any data collected is stored securely. The collection of PPS numbers allows Irish Water to confirm and validate the entitlement to allowances for each customer. This information will not be shared with any organisation other than the Department of Social Protection for the purpose of verification, to ensure that each household receives the allowances it is entitled to, be it the free allowance per household or any additional allowance for children in receipt of Child Benefit at that address. It will also allow Irish Water to provide lower charges to owners who have unoccupied dwellings. I understand that Irish Water and the Department of Social Protection are developing arrangements governing the sharing of PPS information. Any such arrangements will be subject to data protection requirements.<br/><br/>With charges effective from 1 October 2014 Irish Water is in the process of compiling the relevant data to ensure that customers can be billed accurately based on the tariff structure approved by the CER. Over the last number of weeks, Irish Water has been sending application packs to approximately 2 million households, which refer to the effective charging date and the fact that billing for domestic customers in receipt of public water services will start in January 2015. The application process will enable customers to confirm their details for billing and, by providing the relevant PPS numbers, claim the allowances that they are eligible for. Furthermore, Irish Water has advised my Department that it intends to initiate a further campaign after the 31 October deadline for return of application packs, to allow landlords provide proof that their property is occupied by a tenant and that they are not the occupant. Irish Water is currently working with the Data Protection Commissioner ( DPC ) in relation to the arrangements for how this will be done.<br/><br/>Last week the CER made a determination on the water charges plan submitted to it by Irish Water, which sets out the position if customers do not validate their details. In these circumstances, a default charge which does not include the free allowances will be applied to such customers. The relevant details of the determination are available on the CER website ().<br/><br/>Irish Water has an ongoing engagement with the DPC and has advised my Department that it has been asked to provide clarity on some aspects of the legal language of its data protection notice as published on its website, . It has confirmed that this notice was, and is, fully compliant with data protection requirements. However, by providing additional clarity, it will reassure customers that data is held securely, used properly and not shared with third parties, except where necessary for the delivery of water services such as contractors repairing leaks. Any advice given to Irish Water from the DPC will be further incorporated into its data protection notice.<br/><br/>Irish Water has confirmed that all its systems have undergone extensive independent quality assurance testing. In addition, the DPC has worked closely with Irish Water to agree the process for the capture, storage and usage of customer data. Furthermore, Irish Water has also confirmed that no data will be stored outside of the European Economic Area (EEA), and that it will not sell any customer data. There may be limited instances where Irish Water might need to share information with third parties with whom it has service agreements for operational reasons, e.g. ICT support for systems maintenance, and this will be done under full compliance with all Data Protection requirements.<br/><br/>Irish Water has established a dedicated team to deal with representations and queries from public representatives.

The installation programme commenced in August 2013 and will be implemented nationally as quickly as possible.<br/><br/>Up to 300,000 households may not be metered in the initial metering programme due to either the high cost or the technical difficulty of doing so. Irish Water has commissioned a study on possible approaches to metering properties that are not part of the current metering programme, including apartments and properties with shared service connections. On the basis of this report, it has been agreed to incorporate 48,000 apartments, identified by the report as being easily metered, into the current metering programme. The advancement of any further phase of metering, including the individual metering of properties with a shared service connection, will be a matter for consideration by the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), based on proposals from Irish Water.<br/><br/>The proposed approach to charging was outlined by Irish Water in a water charges plan submitted to the CER in line with the provisions of the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013. In approving the p lan the CER was required to take account of a Ministerial policy direction which issued to the CER in July 2014, in accordance with section 42 of the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013. Against this background, the CER has approved the water charges plan which provides that properties not connected to a meter would be billed on the basis of a scheme of assessed charges based on occupancy. Full details of the CER decision are available on its website, . The policy direction of July 2014 requires the CER to review assessed charges in the light of emerging data on metered consumption to ensure that the assessed charges remain as close a proxy for actual usage as possible. <br/><br/>A range of flexible payment options will be available to Irish Water&rsquo;s customers. The company will facilitate bill payment through direct debit, cheque, credit/debit cards, over-the-counter payments (at paypoint and payzone outlets as well as post offices), and electronic funds transfer.<br/><br/>Irish Water has established a dedicated team to deal with representations and queries from public representatives.

This policy provided for charges based on actual metered consumption and is consistent with the requirements of the Water Framework Directive.<br/><br/>With effect from 1 January 2014, Irish Water is responsible for public water services. The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that Irish Water can collect charges from its customers in receipt of water services provided by it. The Act also provides that responsibility for the independent economic regulation of the water sector is assigned to the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and the CER has been given statutory responsibility for protecting the interests of customers.<br/><br/>The proposed approach to charging was outlined by Irish Water in a water charges plan which it submitted to the CER in line with the provisions of the Act. The CER recently held a public consultation on this plan which covered a range of issues relating to water charges. Last week, the CER issued a determination on the water charges plan. Full details and associated documentation are available on the CER website ().<br/><br/>It should be noted that the existing arrangements for all non-domestic customers are remaining in place with no changes for the time being. On this basis, the local authorities will continue to bill for non-domestic water services as agents of Irish Water. The CER will be reviewing all aspects of non-domestic water tariffs under a series of public consultations and will publish the time-line for this process before the end of 2014.</p></reply>

The order must be made by resolution i.e. it is a reserved function of the Council, and must be confirmed by An Bord Plean&aacute;la. In March 1987, the then Minister directed Dublin County Council to make a Special Amenity Area Order for the Liffey Valley and the order was confirmed on 8 March 1990. </p><p>  I am fully supportive of the protection and further enhancement of the Liffey Valley as an amenity.

My Department assists local authorities in carrying out their role as competent auth orities under waste legislation , which involves the taking of necessary measures, on behalf of the State, to ensure that any waste generated and left abandoned by diesel launderers is disposed of without endangering human health and without harming the environment.<br/><br/>The illegal deposition of the waste material arising from diesel laundering activities presents the local authorities with major difficulties as the task of cleaning up the material needs to be dealt with to avoid threats to the environment. The laundering process requires the use of chemicals such as sulphuric acid and bleaching agents and results in a waste by-product, a tar-like chemical compound or sludge, with the potential for environmental pollution, particularly in relation to watercourses.<br/><br/>Approximately 900 incidents of diesel laundering waste dumping have been dealt with by local authorities to date and my Department has up to now reimbursed the costs associated with such disposal on a case by case basis. The majority of the clean-up operations have taken place in Louth and Monaghan, with 490 and 406 sites respectively. Further diesel laundering facilities have been identified in Counties Cavan, Donegal, Offaly, Meath and Waterford.<br/><br/>Details of the amount s provided by my Department since 2008 on a per county basis areset out in the table below. <table><tr><th>Year </th><th>Louth County Council </th><th>Monaghan County Council </th><th>Offaly County Council </th><th>Cavan County Council </th><th>Donegal County Council </th><th>Total </th></tr><tr><td>2008 </td><td>&euro;448,460 </td><td>&euro;109,615 </td><td>- </td><td>- </td><td>- </td><td>&euro;558,075 </td></tr><tr><td>2009 </td><td>&euro;314,678 </td><td>&euro;45,632 </td><td>- </td><td>- </td><td>- </td><td>&euro;360,310 </td></tr><tr><td>2010 </td><td>&euro;246,211 </td><td>&euro;28,414 </td><td>&euro;29,270 </td><td>- </td><td>- </td><td>&euro;303,895 </td></tr><tr><td>2011 </td><td>&euro;939,315 </td><td>&euro;89,588 </td><td>- </td><td>- </td><td>- </td><td>&euro;1,028,903 </td></tr><tr><td>2012 </td><td>&euro;1,452,267 </td><td>&euro;347,350 </td><td>- </td><td>&euro;23,458 </td><td>- </td><td>&euro;1,823,075 </td></tr><tr><td>2013 </td><td>&euro;693,048 </td><td>&euro;150,946 </td><td>- </td><td></td><td>&euro;40,753 </td><td>&euro;884,747 </td></tr><tr><td>Total </td><td>&euro;4,093,979 </td><td>&euro;771,545 </td><td>&euro;29,270 </td><td>&euro;23,458 </td><td>&euro;40,753 </td><td>&euro;4,959,005 </td></tr></table><br/><br/><br/><br/>This is a significant expenditure borne at present by the Environment Fund. As part of ongoing cooperation with the Northern Ireland authorities on repatriation of illegally deposited waste in Northern Ireland, discussions have taken place on the need to develop a mechanism for dealing with waste from cross-border diesel washings which would be factored into the overall discussions on waste repatriation. These discussions are ongoing.<br/><br/>I believe that a complete solution to this problem must necessarily involve effective and co-ordinated enforcement of the law from both a revenue and waste management perspective. In that context, my Department continues to liaise with representatives of the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, the local authorities concerned and the EPA&rsquo;s Office of Environmental Enforcement to seek to identify more effective enforcement solutions and these engagements will continue.<br/><br/>The use of identifying markers as a means of tackling fuel fraud is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners. </p></reply>

Through the National Broadband Plan (NBP) the Government aims to ensure that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses in Ireland. This is being achieved through measures designed to accelerate commercial investment and the development of a State-led intervention for non-commercial areas.<br/><br/>Under EU State Aid Guidelines Member States cannot intervene where commercial investors have plans to roll out services. A comprehensive mapping exercise is underway in my Department to identify those areas that require a State intervention. An initial list of areas has already identified and includes 18 areas in County Kildare, including Newtown. I am also aware of extensive rollout of high speed broadband services in County Kildare by at least one commercial operator. <br/><br/>As part of the mapping process, an initial stakeholder consultation on certain technical aspects of the proposed Plan was launched in June with a deadline of 15th September last. 31 submissions were received as part of this process and non-commercially sensitive versions of these responses will be published by my Department over the coming weeks. <br/><br/>I expect to publish the maps for public consultation later this year. These will include details of the areas requiring State intervention. The maps will be dynamic and will be subject to change if new commercial investments are announced in the future. <br/><br/>A further public consultation on a detailed intervention strategy will be launched in mid-2015. <br/><br/>EU State Aid clearance will be required for the State intervention. My Department will be working closely with the European Commission on this important aspect of the programme.<br/><br/>Finally, a detailed procurement process will have to be undertaken in order to select a potential preferred bidder(s) prior to commencing the roll out of high speed broadband services.<br/><br/>This complex and ambitious project is a key priority for Government and for my Department. It aims to conclusively address current connectivity challenges in a sustainable and meaningful way. Our goal is to ensure that quality broadband services are available to all citizens regardless of where they are located.</p></reply>

To date, wind energy has been the largest driver of growth in renewable electricity, contributing most towards the achievement of the 2020 target. Provisional figures for 2013 indicate that 16.4% of electricity demand was met by wind generation. There is now over 2,000 MW of wind generation connected to the grid in Ireland. It is estimated that a total of between 3,500 and 4,000 MW of onshore renewable generation capacity will be required to allow Ireland to meet its 40% renewable electricity target. Under the Gate 3 grid connection programme over 3,000 MW of renewable generation has taken up connection offers, much of which is onshore wind.<br/><br/>The Transmission System Operators in Ireland and Northern Ireland, EirGrid and SONI, publish the <i>All Island Generation Capacity Statement </i>on an annual basis. The Statement outlines the levels of electricity demand, and generation capacity, expected to be available in both jurisdictions for the coming decade. This includes the expected rate of connections for wind generation, which is set out in detail at Appendix 2 of the report. Information on the connection of new generation is also available on an ongoing basis on the EirGrid and ESB Networks websites.</p></reply>

There is no separate allocation for the LIS.  Instead, local authorities may use up to 15% (increased from 7% in 2013) of their initial Discretionary Grant towards local improvement schemes should they wish to do so. The local contribution for these schemes remains at 20% of the total cost of the project.</p><p>  Details of the 2014 regional and local roads grants were communicated to local authorities on 24 January this year.</p><p>  Furthermore, it is open to local authorities to supplement the percentage of their Discretionary Grant that they can use for the LIS with their own resources.</p><p>  The above position is likely to extend into 2015. Some local authorities want the LIS while others prefer to put the funding into public roads. I think this decision is best made at a local level.</p></reply>

I expect to receive a report from the NTA on the outcome of the review by early 2015.<br/><br/>I also expect at that time to receive the updated DART Underground business case and the preliminary business case for the Swords/Airport Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) scheme from the NTA.<br/><br/>I will then consider the options for addressing key public transport deficits in the GDA having regard to the costs and benefits of each project and  to available Exchequer funding as well as other possible sources of funds. I expect to finalise  this review  by mid-2015.<br/><br/>Significant Exchequer resources will be required to advance any major project irrespective of the availability of private or EU funds. New projects cannot be funded within the existing level of resources available to my Department. The key priority over the coming years is to protect investment made to date and to maintain safety standards. If additional funds are available, which is not certain, there will be many competing projects from all transport modes in all regions.  I will prioritise any additional funds for projects for which there is a clear need, which are affordable, have a sound business case and add value to existing infrastructure. </p></reply>

The purpose of the fund is to provide resources for use by the principal State collecting cultural institutions in acquiring, for the national collections, items of moveable heritage such as artefacts, manuscripts, books and works of art that<br/><br/>- are both rare and of national importance,<br/><br/>-are outstanding examples of their type,<br/><br/>-are pre-eminent in their class, and<br/><br/>-otherwise could not be acquired.<br/><br/>The Act provided for a total fund of &euro;12.697m over a five-year period, broken down between an allocation of &euro;3,809,214 in the financial year 2001, &euro;2,539,476 in each of the financial years 2002, 2003, 2004, and finally a sum of &euro;1,269,738 in the financial year 2005.  Funding for the Heritage Fund is held in the Heritage Fund Public Investment Account, an interest-bearing account.  <br/><br/>The five eligible institutions that may benefit from the Heritage Fund are:<br/><br/>-The National Archives,<br/><br/>-The National Gallery of Ireland,<br/><br/>-The National Library of Ireland,<br/><br/>-The National Museum of Ireland, and<br/><br/>-The Irish Museum of Modern Art.<br/><br/>The Heritage Fund remains in place and currently contains &euro;217,826.11 in funding.  This amount is, however, below the amount laid down in the legislation for an individual acquisition, each of which must be valued above &euro;317,435. As the existing legislation does not allow for the replenishment of the fund, the balance of the fund is currently in an interest-bearing account and cannot be used for acquisitions.  Consequently, no acquisitions have been made using the fund since 2007.  The matter is being kept under review.<br/><br/></p></reply>
