    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-10-02a.7.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014100200031#WRA00500"><p>The ability of some multinationals to lower the amount of corporation tax they pay world-wide using international structures is an issue that has attracted a lot of public and media attention over the past 24 months. </p><p>  The G20 have acknowledged that this is a global challenge that requires global action, and this is happening through the OECD Base Erosion and Profit Shifting ('BEPS') project.  Ireland is actively engaged in this process and it is anticipated that BEPS will result in changes being made to the international taxation rulebook which countries rely on for international trade.    </p><p>  At the same time, countries are increasingly competing for mobile foreign direct investment ('FDI').  The competitiveness of Ireland's overall corporate tax regime is important in that regard, and as I said in my Budget speech last October, Ireland will play fair, as we have always done, but play to win. </p><p>  Last year I published a new International Tax Strategy statement in the Budget which sets out Ireland's objectives and commitments in relation to these issues.  In it, I was clear that the best way to address the issue of aggressive tax planning across borders is for countries to work together at an international level.  This is particularly important as we need to ensure a level playing field among countries, in order for Ireland to compete fairly.</p><p>  As I said in the D&aacute;il last week, I remain firmly of the view that the changes that are coming internationally present many opportunities for Ireland as a competitive location for FDI.</p><p>  For example, one of the key concepts of BEPS is the better alignment of substance with taxing rights. The alignment of substance with a competitive rate of tax has been the cornerstone of our corporation tax policy since the 1950s so I believe that any change that may result from this process will lead to additional opportunities for Ireland.  Ireland has not been and will never will be a brass-plate location.  We only have and want real substantive FDI, the kind that brings real jobs and investment into Ireland.  This will not change in the post-BEPS environment.</p><p>  At 12.5%, Ireland has the most competitive headline corporate tax rate in the OECD, which is applied to a broad base.  Corporate tax rates are a matter of national sovereignty. This Government is committed to maintaining it. </p><p>  Ireland's offering of a competitive corporate tax rate, the availability of skills, and a reputation for being business friendly is a huge advantage that other countries will struggle to match.  As international tax loopholes progressively get closed down, our low general corporation tax rate will become even more attractive.</p><p>  Indeed as we continue to improve our offering for knowledge based investment, R&amp;amp;D and intellectual property, I believe over the coming years we can continue to grow our share of FDI-related investment.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-10-02a.10.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014100200031#WRA00700"><p>Section 10 of the NAMA Act outlines clearly the primary objective that the legislature set for NAMA, namely that it achieves the best financial return for the State from the assets entrusted to it.  NAMA is making very significant progress by reference to this objective.  In my recent section 227 Review of NAMA, which the Deputy should be aware of, the NAMA Board have announced renewed debt redemption targets. By the end of this year, NAMA will have redeemed 50% of its senior debt, two years ahead of schedule, and expects to have redeemed 80% of its senior debt by the end of 2016 assuming that market conditions remain strong.  This progress is extremely important in ensuring that Irish taxpayers face no further losses from the banking and property market crash.  It is also extremely important in terms of generating confidence at home and abroad in Ireland's economic recovery.  In their recent decisions to upgrade Ireland's sovereign credit rating, both Standard and Poor's and Moody's highlighted the faster rate at which NAMA is paying down its debt and reducing Ireland's contingent liability.  NAMA is clearly achieving the mandate set for it by the Oireachtas and I do not propose any course of action that could impact on its ability to complete this important work on behalf of Irish taxpayers.</p><p>  It is not part of NAMA's statutory remit to supply social housing.  Nonetheless, and consistent with its commercial objectives, NAMA is making a very significant contribution in facilitating the delivery of social housing through the Housing Agency to local authorities and approved housing bodies.  It has made 5,455 houses and apartments available to local authorities and approved housing bodies for social housing.  These 5,455 units constitute one third of the completed housing stock held in Ireland by NAMA's debtors and receivers and almost all of NAMA's unoccupied housing stock.  NAMA has also invested over &euro;20m to date in finishing, refurbishing and fitting out these homes for delivery as social housing where local authorities have confirmed demand.    </p><p>  NAMA has no role in determining the take-up of properties that it has made available for social housing as this is a matter for local authorities.  However, NAMA has introduced a number of initiatives to streamline the delivery of homes for which demand has been confirmed.  This includes the establishment of a special purpose vehicle, National Asset Residential Property Services Ltd. (NARPS), to expedite the delivery of housing.  Through NARPS, NAMA acquires houses and apartments from debtors and receivers and directly leases them to approved housing bodies under long-term leasing arrangements - reducing the initial capital outlay required from the approved housing bodies.  In conjunction with the establishment of NARPS, NAMA worked with the housing bodies and introduced standardised leasing terms to further streamline the process.  Both these initiatives are working extremely well.  </p><p>  Of the 5,455 properties made available by NAMA, local authorities have confirmed demand for just over 2,000 units.  NAMA expects that it will exceed the target of delivering 1,000 of these homes for social housing by the end of 2014 with the remainder being delivered over the following 12-18 months.</p><p>  NAMA has also signalled its intention to provide future Part V housing on NAMA-funded residential developments through its social housing SPV, National Asset Residential Property Services Ltd. (NARPS).  This is a very important initiative, which will mean that NAMA will bear the upfront capital cost of delivering Part V housing on estates for which it funds development and that such housing will be delivered on-site fully in accordance with Government policy in this area. </p><p>  As the Deputy is aware, NAMA has stated that it will fund the delivery of some 4,500 new homes in the Dublin area over the period to end-2016. Furthermore, sites held by its debtors and receivers could provide a further 18,000 new homes in the Dublin area and significant additional housing in the other main urban centres in the period beyond 2016.  These numbers highlight the substantial contribution that NAMA could make, directly and indirectly, to the delivery of housing stock generally and as part of that, the delivery of social housing through Part V over the coming years. </p><p>  I am satisfied therefore that, in the context of its overriding commercial mandate, NAMA is doing all that it can to facilitate the supply of social housing and I do not propose to make any changes to its mandate.  The statutory clarity given to NAMA by the Oireachtas in 2009 has been very important in guiding the Agency's work and progress to date and I am satisfied that the clarity provided by the fact that its mandate is primarily a commercial mandate has been an important factor in its success.</p></reply>

This coupled with continued expenditure restraint means that we will overperform the 4.8% of GDP forecast by a comfortable margin.  The next official forecast of the 2014 deficit will be contained in the White Paper on Receipts and Expenditures which will be published on midnight, Friday 10 October.  This will also incorporate the no-policy change scenario for 2015 as sought by the Deputy.</p><p>  A considerable part of the overperformance of taxes in 2014 will have a positive base effect going into 2015. Furthermore, the introduction of the ESA 2010 European statistical standards has led to the upward revision to the level of GDP in Ireland going back over a number of years. These were first presented by the CSO in July 2014 and Budget 2015 will be the first publication to be based on the new standard. </p><p>  Overall GDP in 2013 was revised up by &euro;10.7bn or 6.5 per cent by the CSO, from &euro;164.1bn to &euro;174.8bn. The bulk of the upward revisions (&euro;7.0bn) relates the inclusion of research and development (R&amp;amp;D) as capital formation. However, other revisions mainly relating to revised estimates of exports and the inclusion of illicit activity have added about &euro;3.7 bn. These revisions have had a small positive impact on the growth rates in previous years. </p><p>  In terms of carry forward to be contained in the forthcoming Budget, it is presently estimated that there will be a very limited negative revenue carryover into 2015 as a result of Budget 2014 measures. It should also be noted that the pension levy of 0.6% is not included in the budgetary arithmetic for 2015.</p><p>  With regard to the proposed early repayment of IMF loans, the proposal is to make an early repayment of a portion of those loans and final agreement on this is subject to the necessary national approval procedures of EU Member States. Annual savings achieved on interest expenditure due to any early repayment will depend market conditions at the time of any such repayments, however the cash savings achieved over the maturity of the loans are expected to be in the region of &euro;1.5 billion.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-10-02a.16.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014100200031#WRA01100"><p>The Central Bank has advised that there is no such regulated category as 'sub-prime' lender but that phrase is sometimes used to refer to some non-deposit taking 'retail credit firms'. Retail credit firms are a regulated category of entities which are authorised to provide credit (in the form of cash loans) directly to individuals. Some firms authorised in this category are mortgage lenders. Retail credit firms have been subject to regulation by the Central Bank since 1 February 2008. A register of all Retail Credit Firms is available on the Central Bank website.</p><p>  The latest published Central Bank mortgage arrears and restructures statistics are to end June 2014 and show overall arrears and arrears greater than 90 days fell for the fourth and third consecutive quarter respectively.  At end-June 2014, there were 762,575 private residential mortgage accounts for principal dwellings held in the State, with some 90,343 principal dwelling houses in arrears of greater than 90 days, representing a decline in the greater than 90 days arrears category of 3 per cent over the quarter.  I am informed by the Central Bank that, at end-June 2014, six of these retail credit firms had a total of 17,986 principal dwelling house mortgage accounts of which 5,047 were classified as restructured.  </p><p>  The Central Bank has informed me that the same consumer protection framework applies to retail credit lenders as to other regulated lenders including the Consumer Protection Code and the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears. The CCMA sets out requirements for all mortgage lenders, including retail credit firms, dealing with borrowers in arrears or pre-arrears on a mortgage loan which is secured by their primary residence. It provides a strong consumer protection framework to ensure that borrowers struggling to keep up mortgage repayments are treated in a fair and transparent manner by their lender and that long term resolution is sought by lenders with each of their borrowers.  The Central Bank has advised that retail credit firms were also included in the scope of the Central Bank's recent review of the 'Implementation of the Revised CCMA' by mortgage lenders, the purpose of which was to ensure that mortgage lenders achieved full implementation of the requirements of the revised CCMA by end December 2013.</p><p>  The Central Bank continues to engage with all mortgage lenders, including retail credit firms, in relation to lenders' mortgage arrears resolution strategies and approaches to dealing with borrowers in or facing arrears.  Early and effective engagement between borrowers and lenders is key to resolving cases of mortgage difficulty.  Where there is effective and meaningful engagement regarding a mortgage difficulty, an increasing number of durable long term mortgage restructures is being put in place.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-10-02a.19.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014100200031#WRA01300"><p>The Pyrite Panel appointed by the Minister for the Environment, Community &amp;amp; Local Government recommended that consideration be given to providing an exemption from LPT where damage from pyritic heave had been proven by testing in accordance with a National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) standard capable of determining if there was reactive pyrite in the sub-floor hard core materials, and if it had caused pyritic heave.  I.S. 398 titled "Reactive pyrite in sub-floor hardcore material Part 1: Testing and categorisation protocol" was published on 29 January 2013 by the NSAI in response to the Panel's recommendation.</p><p>  Accordingly, section 10A of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) provides that an exemption from the charge to Local Property Tax (LPT) will apply for a temporary period of at least three consecutive years for residential properties that have been certified under the Finance (Local Property Tax) (Pyrite Exemption) Regulations 2013 made by the Minister for the Environment, Community &amp;amp; Local Government  as having &quot;significant pyritic damage&quot;.  The Regulations set out the methodology for the assessment of dwellings to establish significant pyritic damage. These Regulations require that homeowners demonstrate significant pyritic damage in accordance with the NSAI standard I.S. 398. </p><p>  To be eligible for an exemption from LPT, a liable person must</p><p>  - have a Damage Condition Rating of 2 or a Damage Condition Rating of 1 with progression, established on foot of a Building Condition Assessment (&quot;BCA&quot;) carried out by a competent person in accordance with the NSAI standard, and</p><p>  - have a sub-floor hard core material classified by the appropriate competent person(s), as susceptible to significant or limited expansion, established on foot of testing the sub-floor hard core material.</p><p>  The purpose of the Building Condition Assessment is to demonstrate damage and to inform whether sampling and testing of the sub-floor hardcore of the residential property should be undertaken in order to confirm that such damage arises from pyrite.  The Building Condition Assessment does not involve any invasive internal or external inspections to a residential property and, on its own, cannot be used to state conclusively that reactive pyrite is present in the sub-floor hardcore of the property.</p><p>  Officials of my Department, with officials of the Department of Environment, Community &amp;amp; Local Government, have been examining the alternatives other than testing that may be available in order to confirm entitlement to a Local Property Tax exemption. I expect to make a decision in the matter shortly that will be consistent with the original objectives of the legislation and the report of the Pyrite Panel and I will communicate my decision to the Deputy immediately it is made. I thank her for bringing this matter to attention.</p></reply>

However the Bank is responsible for supervising for conduct of business rules. Furthermore, EEA insurance regulators are members of the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority, EIOPA, and are required to comply with the general protocol relating to the collaboration of the insurance supervisory authorities of the member states of the European Union. This general protocol statement was issued in 2008 and is under review by EIOPA.<br/><br/>The current legal and regulatory framework for the provision of insurance in the European Economic Area, and the supervision of that activity, is prescribed by European Union Law in the Life and Non-Life Insurance Directives.  Since the relevant legislation is EU determined, there may be limits  as to what can be done in the short-term.  The matter has, however, been raised with the European Commission and it has indicated that it will also review whether any issues raised relating to the regulatory and legislative framework require action.  It is too early as yet to consider whether legislative measures. <br/><br/>Following negotiations that were completed at European level in November, 2013, a new regime known as Solvency II will commence on 1 January 2016.  This will strengthen the EU regulatory framework. The Solvency II EU Directive sets out new, stronger EU-wide requirements on capital adequacy and risk management for insurers with the key aim of increasing policyholder protection.  The new regime will also ensure greater cooperation between supervisors. <br/><br/>With regard to domestic legislation, my officials are taking note of how the ICF framework is responding to current requirements. My Department and the Central Bank will in due course be reviewing the overall circumstances relating to Setanta and report to me on what lessons can be learned and how the framework can be strengthened.</p></reply>

Taken in conjunction with first quarter data, GDP grew by 5.8 per cent in the first half of this year. The increase in economic activity is broadly-based with both domestic sectors and exporting sectors performing strongly.</p><p>  Recovery is perhaps most clearly evident in the labour market with employment increasing in each of the last seven quarters representing an increase of over 70,000 jobs since the low-point in mid-2012.  In line with this, the standardised unemployment rate stood at 11.2 per cent in August, having fallen from a peak of 15.1 per cent in 2012.</p><p>  Significant progress has been made in addressing the underlying problems of the public finances.  The policy measures implemented by the Government have resulted in a decline in the deficit.  This decline has been gradual and in a phased manner, consistent with the dual needs of supporting economic activity as well as repairing the public finances.  All of the interim deficit ceilings that were set have been met and Ireland is firmly on track to achieve a deficit of below 3 per cent in 2015.  This has been important in restoring Ireland's credibility.  Thereafter, fiscal policy will be set in line with the requirement to move towards Ireland's medium-term budgetary objective, which is for a balanced budget in structural terms.  In addition, the debt-to-GDP ratio is estimated to have peaked and is now on a firm downward trajectory.</p><p>  The Government remains focused on maintaining the reform momentum to achieve the goals of creating more jobs to enhance living standards and ultimately to achieve full employment.  The Government will work to ensure that any obstacles to achieving this are removed.  While the Goverment recognises that further improvements in competitiveness are needed, all the recent data show that we are moving in the right direction.</p></reply>

This includes a specific provision in relation to the retroactive application of the instrument. Therefore, the agreement, that we were active in negotiating, keeps open the possibility to apply to the European Stability Mechanism for a retrospective direct recapitalisation of the Irish banks, should we wish to avail of it.</p><p>  What is now required is a decision by mutual agreement of the ESM Board of Governors to create a new ESM instrument in accordance with Article 19 of the ESM treaty. The aim is to have this process completed by early November this year, subject to completion of national approval procedures. For Ireland the European Stability Mechanism (Amendment) Bill 2014 which was published last week will fulfil this purpose.  The Board of Governors' decision would allow the ESM DRI to come into effect once the Single Supervisory Mechanism is in place and operational which is expected to be on 4 November this year. </p><p>  In relation to retrospective recapitalisation, the draft guideline states that the potential retroactive application of the instrument should be decided on a case-by-case basis and by mutual agreement. As I have stated previously, it will not be possible to make a formal application to the ESM for retrospective recapitalisation before the Instrument is in place as expected in November.

Through the introduction of various initiatives, the stability and resilience of the financial sector has been strengthened and restored to a position where it better serves the economies and people of Europe. We have played a crucial role in driving that reform agenda, none more so than during our Presidency in 2013.  </p><p>  A series of measures have been introduced to reduce the risks across the financial system and to minimise the adverse effects of future financial crises. The Deposit Guarantee Scheme Directive (DGSD) significantly enhances depositors' confidence by introducing faster pay-out and more credible funding of the various Deposit Guarantee Schemes. Agreement was reached during our presidency on the Capital Requirements Directive and Regulation which increases the level and quality of bank capital thereby improving banks' capacity to absorb losses. The package requires banks to build additional capital buffers in good times that can be used in periods of stress. The Directive for Bank Recovery and Resolution (BRRD) is geared at reducing the impact of bank failures on the economy and to help insure that the costs of future failures are not borne by taxpayers. It provides for a more orderly resolution of EU banks thereby minimising the risk of future state interventions to maintain financial stability.</p><p>  Measures have also been introduced to address weaknesses in the institutional structures. In this regard, three new European Supervisory Authorities and the European Systemic Risk Board were established in 2011 to improve cross-border cooperation and to ensure consistent enforcement of rules and systemic oversight. The creation of the European System of Financial Supervisors (ESFS) and in particular the three European supervisory authorities, the European Banking Authority (EBA), the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), and the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA), ensure a single regulatory framework and its uniform application across the EU. The Single Rulebook for all EU member states will mean a common set of rules on supervision, deposit insurance and resolution. Building on the single rulebook, the first pillar of banking union is the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) which transfers key supervisory tasks for significant banks in the euro area to the European Central Bank. The second pillar of banking union, the Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM), provides for an integrated and effective resolution process for all banks in participating member states including Ireland.   </p><p>  Measures have also been brought forward aimed at improving the stability and efficiency of the single market in financial services. The Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) and the Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation (MiFIR) aim to strengthen the protection of investors by making financial markets more efficient, resilient and transparent. The new framework will also increase the supervisory powers of regulators and provide clear operating rules for all trading activities. The European Markets Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) provides for more stability, transparency and efficiency in derivatives markets regulation. The funds sector is being overhauled by the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (AIFMD) and the Money Market Funds Regulation (MMF). The AIFMD provides Europe-wide regulation for the management of collective investment schemes aimed at professional or qualified investors while the MMF proposal provides for greater regulation of shadow banking thereby safeguarding the integrity of the internal market by addressing the liquidity and stability of money market funds. </p><p>  In relation to insurance regulation, the Solvency II proposal, coupled with Omnibus II, sets out stronger EU-wide requirements on capital adequacy and risk management for insurers with the key aim of increasing policyholder protection. This new risk-based system for the regulation and supervision of European insurance and reinsurance undertakings is necessary in order to ensure a safe and solid insurance sector that can provide sustainable insurance products and support the real economy through long-term investments and additional stability.</p><p>  The reform of our statutory code for the financial services sector has been and continues to be driven by the comprehensive set of reforms that have been brought forward at EU level. However, a number of significant domestic legislative reforms have been undertaken towards building a strengthened regulatory framework for the financial services sector which complements the strategically important reforms at EU level. </p><p>  The Central Bank Reform Act 2010 created a single fully-integrated Central Bank of Ireland with a unitary board, the Central Bank Commission, chaired by the Governor of the Central Bank. The unitary Central Bank structure gives the Commission members a more complete remit over prudential regulation and financial stability issues. In 2011 the new Fitness and Probity regime was rolled out by the Central Bank in accordance with the provisions of the Central Bank Reform Act 2010. The regime provides for new powers to be exercised by the Central Bank to ensure the fitness and probity of nominees to key positions within financial service providers and of key office-holders within those providers. </p><p>  The Central Bank and Credit Institutions (Resolution) Act was also introduced in 2011. It provides the necessary mechanisms to enable the Central Bank to intervene where a credit institution gets into serious difficulty and is in danger of becoming destabilised or otherwise failing.</p><p>  The Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 enhances the Central Bank's regulatory powers, drawing on the lessons of the recent past. It strengthens the ability of the Central Bank to impose and supervise compliance with regulatory requirements and to undertake timely prudential interventions.  The Act also provides the Central Bank with greater access to information and analysis and underpins the credible enforcement of Irish financial services legislation in line with international best practice. </p><p>  The EU financial regulation reform agenda is continuing to strengthen regulation and supervision to improve the stability and functioning of the financial system for the benefit of the economies and people of the EU.  The financial system has changed significantly since the financial crisis and improved in areas of key importance. I and my Department will continue to work with our EU colleagues towards providing for a balanced regulatory framework that is consistent with both long-term growth and job creation and a more focused and proactive financial services sector.</p></reply>

Ireland's corporation tax rate plays an important role in attracting Foreign Direct Investment ('FDI') to Ireland and thereby increasing employment here.</p><p>  Further, it is clear that the certainty around the rate of Irish corporation tax is one of its biggest strengths, underlying the Government's commitment to the rate.  This certainty is important for business here, both domestic and international as companies plan investment decisions over the medium to long-term.</p><p>  With regard to international tax issues more generally, the ability of some multinationals to lower the amount of corporation tax they pay world-wide using international structures is an issue that has attracted a lot of public and media attention over the past 24 months. </p><p>  The G20 have acknowledged that this is a global challenge that requires global action, and this is happening through the OECD Base Erosion and Profit Shifting ('BEPS') project.  </p><p>  Ireland is actively engaged in this process and it is anticipated that BEPS will result in changes being made to the international taxation rulebook which countries rely on for international trade.  Ireland has always played by these rules and played to win as is evidenced by our successful track record for attracting FDI.  </p><p>  This will not change in the post-BEPS environment, and I believe that the BEPS project will create opportunities for Ireland.</p><p>  For example, one of the key concepts of BEPS is the better alignment of substance with taxing rights. The alignment of substance with a competitive rate of tax has been the cornerstone of our CT policy since the 1950s so I believe that any change that may result from this process will lead to additional opportunities for Ireland.  Ireland has not been and will never will be a brass-plate location. We only have and want real substantive FDI, the kind that brings real jobs and investment into Ireland.</p><p>  Ireland's offering of a competitive corporate tax rate, the availability of skills, and a reputation for being business friendly is a huge advantage that other countries will struggle to match.  As international tax loopholes progressively get closed down, our low general corporation tax rate will become even more attractive.</p><p>  Indeed as we continue to improve our offering for knowledge based investment, R&amp;amp;D and intellectual property, I believe over the coming years we can continue to grow our share of FDI-related investment.</p></reply>

I did, however, introduce an additional levy on pension funds at 0.15% for 2014 and 2015. I did this to continue to help fund the Jobs Initiative and also to help make provision for potential State liabilities which may emerge from difficulties facing pension funds.</p><p>  The reduced VAT rate of 9% on tourism and certain other services was one of the very significant and successful measures introduced by the Jobs Initiative. It was due to end in 2013. In my Budget 2014 speech I announced the continuation of the reduced 9% VAT rate. I also announced that the Air Travel Tax is being reduced to zero with effect from 1 April 2014. The 9% VAT rate has helped to create thousands of new jobs as well as protecting existing jobs. Since the Budget announcement about the reduction in the Air Travel Tax, airlines have announced the opening up of new routes resulting in significant increases in passenger numbers with the associated increase in tourism activity and employment.</p><p>  I also said in my Budget 2014 speech that the additional 0.15% levy for 2014 and 2015 would be used to help make provision for potential State liabilities which may emerge from pre-existing or future pension fund difficulties, although funds from the levy would not be hypothecated or specifically set aside for this purpose. The Government decided that such liabilities will be met by the Exchequer as they arise.</p><p>  I am advised by the Minister for Social Protection that the drawdown of funds to meet existing or future pension fund difficulties will only arise in the event of the wind up of a defined benefit pension scheme, where the employer is insolvent and there are not sufficient funds in the scheme to meet 50% of the liabilities of the scheme in respect of all scheme members or up to &euro;12,000 of pensioner liabilities.</p></reply>

The initiative also offers incentives for retailers and small businesses in those areas. This Initiative is subject to EU State Aid approval and a commencement order. An ex ante cost benefit analysis was conducted in the summer of 2013 and published alongside Budget 2014. An application for EU State Aid approval was submitted in March 2013. It is hoped that this issue will be concluded in the very near future. An independent cost-benefit analysis concluded that the Initiative would create more than 1,000 jobs for each of the 5 years it will be in place. The analysis also concluded that the annual cost would be in the order of &euro;3m per year.<br/><br/><b>Film Relief </b><br/><br/>The Film relief scheme has been in place since 1987. Finance Act 2013 introduced new provisions to ensure that Film tax reliefs will accrue to the producers rather than investors and result in tax savings for the Exchequer. Budget 2014 extended the definition of 'eligible individual' to include non-EU talent, in conjunction with the introduction of a withholding tax. It is intended to commence these provisions once EU State Aid approval has been given. The Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht are progressing this State Aid approval with the EU Commission. Statistics are not available to show the actual number of persons employed in the film industry. However, it is estimated that in 2013 just over 27,000 individual employments (both part-time and full-time) were generated on film productions supported by Section 481 relief.<br/><br/><b>Tax scheme for the construction or refurbishment of certain aviation services facilities</b><br/><br/>A scheme of accelerated capital allowances for the construction and refurbishment of certain buildings and structures for use in the maintenance, repair or overhaul of commercial aircraft, and the dismantling of such aircraft for the purposes of salvaging or recycling of parts or materials was announced in Budget 2013 and an application was made to the EU Commission on 18 June 2013. <br/><br/>The Commission formed the view that the scheme in its current form is not compatible with State Aid guidelines.

These rate increases were necessary to protect the yield from CGT in the context of the rebalancing of the public finances. An increase in the taxation of capital is preferable from the point of view of its impact on the economy as compared to an increase in employment taxes such as income tax.</p><p>  In common with all taxes, CGT is subject to on-going review and all reliefs and exemptions are carefully considered. In the circumstances in which we have found ourselves in recent years, and as opposed to embedding major long-term changes to the tax system which might prove controversial, divisive or unworkable, the approach (particularly in CGT) has increasingly been to introduce changes which are targeted and which apply for short-term periods to achieve focused outcomes.</p><p>  For example, a CGT relief was introduced in Budget and Finance Act 2012 to incentivise the purchase of property between 7 December 2011 and the end of 2013 with the intention of stimulating activity in the property market. The incentive was subsequently extended to property purchased to the end of 2014. I stated recently that this relief will not be extended further as it has served its purpose.</p><p>  The incentive applies to industrial, farmland, commercial and residential (buy-to-let) property (land and buildings) purchased to the end of this year. If the property is held for more than 7 years, the capital gains attributable to those 7 years will be exempt from CGT on a proportionate basis relative to the period of ownership. Property sold within the 7 year period subsequent to purchase will not qualify for relief.</p><p>  Relief for farm restructuring was introduced in Finance Act 2013 on disposals of farm land for the purpose of farm restructuring or consolidation. The relief applies to a sale, purchase or exchange of agricultural land in the period from 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2015 where Teagasc has certified that a sale and purchase or an exchange of agricultural land was made for farm restructuring purposes.</p><p>  Section 45 of Finance (No 2) Act of 2013 provides for a CGT relief for entrepreneurs who reinvest the proceeds from the disposal of assets made on or after 1 January 2010 in certain chargeable business assets. Commencement of the legislative provisions is subject to EU state-aid approval. Discussions with the EU Commission about State Aid clearance are ongoing. I hope that these will result in a positive outcome in the near future. Notwithstanding that the legislative provisions have yet to be commenced, the CGT relief will only apply, among other conditions, where new chargeable business assets acquired after 1 January 2014  and up to end- December 2018 are disposed of having been held for a minimum period of 3 years after acquisition in that period.</p><p>  Over the years other reliefs that had been in place for a number of years were reviewed and abolished or restricted. These included roll-over relief and indexation relief.  The relevance of these reliefs had to be weighed against what they were achieving, the cost of the reliefs and the opportunities for providing other more relevant relieving measures.</p><p>  In the context of this year's Budget and Finance Bill process, I will again consider what changes can be made to the CGT regime in order to encourage and facilitate investment in our improving economic environment.</p></reply>

Following on from the seven reports released two weeks ago, another batch of deliverables are due for completion in September 2015, with the remaining BEPS reports expected to be finalised in December 2015. We have welcomed the first set of reports as they are the first milestones in this project. However it is important to recognise that the timetable provides reporting timelines and not implementation deadlines. The BEPS actions will be implemented through a mixture of updates to OECD guidelines/recommendations which countries would have to strongly consider implementing in their domestic law, and updates to bilateral tax treaties, which the OECD plans to amend on a multilateral basis by means of an OECD Multilateral Convention. Of the seven recent deliverables, there are: two final reports (Action 1 Digital Economy and Action 15 - Feasibility of a Multilateral Instrument), one interim report (Action 5 Harmful tax practices) and four reports containing draft recommendations (Actions 2 Hybrid mismatches, 6 Treaty abuse, 8 Transfer pricing intangibles and 13 Transfer pricing documentation). The OECD has acknowledged that the recommendations remain draft in order to fully assess the interaction between all the different BEPS workstreams. Therefore the BEPS project is best seen as an overall package which is still in progress. While there is still significant work to be done in finalising the recommendations, the reports are a big step towards addressing problems in the international tax environment.</p></reply>

In summary, during Quarter 2, 67 Debt Relief Notices (DRN), 30 Debt Settlement Arrangements (DSA), and 27 Personal Insolvency Arrangements (PIA) were approved. The statistical report shows that three out of every four proposals for arrangements (for both DSAs and PIAs) result in acceptances.  <br/><br/>In addition, there were 98 bankruptcy adjudications in the second quarter of 2014 following the reduction in the duration of bankruptcy to three years.  In the year to the end of the second quarter there has been 164 bankruptcy adjudications compared to 58 in the whole of 2013.  The Deputy will also be aware that at his appearance before the Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, the Director of the Insolvency Service of Ireland said that monitoring creditor engagement will be a key focus of the ISI.<br/><br/>The ISI established a Debt Solutions Protocol Steering Group earlier this year to develop Protocols for both the Debt Settlement Arrangement (DSA) and Personal Insolvency Arrangement (PIA). These Protocols can be used by personal insolvency practitioners when making straightforward proposals to creditors for either a DSA or PIA.  The DSA protocol was finalised in July 2014 and can be accessed at the following link - .  The development of a protocol is in line with best practice in other jurisdictions and does not require amendments to existing legislation.  A similar protocol was developed in the UK for their Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA) which is comparable to the Debt Settlement Arrangement here in Ireland.  The UK protocol, once it was agreed and adopted apparently resulted in significant acceptance rates by creditors there - exceeding 90%.  Work began on a PIA protocol in August with a target date for completion of the end of the year.  <br/><br/>While the initial take up of insolvency solutions has been low, the fact that the ISI is now in place has acted as a catalyst to encourage debtors and creditors to reach bilateral deals to address their insolvency.  In the absence of bilateral agreements, the new statutory frameworks are a mechanism requiring all relevant creditors to engage with and respond to an insolvency arrangement proposed by a debtor.  Of course both debtors and creditors have rights in a financial contract and these must be respected, but in the event that either a DSA or PIA cannot be agreed, the ultimate resolution option is judicial bankruptcy.</p></reply>

As general government debt expressed as a percentage of gross domestic product is the standard metric internationally for assessing debt levels, general government interest rather than national debt interest is the more appropriate metric to look at.  The SPU general government interest costs are set out in the table. <table><tr><th>&euro;m</th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th><th>2016</th><th>2017</th><th>2018</th></tr><tr><td>General government interest</td><td>7,966</td><td>8,452</td><td>8,836</td><td>9,251</td><td>9,573</td></tr></table><br/><br/><br/><br/>Budget 2015 on 14 October will contain updated fiscal forecasts, including interest expenditure. The forecast of interest expenditure will take into account any change in the Exchequer Borrowing Requirement (EBR), repayment profiles and the interest rate environment. It should also be noted that the SPU estimates of general government interest were calculated in accordance with the standards set in the 1995 European System of Accounts (ESA95) while the Budget estimates will be calculated on an ESA 2010 basis that entered into force with effect from the 1st of September this year.  <br/><br/>In relation to the proposed early repayment of IMF loans, the proposal is to make an early repayment of a portion of those loans and final agreement on this is subject to the necessary national approval procedures. Annual savings achieved on interest expenditure due to any early repayment will depend market conditions at the time of any such repayments, however the cash savings achieved over the maturity of the loans are expected to be in the region of &euro;1.5 billion.</p></reply>

The CCMA provides a strong consumer protection framework to ensure that borrowers struggling to keep up mortgage repayments are treated in a fair and transparent manner by their lender and that long term resolution is sought by lenders with each of their borrowers in genuine mortgage difficulty.<br/><br/>The Central Bank's latest 'Residential Mortgage Arrears and Repossessions Statistics' publication for the end of Quarter 2 2014 (), shows that the number of mortgage accounts for principal dwelling houses (PDH) in arrears, fell for the fourth consecutive quarter and at the end of June 2014, 90,343 (11.8 per cent) primary dwelling mortgage accounts were more than 90 days in arrears, representing a decline of 3% over the quarter.<br/><br/>Separately from Central Bank quarterly reports, a monthly reporting regime on mortgage restructures and arrears for the six main banks covered by the Central Bank's Mortgage Arrears Resolution Targets (MART) has been put in place by my Department.  The latest publication, with data to the end of July, shows that the number of PDH mortgage accounts in arrears of greater than 90 days has fallen by over 7,000 accounts when compared to the end of Q1 2014 while the total number of PDH mortgage arrears has fallen by 8,800 accounts in the same period.<br/><br/>The data published by my Department, as well as the Central Bank data, would appear to demonstrate some success by the lenders in addressing the accounts in mortgage arrears as well as measures to prevent borrowers from going into arrears.  However, increased engagement in this area by the financial institutions will be necessary to address the situation of those remaining householders facing difficulties in meeting their mortgage commitments.</p></reply>

However, consistent with its overall commercial objectives, NAMA is making a very significant contribution in facilitating the delivery of social housing.  It has made 5,455 houses and apartments, one third of the completed housing stock held by its debtors and receivers in Ireland, available to local authorities and approved housing bodies for social housing and has invested over &euro;20m to date in delivering homes for social housing where local authorities have confirmed demand.</p><p>  The Deputy may not appreciate that NAMA has no role in terms of determining the take-up of properties that it has made available for social housing as this is a matter for local authorities.  Of the 5,455 properties made available by NAMA, local authorities have confirmed demand for just over 2,000.  NAMA expects that it will exceed the target of delivering 1,000 of these homes for social housing by the end of the year with the remainder being delivered over the following 12-18 months.  </p><p>  Once demand is confirmed by local authorities through the Housing Agency and contracts have been entered into by local authorities or approved housing bodies, NAMA immediately makes the properties available.  This often involves significant investment by NAMA to complete building works and significant work to resolve often complex compliance issues in relation to, amongst other things, planning conditions, regulatory standards and Multi-unit Development requirements.  There are no shortcuts in this process.  NAMA is facilitating the delivery of homes for individuals and families through this very welcome initiative. </p><p>  The Deputy may also be aware that NAMA has established a special purpose vehicle, National Asset Residential Property Services Ltd. (NARPS), to expedite the delivery of housing.  Through NARPS, NAMA acquires houses and apartments from debtors and receivers and directly leases them to approved housing bodies under long-term leasing arrangements.  In conjunction with the establishment of NARPS, NAMA has introduced standardised leasing terms to further streamline the process.   </p><p>  NARPS has proven to be an effective method of delivery and NAMA recently announced its intention to provide future Part V housing on NAMA-funded residential developments through this mechanism.  This is a very important initiative, which will mean that NAMA will bear the upfront capital cost of delivering Part V housing on estates that it funds and that such housing will be delivered on site in line with Government policy aimed at ensuring greater integration in housing.  </p><p>  I am confident that NAMA, within the context of its overriding commercial objective, has done everything it can do to facilitate the delivery of social housing to Local Authorities and approved housing bodies through the existing residential stock securing its loans and it has clearly signalled its commitment to doing likewise through its funding for new residential development.</p></reply>

I have no statutory role in relation to regulated financial institutions passing on the European Central Bank interest rate change or to the mortgage interest rates charged.  It is a commercial matter for each institution concerned.  It is not appropriate for me, as Minister for Finance, to comment on or become involved in the detailed mortgage position of mortgage holders.</p><p>  The Central Bank has responsibility for the regulation and supervision of financial institutions in terms of consumer protection and prudential requirements and for ensuring ongoing compliance with applicable statutory obligations.  The Central Bank has no statutory role in the setting of interest rates by financial institutions apart from the interest rate cap imposed on the credit union sector in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Union Act, 1997. </p><p>  The mortgage interest rates that financial institutions operating in Ireland charge to customers are determined as a result of a commercial decision by the institutions concerned.  This interest rate is determined taking into account a broad range of factors, including European Central Bank base rates, deposit rates, market funding costs, the competitive environment and an institution's overall funding. </p><p>  However, as part of the Central Bank's work on mortgage arrears, lenders were asked to consider all avenues to help customers in arrears, including interest rate reductions.</p></reply>

The Act sets out the Council's functions, which can only be amended through primary legislation. </p><p>  In that context, Regulation (EU) 473/2013 introduced a requirement that draft budgets and the stability programme update must be based on macroeconomic forecasts that are produced or endorsed by an independent body. This endorsement function has been set out in an amendment to the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2012 and has been assigned to the Fiscal Council. </p><p>  Since its establishment, the Council has published six Fiscal Assessment Reports, all of which can be found on the Fiscal Council's website. I respond to these reports, usually in my next fiscal policy publication. However, given the gap between the last Fiscal Assessment Report in June 2014 and the publication of the Budget in October, I responded to the Council in writing on 22 July 2014. My response can be found on the websites of the Council and my own Department. The establishment of the Council has strengthened the fiscal governance of the country and its reports have widened and deepened the debate on fiscal policy.</p><p>  The Fiscal Council have also published a number of other papers, including a Pre-Budget paper on 22 September. This laid out the Council's recommendation that, despite the Exchequer returns, the benefits flowing from the switch over to ESA 2010 and the improved economic environment, consolidation of the order of &euro;2 billion should take place in Budget 2015.</p><p>  The Council maintain their consolidation recommendation for a number of reasons -</p><p>  -   in order to break the boom and bust pattern and show commitment to a new fiscal policy stance</p><p>  -   to return to sustainable medium-term economic growth and put debt on a strong downward path, and</p><p>  -   to comfortably secure compliance with the 3% general government deficit target</p><p>  The Council also recommends against any cuts in the Government's revenue-raising capacity, due to the considerable challenges it feels the Government faces in maintaining tight expenditure control. </p><p>  I note the views expressed by the Fiscal Council in the update of their fiscal stance, and their suggestions with regard to consolidation in Budget 2015. I agree wholeheartedly with the Council's view that we need to break the pattern of boom and bust economics and said so on many occassions. The Government has implemented a number of measures as part of a new fiscal framework to prevent the cyclical pressures of the past from driving fiscal policy, including multi-annual ministerial expenditure ceilings and greater fiscal transparency.</p><p>  We are required to deliver a deficit of no more than 2.9% of GDP in 2015, we will do what is needed to achieve this target. It looks likely that we can achieve our target without any further expenditure cuts or tax increases. This Government's track record is there for all to see. Each year we have continued to either meet or exceeded our deficit targets. The economy has returned to growth and jobs are being created. The objective of the upcoming Budget is both to broaden, deepen and secure this recovery.We will continue to be prudent and take the necessary steps to deliver metium-term growth and put our debt levels on a downward path.</p><p>  With regard to the longer term outlook, the forthcoming Budget will show a multi-annual path towards a more balanced budgetary position.  This timeframe reflects the Government's desire to provide certainty to Irish people over the medium term.  </p><p>  Finally, I agree with the Fiscal Council that taking account of demographic and other challenges, maintaining tight expenditure control will be tough.  However, taking tough decisions is the role of Government and something that we have shown a proven track record over recent years.  The hard decisions of recent years have paid off and I am confident that we are best placed to drive the recovery forward into the future.</p></reply>

This covers its use for DSP purposes as well as use by other agencies (in accordance with legislation - Section 262 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 2005 provides the basis for the allocation, use and sharing of the PPS Number).<br/><br/>Before a PPS Number can be allocated, the person making the application must provide evidence of identity, and demonstrate the reason why s/he requires the allocation of a PPS Number.  PPS Numbers are issued by the Department following checks on an individual&rsquo;s identity.  The checks vary depending on the type of individual concerned &ndash; the Department accepts notification via the General Register Office of births but insists on a face to face interview before issuing a PPS number to a resident of working age.  In addition, acceptable evidence of address must be provided.  The process of allocating a PPS Number has been expanded to include the capture of a photograph and signature.  This is being rolled out to PPS Number allocation centres and will be in place in all PPS Number allocation centres by the end of this year.  Photographs captured are compared with other photographs previously captured in order to detect any possible duplicates. <br/><br/>PPS Numbers may be used by persons in their dealings with public bodies that are specified in legislation.  I would also like to make the point that possession of a PPS Number, in itself, does not convey any entitlement.  While it can make identifying a person easier for both the individual and the agency, checks on identity and meeting the qualifying conditions for any service must be carried out.<br/><br/>It is not possible for me to describe all uses that other agencies have for the PPS Number, but it is worth remarking that my Department uses the number to identify an individual&rsquo;s PRSI contributions while they are working in the State.  This means that, even after they have left the State, the number allocated to them remains valid.  The PRSI contribution information will be relevant to calculating pension entitlements in other jurisdictions as well as in this one.  While there is no current activity on such PPS Numbers, activity is expected in the future as people reach retirement age.  Consequently it is not possible to determine the number of &ldquo;Active PPS Numbers&rdquo;.<br/><br/>PPS Numbers, once allocated, are not cancelled.  Should a PPS Number be compromised, that number is put beyond use, but is retained on the Department&rsquo;s records.<br/><br/>Details of the PPS Numbers allocated over the years have already been published and are available on the Department&rsquo;s Website at:<br/><br/><b>.</b></p></reply>

These rules prioritise the benefits of pensioner over the benefits of active and deferred scheme members. The priority given to the distribution of assets to deferred scheme members is the same as that given to active scheme members. The Social Welfare and Pensions (No. 2) Act 2013 amended the Pensions Act to change the wind up rules. This change deprioritised an element of pensioner benefits in favour of the benefits of active and deferred scheme members. There are no plans to make further changes to section 48 of the Pensions Act at this time.</p><p>  The manner in which the assets of a pension scheme are distributed is not an issue when a pension scheme is fully funded.

When the CWS transferred to the Department in October 2011 there were approximately 760 full time equivalent community welfare officers delivering the full range of community welfare services.  <br/><br/>The Department is continuing to examine the operation of all its services, including the CWS, in the context of the Pathways to Work commitments and the development of Intreo services nationally.  The Pathways to Work Programme represents a significant reform in the social welfare system and highlighted the need for the Department to focus its resources on the provision of opportunities, supports and assistance to unemployed people. The new Intreo service offers practical, tailored employment services and supports for jobseekers, a model which is currently being rolled out across the country. <br/><br/>Overall, this has resulted in a rebalancing of resources across the Department&rsquo;s range of activities including<font color="#004080"> </font>the relocation of some staff to main centres, primarily Intreo offices<font color="#004080">,</font>where a full range of services will be available in one location. As part of this programme of change approximately 430 satellite CWS clinics have been closed and approximately 300 posts have been redeployed to activation and case management support services, the majority coming from the former CWS cohort.<br/><br/>The Department currently has in the region of approximately 460 higher executive officer posts delivering the full range of CWS services. The number of officers serving per county or those as of October 2012 and 2013 are not available. <br/><br/>People claiming supports under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme generally only interact with the Department on an occasional basis, for example, when seeking an exceptional needs payment or in claiming additional supports such as rent supplement, which are usually reviewed once to twice yearly. Statistics are not maintained to allow the estimation of the population served per officer.<br/><br/>The staffing needs for all areas within the Department are continuously reviewed, to ensure that the best use is made of all available resources with a view to providing an efficient service to those who rely on the schemes operated by the Department and that the services provided are reconstituted, where necessary, to meet the changing needs of Irish society.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-10-02a.143.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014100200035#WRE01000"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 55 and 58 together. <br/><br/>The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term income support to assist with reasonable accommodation costs of eligible people living in private rented accommodation who are unable to provide for their accommodation costs from their own resources. The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer. There are currently approximately 73,500 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;344 million for 2014.  <br/><br/>Maximum rent limits are generally reviewed every 18 months. The most recent review was completed in June 2013 with revised rent limits introduced on 17 June 2013. Despite pressures on the social protection budget, the last review saw rent limits increase in line with market rents in some areas, including Dublin and Galway, with Dublin limits increasing by a weighted average of 9%. <br/><br/>A review of the maximum rent limits is being undertaken within the Department. This review involves a comprehensive analysis of information from a range of sources including rental tenancies registered with the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB), the Central Statistics Office rental indices, websites advertising rental properties, relevant Departments and Agencies, landlord representative groups and non-Government organisations such as Threshold, Focus Ireland and the Society of St Vincent de Paul. Any changes to social welfare supports can only be considered in a budgetary context.<br/><br/>The current difficulties in the rental market and the difficulties faced by prospective tenants, including those seeking access to rent supplement, is a shortage of supply of suitable properties in areas of high demand. The Government has recently launched its Construction Strategy with the aim of increasing housing supply generally. <br/><br/>I can assure the Deputies that officers administering rent supplement throughout the country have considerable experience in dealing with customers and make every effort to ensure that their accommodation needs are met. Discretionary powers are available to staff to award a supplement for rental purposes in exceptional cases where it appears that the circumstances of the case so warrant. A notice reminding staff of their statutory discretionary power to award a supplement for rental purposes in exceptional cases, for example, when dealing with applicants who are at risk of losing their tenancy was circulated in July 2014. <br/><br/>In view of the current supply difficulties, the Department has agreed a protocol with the Dublin local authorities and voluntary organisations so that families on rent supplement who are at risk of losing their accommodation can have more timely and appropriate interventions made on their behalf. Since the launch of this initiative in mid-June 2014, over 120 families have had their rent supplement claims revised by the Department. <br/><br/>The Department&rsquo;s strategic policy direction is to transfer responsibility for recipients of rent supplement with a long-term housing need to local authorities under the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP). Officials are working closely with those in the lead Department of Environment, Community and Local Government, in introducing HAP on a phased basis, in the selected local authorities.<br/><br/>The number of recipients on the rent supplement scheme increased from 59,700 in 2007 to a maximum of 97,000 in 2010 and has since decreased to the current figure of approximately 73,500. This reduction is attributable to a number of factors including the rate of unemployment, transfer of recipients to social housing, changes in rent levels and increases to the minimum contribution payable by rent supplement tenants.  <br/><br/>Rent supplement recipients by county from 2010 to date are provided in the attached tabular statement. A demographic breakdown of these figures is not available. <br/><br/><b>Rent Supplement:  Recipient Numbers by County 2010 to present.</b><table><tr><th>2010</th><th>2011</th><th>County</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th><th>End Sept. 2014</th></tr><tr><td>33,818</td><td>34,423</td><td>Dublin</td><td>32,584</td><td>29,541</td><td>27,352</td></tr><tr><td>10,988</td><td>10,732</td><td>Cork</td><td>9,878</td><td>9,020</td><td>8,464</td></tr><tr><td>4,409</td><td>4,447</td><td>Kildare</td><td>4,338</td><td>4,135</td><td>3,811</td></tr><tr><td>4,829</td><td>4,615</td><td>Galway</td><td>4,134</td><td>3,983</td><td>3,631</td></tr><tr><td>4,055</td><td>4,102</td><td>Wexford</td><td>3,700</td><td>3,179</td><td>2,726</td></tr><tr><td>3,896</td><td>3,833</td><td>Limerick</td><td>3,323</td><td>2,984</td><td>2,669</td></tr><tr><td>2,563</td><td>2,734</td><td>Louth</td><td>2,549</td><td>2,422</td><td>2,274</td></tr><tr><td>2,613</td><td>2,719</td><td>Wicklow</td><td>2,495</td><td>2,381</td><td>2,183</td></tr><tr><td>2,680</td><td>2,609</td><td>Tipperary</td><td>2,199</td><td>2,094</td><td>1,960</td></tr><tr><td>3,194</td><td>2,977</td><td>Donegal</td><td>2,411</td><td>2,047</td><td>1,871</td></tr><tr><td>2,552</td><td>2,723</td><td>Meath</td><td>2,143</td><td>1,941</td><td>1,777</td></tr><tr><td>2,339</td><td>2,278</td><td>Kerry</td><td>2,037</td><td>1,888</td><td>1,753</td></tr><tr><td>3,012</td><td>2,928</td><td>Mayo</td><td>2,435</td><td>1,900</td><td>1,664</td></tr><tr><td>1,623</td><td>1,671</td><td>Westmeath</td><td>1,592</td><td>1,588</td><td>1,540</td></tr><tr><td>2,332</td><td>2,098</td><td>Waterford</td><td>1,773</td><td>1,556</td><td>1,394</td></tr><tr><td>1,937</td><td>1,961</td><td>Clare</td><td>1,722</td><td>1,547</td><td>1,380</td></tr><tr><td>1,577</td><td>1,619</td><td>Kilkenny</td><td>1,365</td><td>1,210</td><td>1,140</td></tr><tr><td>1,484</td><td>1,440</td><td>Carlow</td><td>1,239</td><td>1,108</td><td>1,072</td></tr><tr><td>1,273</td><td>1,349</td><td>Offaly</td><td>1,240</td><td>1,124</td><td>1,064</td></tr><tr><td>1,151</td><td>1,178</td><td>Laois</td><td>1,097</td><td>1,085</td><td>1,020</td></tr><tr><td>1,276</td><td>1,275</td><td>Roscommon</td><td>997</td><td>802</td><td>682</td></tr><tr><td>715</td><td>623</td><td>Longford</td><td>511</td><td>507</td><td>479</td></tr><tr><td>787</td><td>698</td><td>Sligo</td><td>591</td><td>542</td><td>463</td></tr><tr><td>1,029</td><td>843</td><td>Cavan</td><td>519</td><td>455</td><td>417</td></tr><tr><td>598</td><td>488</td><td>Monaghan</td><td>438</td><td>395</td><td>365</td></tr><tr><td>530</td><td>440</td><td>Leitrim</td><td>374</td><td>354</td><td>335</td></tr><tr><td>97,260</td><td>96,803</td><td>Total</td><td>87,684</td><td>79,788</td><td>73,486</td></tr></table></p></reply>

They must comply with the various Central Bank Codes including the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears. </p><p>  Where the purchaser of a loan book has not been a regulated entity in Ireland, those companies have committed to voluntarily apply the codes when managing the loan books. Of course, voluntary compliance is not enforceable and ultimately it is the aim of this Government to ensure the same protections are available for all consumers whose loans have been sold.</p><p>  Therefore, as Minister for Finance, I am committed to bringing forward legislation that protects consumers whose mortgages are sold to unregulated entities. The Government has reiterated this commitment on several occasions. In July and August of this year, my Department ran a public consultation seeking views on its proposed legislation to protect consumers whose loans are sold to unregulated entities.  </p><p>  The Department of Finance received 18 submissions from a range of respondents from the financial services industry, consumer groups, public representatives and individuals and other stakeholders. Officials in my Department are carefully considering the submissions and it is anticipated that legislation will be published by the end of this year.</p></reply>

Mayo.  In general, such reports are followed up as a matter of course and samples sent to the State Laboratory for analysis where officers have reason to suspect Excise Duty fraud. </p><p>  The recent reports of suspected petrol &quot;stretching&quot; are being investigated by the Revenue Commissioners who have been in contact with the Oil and Motor trade in this regard.  </p><p>  Any illegal activity, such as petrol stretching, would be a matter of serious concern because of the risks to the Exchequer, the threat to legitimate businesses and the damage that can be caused to the vehicles of unsuspecting purchasers of adulterated fuel.  Section 102(1A) of the Finance Act 1999 makes it an offence to sell, deliver or use oil on which Mineral Oil Tax at the appropriate rate has not been paid.  In the normal course of work, Revenue's enforcement staff take samples of fuel from mineral oil suppliers, including filling stations, to ensure compliance with mineral oil regulations. These samples are sent to the State Laboratory for scientific analysis. I am advised that the scientific analysis process is time consuming and that reports from the State Laboratory in respect of these samples are still awaited by Revenue.  If the results of the analysis reveals the presence of any illegal stretching agents, I can assure the Deputy that the Revenue Commissioners will take action and pursue prosecutions against offenders where possible.</p><p>  Revenue and the oil sector have cooperated very successfully to tackle diesel laundering and I am confident that with this cooperation, and with the supply chain information available to Revenue,  the problem of petrol stretching can also be tackled successfully. In this regard it is essential that petrol distributors report on any reduction in the pattern of legitimate supplies of fuel to the retail trade which may indicate that specific retailers are shifting some of their sourcing to laundered or 'stretched' fuel.  </p><p>   Motorists themselves should take care about where they source their petrol from, and report any suspicions concerning the source of adulterated petrol that may have damaged their engines to Revenue. Revenue will investigate such reports and pursue prosecutions against offenders where possible. In that regard, Revenue has recently launched a dedicated section of its website specifically on the shadow economy and this includes an electronic reporting facility for anyone who has information about shadow economy practices such as petrol stretching.</p></reply>

Taken in conjunction with first quarter data, GDP grew by 5.8 per cent in the first half of this year. The increase in economic activity was broadly-based with both domestic sectors and exporting sectors performing strongly.</p><p>  Exports rose by 13% in the year to the second quarter of 2014.  This was the fastest rate of expansion since 2001 and there is growing evidence that the impact of the patent expiry issue in the pharmaceutical sector has passed.</p><p>  Consumer spending on goods has been strong in the first eight months of this year.  Retail sales in the period January to August were up 7% when compared with the same period in 2013.  Core sales (excluding motor trades) were up 3.5% over the same period.  Investment is also growing, with both building and construction and machinery and equipment activity rising.  Recovery in the construction sector continued in August with the Purchasing Managers' Index for the sector recording a 13th successive month of expansion.</p><p>  Recovery is also evident in the labour market with employment increasing in each of the last seven quarters representing an increase of over 70,000 since the low point in mid-2012.  In line with this, the standardised unemployment rate stood at 11.1 per cent at the end of September, having fallen from a peak of 15.1 per cent in early 2012.  Ireland's competitiveness has significantly improved in recent years.  Low consumer price inflation over the last five years has meant that Irish price levels have fallen considerably relative to the euro area.  For instance, annual HICP inflation in Ireland has been below that of the euro area average for every year since 2008.  This trend continued into the early part of this year, with inflation over the first six months of the year coming in below the comparable rate in the euro area.</p><p>  The Government remains focused on maintaining the reform momentum to achieve the goals of creating more jobs, enhancing living standards and, ultimately, achieving full employment.  As set out in its Statement of Government Priorities 2014-2016, the Government is prioritising the actions needed to build on the economic recovery that is already under way to ensure that the benefits of the recovery are felt by everyone across the country.</p></reply>

The objective is now to boost the pace of economic growth and to increase the rate of inflation, which is currently excessively low.</p><p>  There are a number of dimensions to this.  Firstly, the European Central Bank has adopted a loose monetary policy stance, designed to raise economic activity and reduce fragmentation across euro area financial markets.</p><p>  On the fiscal side, the pace of consolidation is slowing, in aggregate terms, across the euro area, and this is appropriate. In addition, a greater focus is needed on the implementation of structural reforms to foster growth and job creation in the euro area.</p><p>  Finally, a number of initiatives are being examined to boost the level of investment in the EU including the use of EIB capital, how to better use public funding as well as a &euro;300 billion investment package proposed by European Commission President-elect Jean-Claude Juncker. These issues will be dicussed at the upcoming European Council meeting in October.</p></reply>

The Deputy should be aware that my Department is party to a range of actions as part of the Strategy. The Strategy addresses among other issues: housing supply, with a particular focus on planning issues and appropriate and sustainable development financing; transparent and sustainable mortgage lending; the application of the tax code to the construction and property sectors; as well as addressing legacy issues associated with the property bubble. All of these actions are detailed in the Construction 2020 Strategy publication.</p><p>  As regards the Deputy's reference to a bond, all monies raised through Government borrowing are paid into the Central Fund and used to fund Government spending as approved by the Oireachtas.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-10-02a.215.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014100200039#WRJ01100"><p>There have been a number of improvements to the terms our EU-IMF Programme loans since they were initially agreed in late 2010. These changes have included reductions of the interest rates and, in the case of the EU facilities, extension of maturities. We have also negotiated the replacement of the Promissory Notes issued to the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation (IBRC) with a series of longer term, non-amortising floating rate Government bonds. In addition, I am proposing to make an early repayment of a portion of Ireland's IMF programme loan. </p><p>  When the programme was initially agreed in late 2010, the average interest rate on the &euro;67.5 billion available to drawdown from the external sources was estimated by the EU Commission to be 5.82% on the basis of market rates at that time. The average life of the borrowing was initially set at 7.5 years. </p><p>  In July 2011, the Euro Area Heads of State or Government (HOSG) agreed to reduce the cost of the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) loans, and similar reductions were subsequently agreed for the interest rates on the loans provided by the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM) and also by the three bilateral lenders (UK, Sweden and Denmark).  It is estimated that the interest rate reductions on the EU funding mechanisms and the bilateral loans are worth of the order of &euro;9 billion over the initially envisaged 7 &frac12; year term of these loans.  As of July 2014 the all in euro equivalent cost of our EU-IMF programme loans was estimated at 3.4%.</p><p>  Also in 2011, the average maturity of the EFSM and the EFSF loans was extended to 12.5 and 15 years respectively.  </p><p>  In April 2013, EU Finance Ministers agreed in principle to further extend the maximum weighted average maturities on our EFSF and EFSM loans by up to 7 years, over and above the extension agreed in 2011. This further maturity extension removes a refinancing requirement of some &euro;20 billion for the Irish State in the years 2015 to 2022.   This extension of maturities has a number of significant benefits for Ireland, including smoothing our redemption profile, improving long term debt sustainability and it also has a positive impact on the cost of Exchequer borrowing through creating further downward pressure on our borrowing costs.  </p><p>  In February 2013, the Irish Government replaced the Promissory Notes issued to IBRC with a series of longer term, non-amortising floating rate Government bonds. This has resulted in significant benefits to the State, including increasing the weighted average life from c.7-8 years for the Promissory Notes to c.34-35 years for the floating rate notes.</p><p>  Finally, as you will be aware, I am proposing to make an early repayment of a portion of Ireland's IMF programme loan. Specifically the proposal is to make an early repayment of up to &euro;18.3 billion of our &euro;22.5 billion IMF loan, which is the portion subject to the highest rate of charge, and to replace it with less expensive market funding subject to prevailing market conditions.</p><p>  For this to succeed,  a waiver of the mandatory proportional early repayment clauses which are included in each of our loan agreements with the EFSF and the EFSM, and with our bilateral lenders, the U.K., Denmark and Sweden is required.</p><p>  There was broad political support among Ministers when the issue was discussed at the Eurogroup and ECOFIN meetings last month. However, this support is subject to necessary national approval procedures including parliamentary approval in some Member States. </p><p>  Estimates provided by the NTMA show that in a situation where the recent reduction in market yields is maintained it would be possible to achieve cash savings of the order of &euro;1.5 billion. The actual savings that are generated from early repayment will depend on a number of factors such as the size of any repayments, general market conditions and the cost of the replacement market funding.</p></reply>

As statutory regulator of credit institutions, the Central Bank has the power, from both a prudential and consumer protection perspective, to require banks to meaningfully and sustainably address mortgage arrears cases on their books. All borrowers whose loans have been purchased by regulated entities, and were previously protected under the consumer codes, remain so protected. As the Deputy is aware, the Central Bank publishes statistics in relation to residential mortgage arrears and repossessions on a quarterly basis.</p><p>  Where the purchaser of a loan book is not a regulated entity in Ireland, those companies have committed to voluntarily apply the codes when managing the loan books. Of course, voluntary compliance is not enforceable and ultimately it is the aim of this Government to ensure the same protections for all consumers whose loans have been sold.</p><p>  Therefore, as Minister for Finance, I am committed to bringing forward legislation that protects consumers whose mortgages are sold to unregulated entities. The Government has reiterated this commitment on several occasions. In July and August of this year, my Department ran a public consultation seeking views on its proposed legislation to protect consumers whose loans are sold to unregulated entities.  </p><p>  The Department of Finance received 18 submissions from a range of respondents from the financial services industry, consumer groups, public representatives and individuals and other stakeholders. Officials in my Department are carefully considering the submissions and it is anticipated that legislation will be published by the end of this year. </p></reply>

To facilitate this, Government policy is focused on ensuring that all viable SMEs have access to an appropriate supply of credit from a diverse range of bank and non-bank sources. My Department has been involved in a range of initiatives to encourage access to credit for small business, and the establishment of the SME State Bodies Group has also provided a forum where this issue is discussed and policy options explored on a regular basis.<br/><br/>The following is an overview of the main policies introduced by this Government to encourage access to credit for small business:<br/><br/>- With over &euro;2bn of Government supports available to small business in Ireland from over twenty Departments and Agencies, it is vital that SMEs can quickly access information on this range of supports available to them. With this in mind, the Supporting SMEs Online Tool, a cross-government initiative, was launched in May 2014. On answering 8 simple questions, the small business will receive a list of available Government supports. In the  four months since its launch, this website has had over 17,000 unique visits. The Supporting SMEs Online Tool is available at .<br/><br/>- The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) has been established by the Government as a means of ensuring that SMEs in Ireland are provided with sufficient finance for growth. As the Deputy will be aware, the legislation enabling the establishment of the SBCI was passed by the Oireachtas prior to the Summer recess and the SBCI was incorporated as a company in September. The company is already operational with the immediate priorities being the finalisation of the funding arrangements for the company and establishing mechanisms to enable credit to flow quickly to the small business sector.  This work is well advanced. Loan agreements with the international funders, KfW and the European Investment Bank, will be signed in the coming weeks. Following that, the SBCI will agree lending terms with traditional bank lenders and new credit providers from beyond the traditional bank sector allowing for the distribution of SBCI funding to the SME sector in Ireland on a prudent basis.  I anticipate that the first SBCI funded loans to SMEs should be available for disbursement before the end of this year. <br/><br/>- Another important initiative stemming from the work of the SME State Bodies Group is the &quot;Finance4Growth&quot; programme offered by Managementworks. This provides participants with access to an SME finance expert who will explain the different sources of finance available, guide them as to which would be most relevant to their business, and advise on how banks, investors and agencies make their decisions. This mentoring is free, and there is also an option to avail of a one-day finance workshop and a further two hours of mentoring for a small fee. It is important that businesses seeking finance are equipped with as much expertise as possible to ensure that they can provide lending institutions with strong evidence that they have strong repayment capacity and this programme provides them with exactly that.<br/><br/>- The Credit Guarantee Scheme encourages additional lending to small businesses by offering a partial Government guarantee to banks against losses on qualifying loans to eligible SMEs. My colleague the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation will shortly bring legislation to the Oireachtas which should broaden the scope of the scheme to encourage higher utilisation.<br/><br/>- The Microenterprise Loan Fund, administered by Microfinance Ireland, provides loans of up to &euro;25,000 to small businesses who have been refused credit by commercial banks. Microfinance Ireland works in partnership with the Local Enterprise Offices  nationally to administer this fund. <br/><br/>The Government remains committed to the SME sector and sees it as the key engine of ongoing economic growth.  Consequently the Department of Finance, working with the other relevant Departments and Agencies, will continue to monitor the availability of both bank and non-bank credit with a view to taking appropriate actions as warranted to ensure that SMEs in Ireland have the opportunity to reach their full potential in terms of growth and employment generation.</p></reply>

My Department and the Central Bank will in due course be reviewing the overall circumstances relating to Setanta and will report to me on what lessons can be learned and how the framework can be strengthened.<br/><br/>With regard to the position of Setanta claimants, you will appreciate that a liquidation of an insurance company is a legally complex and time consuming process.  In general terms, under the Statute of Limitations, claimants are given two years following an accident to make an initial claim.  However, it could take several years for a particular case to be finalised.<font color="#2F2F2F">  Setanta is a Maltese incorporated company and, therefore, the Setanta liquidation is being carried out under Maltese law. </font>The Setanta Liquidator is currently examining a range of factors in order to estimate the cost of claims and the extent to which claims can be met in the Setanta liquidation.  The Liquidator has advised that settlements can only be paid out after all of the company's liabilities are quantified, including claims.<br/><br/>The Insurance Compensation Fund (ICF) provides for payments to meet the liabilities of insolvent insurers in certain cases where it is unlikely that claims can be met otherwise than from the ICF.  Under the Insurance Act 1964 claims by bodies corporate or unincorporated bodies are not covered by the ICF, except where there is a liability to or by an individual.  In addition, all ICF payments are subject to a limit of 65% of the amount due or &euro;825,000, whichever is the lesser.  Management and administration of the ICF is under the control of the President of the High Court acting through the Office of the Accountant of the Courts of Justice.  The Accountant <font color="#2F2F2F">of the Courts of Justice </font>is currently engaging with both the Setanta Liquidator and his legal advisors to put in place an appropriate mechanism to commence making applications to the High Court in accordance with the Insurance Act 1964.  I understand that at the moment the Accountant is not in a position to put a timeline on when the first applications will be made.  Procedures for processing claims and the timing of payments, including the question of advance payments from the ICF, is a matter for the President of the High Court.  I have asked that this information on procedures is made available publicly as soon as possible.  While this process is still ongoing, the Setanta Liquidator has advised that policyholders and brokers should send correspondence in relation to individual claims or other claims matters as soon as is possible to Setanta Insurance Company Limited (in liquidation) at:<br/><br/>Deloitte &amp;amp; Touche<br/><br/>Earlsfort Terrace<br/><br/>Dublin 2<br/><br/>Tel: 0818 255 255<br/><br/>Email: </p></reply>

A detailed assessment is being carried out under the Shannon Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Study.  The Office of Public Works is currently undertaking this in partnership with the relevant local authorities including Kerry County Council.  Draft flood maps have been produced for Moneycashen and were subject to a public consultation day that was held in Ballyduff on 24th September 2014.  Feedback from that event and a forthcoming national consultation process will be taken account of before the flood maps are finalised.  Subsequent phases of the Shannon CFRAM Study will involve an options assessment process followed by the preparation of Flood Risk Management Plans.  Further information and updates on the Shannon CFRAM Study are available on .<br/><br/>The Office of Public Works has recently completed the refurbishment of 2,000m of flood defences on the River Cashen at Derryco and other works are ongoing in the area.  OPW has also recently extended flood defences at Rahoonagh on the Cashen for a length of 500m to provide protection to a number of houses in the area.<br/><br/>OPW has also carried out an examination of the feasibility of dredging the River Feale/Cashen estuary.  This examination has concluded that while this dredging would provide some relief to the flooding problem in the area, it is likely to cost several million euro, and that there is little likelihood of funding for this being available in the foreseeable future.  Further, because this area is a Special Area of Conservation and a Natural Heritage Area of European importance, significant constraints will apply to any work.  In the short to medium term, the OPW will consider the installation of localised pumping facilities as funds and resources allow, in the polders worst affected by flooding.</p></reply>

Recent statistics published by the Central Statistics Office show that consumer prices on average were 0.4% higher in August 2014 when compared with prices prevailing in August 2013. The latest EU Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), which is accepted as the most appropriate measure for community wide comparisons (and is also published by the Central Statistics Office), show that price index levels increased in Ireland by 0.36% in the 12 month period between August 2013 and July 2014. Price index levels increased across the EU by 0.44% for the same period while in the UK, the Index shows that price index levels rose by 1.5% in the period between August 2013 and June 2014 (the latest UK figures at the time of publication).</p><p>  The Government is fully committed to pursuing the competitiveness agenda, including in the area of prices so as to ensure that Irish consumers receive and can expect to receive a fair deal in the goods and services that they buy. Changes in patterns of consumer behaviour in recent years have also prompted grocery retailers to respond by offering keener prices, better value and more competition in terms of the options open to consumers when they purchase grocery goods.</p></reply>

Therefore the 2014 figures for the former CEBs in these Counties have been amalgamated, as have the figures for the CEBs in Cork North and Cork West, which now operate as a single LEO.<br/><br/>As in 2013 the expectation for 2014 is that the budget allocation available to the LEOs will be fully drawn down by year end.<table><tr><th>County</th><th>TOTAL 2013</th><th>TOTAL (June 2014)</th></tr><tr><td></td><td>&euro;</td><td>&euro;</td></tr><tr><td>Carlow</td><td>398,283</td><td>246,108</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan</td><td>576,402</td><td>253,263</td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>367,488</td><td>289,978</td></tr><tr><td>Cork City</td><td>511,530</td><td>185,235</td></tr><tr><td>Cork North West</td><td>875,333</td><td>262,517</td></tr><tr><td>Cork South</td><td>1,135,247</td><td>303,922</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>772,564</td><td>45,142</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin City</td><td>1,136,326</td><td>354,195</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin South</td><td>753,468</td><td>183,409</td></tr><tr><td>Dun Laoghaire/ Rathdown</td><td>815,919</td><td>261,458</td></tr><tr><td>Fingal</td><td>860,168</td><td>247,804</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>789,130</td><td>42,412</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>501,033</td><td>151,808</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>538,470</td><td>178,437</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td>425,013</td><td>161,472</td></tr><tr><td>Laois</td><td>363,181</td><td>153,180</td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim</td><td>310,773</td><td>137,271</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>982,316</td><td>114,387</td></tr><tr><td>Longford</td><td>369,373</td><td>124,012</td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td>418,606</td><td>239,332</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td>398,963</td><td>165,443</td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td>665,949</td><td>100,350</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan</td><td>407,573</td><td>97,080</td></tr><tr><td>Offaly</td><td>392,299</td><td>266,362</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon</td><td>366,498</td><td>7,600</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td>439,668</td><td>414,333</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary North</td><td>900,655</td><td>305,658</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>1,009,972</td><td>614,371</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath</td><td>626,934</td><td>96,519</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>749,145</td><td>242,509</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>660,273</td><td>239,791</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>19,518,550</td><td>6,485,357</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The newly recruited staff will be on contracts for a period of 3 years, to cover the lifetime of the programme.  As with all job advertisements in IDA Ireland, there was a very strong response from the public.  The intense process of screening and selecting the applicants with the visa requirements and the particular skills and competencies to represent Ireland in the overseas marketplace commenced thereafter. Roles are based in locations including Boston, New York, Chicago, Atlanta, Austin, Mountain View, Irvine, London, Frankfurt, Paris, Tokyo, Shanghai, Sydney and Dublin.  Funding for this initiative is provided through IDA Ireland&rsquo;s budget allocation from the exchequer.</p><p>  IDA Ireland recruited a Programme Manager to manage the process and since then 16 competitions have been completed with 6 staff recruited to date for global locations. By early November there will be 16 people recruited.

The Civil Defence Board was identified in the Public Service Reform Plan as a body to be abolished.  The then Minister for Defence appointed a 14 person interim Board as a temporary measure in 2011 and in this context none of the positions were advertised.  Legislation to dissolve the Board was passed by the Oireachtas in December 2012. Its functions have now transferred back to the Department of Defence.</p><p>  There were no appointments to the Board of Coiste an Asgard from 2009.  In the context of settling the Estimates for the Department of Defence for 2010, the Government decided that the national sail training scheme operated by Coiste an Asgard would be discontinued as recommended in the Report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure.</p><p>  The formal wind up of the Company including voluntary strike off with the Companies Registration Office was completed in early 2013.</p><p>  The only body currently under the aegis of the Department of Defence is the Army Pensions Board. The Army Pensions Board is an independent statutory body established under the Army Pensions Act, 1927.  The Act specifies that the Board shall consist of a chairman and two ordinary members.  The two ordinary members must be qualified medical practitioners of whom one must be an officer of the Army Medical Corps.  The chairman and the non military ordinary member are appointed by the Minister for Defence with the concurrence of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  The Army Medical Corps ordinary member is appointed by the Minister for Defence on the recommendation of the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces.</p><p>  There have been two appointments to the Army Pensions Board since March 2011.  A serving officer was appointed to the position of Army Medical Corps member of the Board in December 2011, and a civilian doctor was appointed as ordinary member in November 2013.</p><p>  The position of Army Medical Corps ordinary member became vacant due to retirement in 2011.  The then Minister for Defence appointed Commandant Adam Lagun to the Board on the recommendation of the Chief of Staff.  As the Army Pensions Act, 1927 specifies that one of the ordinary members must be an officer of the Army Medical Corps, this position was not publicly advertised.  Details of Commandant Lagun&rsquo;s appointment to the Army Pensions Board were published in the Iris Oifigi&uacute;l on 13 January 2012.</p><p>  The civilian doctor vacancy was advertised on the Department of Defence website and the Public Appointments Service website.  A number of expressions of interest in the position were received and Dr. Loretta Nolan was appointed to the Board on foot of this public advertisement process.  Details of Dr. Nolan&rsquo;s appointment to the Army Pensions Board were published in the Iris Oifigi&uacute;l on 10 December 2013.</p></reply>

The applicant will be notified directly of any developments in his case as they arise.</p><p>  The Transfer of Sentenced Persons Acts, 1995 and 1997 provide a mechanism whereby non-nationals serving  sentences in Ireland may apply to serve the remainder of their sentences in their own countries and, similarly, Irish persons who are imprisoned overseas may apply to serve the remainder of their sentences in Ireland.  Such transfers may be facilitated where the other country has ratified the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons.  Transfer requests under the Convention are normally made by a prisoner through the governor of the prison in which he or she is detained.  I decide on all such requests following the collation of a number of reports from various agencies setting out the consequences of such a transfer.  The consent of the three parties in the process is required prior to any transfer, i.e. the sentencing state, the receiving state and the sentenced person.</p><p>  However, the Deputy should be aware that the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons does not confer an automatic right on any prisoner to be transferred nor does it confer an obligation on any state to comply with a transfer.</p></reply>

Board vacancies are not always advertised through the PAS as many are advertised on the Department's website or the websites of the organisations concerned.  In addition, as the Deputy will be aware, there are many constraining factors which impact on the filling of vacancies to State Boards.  I refer primarily to appointments where legislation requires that a vacancy must be filled by candidates holding certain qualifications or must be nominated by certain prescribed bodies thereby requiring no public advertisement of the vacancy.  I am advised that in order to provide the information sought by the Deputy it would be necessary to disaggregate every appointments made since 2011 and that the resources are not available to undertake this task.  However, to the extent possible I have provided below a narrative account of the vacancies filled since 2011 and the manner in which they were filled.<br/><br/>The Deputy may wish to note that the term 'State Boards' is somewhat imprecise as it includes bodies with a wide and diverse range of functions many of which would not fall into the more commonly understood definition of Board which is a body with a governance oversight of an organisation.  To be of assistance to the Deputy I have interpreted his question as embracing all bodies called Boards, irrespective of their functions, as well as other bodies with a governance remit whose title does not include the term &ldquo;Board&rdquo;.<br/><br/><b><i>Charities Regulatory Authority Board </i></b><b>- </b>Expressions of interest for appointment to the Board of the Charities Regulatory Authority were sought through the Public Appointments Service.  Sixteen appointments were subsequently made to the Board of the Authority; thirteen of those appointed applied through the Public Appointments Service.<br/><br/><b><i>Children Detention Schools Board of Management </i></b>- One appointment was made to the Children Detention Schools Board of Management.  The position was not advertised as the appointment was made under Section 167(4)(a) of the Children Act 2001 as amended, which requires at least one officer of the Minister.  The person appointed was a civil servant.  The Deputy should note that responsibility for the Children Detention Schools Board of Management moved to the Department for Children and Youth Affairs on 1 January 2012.<br/><br/><b><i>Classification of Films Appeal Board </i></b><b>-</b>There are currently nine vacancies on the Classification of Films Appeal Board.  Following an invitation to the public to submit expressions of interest, a total of forty-four applications were received.  I expect to make appointments to these positions in the near future.<br/><br/><b><i>Courts Service Board </i></b>- The Courts Service Board has seventeen members, it is chaired by the Chief Justice and includes eight other judges, the CEO of the Courts Service, persons nominated by the Law Society, Bar Council and ICTU, an elected staff representative and three persons nominated by the Minister for Justice.  There have been 20 appointments, three of which were individuals nominated by my predecessor Mr. Alan Shatter, T.D. including a civil servant from my Department.<br/><br/><b><i>Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Arbitration Board </i></b><b>-</b>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Arbitration Board is appointed by the Government and consists of a Chairperson, a member nominated by the representatives associations and a member nominated by the Government.  The Chairperson is appointed on the nomination of the Ministers for Justice &amp;amp; Equality and Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform in agreement with the representative associations.  Four appointments were made to the board.<br/><br/><b><i>Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Complaints Board </i></b><b>-</b>Nine appointments were made to board on 10 April 2012.  These positions were not advertised.  Eight of the outgoing members were re-appointed as the Board, which has been replaced by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, only had a few outstanding cases on hands at that time.  The outstanding cases have now been finalised and the necessary steps to close the Board are now being put in place.  The 9th appointee is a civil servant.<br/><br/><b><i>Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission </i></b><b>-</b>The Commission consists of three members, a Chairman and two members.  These positions were advertised through the Public Appointments Service following which 40 applications were received.  Three candidates were selected by my predecessor Mr. Alan Shatter, T.D. and approved by Government as having the appropriate experience, qualifications, training and expertise for the relevant roles.<br/><br/><b><i>Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission </i></b><b>-</b>On 8 September 2011, the Government decided to merge the Human Rights Commission and the Equality Authority to establish a new Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC) to promote human rights and equality issues in a more efficient, effective and coherent way.  The 14 outgoing members of the Equality Authority accepted reappointment in September 2011 for a further term which concluded at the end of July 2012.<br/><br/>In the case of the Human Rights Commission three Commissioners were appointed by a Government Decision on the 20 December 2011 and their term expired on 31 May 2012.  In November 2012, advertisements inviting expressions of interest for the position of Chief Commissioner and of &quot;ordinary&quot; members appeared in the media.  The fourteen Members Designate of the new Commission were selected in April 2013 in a process independent of Government and appointed initially to the Equality Authority and the Human Rights Commission on an interim basis so that the two organisations could begin to operate as a cohesive whole.  Following this experience, it was decided that the Public Appointments Service (PAS) should be responsible henceforth for selection of Commissioners, including Chief Commissioner post.<br/><br/>  The Government appointed the fourteen individuals as Members Designate of the Human Rights Commission in advance of the enactment and commencement of the required legislation.  On 31 May 2013 the then Minister for Justice and Equality Mr Alan Shatter T.D. appointed twelve of their number to the Board of the Equality Authority, under the Employment Equality Act 1998, as amended.<br/><br/>  Emily Logan was recently nominated by the PAS as Chief Commissioner of the IHREC and at a Government meeting of the 23 July 2014 Ms Logan was appointed on an interim basis as President of the Human Rights Commission pursuant to section 5 of the Human Rights Commission Act 2000.  She was also appointed as Chair of the Equality Authority pursuant to section 41 and 42 of the Employment Equality Act 1998.<br/><br/>  The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014 passed both Houses of the Oireachtas and was signed by the President on the 27 July 2014.  It is expected that Ms. Logan's formal appointment and the formal appointment of the other fourteen members designate of the new IHREC will then be made by the President following the passing of motions in both Houses of the Oireachtas.<br/><br/><b><i>Judicial Appointments Advisory Board </i></b><b>- </b>Eleven appointments were made to the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board.  The Board consists of ten members, it is chaired by the Chief Justice and includes three other judges, the Attorney General, persons nominated by the Law Society and Bar Council and three persons nominated by the Minister for Justice and Equality.  Five of the appointments were individuals nominated by myself or my predecessor Deputy Shatter.<br/><br/><b><i>Legal Aid Board </i></b><b>- </b>Fifteen appointments were made to this Board, nine of which were civil or public servants.<br/><br/><b><i>Mental Health (Criminal Law) Review Board </i></b><b>- </b>Five appointments were made to the Mental Health (Criminal Law) Review Board.<br/><br/><b><i>National Disability Authority (NDA) </i></b><b>- </b>Fourteen appointments were made to the National Disability Authority (NDA).  Appointments to the Board were made from nominations of relevant Ministers, as prescribed in the National Disability Authority Act 1999 (the Act), an elected member of the staff of the NDA (also a requirement of the Act) and respondents to publicly advertised calls for expressions of interest (in line with Government Decision S180/20/10/1424 of April 2011).  The Act also stipulates that in making appointments &quot;<i>the Minister shall have regard to the objective that a majority of the Authority would be persons with disabilities, their representatives, families or carers, and, in the case of each member of the Authority, that he or she would have knowledge or experience, either directly or indirectly, of matters pertaining to disability or of any other subject which in the opinion of the Minister would be of assistance to the Authority in the performance of its functions&quot; .</i>The Act also makes reference to the objective that not less than 5 women and 5 men be appointed to the Board; and to the desirability that its members would include persons from both rural and urban areas.<br/><br/><b><i>Parole Board </i></b><b>-</b>Eleven appointments were made to the Parole Board.  Individuals are appointed by the Minister on foot of their experience and expertise which is invaluable to the work of the Board.<br/><br/><b><i>Private Security Appeal Board</i></b><b>-</b>The Government appointed four people on 3 April 2012.  The proposed Chairperson appeared before the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence.  The Board may consist of as many members as are necessary for the expeditious discharge of its functions.

In recent years the maximum penalty for possessing a knife in a public place without good reason or lawful authority has been increased from one to five years, and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also now have an extended power of search without warrant in relation to knives and offensive weapons.  <br/><br/>At an operational level,  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na proactively target public disorder and anti-social behaviour, including knife related crime through the strategic deployment of Garda resources.  In this regard, areas identified as public order hot-spots by local Garda management are the subject of additional foot and mobile patrols.  In addition, Detective Units and Divisional Crime Task Forces may be utilised to provide a high visibility presence in areas such as late night bars, clubs etc, particularly when people are exiting, to deter and detect anti-social behaviour and possible altercations.  However, it should be noted that many knife crimes occur in domestic settings and often with a degree of spontaneity, which increases the challenges for preventative policing and enforcement.  <b><font color="#000080"> </font></b><br/><br/>In relation to the investigation of specific knife-related crimes, I am assured that all appropriate resources, including any necessary technical and forensic facilities, are employed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to secure detections and identify perpetrators of these crimes.<br/><br/>In addition to these enforcement measures, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is involved in a number of awareness measures relating to knife crime, and I understand that the Garda Schools Programme is utilised to include talks on knives and other weapons for secondary school pupils, emphasising the dangers involved and the need for care, vigilance and social responsibility.  <b><font color="#000080"></font></b></p></reply>

These complaints, details of the numbers of which are shown in the table below, have been received by the Garda Divisions in Claremorris and Ballina.<br/><br/>I am further informed that these complaints are currently under investigation and that no individuals have been charged nor files forwarded to the Director of Public Prosecutions to date.  An Garda Sioch&aacute;na are continuing to investigate these complaints and are liaising with the injured parties.  Contact has also been made with Revenue's Customs Service who take the enforcement lead nationally in relation to this issue and who have arranged to have fuel samples from these cases analysed for contaminants.<br/><br/>In terms of the overall national position, I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they have received a number of reports of problems relating to petrol quality from around the country in recent weeks and that such reports are followed up as a matter of course and samples sent to the State Laboratory for analysis where officers have reason to suspect excise duty fraud. <br/><br/>Petrol stretching is a matter of serious concern because of the risks to the Exchequer, the threat to legitimate businesses and the damage that can be caused to the vehicles of unsuspecting purchasers of adulterated fuel.  Under Section 102 of the Finance Act 1999, it is an offence to sell and/or deliver oil on which Mineral Oil Tax at the appropriate rate has not been paid. <br/><br/>In the normal course of work, Revenue's enforcement staff take samples of fuel, which are sent to the State Laboratory for scientific analysis, from mineral oil suppliers, including filling stations, to ensure compliance with mineral oil regulations.  If the results of the analysis reveals the presence of any illegal stretching agents, I can assure the Deputy that the Revenue Commissioners will take action and pursue prosecutions against offenders where possible. <br/><br/>I am further advised that Revenue and the oil sector have co-operated very successfully to tackle diesel laundering and are confident that, with this co-operation and with the supply chain information available to Revenue, the problem of petrol stretching can also be tackled successfully.  In this regard it is essential that petrol distributors report on any reduction in the pattern of legitimate supplies of fuel to the retail trade which may indicate that specific retailers are shifting some of their sourcing to laundered or &quot;stretched&quot; fuel. <br/><br/>In addition, motorists themselves should take care with regard to their source of petrol and report any suspicions concerning adulterated fuel which may have damaged their engines to Revenue who will investigate such reports and pursue prosecutions against offenders where possible.  In that regard Revenue has recently launched a dedicated section of its website at www.revenue.ie specifically on the shadow economy and this includes an electronic reporting facility for anyone who has information about shadow economy practices such as petrol stretching.<br/><br/><b>Table 1- Complaints re suspected petrol contamination to An Garda Sioch&aacute;na Mayo's Division June - September 2014 </b><table><tr><th>Month</th><th>Claremorris District</th><th>Ballina District</th></tr><tr><td>June</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>July</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>August</td><td>10</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>September</td><td>59</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>70</td><td>16</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The Group includes representatives from my Department, the Child and Family Agency (formerly the HSE), HIQA, the Irish Youth Justice Service, the Department of Education and Skills and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. In May 2011, the Children&rsquo;s Rights Alliance were invited to join the Group in order to ensure the inclusion of the voices of children and civic society. </p><p>  The Monitoring Group has presented three progress reports to the Government to date, which have been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The fourth and final monitoring report on the implementation of the recommendations of the Ryan Report is currently being finalised by officials in my Department and it will be published in the near future. While not wishing to pre-empt either the contents of the report, or the views of the Monitoring Group, I wish to reiterate that the Government has committed to the full implementation of the recommendations contained in the Ryan Report. </p><p>  My Department will continue to monitor the delivery of actions contained in the implementation plan in the context of the ongoing monitoring of the Child and Family Agency&rsquo;s Corporate Plan and Performance Statement. Work is underway in my Department to prepare a monitoring framework for all significant child care reports which is intended to be put in place following the completion of the formal monitoring process for the Ryan Commission Implementation Plan.</p></reply>

These include the introduction of minimum qualification standards for those working directly with children in the pre-school sector.</p><p>  Amendments have been made to the Child Care Act 1991 to underpin the proposed reforms and Regulations giving effect to these legislative changes are expected to be published shortly.  The new Regulations will impose qualification requirements of a minimum Level 5 award on the National Qualifications Framework (NFQ) in early childhood care and education for all staff working in early years services (no requirement currently exists).  This requirement applies from September 2014 in the case of new services, and from September 2015 in the case of existing services.  In addition, the minimum qualification requirement for pre-school leaders delivering the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme will be increased from a Level 5 award to a Level 6, from the same dates.</p><p>  In light of the proposed timeframes for the introduction of new qualification requirements, the Department has sought to work with the childcare sector to accelerate the process for training and upskilling staff and improving the quality of care delivered to children.  Some &euro;0.9 million was provided to support a training programme in 2013 to provide support to staff who are seeking to meet the qualification requirements.  </p><p>  In March of this year, the Learner Fund was launched.  This Fund, which has an allocation of &euro;3 million over the two years 2014 and 2015 and is sufficient to support all eligible applicants, is designed to support existing childcare staff to up-skill to meet new qualification requirements.  The Learner Fund is being administered by Pobal, with the assistance of local City and County Childcare Committees.  The fund closed for applications from childcare staff at the end of April this year but it is hoped to make further funding available later this year which will provide for additional places for staff seeking training support.  </p><p>  Working with children in an early childhood care and education setting is a professional role which requires the achievement of core skills and knowledge including Child Development 0-6, Early Learning Theory and Practice and Child Health and Welfare as well as a supervised practicuum.  For the purposes of my Department's childcare programmes, it recognises certain qualifications as being equivalent to NFQ qualifications for its purposes.  However, the content must include the topics listed.  </p><p>  In relation to childcare services providing the free pre-school provision under the ECCE programme, it is currently a requirement that the pre-school leader hold a major award at level 5 or an equivalent qualification.  Completion of part of a degree programme does not meet the requirement for a major award. It is the responsibility of childcare services participating in the programme to submit to my Department documentary evidence that the pre-school leader in the service holds the required qualifications.  All applications will be evaluated and the service advised of the outcome.</p></reply>

Governance of implementation, adherence, monitoring and audit associated with the Guideline is the responsibility of the service providers.<br/><br/>Under the Health Act 2007, HIQA monitors compliance with the <i>National Standards for Safer Better Healthcare, </i>which were published in June 2012.  The National Standards are not illness or condition specific but they have been designed so that they can be implemented in all healthcare services, settings and locations. Theme 2 (Effective Care and Support) of the <i>National Standards for Safer Better Healthcare</i>states that the fundamental principle of effective care and support is that it consistently delivers the best achievable outcomes for people using a service within the context of that service, and the resources available to it. The Standards promote the use of National Clinical Guidelines and nationally agreed protocols, care bundles and care pathways where available.</p></reply>

In line with Government Decision S180/20/10/1424 of 2011, relating to the advertising for expressions of interest in vacancies on State Boards, my Department currently advertises for board vacancies as they arise, where I, as Minister for Health, have nominating rights under relevant legislation. I also appoint members on the nomination of various bodies, again in accordance with the relevant legislation.<br/><br/>There were some exceptions to the advertising process in 2012 and 2013.  In 2012, the members of the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal were appointed, on the advice of the Attorney General, as these members carry out a very specific role in relation to assessing the quantum of awards under the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal Act.  Another exception was in the case of some hospital boards, e.g. Beaumont and St James&rsquo;s, where the term of existing members was extended as a prudent provisional measure, to allow time for appropriate competencies required in members of these boards to be set out, given the Health Reform Programme and its impact on hospital configuration.  Appointments of the new board members were subsequently advertised.  <br/><br/>In 2012 existing board members of the National Paediatric Hospital Board were re-appointed for a 3 month period to allow time to consider the competencies required by board members into the future.  In January 2013 four Departmental officials and two HSE nominated officials were appointed for a number of months for the same reason.  In July 2013, the Chairperson and 3 other members for which the Minister had nominating rights were also appointed.  <br/><br/>The table below sets out the number of appointments to State Boards under the remit of the Department, where the Minister has nominating rights since March 2011 to 2014 (to date), including the number that were publicly advertised and the percentage of appointments filled from the advertising process. It should be noted that there were no advertising campaigns in 2011, but 34 appointments were made where the Minister had nominating rights.<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th><th>2014 (to date)</th></tr><tr><td>Total Number of Board Appointments </td><td>50</td><td>144</td><td>205</td><td>95</td></tr><tr><td>Appointments made where Minister has nominating rights</td><td>34</td><td>100</td><td>140</td><td>61</td></tr><tr><td>Number of Positions Advertised</td><td>N\A</td><td>98</td><td>115</td><td>61</td></tr><tr><td>% of Appointments made drawn directly from the public advertisement process</td><td>N\A</td><td>31(32)%</td><td>41(36%)</td><td>44(72%)</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The majority of GPs in Ireland are private contractors who provide services to the public health system under the General Medical Services (GMS) Scheme.  As of 30 April 2014, 2,416 GPs were contracted to provide services under the GMS Scheme. GP co-operatives also provide out-of-hours services to <i>circa</i>90% of the population.  <br/><br/>The recruitment and retention of doctors, including GPs, in the public health system is a priority for me as Minister for Health. That is why I am committed to the implementation of the recommendations of the Strategic Review of Medical Training and Career Structure completed earlier this year.<br/><br/>In July 2013, a Working Group, chaired by Professor Brian MacCraith, President of DCU, was established to carry out the Strategic Review. The Working Group was tasked with examining and making high-level recommendations relating to training and career pathways for doctors with a view to:<br/><br/>- improving graduate retention in the public health system;<br/><br/>- planning for future service needs;<br/><br/>- and realising maximum benefit from investment in medical education and training. <br/><br/>In the course of its work, the Group considered issues including:<br/><br/>- the pathway for training at every level from Intern to Specialist;<br/><br/>- mentoring practices and career planning supports for medical graduates;<br/><br/>- measures to improve the quality of the training experience;<br/><br/>- career structures for doctors on completion of training. <br/><br/>The Strategic Review reports address a range of barriers and issues relating to the recruitment and retention of doctors in the Irish public health service, including general practice, and offer solutions and recommendations that will enable us to build a sustainable medical workforce for the future.</p></reply>

The success of the outpatient initiative run by the HSE at the end of 2013 and further validation work in 2014 resulted in facilitation of 33,000 additional outpatient appointments in 2013 and an additional 55,883 outpatient appointments thus far in 2014. </p><p>  Increases in outpatient activity have had the consequence of driving up in-patient and day case waiting lists as patients are referred for appropriate treatment.  In addition, other pressures such as almost 30,000 new cancer diagnoses each year place increasing demands of the order of 3000 &ndash; 6000 additional referral requirements on the system each month.</p><p>  The role of the National Treatment Purchase Fund is working in close co-operation with the SDU to unblock access to acute services by improving the flow of patients through the service, and by streamlining waiting lists, including referrals from GPs. </p><p>  The HSE National Director of Acute Hospital Services has asked all hospitals to provide an action plan to address their waiting lists.  These individual hospital plans will be assessed and monitored by the SDU/NTPF scheduled care team. There are several potential strategies hospitals can use when planning their resources most effectively around the delivery of the national access targets for their patients. For example, improvements in chronological scheduling, consistent validation of waiting lists and active engagement with patients to reduce &lsquo;DNA&rsquo; or Did Not Attend rates are underway to address outpatient waiting lists; similar measures, as well as optimisation of theatre capacity and day of surgery admission where possible are being employed to improve management of in-patient and day case waiting lists.  The HSE, in collaboration with the SDU and all acute hospitals, is continuing to tackle waiting lists for the remainder of 2014. </p></reply>

Our policy on International Development, &ldquo;One World, One Future&rdquo;, clearly states our commitment to the UN target of providing 0.7% of Gross National Product (GNP) for Official Development Assistance (ODA), and to making further progress towards it when economic circumstances permit.  Since coming to office, this Government has managed to successfully stabilise the budget for development assistance.  This is a significant achievement, in extremely difficult budgetary and fiscal circumstances.  In 2011 we provided &euro;657 million for ODA, and between 2012 and 2013 our allocation to ODA increased slightly from &euro;629 million to &euro;637 million.  For 2014 we expect to provide in excess of &euro;600 million for ODA.</p><p>  These are substantial allocations of public funds and provide clear evidence of our support and commitment to the aid programme.  They also represent a genuine investment on behalf of the Irish people in assisting those less fortunate than ourselves.</p><p>  The estimates process for Budget 2015 is now in its finals stages.  As with allocations to all Government Departments, Budget 2015 allocations for ODA will be framed in the context of our policy commitments and the overall budgetary circumstances we face.  The final 2015 Budget allocation, which is ultimately a decision for Government, will be announced by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform on 14 October next.  The Deputy will appreciate I am currently not in a position to announce the 2015 ODA budget, but as I have repeatedly stated publicly, and in response to earlier Questions, I and the Minster for Foreign Affairs and Trade have made, and will continue to make, the strongest case possible for the allocation to the development assistance programme.</p></reply>

While there I had a wide range of meetings covering UN issues as well as bilateral and community matters.  On US. immigration reform, which remains a key Government priority, I met with both Irish community groups and high level government contacts.</p><p>  My programme included discussions with Vice President Joe Biden, White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough, Secretary of State John Kerry, and Congressman Joseph Kennedy.  I had a meeting in New York with Irish-American community leaders, including from the Coalition of Irish Immigration Centers, Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform, Ancient Order of Hibernians and the New York branch of the GAA, with whom the Government has worked closely on our shared US. immigration reform agenda.  I also had the opportunity to visit the Emerald Isle Immigration Center and Aisling Irish Center in New York and the Irish International Immigrant Center in Boston, which gave me the opportunity to meet some of those most affected by the current state of affairs.</p><p>  Following the bipartisan US Senate bill last year, and despite extensive combined efforts at Government, Embassy and Irish-American community levels since then, the US House of Representatives has not yet taken action that would deliver relief for undocumented Irish migrants in the US or an improved facility for future legal migration between Ireland and the US.  While it appeared before the summer to be the intention of President Obama and his Administration to examine the scope for action on immigration via executive authority, President Obama announced on September 6 that he would delay any such action until after the November US elections. </p><p>  The exact extent, nature and timing of any action that the U.S. Administration will be ready to take remains to be confirmed and there is clearly no guarantee as to the outcome that can be achieved via executive action.  However, in my contacts in Washington, including in my conversation with the White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough, I stressed the importance of addressing the needs and concerns of the undocumented Irish migrants in any such action. There are of course limits to what executive action is likely to be able to do and so further progress on the legislative track is also necessary. </p><p>  While there appears to be some willingness to consider further action in Congress at some future point, this is dependent on many factors and will not be easy to achieve. The Government will continue to work resolutely for progress over the coming months from which currently undocumented Irish migrants in the U.S. and their families can benefit.</p></reply>

We firmly believe in tolerance, non-discrimination, freedom of expression, freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief.</p><p>  Ireland consistently presses for effective action to counter the persecution of minorities in all relevant international fora, including the EU and UN.  Just this week (29 September) I highlighted the issue when I addressed the UN General Assembly in New York.  I also raised it during my meeting with UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon.</p><p>  The persecution of Christians and other minorities in the Middle East is a cause for particularly serious concern. In recent weeks, we have seen the extreme brutality and lawlessness demonstrated by ISIS in Iraq and in Syria which is utterly abhorrent and unacceptable. Threats and violence aimed at minority communities, including Christians and Yazidis, are intolerable. </p><p>  I am extremely concerned for the plight of Christians and other minorities and the threat they face from ISIS. Accordingly, Ireland has allocated &euro;1.1 million to the emergency response to the conflict and unfolding humanitarian catastrophe, with a focus which includes Christians and other minority groups. </p><p>  Ireland is also working within the EU to address these issues, notably with the EU Guidelines on Freedom of Religion or Belief adopted during Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the Council of the European Union last year.  These Guidelines provide EU officials with an overview of the legal and policy framework within which the right to freedom of religion or belief is protected. They also elaborate an EU strategy on how to engage with third countries on the right to freedom of religion or belief, a strategy which we hope to see bear fruit as we assess the implementation of the Guidelines.</p><p>  Ireland stands in solidarity with human rights defenders around the world advocating for their right to freedom of religion or belief, and we will continue to work to help to realise a world in which this right is respected and protected.</p><p>  I can assure the Deputy that Ireland will continue to actively support freedom of religion or belief across our foreign policy.</p></reply>

Ireland, in a statement delivered at this panel discussion, said that while armed drones as such are not illegal, there is a need to address and investigate possible disproportionate civilian casualties caused by their use.<br/><br/>Ireland said that states must take responsibility for their actions.  They must make every effort to avoid civilian casualties, and must take steps to address and investigate harm caused to civilians.  States must facilitate prompt, independent and impartial investigations where civilian deaths or injuries are reported.  In cases where drone strikes are proven to have been unlawful, access to an effective remedy must be provided.<br/><br/>Ireland commended efforts made to date to quantify the use of armed drones, and urged States to be as transparent as possible concerning their use.  The release by States of information concerning the extent of use of armed drones, and the numbers and identities of casualties, would constitute a significant step forward in promoting greater accountability. <br/><br/>Ireland has consistently taken the view that the use of drones must be in accordance with international law, including international human rights and humanitarian law.</p></reply>

Initial teacher education providers have responsibility for quality assuring the content, teaching and assessment of the Gaeltacht element of initial teacher education programmes. My Department supports the changes as contributing to overall quality improvement in initial teacher education.</p><p>  A decision was made to abolish payments by my Department towards the cost of attendance at Gaeltacht courses by initial teacher education students with effect from September 2012.   In making difficult decisions such as this, priority was given to protecting resources for front line education services as far as possible in the coming years, which is especially challenging with rising numbers of school-going children.  The changes to the gaeltacht placement grant were publicised in advance of implementation so that students would be aware of the new arrangements before embarking on Initial Teacher Education programmes.</p><p>  I can appreciate that supporting a student through third level education can be challenging.  However, I am not in a position to reinstate funding to this area.</p></reply>

The establishment of such classes is contingent on the provision of Speech and Language Therapy support being provided to the class by the Health Service Executive (HSE).</p><p>  In general, children who meet the criteria for enrolment in Special Classes for pupils with SSLD are eligible for free transport to the SSLD class nearest to his or her place of residence, subject to the terms of the school transport scheme. </p><p>  Children who meet the criteria and who are not enrolled in a Special Class for pupils with SSLD qualify for additional teaching support through an allocation of resource teaching hours, processed by the National Council for Special Education.</p><p>  As such, pupils with SSLD have the option of attending their local school with additional teaching supports and speech &amp;amp; language therapy through the primary care service, or attending a Special Class for pupils with SSLD with speech and language therapy services provided in class by the HSE.</p><p>  In the case to which the Deputy refers, I am advised that a number of different placement options were explored for the children, including enrolment in their local mainstream primary school with additional supports as outlined above. In this case the parents accepted placements in a specific speech and language disorder class in the school where the children are currently enrolled. Special school transport arrangements were then put in place.</p><p>  While it has been suggested that funding made available for school transport might be diverted to employ a speech and language therapist, the Deputy will be aware that this option is not possible. My Department currently has no responsibility or mandate for the Speech and Language service, which is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Health through the Health Service Executive (HSE).</p><p>  The matter relating to the provision of speech and language therapy has been referred to my colleague, the Minister for Health for direct reply.</p></reply>

The staffing arrangements for the 2014/15 school year (Circular 0007/2014) were published on 24 January, 2014. The staffing process includes an appeals mechanism for schools to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeals Board. The appeals criteria is also set out in Circular 0007/2014. The Appeals Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.</p><p>  The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September. The staffing schedule currently operates on the basis of a general average of 1 classroom teacher for every 28 pupils with lower thresholds for DEIS Band 1 schools.</p><p>  My Department has expanded the existing appeals process so that it is accessible to the schools that are affected by the small schools 2012 budget measure. In this regard small schools did not lose their classroom post if they projected sustainable increased enrolments in September 2014 that would be sufficient to allow them to retain their existing classroom posts over the longer term. Post allocated under this appeal criterion cannot be retained if the projected enrolment is not achieved.</p><p>  The next meeting of the Primary Staffing Appeals Board will be held in October, 2014. The closing date for schools to submit an appeal application to the Department's Primary Allocations Section is Friday 3 October, 2014.</p></reply>

It provides for a National Framework for Housing Supply to be established on a statutory footing with an annual National Statement of Projected Housing Supply and Demand published every June. The Housing Agency has been asked to take the lead in implementing this Action.<br/><br/>The proper management of all State land is critical; accordingly, both lands that have been transferred to the Housing Agency and local authority held lands suitable for development will be the first sites considered in any future targeted social housing building programme. In line with the commitments under <i>Construction 2020</i>, a Housing Supply Co-ordination Task Force for Dublin has been established with an immediate focus on addressing supply-related issues. <br/><br/>The Review of Part V of the Planning and Development Acts, which provides for social and affordable housing supply, has been completed by the Housing Agency, at my Department&rsquo;s request, and has recently been submitted to Government. It is anticipated that any legislative changes required on foot of the review will, be incorporated into the General Scheme of a new Planning Bill, which is expected to be published shortly. <br/><br/>My intention is that the Social Housing Strategy, required under Action 8 of <i>&ldquo;Construction 2020&rdquo;</i>and now in preparation, will be both challenging and innovative, and will provide the basis for an enhanced approach to social housing provision in Ireland. The Strategy will contain clear measurable actions that are to be taken to increase the supply of social housing and, most importantly, reduce the number of people on waiting lists over the next five years. I expect that the Strategy will be ready for consideration by Government in the coming weeks.<br/><br/>I expect the final output across all social housing programmes for 2014 to be in the region of 6,000 units. The number and method of delivery of social housing units in future years will be determined in the course of the annual Estimates process and will be informed by the Social Housing Strategy.</p></reply>

The code sets out key governance, management and financial principles that AHBs commit to meeting on signing a Charter of Commitments.  In February 2014 an interim Regulatory Committee was established to oversee the implementation of the code and to advise on the development of statutory regulation. The Committee includes experts in regulation, housing, law and finance and has been constituted as an independent committee operating, for the time being, within the Housing and Sustainable Communities Agency.<br/><br/>A Regulation Office has also been established within the Agency to manage the day to day functions of implementing the voluntary code. To date, just over 160 AHBs have signed up to the code and further details are available on the Agency&rsquo;s website at .<br/><br/>In July 2014, the Government approved the preparation of the Heads of a Bill to provide for the statutory regulation and governance of AHBs.  I expect that the finalised Heads of the Bill will be ready for submission to Government in Q1 2015, after which drafting of the Bill will be progressed by the office of the Parliamentary Counsel. The interim period of voluntary regulation will be a valuable source of information as to the scope and final content of the Bill.<br/><br/>Regulation will provide support and assurance to tenants, the Boards of AHBs and their external partners that the sector is well regulated. It will also safeguard the investment that has been made in the sector and encourage future investment.</p></reply>

With effect from 1 January 2014, Irish Water is responsible for the provision of public water services.<br/><br/>Section 12 of the Act provides for the transfer of property from a local authority to Irish Water. Section 13 of the Act provides that any rights or liabilities relating to the property transferred to Irish Water under section 12 shall also stand transferred to Irish Water.  Section 14 of the Act provides for the transfer of other liabilities from a water services authority to Irish Water by way of Ministerial Order.<br/><br/>To date, two Orders have been made under section 14 - the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 (Transfer of Other Liabilities) Order 2014, which was signed on 20 February 2014, and the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 (Transfer of Other Liabilities) Order (No. 2) 2014, which was signed on 24 April 2014. The Orders, which are available in the Oireachtas library, provided for the transfer of a total of 970 contracts from the local authorities to Irish Water.<br/><br/>Work is underway to prepare for the transfer of water services property and liabilities from the local authorities to Irish Water and it is expected that further Orders will be made in this regard in the coming months.<br/><br/>Irish Water has entered into service level agreements (SLA) with each of the local authorities for the provision of water services, as provided for under the Water Services (No.2) Act 2013.  Staff in local authorities conducting work under these arrangements will remain local authority employees. The SLA reflects the transformation agenda required for the sector, with provision for annual service plans which will set out required performance, budgets and headcount.<br/><br/>The length of the service level agreement and the fact that the agreement will include a programme of change are reflected in a Framework document, agreed with the Trade Unions under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission, and which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website. This agreement, and the Water Services (No.2) Act 2013 provide that, in the event of a SLA coming to an end, the staff covered by that agreement will become Irish Water employees and their terms and conditions and superannuation arrangements will be protected by legislation.<br/><br/>The Water Services Transition Office was established to ensure appropriate local authority input into the reform agenda and prepare for the transfer of functions to Irish Water.  My Department agreed outline budgets for both 2013 and 2014 to cover costs of staff seconded to the Office, recoupment of salaries of certain staff in local authorities and other necessary programme costs.

These grants are in addition to the VRT reliefs of up to &euro;5,000 which apply to electric vehicles. To date, support has been provided for the purchase of 525 new vehicles of which 243 were grant aided in 2014 to date. The grant scheme will remain open for this year and, subject to finalisation of the budgetary arrangements, continue next year.</p><p>  Additionally, the ESB, through its ecars programme, is continuing to roll out both publicly accessible charging infrastructure and domestic charge points. My Department understands that 892 public charge-points have now been installed nationally. These include 67 DC fast chargers, most of which have been installed on major roads.

In accordance with the Government Decision of 12 April 2011, my predecessor commenced a process of seeking, on the Department&rsquo;s website, expressions of Interest from persons wishing to be considered for appointment to vacancies on State Boards under the aegis of this Department. This information has been used to inform decisions for such appointments, but I would stress that such invitations are designed to extend the range of suitable persons from which a Minister might make appointments, not to constrain it. While appointments are made by the relevant Minister, I would add that appointments to Boards also include nominations, provided for by statute, by Committees of the Oireachtas, worker directors and ex-officio positions. While the precise structure varies from body to body, in total this can amount to a significant proportion of the Board in certain instances. While I am aware of the service that can be provided by the Public Appointments Service, I would point out that the arrangements I have outlined provide for a wide and varied process of selection for appointment </p><p>  All appointments are made in light of the applicable legislative requirements, objectives of the organisation and on the basis of appointees having the necessary competencies, expertise and experience to contribute effectively to the work of the particular boards.</p><p>  In 2011 there were 31 applications received following the advertisement for Expressions of Interest from which 3 appointments were made. In 2012 there were 37 applications received following the advertisement for Expressions of Interest from which 5 appointments were made. In the current 2013/2014 call for Expressions of Interest there have been 118 applications received to date following the advertisement for Expressions of Interest from which 9 appointments were made.</p><p>  There have been 114 appointments made to State Boards under the aegis of my Department in the period March 2011 to date. The percentage of these appointments filled from the Expressions of Interest received amounts to 15%. It should be noted that about 30% of the appointments made were either ex-officio appointments, reappointments, the appointment of worker directors chosen by election, or appointments made from nominations made by an Oireachtas Committee. </p><p>  On 30 September, my colleague the Minister of Public Expenditure and Reform announced further steps to strengthen the process of Board appointments and my Department will be liaising with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to ensure that procedures in my Department are in line with the new measures proposed.</p></reply>

Options being proposed for international interoperability are still in development and to date no over-arching standard has emerged as the dominant standard for Europe.  At present, the EU includes a number of nationally supported smartcard ticketing schemes which are collaborating to seek to find ways to achieve cross border interoperability, however achieving consensus is some way off. The recent introduction of contactless bank card payment for public transport may in fact be the means by which interoperability is achieved in the future.</p></reply>

DART Underground is now being reviewed and assessed by the National Transport Authority (NTA) in conjunction with other large public transport projects for the Dublin area. The 2010 business case for DART Underground is currently being updated and will be based on the latest data on population, transport demand, construction costs etc.</p><p>  The NTA have advised me that the DART Underground report and the outcome from the Fingal/North Dublin Transport Study and the preliminary Business Case for the BRT to Swords will be available by early next year.</p><p>  Following receipt and assessment of the reports I will then consider the options and priorities for addressing key public transport deficits in the GDA having regard to the costs and benefits and affordability of each project as well as funding sources and options including private funds, EIB loans and EU grants.</p><p>  Significant additional Exchequer resources will be required to advance any new major project irrespective of the availability of private or EU funds. With existing funding levels the key priority is to protect investment made to date and to maintain safety standards. If additional funds become available, there will be many competing projects from all transport modes in all regions.</p><p>  I will prioritise any additional funds for projects for which there is a clear need, which are affordable, have a sound business case and add value to existing infrastructure. I would expect that there will be public transport projects in the Dublin region which will meet these criteria if funds are available.</p></reply>

Finally, candidates may also be appointed who, in the view of the Minister of the day, have a contribution to make and who may be willing to serve.<br/><br/>The Government has recently agreed on a <i>Revised Model for Ministerial Appointments </i>to State Boards which complements the current system with a more structured approach to ensure<i></i>that vacancies on State Boards are populated in a transparent way by the high-calibre personnel required to successfully perform their mandates. My officials are now engaged in the preparations for implementing this revised model and I look forward to the guidelines which Minister Howlin will present in the coming weeks in that regard.</p></reply>

The qualifying criteria for the Cessation of Turf Cutting Compensation Scheme are that:<br/><br/>- The claimant must have a legal interest in one of the 53 raised bog special areas of conservation &ndash; ownership or turbary right;<br/><br/>- The claimant must have been the owner or entitled to exercise turbary rights on the land in question on 25 May 2010;<br/><br/>- The turbary on the site must not be exhausted;<br/><br/>- The claimant must have been cutting turf on the land in question during the relevant five year period; and<br/><br/>- No turf cutting or associated activity is ongoing on the property.<br/><br/>Following an inspection by officials of my Department of the plot of bog in respect of which the applicant has applied for compensation, it appears that a supply of turf had not been cut on the land in question during the relevant five year period.<br/><br/>The application has been reviewed within my Department and arrangements will be made to meet with the applicant to discuss his case as soon as possible.</p></reply>
