These demonstrations began earlier this month as a protest at a rise in bus fares.  Demonstrations have since spread to cities across the country and have become an expression of broader discontent on a range of issues.  Grievances are reported to include the quality of public services, corruption and the cost of public spending on preparations for the 2014 World Cup.</p><p>  While most of the public gatherings have been peaceful in nature, there have been regrettable incidents of violence.  There are also reports of vandalism and of looting carried out by fringe elements taking advantage of situations of disorder.  </p><p>  The grievances raised by demonstrators highlight complex issues that require work over time.  Brazil is a country that has been enjoying strong economic growth and positive social development since its return to democracy a little over 25 years ago.  Notably, Brazil has developed and delivered policies that have lifted an estimated 40 million people from poverty.  The demonstrations of recent weeks have highlighted issues which many citizens now wish to see addressed by their authorities.</p><p>  The Government of Brazil has expressed willingness for dialogue on these issues while, at the same time, making clear the need for violence and vandalism to cease.  Brazil&rsquo;s President Rousseff met earlier this week with representatives of those protesting on public transport issues.  She also met with Governors and Mayors from across Brazil to discuss the range of issues raised by the protestors.  The President has since announced an increase in funding for key public services, and has also proposed consultations on political reforms. </p><p>  The Ambassador and his colleagues continue to monitor the situation carefully, and to keep me informed of developments.  Although the majority of protests have been peaceful, we advise Irish citizens to avoid such demonstrations.</p><p>  I wish the President, Government and People of Brazil every success as they continue to build a society that supports sustainable and just development in the interests of all Brazilians.</p></reply>

Ireland's merchandise exports to Canada increased by 11% in 2012 to over &euro;780 million and exports by indigenous EI client companies increased by 26% in 2012 to over &euro;214 million. </p><p>  The recent Enterprise Ireland trade mission to Canada, which I led from 10 to 13 June, was organised in close cooperation with my Department and the Embassy of Ireland to Canada. A key objective of the mission was to identify potential opportunities for Irish companies in the oil and gas industries in the province of Alberta. 15 Irish companies participated in the mission, in the engineering, construction, technology and recruitment sectors.</p><p>  During the trade mission, I met with the Deputy Premier and Minister for Enterprise and Advanced Education, and the Minister for International and Intergovernmental Affairs, of the province of Alberta, as well as with a range of Irish companies and their Canadian business partners and customers. I delivered keynote addresses at business networking events organised in conjunction with the Ireland-Canada Centre of Commerce in Calgary and the Ireland-Canada Chamber of Commerce in Edmonton, and also at a Seminar on European Innovation in the Canadian Heavy Oil Industry. I also met with Irish community groups in both Calgary and Edmonton and thanked them for their work in supporting younger Irish people working in Alberta. In addition, I used the opportunities presented by engagement with the Irish-Canadian community in both cities to promote <i>The Gathering. </i>  I also availed of media interviews to deliver key messages on the Irish economy, as well as promoting awareness of the objectives of the trade mission and of the strong Ireland-Canada bilateral relationship generally.</p><p>  Among the highlights from the trade mission for a number of EI client companies were the conclusion of an agreement between <i>PM Group</i> and its Canadian Partner, <i>Gas Liquids Engineering (GLE)</i>, which will see both companies working together in the gas processing industry in Europe and across the world; a long-term contract secured by <i>Decisions [D4H]</i> with the Government of Alberta for the provision of their innovative search and rescue software; and an event with Canadian business contacts to mark the recent opening by <i>Tech Skills</i>  of its first office in Canada. I am confident that the contacts made and developed during this trade mission will lead to ongoing opportunities for Irish companies to increase their exports to the Canadian market and to expand their engagement with new and existing Canadian partners.</p><p>  Trade missions are just one of the ways in which we aim to support the Irish enterprise sector to develop trade, tourism and investment opportunities across the globe. Our Embassy network and state agencies overseas work hard to identify specific export and investment opportunities, build extensive business and political contact networks, lobby on market access issues and promote Ireland as a destination for tourism and for study. I would add that during the recent visit to Ireland by Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, which took place from 15 to 17 June, the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste discussed Ireland-Canada and EU-Canada relations, including our trading and economic relationship, and they used the opportunity to update the PM on recent positive developments related to the Irish economy.</p></reply>

In January 2012, I visited Israel, the West Bank and Gaza to see the issues on the ground and speak to leaders on all sides. I and my Department continue to avail of every opportunity to meet leaders and officials from the region, as well as EU and other leaders active on the Middle East. I have discussed the Middle East Peace Process on a number of occasions with US Secretary of State Kerry including when I met him in Washington in March, prior to the first of his recent intensive series of visits to the region.   The Foreign Affairs Council which I attended on Monday had a valuable discussion on the Arab-Israeli conflict. </p><p>  The EU&rsquo;s key priority at this point is to support the efforts of Secretary Kerry to bring the two parties back to substantial negotiations aimed at concluding a comprehensive agreement. Ultimately this is the only way the overall conflict, and the many problems caused by the occupation, will be ended. In advance of any proposals from the US, the Council considered how the EU can best support what may well be the last feasible chance to achieve a two-state solution to the conflict. This could take the form of direct political support and encouragement, and parallel EU actions in support, such as the capacity building in the Palestinian administration which we have engaged in for some years. We noted also that over the past year the viability of the two-state solution has been further eroded.</p><p>  Recalling in particular the Conclusions which we reached in May and December 2012, we expressed our concerns about developments on the ground which are working to make the two-state solution impossible.  This is a theme which I have continually addressed and kept to the fore in EU discussions.  I have been a strong advocate of the need for an early review by the Foreign Affairs Council of the issues which we addressed in the May 2012 Conclusions. I am firmly of the view that actions on the ground are threatening the prospects for a peace agreement based on the two-state solution and that the EU must make its position in this regard very clear.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-06-26a.20.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1006" speakername="Joe Costello" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013062600068#WRB00900"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 18 together.</p><p>  As Minister of State with responsibility for Ireland&rsquo;s Official Development Assistance, I am very conscious of the need to ensure that our development assistance is spent effectively, is fully accountable and that it makes a real difference to the lives of the world&rsquo;s poorest people. </p><p>  The overarching objective of the aid programme is to contribute to the eradication of extreme poverty and hunger in the world.  To be certain that our assistance is targeted at those most in need and delivered in the most effective manner, we work through a variety of delivery channels in partnership with national governments, local communities, NGOs, and key multilateral partners such as the United Nations. Each of these partners is fully accountable to my Department for any funds received.</p><p>  All proposals for funding are rigorously appraised by Irish Aid staff or independent experts using clear criteria, including quality of intended impact, sustainability, cost effectiveness and efficiency in the use of resources.</p><p>  Irish Aid Programmes in receipt of funding are subject to regular internal and external monitoring and are evaluated and audited by independent experts.  The independent Evaluation and Audit Unit of my Department evaluates the performance of Irish Aid under its work programme and regularly reviews risks associated with the implementation of programmes. This year the Unit has prioritised the assessment of all internal control systems governing the management of the Aid Programme.  Evaluations and audits are also regularly reviewed by the independent Audit Committee of my Department. </p><p>  In addition a comprehensive system of external audit is in place in the Department.  Audits are carried out on an annual basis by independent auditors of international accountancy firms and the national audit offices of our partner Governments. Oversight of the audit function is by the Department&rsquo;s independent Audit Committee which provides an independent appraisal of the Department&rsquo;s audit and evaluation function</p><p>  The Comptroller &amp;amp; Auditor General reviews the operation of the Department&rsquo;s Internal Audit function and places reliance on its work for the purpose of its annual report. This report is in turn examined by the Public Accounts Committee.</p><p>  I believe that the strong focus on appraisal, regular review, independent evaluations and audit provides assurance that all Irish Aid funds are very closely monitored and used for the purposes intended.  </p><p>  The recent case in Uganda is a clear indication of the need for continuous vigilance. The report into the events in Uganda contains a number of recommendations for improving the monitoring and oversight of Irish Aid spending. I have accepted all of the recommendations of the Uganda report. I have welcomed the swift action of the Government of Uganda in reimbursing in full all misused funds and the prosecutions which are underway. I wish to assure Deputies that all oversight systems are currently being reviewed in the light of the report and will be strengthened, where necessary, if any deficiencies are identified. </p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights and to the advancement of peace and reconciliation is a cornerstone of our foreign policy and a key priority of Ireland&rsquo;s new Policy for International Development &lsquo;One World, One Future&rsquo;. We believe that sustainable development can only be achieved when there is a strong foundation of human rights, peace and security. In line with our new policy we are committed to reinvigorating our approach to human rights by ensuring that the human rights principles of non-discrimination, equality, empowerment and participation are integrated across all our development efforts and organisations that we fund. </p><p>  My Department, through Irish Aid and the Human Rights and Conflict Resolution Units, has significant experience in supporting peace and reconciliation efforts in a number of developing countries including Timor Leste, Sierra Leone and Liberia.  A priority in the Policy for International Development is to build on this considerable experience and deepen our efforts in Fragile States.  We will be strengthening our work in this area over the coming months.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-06-26a.23.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1006" speakername="Joe Costello" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013062600068#WRB01100"><p>The Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which was adopted by the UN General Assembly in 2000, focuses on the involvement of children in armed conflict in an effort to strengthen implementation of the Convention and increase the protection of children during armed conflicts.  The Protocol became legally binding on 12 February 2002 and, to date, more than 100 countries, including Ireland, have ratified it.  The Protocol requires States which ratify the Convention to &#8220;take all feasible measures&#8221; to ensure that any members of their armed forces under the age of 18 do not take a direct part in hostilities.</p><p>  The two countries to which the Deputy refers, Zambia and Ethiopia, have already signed and ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child. They have also signed the Optional Protocol on the involvement of children in armed conflict. However, neither country has yet ratified the Protocol, or established a specific timeframe for such ratification.</p><p>  In both countries, the United Nations Children's Fund, UNICEF, has raised the issue of ratification with the relevant authorities, and will continue to do so, with the support of our Embassies in Addis Ababa and Lusaka.  Ethiopia and Zambia are both key partner countries for Ireland's development assistance programme, where we have a commitment to long term strategic assistance.  In keeping with our partnership approach, I have asked our Ambassadors to raise the issue of the Optional Protocol with the authorities in both countries and to encourage them to ratify it.</p><p>  Ireland continues to engage on the protection of children's rights including through the core work of the Irish Aid programme.  The central priority of our aid programme is the elimination of extreme poverty and the fight to end hunger and under-nutrition.  We are also implementing major programmes to improve child and maternal health and increase access to and quality of education, including in Ethiopia and Zambia.  More generally, Ireland is a strong contributor to the work of UNICEF.    <font color="#4F4F4F"> </font></p><p>  In Ireland's new policy for international development, &#8220;One World, One Future,&#8221; we have pledged to increase our engagement on the issue of children in armed conflict, and we are actively examining options for strengthened action in this area.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-06-26a.26.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1006" speakername="Joe Costello" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013062600068#WRB01300"><p>Sierra Leone&rsquo;s protracted civil war, in which 50,000 people died, fostered widespread abuse of human rights. Women suffered the brunt of the conflict, and experienced some of the most horrific acts of violence during the war. While Sierra Leone has made considerable progress towards peace and sustainable development since the end of the war in 2002, the country continues to suffer from a high incidence of sexual and gender-based violence. The most common forms of gender-based violence in Sierra Leone are domestic violence, sexual assault, physical violence against women and girls, female genital mutilation, and early and forced marriage.</p><p>  The Government of Sierra Leone is making solid progress towards protecting, promoting and fulfilling human rights, and developing systems of good governance in terms of institutions and laws. The Government has established a Human Rights Commission and an Anti Corruption Commission, and has passed laws against sexual offences, domestic violence and child abuse. A national gender strategic plan and an action plan on gender-based violence are in place. However, implementation of these laws and strategies is, as yet, limited due in large part to resourcing and capacity challenges faced by the Government. </p><p>  Gender-based violence is a significant contributory factor to poverty and ill-health worldwide and prevents many people, the vast majority of whom are women, from reaching their potential.  As the Deputy may be aware, the Government is one of the key drivers behind the Irish Consortium on Gender Based Violence in which former President Mary Robinson plays such a prominent role. Tackling gender-based violence is a priority for Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme, including in its newest Key Partner Country, Sierra Leone. </p><p>  Since 2006, Ireland has provided over &euro;2.1 million to the International Rescue Committee for its gender-based violence and women&rsquo;s empowerment programme in Sierra Leone. I had the opportunity to visit this programme while in Sierra Leone last year and saw first-hand how Ireland&rsquo;s contribution is helping to support activities focused on prevention of gender-based violence through awareness raising and training of women, school-children, and men, and economic empowerment of women. Our support has also allowed the International Rescue Committee to engage with the Government of Sierra Leone in order to build capacity of the Ministry for Social Welfare, Gender and Children&rsquo;s Affairs and to advocate for increased attention to issues affecting women and girls.</p><p>  Ireland is also providing &euro;1.4 million to the United Nations Development Programme for its programme, which seeks to improve the access to justice for gender-based violence survivors in Sierra Leone.</p><p>  Ireland is committed to supporting the recovery efforts and successful transition of countries emerging from conflict or significant and protracted humanitarian crises. The recent announcement that Sierra Leone will become one of Irish Aid&rsquo;s nine Key Partner Countries is testament to this commitment. Ireland will further strengthen its support for long-term reconstruction and development in Sierra Leone, working in close collaboration with the Sierra Leonean Government and other partners such as United Nations agencies and NGOs.</p></reply>

At present, it numbers some 3400 staff, spread between the Brussels Headquarters and 141 EU Delegations throughout the world. Under the leadership of the High Representative, Catherine Ashton, the EEAS has achieved much during its first two and a half years in operation.  From a CFSP perspective, this period has been a very busy one, and the Foreign Affairs Council, which HR Ashton chairs, has taken important decisions in relation to major foreign policy issues, not least the crisis in Syria, the nuclear issue in Iran and various African conflict situations.  There have been significant breakthroughs in areas such as the Belgrade/Pristina dialogue and important developments also on policy issues such as the &lsquo;comprehensive approach&rsquo; to crisis management.  Operationally, good progress has also been made in meeting the challenge of establishing a new institution, which comprises staff from the EU Commission, the General Secretariat of the Council and national diplomats seconded from the Member States.   </p><p>  As a new institution however, the EEAS is very much a work in progress. The 2010 Council Decision included a specification that HR Ashton would prepare a Review of the &ldquo;organisation and functioning&rdquo; of the Service by mid-2013.  This is an important process, which provides an opportunity to take stock of progress achieved to date and to identify those areas which might be improved.  While the Review is led by the High Representative, Ireland has taken an active interest in the process, contributing to consultations at senior political and official level.  Other EU member States and key interlocutors such as the European Parliament and the EU Commission have also contributed to it.  The Review was the subject of discussions at the informal meeting of EU Foreign Ministers which I co-hosted with HR Ashton in Dublin Castle in March (and to which I was particularly pleased to welcome representatives from the Parliament and the Commission for that discussion).    </p><p>  The recently-published report from the European Parliament makes a number of recommendations across a range of areas, including in relation to management and recruitment issues. Ireland shares many of these views.   We too wish to see progress towards achieving improved member State representation and gender balance within the EEAS and we welcome the advances that are being made to achieve this.  Indeed, the one-third target, as set out in the original 2010 Decision, for the participation of nationals of EU member States has almost been reached and this is to be commended.  Commenting on the Parliament&rsquo;s report, HR Ashton concurred with many of the points made in it and congratulated the rapporteurs, Elmar Brok and Roberto Gualtieri, for their &ldquo;thoughtful and balanced&rdquo; contribution.</p><p>  I expect that the High Representative will take account of the various contributions &ndash; including from the European Parliament and member States &ndash; in the Report which she will present in the near future.  I look forward to considering her recommendations in due course.</p></reply>

Ireland along with our partners in the EU believes that genuine reconciliation among all groups and communities in Sri Lanka is essential and requires justice and accountability.</p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s Ambassador to India, who is accredited to Sri Lanka, discussed the peace and reconciliation process with the Prime Minister and Minister of External Affairs of Sri Lanka in December of 2012 and again with the Minister of External Affairs in February of 2013.  These discussions included issues around the treatment of prisoners incarcerated in connection with the conflict.</p><p>  In an address I gave to the 22nd Session of the United Nations Human Rights Council I highlighted the current human rights situation in the country and in particular the need for accountability and reconciliation in Sri Lanka.  Also during this session of the Council, members passed a resolution calling upon the Government of Sri Lanka to take meaningful action on reconciliation and accountability and specifically expressed concern about continued reports of enforced disappearances, extrajudicial killings, torture and other human rights violations.</p><p>  As mentioned in the report, Sri Lanka regrettably rejected a number of recommendations made by the international community during the Universal Periodic Review of the situation of human rights in Sri Lanka.  However Ireland&rsquo;s recommendations that the Government of Sri Lanka take steps to ensure that all detainees are afforded a fair trial within a reasonable time period, and second, that the Government of Sri Lanka inform the Council of implementation of recommendations of the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission, were both accepted by Sri Lanka. </p><p>  Ireland, together with our international partners, will continue to urge the Government of Sri Lanka to adhere to its international obligations and respect the human rights of all its citizens, through our accredited embassy in New Delhi and the relevant multilateral channels.</p></reply>

Separately, on the same date, I met with the First Minister and deputy First Minister on North South Institutional matters. In both meetings, the then absence of an agreed strategy to provide a framework for a stable, shared society for the people of Northern Ireland was discussed.</p><p>  I welcome, therefore, the publication on 23 May 2013 by the NI Executive of a new strategy <i>'Together: Building A United Community'</i>.  The publication of the strategy is an important acknowledgement of the ongoing blight of sectarianism across communities in Northern Ireland and recognition that building a shared society will require a comprehensive response across political, economic, civic and social life.</p><p>  I welcome in particular the proposal to establish an All-Party Group, with an independent Chair from outside of the political parties, to consider and make recommendations on difficult matters including parades and protests; flags, symbols, emblems and related matters; and the past. I understand that progress is being made on this on an all-party basis and that the All-Party Group should be operational within the coming weeks.  </p><p>  Building relationships between divided communities takes time and sustained effort and will need to be at the core of the work of the NI Executive, NI Party Leaders and the NI Assembly for some time to come.  The Government will continue to support all efforts by the Executive and political leaders in Northern Ireland to promote reconciliation.  The priority now, in my discussions with the Parties in Northern Ireland, is to encourage and support them in implementing the Strategy and the work of the All-Party Group to its fullest extent, both in terms of promoting an ethos of respect and reconciliation and in implementing fully the individual practical proposals as set out in the Strategy. </p><p>  I am particularly pleased that progress has been made in the draft Multi-Annual financial framework for a Peace Programme which I believe will play a critical role in supporting this Strategy. The Government will also continue to support reconciliation in other ways, including through the Reconciliation and Anti-Sectarianism Funds, which provide grants to organisations involved in reconciliation work on a cross-community and cross-border basis.  We will also continue to support commemorative initiatives and events in Northern Ireland which foster reconciliation and mutual understanding among the different communities on the island.  </p><p>  We are committed to advancing all aspects of North South relations in close cooperation with the Northern Ireland Executive and to developing an ever-deeper partnership with the British Government.  In respect of each of these levels of engagement, the work of my Department and across Government is informed by a common purpose of contributing to building united, reconciled and prosperous communities across this island.</p></reply>

I share the concern expressed by the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs, Catherine Ashton, in a statement on 5 June 2013, and support her call for all States to observe the principle of non-refoulment.  All States should refrain from the expulsion of refugees to countries where they may face persecution.  This principle is a core tenet of international humanitarian law.  The international community is extremely concerned about the dire human rights situation in North Korea.  Ireland, together with the members of the Human Rights Commission in Geneva in March 2013, approved a resolution to set up a Commission of Inquiry into the matter.  This resolution deplored the grave, widespread and systematic human rights abuses in the country and also called upon North Korea to immediately end the use of torture and labour camps against its citizens, including repatriated citizens.  Ireland, as a member of the United Nations Human Rights Council, and together with our international partners, will continue to urge the DPRK Government to address the dire human rights situation in the country and related issues regarding the repatriation of refugees through the relevant multilateral channels.</p></reply>

The importance that Ireland attaches to Croatian accession and to our bilateral relations was demonstrated when President Higgins paid his first State Visit to Croatia from 5 &ndash; 9 June this year. Ireland has been positively associated with Croatia's accession process from the beginning.  It was during our Presidency of 2004 that Ireland sought and achieved a decision on granting Croatia candidate status.  We have remained closely engaged with Croatia since then, including during our current Presidency. In addition to meetings in Brussels at the regular Council sessions, last month First Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ms. Vesna Pusić visited Dublin and held discussions with myself and Minister of State Creighton.  I held talks in Dublin last September with Deputy Prime Minister Mr. Neven Mimica, who has since been nominated as Croatia's first European Commissioner.  Minister of State Creighton accompanied President Higgins on his State Visit to Croatia earlier this month.  Prior to this, Minister of State Creighton attended the Croatia Summit in July 2012 and also met with Foreign Minister Pusić.  As Croatia joins the family of members of the European Union, I expect that our bilateral and trade relations will continue to strengthen and deepen.  I look forward to representing the Irish Presidency in Zagreb on 30 June for the accession celebrations.</p></reply>

Pluralism of opinion, freedom of expression, and the right to peaceful protest, should be part of every democracy, alongside the rule of law.  The disproportionate use of force by the police against mostly peaceful demonstrators has been deeply disturbing and should be thoroughly investigated.  Those responsible should be held fully accountable before the law.</p><p>  In order to avoid any further escalation and to restore calm, it is imperative that the Turkish government engages fully with the protestors.  I understand that Prime Minister Erdoğan met representatives of the protestors on two occasions.  This is to be welcomed, as is his offer of public consultation on the future of Gezi Park. </p><p>  However, it is clear at this stage that the protestors now have a broader agenda seeking greater freedoms, and protesting excessive police violence.  I would urge the Turkish government to address these legitimate concerns also.  I would also call on the government to refrain from using divisive language.  I urge all sides to show calm and restraint in the period ahead.</p><p>  I spoke with the Turkish Foreign Minister by phone earlier this month and expressed my concern at the heavy handed police response to protestors.  While, personally, I have not had any direct contacts with Turkish trade unions in recent days, my Department, and the Irish Embassy in Ankara, continue to monitor the situation closely, and to liaise with counterparts on developments.  I engaged with my EU counterparts at Council this week, and there was general agreement that developments in Turkey are of deep concern. </p><p>  Turkey is a candidate for membership of the EU.  As such it is expected to uphold the democratic values of the EU.  Ireland has long been supportive of Turkish EU membership, and the Irish Presidency has been active in efforts to reinvigorate the accession process.  We believe that the EU accession process exercises a positive influence on Turkey.  Significant reforms, inspired by the accession process, have been undertaken.  However, the demonstrations show that Turkey remains a country in transition and that, while a space for civil society has been opened up, further reform is needed. </p><p>  Now is not the time to weaken the hand of the reformers by turning our back on Turkey.  This would not serve the aims of the civil society demonstrators.  We should be strengthening the hand of the reformers by ensuring that accession &ndash; which is a lengthy process with some distance to run &ndash; continues.  This is not the moment to disengage from Turkey, but to engage more closely.  We should continue to focus on pursuing the accession process, while at the same time pressing Turkey to live up to its commitments.</p></reply>

The Government have also attached great importance to providing for future flows of migration between Ireland and the United States through the extension of the so called E3 visa scheme to include Irish citizens.</p><p>  In this context, we very much welcomed the publication this springtime of the US Senate&rsquo;s Border Security, Economic Opportunity and Immigration Modernization Bill which provides for reform of the US immigration system.  </p><p>  The bill is progressing through the Senate system and on May 21, the Senate Judiciary Committee completed its detailed examination of proposals for comprehensive reform of the US immigration system as set out in the Bill.  The Bill has gone forward for further debate by the full Senate and it is expected debates will continue over the coming weeks.</p><p>  The comprehensive draft legislation, which was drafted over several months by a bi-partisan group of eight US Senators, includes provisions that would legalise the status of thousands of undocumented Irish people and provide a path to permanent residency.  It also provides for future flows of legal migration between Ireland and the US via the proposed E-3 visa. </p><p>  The Bill is a very positive development.  Its provisions, if adopted, would help to end the great hardship and uncertainty faced by undocumented Irish in the US and their families here in Ireland.  The inclusion of a new provision to allow several thousand Irish citizens to legally avail of employment opportunities in the US every year is also particularly welcome.  </p><p>  It is important to recall that the overall issues involved are complex and sensitive ones within the US political system.  Our Embassy in Washington continues to closely follow developments and lobby as necessary, in keeping with the approach we have adopted over many years in our pursuit of a resolution of the situation facing the undocumented in the United States.    </p><p>  I have recently written to Secretary of State John Kerry to express continued support for immigration reform and to express concerns that certain provisions of the Bill might have an impact on the operation of the J-1 summer work and travel programme.  I have also discussed these issues recently with Senator Patrick Leahy, Chair of the Senate&rsquo;s Judiciary Committee and I intend to visit Washington DC in the coming weeks to reinforce the Irish Government&rsquo;s interest in all aspects of immigration reform.   </p><p>  I would like to reiterate my appreciation for the active support we continue to receive from a number of Irish community organisations, including the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform, the Chicago Celts and the Ancient Order of Hibernians.</p></reply>

The Venezuelan National Electoral Commission recorded President Maduro ahead of the leading opposition candidate, Henrique Capriles, by 1.49%.  I am aware that Mr Capriles has disputed the outcome and is pursuing his claim through legal channels. The European Union and its member states continue to follow developments closely.  The EU High Representative, Catherine Ashton, has expressed her concern at the growing polarisation of Venezuelan society, noting that it is important that the outcome of the vote can be accepted by all and that appeals are duly considered by the competent Venezuelan authorities.  In my view, any allegations of electoral irregularity must be addressed fully through appropriate appeal mechanisms.  Building and sustaining trust in the fairness of a country&rsquo;s democratic institutions is critical in the promotion of fundamental freedoms, social inclusion and sustainable development.  I join with EU High Representative Ashton in calling upon all parties in Venezuela to engage constructively in the promotion of good governance. </p></reply>

The Fund was launched in April 2012. </p><p>  The fund is part of Ireland&rsquo;s overseas development cooperation programme and is designed to support the development of new partnerships between the agri-food sectors in Ireland and Africa. The two-year pilot phase (2012 to 2013) has a focus on Tanzania and Kenya. </p><p>  The programme is targeted at encouraging and supporting Irish agri-food companies to transfer knowledge and experience to the African agri-food sector in order to build and strengthen the African food industry and meet the continent&rsquo;s food needs.</p><p>  A technical mission from both Departments supported by Enterprise Ireland visited Tanzania and Kenya in April 2012. A workshop with potential Irish partners was hosted by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Marine in May 2012.  In July 2012, the T&aacute;naiste visited an agri-food industry in Kenya to learn how a company which exports directly to high street stores in Dublin can provide a market for smallholder outgrower farmers, especially women. The T&aacute;naiste invited this company to participate in the Africa Ireland Economic Forum in Dublin last October. </p><p>  The Fund has adopted the Principles for Responsible International Investment in Agriculture that respect Rights, Livelihoods and Resources as adopted by the FAO, IFAD, UNCTAD and the World Bank. All Fund applicants will have to comply with these principles in the event that they receive public funding.</p><p>  I am pleased to confirm that both Departments continue to engage in constructive dialogue with some of the major players in the agri-business in Ireland. Some of the larger companies have independently visited East Africa and initiated business contacts. In terms of the overall objective of connecting the Irish agri-food sector with the African market, the AADF has already made significant progress. </p><p>  Turning to the specific questions on the disbursement of funds, I am pleased to note further progress. In all new initiatives, it takes time to identify viable areas for support.  At the moment, two proposals are under consideration for funding. I can confirm that they relate to the broad areas of training for the agri-food industry and technology transfer that can improve the efficiency of food production in Africa. </p><p>  In keeping with the open and transparent nature of the Fund, full details of the scheme, its objectives, principles and management are published on my Department&rsquo;s website along with contact details for interested participants.  The success of the Fund ultimately rests on the level of engagement by Irish agri-food companies and I remain hopeful that the pilot phase will see sustainable partnerships developed between the Irish and African agri-food sectors.</p></reply>

Although the central focus of the hearing concerned perceived problems in the US tax system, there were also some misleading and inaccurate references to the Irish tax system made during the hearing.  The Ambassador of Ireland in Washington D.C. wrote to the Chairman and Ranking Member of the US Senate Subcommittee directly to correct the two most glaring inaccuracies, making it clear that Ireland is not a tax haven and that Ireland does not do special tax deals with companies. </p><p>  The Embassy of Ireland in Washington D.C. continues to engage with the US Administration, with Members of Congress and with key contacts on these issues. The economic messaging briefing available to the Embassy network across the globe has also been regularly reinforced, in close co-operation with the Department of Finance who, of course, lead on corporate tax policy, following the inaccurate references made during the US Senate Subcommittee hearing.</p><p>  Ireland supports those countries who are calling for measures to tackle tax fraud and evasion. The only way for such measures to be effective is for countries to work together to examine these issues and to consider how international rules can be amended to ensure fair levels of taxation. This is being done at the appropriate levels in the OECD, through the BEPS (Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Project. Ireland is fully engaged in that process.  At EU level, Ireland has led the way in making sure that significant progress was made in recent months in the area of savings, VAT anti-fraud, aggressive tax planning, and tax fraud and evasion.</p><p>  In close co-operation with the Department of Finance, the Revenue Commissioners and the IDA, my Department will continue to challenge misleading references to corporate taxation in Ireland through the Embassy network. We have a positive story to tell of Ireland&rsquo;s transparent and competitive taxation system and of our strong track record of attracting companies of real substance to invest and create thousands of jobs here.</p></reply>

The issues involved are highlighted in the most recent annual report of the UN Secretary General on children and armed conflict, which was issued on 15 May.  The report notes that children have become more vulnerable in conflicts in recent years because of the absence of clear front lines and identifiable opponents, the increasing use of terror tactics by some armed groups and certain methods used by security forces.  It details many grave violations against children, including the appalling situation in Mali, where children allegedly joined armed groups because of poverty.</p><p>  In presenting the report to the UN Security Council on 17 June, the Secretary-General's Special Representative for Children and Armed Conflict, Ms Leila Zerrougui, highlighted the extent of the problem and the progress that has been made to date on the protection of children in conflict.  She announced a campaign to galvanise the efforts of Governments and the UN system to end by 2016 the recruitment and use of children by government and armed forces in conflict. </p><p>  The Government has engaged strongly on this issue, including through the core work of our Irish Aid programme in addressing poverty and under-development, with a focus on some of the poorest countries and communities in Africa.  Ireland has also supported more targeted and specific action, through support for agencies such as UNICEF and the International Criminal Court, and through elements in our bilateral programmes that address the needs of children affected by conflict. </p><p>  In Ireland&rsquo;s new Policy for International Development, &ldquo;One World, One Future&rdquo;, the Government has pledged to increase our engagement on the issue of children in armed conflict.  I have asked officials to examine options for strengthened action in this area.  We are also exploring ways in which we can use our membership of the UN Human Rights Council to support ongoing international efforts to end this exploitation and suffering of children in conflict. </p></reply>

In May 2011, the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina ruled that Article 5 of the Law on JMBG was not in compliance with the Bosnian Constitution because of the inaccurate use of some municipalities&rsquo; names.  The Constitutional Court requested the Parliamentary Assembly to amend this article within six months, but the Parliament&rsquo;s House of Representatives&rsquo; delegates failed to do so.  Since the deadline was not met, a second Constitutional Court decision entered into force, and as of 12 February newborn Bosnian citizens cannot get a JMBG.  The JMBG is required for Bosnian citizens to exercise certain rights such as having access to health insurance and identity documents. </p><p>  This failure to legislate for the express good of the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina is deplorable.  I add my voice to those of the protestors calling on the Parliament to act to rapidly adopt this important legislation.

In this context, permission for foreign military aircraft to land at Irish airports is given only on condition that the aircraft are unarmed, carry no arms, ammunition or explosives and do not engage in intelligence gathering and that the flights in question do not form any part of military exercises or operations. These conditions apply fully to US aircraft.</p><p>  In accordance with international practice, state aircraft passing through Ireland with the permission of the Government are not subject to search or inspection.  Furthermore, the carriage of weapons through Shannon Airport on commercial aircraft is prohibited under the Air Navigation (Carriage of Munitions of War, Weapons and Dangerous Goods) Order, 1973, adopted under the provisions of the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1946, unless an exemption has been obtained by the commercial carrier from my colleague, the Minister for Transport.

Today, forty million more children are enrolled in primary school than at the start of the new century.  However, this progress has been uneven.  For instance, children from conflict-affected states and children from remote rural areas in poor countries account for most of the 61 million children of primary school age who have never attended school.  Moreover, the quality of education has not kept pace with increases in enrolment.  Many children still leave school without acquiring basic numeracy and literacy skills.  Improving access to quality education is an important priority of the Irish Aid programme. In 2012, for instance, the Government provided over &euro;42 million in development assistance for programmes focused on education.  These programmes are concentrated on ensuring access for the most marginalised, as well as on improving quality. </p><p>  In advance of the deadline for achieving the Millennium Development Goals, the United Nations has been holding a series of international consultations on the possible shape of a new framework for global development, beyond 2015.  </p><p>  As part of these consultations, I participated in an international Conference on Education and Development in Brussels in May.  The objective of the meeting was to underline the importance of education in reducing poverty and to discuss how education should be represented in the post-2015 framework.</p><p>  Speakers at the Conference emphasised the need for a continued focus on improving global access to education, particularly for children from the poorest families.  The important role education can play in preventing conflict and improving the resilience of communities affected by conflict or natural disaster was also highlighted.  In my address, I emphasised the need to address the quality of education, and the need to improve accountability at all levels: accountability by donors, partner countries, ministries of education and schools, to the pupils and their parents.</p><p>  Ireland has been centrally involved in discussions to date on a new post-2015 development framework.  During our EU Presidency, Ireland has been instrumental in ensuring a coherent and consistent position across the EU in advance of the United Nations Special Event on the MDGs, which will be held in September.  In presentations I have made at the UN, the OECD and the EU, I have highlighted the importance of education in the fight to eliminate extreme poverty and, therefore, in any framework for the achievement of sustainable development.  I will continue to take this approach.</p></reply>

I have spoken in the past two weeks with both the Secretary State for Northern Ireland, Theresa Villiers MP and NI Justice Minister David Ford.  We have a shared concern about the potential for sectarian violence during the summer marching season.  I re-iterated our view that it is essential that the determinations of the Parades Commission are fully respected and that the Commission itself and the Police Service of Northern Ireland receive full support from everyone.  Apart from the risk to life and the potential for parades linked violence to damage community relations, it would be a real setback if the positive images about the North emerging from the success of the G8 conference were replaced with scenes of riots and attacks on police.  The recent conference organised by the PSNI in Cardiff was not specifically about parades but was about relationships &ndash; relationships between community representatives and between such representatives and the police.  And of course these relationships go to the heart of the parading dilemma just as they go to the heart of the solution to other sources of sectarian division.  The fact that all participants committed themselves, inter alia, to support the police in upholding the rule of law in their communities and to commit to ongoing dialogue throughout the summer even when tensions are high is a very welcome development.  I fully support and join with the leaders of the Northern Ireland Executive and the Chief Constable in their recent call on all political and community representatives to redouble efforts to reduce parade related tensions in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

As the Deputy will be aware, there are now almost 7 million people in need of emergency humanitarian assistance inside Syria, while the number of fatalities as a result of the widespread and indiscriminate violence is in excess of 90,000.  As a result of this crisis there are more than 1.6 million Syrians in neighbouring countries who have been forced to make the dangerous journey out of Syria, with more than 4 million more who have been displaced from their homes within Syria's borders.  With each passing day, the humanitarian situation becomes increasingly desperate.</p><p>  Ireland has been a leader in terms of the international humanitarian response to this crisis.  Only days ago, the Government announced a further humanitarian assistance package of &euro;1.65 million, bringing our overall assistance to help meet the needs arising from this crisis to almost &euro;10 million.  This includes Ireland's pledge of &euro;4.7 million made at the Kuwait Pledging Conference for Syria in January, which was met in full.  This significant support marks us out as one of the most generous contributors in the world to the humanitarian response on a <i>per capita</i> basis.  Ireland's support is being provided through trusted UN agencies, NGO partners and the Red Cross to deliver life saving assistance, including with water, food, shelter and vital medicines, to the most vulnerable and in greatest need as a result of this disaster.</p><p>  At the international level, the Government has consistently raised the dire situation being faced by the people of Syria and the imperative to improve humanitarian access to the worst affected areas.  In this regard, my own visit to al-Zaatari refugee camp in northern Jordan in 2012 and the T&aacute;naiste's visit to Nizip refugee camp in southern Turkey provided further opportunity for Ireland to express our concern about the humanitarian consequences of the Syrian crisis.</p><p>  Throughout our Presidency of the Council of European Union, we have also underlined the gravity of the humanitarian situation and the need to provide urgently needed assistance to all those affected.  At this week's meeting of EU Foreign Ministers in Luxembourg, we encouraged our partners to increase their contributions to the humanitarian response and to respect pledges already made.</p><p>  We welcome the fact that the EU and its Member States, including Ireland, has so far contributed almost &euro;1billion in emergency funding to address the humanitarian crisis, and recently announced an additional &euro;400 million as a response to the deterioration of the situation in the country and the surrounding region.  We also welcome the collective commitment made by G8 leaders who met in Co. Fermanagh last week to provide an additional $1.5 billion in humanitarian assistance.  This is in support of the latest UN appeal for $5.2 billion launched earlier this month and which represented the largest such appeal ever launched by the UN.</p></reply>

I spoke with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Theresa Villiers and commended her on the package which represents a strong commitment by the British Government in support of the work of the Northern Ireland Executive.  I have noted the reference in the economic package to the UK Government and the Northern Ireland Executive working with our Government to examine how we can jointly support economic growth and a genuinely shared society in Northern Ireland.  We will do all we can to take this forward both in the context of ongoing North-South engagement and East-West economic co-operation.</p><p>  I also note the commitment to work with our Government to explore the possibility of creating a reciprocal visa regime whereby the UK would permit visitors from some destinations to enter Northern Ireland and the UK using an Irish visit visa without the need for a separate UK visa.  This would complement the existing visa waiver scheme which is operating in this jurisdiction for visitors from a number of countries and has considerable potential to boost tourism to the island as a whole.</p></reply>

In particular, I welcome the Peace, Security and Cooperation Framework Agreement for the DRC and the Region, which was concluded in Addis Ababa on 24 February, in the presence of the UN Secretary General.  The adoption of the Agreement was welcomed on behalf of the EU in a joint statement by High Representative Catherine Ashton and Development Commissioner, Andris Piebalgs, calling on all parties to continue negotiating in good faith and to refrain from violence.  The European Union will continue to pursue a strategic and comprehensive approach to the crisis in the region, working through political and diplomatic engagement, development cooperation programmes, and support for the United Nations peacekeeping operations.  The EU is also pursuing security sector reform programmes, through the EU Common Security and Defence Policy missions in the DRC.</p><p>  Ireland will also continue to play a constructive role.  We are contributing a number of military observers to the UN Mission.

These consist of offices and official residences of Heads of Mission which provide platforms for our Missions to promote Irish economic interests, provide services to the public and represent Ireland in international organisations.  These premises need to be maintained, repairs are inevitably required from time to time, operating requirements change and it sometimes proves necessary or advantageous to relocate to more economical accommodation.  Total amounts of &euro;2.97 million and &euro;2.70 million were spent for these purposes in 2011 and 2012 respectively.  The bulk of the expenditure over the past two years has been on essential repairs and maintenance; upfront transitional expense involved in relocations to more cost-effective premises which are yielding significant net savings and operating benefits to the State; temporary reconfiguration of office space to accommodate the additional staff required to conduct the EU Presidency; and implementation of expert recommendations for strengthening of security systems.</p><p>  This expenditure was necessary to ensure that Missions have the accommodation necessary to fulfil their responsibilities and present a positive image of Ireland and its potential as a business partner, investment location and tourism destination.</p></reply>

The High Representative for Foreign and Security Policy, Catherine Ashton, welcomed the Ouagadougou Agreement on behalf of the EU in a statement on 18 June.  The situation in Mali was again discussed by EU Foreign Ministers when we met in the Foreign Affairs Council in Luxembourg on Monday, and we adopted Council Conclusions welcoming these latest positive developments and urging the parties to implement the terms of the Agreement. </p><p>  Ireland is also continuing to make a significant national contribution to the efforts to overcome the crisis.  We are contributing eight personnel to the EU Training Mission in Mali.  We are also continuing to respond to the humanitarian needs of those affected by the crisis in Mali and the wider region.  So far in 2013, over &euro;1.8 million has been provided by Ireland for those worst affected by the crisis.  At the International Donor Conference in Brussels in May, Ireland announced assistance of &euro;2.5 million to further support the humanitarian response and recovery efforts in Mali over the next two years.  </p></reply>

Groups of peacekeepers serving with the UNDOF mission have on two occasions been detained for prolonged periods by armed elements.  I condemn all attacks on, or threats against, United Nations peacekeepers, for which there can be no justification.</p><p>  Austria has served for many years in UNDOF but has decided, in the light of current conditions, to withdraw its troops from that operation.  While I have not discussed this with my Austrian counterpart, I fully respect the decision of the Austrian Government. </p><p>  The priority for the United Nations is to strengthen the UNDOF mission, which is now quite exposed as the confrontation between Government and opposition forces in Syria spills over into the Golan Heights area.  As a measure of our support for the United Nations&rsquo; peacekeeping missions, Ireland responded positively to a request received last April to provide personnel for the UNDOF headquarters.  Three members of the Permanent Defence Force were recently deployed to the mission and a fourth member will be deployed to UNDOF in the coming weeks.  I think that there will be particular appreciation on the part of the UN for Ireland&rsquo;s willingness to provide personnel in these difficult and dangerous circumstances.</p></reply>

The persistence of armed militias in many parts of southern and eastern Libya, and the widespread availability of arms in general, continue to pose serious threats to the stability of the state.  Most recently, heavy fighting broke out in Benghazi on June 15th after an unidentified militia attacked government troops, killing five soldiers and a civilian.  A week previously, in one of the most serious incidents since the end of the civil war in 2011, an estimated 35 people died in a separate confrontation near a militia barracks which resulted in the militia in question being expelled.  Such episodes have exposed the problems faced by Prime Minister Zidan and his Government in exerting control over the entire country, particularly in rural and tribal areas where the state has traditionally had little or no presence.  Border security is also critically important given the limited capacity of the Government to control its territory and the possible impact of militants returning from Mali.     On the political front, there are serious concerns, both inside and outside Libya, about the likely implications of the adoption of a recent political exclusion law by the General National Congress which is aimed at banning anyone linked to the Gaddafi regime from participating in government.  It has already resulted in the resignation of the President of the GNC, Mohammed Magarief, and could yet lead to other members of the current Government being forced to resign.  It is a development which does not bode well for overall reconciliation within the country and which has been criticised by the UN for further weakening Libya&rsquo;s already fragile state institutions.  The strong support for this law expressed by various militias, which led them to blockade various Government ministries prior to its adoption, only underlines the urgent need for progress on security sector reform within Libya.  </p><p>  Nevertheless, we must not lose sight of the enormous progress which has been made since the fall of the Gadaffi regime less than two years ago.  The holding of Libya&rsquo;s first democratic elections in July 2012 was a momentous achievement and the new Government has made significant progress in many areas, including the drafting of a new constitution.</p><p>  Ireland and other partners are continuing to offer all possible support and assistance to the Libyan Government and people as the process of transition continues.  The   EU will be shortly deploying a new civilian CSDP mission to assist the Libyan authorities in the area of border management.  The EU has also stated its willingness to negotiate an Association Agreement with Libya to develop a more formal framework for assistance and cooperation.</p><p>  On a bilateral basis,   Ireland is advancing practical cooperation with the new administration in Libya in a number of key strategic areas of mutual interest, including trade, education and health. My Department also continues to work to facilitate political-level contacts with the new Libyan Government.</p></reply>

Successive Governments have not interpreted neutrality as meaning that Ireland should avoid international engagement.  Rather, they have considered that it enhances our capacity to make a direct and significant contribution to the promotion of global peace and stability through the UN, the European Union and in bilateral action.  In common with several other neutral and non-aligned States, Ireland will continue to participate in peace operations authorised by the United Nations, whether these are undertaken under direct UN command or are led by the European Union or by NATO. </p></reply>

This includes settlement goods.  The essential element of voluntary national guidelines already issued by some Member States, and of the EU level guidelines now being considered, is to make clear to importers, wholesalers and retailers that the Israeli settlements in Occupied Palestinian Territory are not located in Israel, and that it would therefore be misleading if goods produced there were labelled, as they reportedly are in some cases, as being &ldquo;Made in Israel&rdquo;.  These are thus guidelines to the correct implementation of already existing EU law.  As such they will apply to all goods produced by settlements.  In all administrations, labelling of goods is a complex matter, involving numerous different Ministries, policy areas and objectives.  At EU level, the EAS is now working through these complex issues with the European Commission to produce draft EU guidelines.  This may take some time &ndash; the UK guidelines in this area were the result of a two year period of consultation. Since this work is ongoing, I cannot predict the details of what will eventually emerge.</p><p>  Mandatory place of origin labelling applies to some types of goods in the EU. For other products, such labelling is not required at all, and where it appears this is a choice of the producer, importer or retailer.  Many goods which do not have to carry place of origin labelling nonetheless do so. </p><p>  No Member State has suggested that the outcome at EU or national level will be to require all goods produced by settlements to be origin labelled.  This would be to introduce a mandatory origin labelling regime for settlement goods alone, which would be disproportionate for such a tiny proportion of goods marketed in the EU.  The intention is that origin labelling, where it appears on a mandatory or voluntary basis, must be accurate.</p></reply>

Under the Lisbon Treaty, the consent of the European Parliament is required before the MFF can be adopted by Council.  As Presidency, we have had the responsibility for negotiating the text of the MFF Regulation and the Inter-Institutional Agreement between the Council, the Commission and the Parliament.  This task has been a challenging one, and the outcome remains critical to our capacity across the EU to begin to address the key challenges of creating jobs and growth.  It is also an urgent task.  Since February we have been engaged in intensive consultations. Informal discussions with the Parliament began soon after the February European Council, leading to several rounds of formal Trilogues between Presidency, Parliament and Commission.  These negotiations were advanced at political level through detailed consultations on 13 May, 28 May, 4 June, 11 June and finally on 18-19 June.  I led the Presidency negotiating team and MEP Alain Lamassoure has the lead for the Parliament&rsquo;s team.  In each case, the negotiators kept their respective institutions appraised of progress.  From an early stage in discussions, it was clear that for the European Parliament, four main issues were critical in securing their consent: Flexibility, a Mid-term Review, Own Resources and Unity of the Budget. </p><p>  Throughout the iterative process we worked through our respective positions on each of those core concerns.  We made substantial progress. </p><p>  On 19 June Mr Lamassoure and I concluded negotiations and agreed a core package, comprising the MFF Regulation and Inter-Institutional Agreement (IIA).  We both agreed that we would recommend that package to our respective institutions.  We are now in the process of discussing the elements of the package both in the Council, and in the European Parliament. </p><p>  I remain hopeful that the package will offer the basis for the final outcome on this important file.  I am also optimistic that this process will conclude under the Irish Presidency.  </p><p>  An additional but important aspect of concluding the MFF, relates to the Amending Budget for 2013.  The linkage between the MFF and the 2013 Draft Amending Budget 2 (DAB 2) was established by the Parliament, and was recognised in the MFF negotiations as a political reality.  The issue, which is one of significant sensitivity, was addressed at a summit meeting of the Presidents of the Parliament, Commission and the rotating Presidency on 6 May.  </p><p>  At the 14 May ECOFIN Council, it was agreed that of the requested &euro;11.2bn, the Council would approve a first tranche of &euro;7.3bn, subject to agreement on the MFF.  This issue will have to be addressed before final adoption of the MFF, and I am confident that we can find a workable arrangement.</p><p>  Both Council and Parliament are now considering the outcome of the MFF negotiations.  That outcome provides extensive flexibility in payment appropriations for the first time, as well as improved arrangements for the special flexibility instruments and a provision for the limited carryover of commitment appropriations.  In addition, there will be a meaningful mid-term review, provisions on the unity of the budget, and a detailed roadmap for future work on reform of Own Resources. </p><p>  All of this together represents a significant step forward.  The agreement of the Parliament and Council would allow us now to move ahead, and to rapidly deliver the spending and programmes that our citizens need and expect: it is about real money for real people and real jobs at a time when they have never been more needed in Europe, particularly by the very many affected by the crisis of youth unemployment. </p><p>  The MFF deal will put in place a robust &euro;960 billion budget for investment that will enable the European economy to grow, to create jobs and to begin to address youth employment.  It is a matter of some urgency across Europe that this major investment is implemented without delay. </p><p>  Ireland will benefit in particular from a strong and well-funded CAP, and from increased funding for competitiveness and jobs, including from the special allocation of &euro;6billion for youth unemployment which we have supported being frontloaded starting in 2014.  We will also benefit from a number of specific and tailored resource instruments, including a special allocation of &euro;100 million for rural development, and a special allocation of &euro;100m for the Border, Midland and Western region.  I am especially satisfied to have been instrumental in ensuring a special allocation of &euro;150m for the PEACE programme. </p><p>  I now look forward to moving beyond the detailed negotiations, and to addressing the major political challenge we share as politicians, whether in Council or Parliament: to ensure that we use every euro of EU resources to address the impact of the crisis and the blight of unemployment  across our European family.  We have no time to lose.</p></reply>

The number of fatalities as a result of the widespread and indiscriminate violence is in excess of 90,000 and there are now almost 7 million people in need of emergency humanitarian assistance inside Syria, many of whom are children.  Fear and uncertainty have forced more than 1.6 million Syrians to flee to neighbouring countries, with more than 4 million more displaced from their homes within Syria's borders.  Ireland's total support in response to this humanitarian crisis is now almost &euro;10 million after the Government recently announced a further assistance package of &euro;1.65 million.  This makes Ireland one of the most generous contributors in the world to the humanitarian response on a <i>per capita</i> basis.  Ireland's total support includes the pledge of &euro;4.7 million made at the Kuwait Pledging Conference for Syria in January, which was met in full. Ireland's humanitarian assistance is being provided through trusted UN agencies, NGO partners and the Red Cross to deliver life saving support, including with water, food, shelter and vital medicines, to the most vulnerable and in greatest need as a result of this disaster. </p><p>  Humanitarian access remains a serious concern.  Excessive controls on aid agencies working in the country, restrictions imposed by the Assad regime, the fragmentation of the armed opposition and the intensity of military confrontations make it very difficult to access populations in need of humanitarian assistance.  We must work together to improve access for humanitarian agencies.  Where it is proving too difficult to reach those most in need simply through cross-line activities, we must consider alternative forms of aid delivery, including the cross border delivery of assistance. </p><p>  Earlier this month, Under-Secretary-General and Emergency Relief Coordinator Valerie Amos and United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay issued a joint statement in relation to the civilians trapped and wounded in the town of Al-Qusayr.  In their statement they underlined that all parties must immediately halt all actions that might result in civilian loss of life and damage, and to permit civilians to move to safer areas.  Humanitarian agencies must be allowed to evacuate the wounded and provide life-saving treatment and supplies. </p><p>  At the G8 Summit last week, it was again emphasised that all humanitarian action takes place in a manner consistent with humanitarian principles and international law.  Those suffering the consequences of hunger and conflict throughout the world benefit from our respect for the core principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality, and independence.  As Emergency Relief Coordinator Valerie Amos has also underlined, we must caution against calls for military interventions in support of humanitarian actions which may place vulnerable people and aid workers at further risk. </p><p>  In relation to calls which have been made for the establishment of a no-fly zone over Syria, this would obviously necessitate broad international agreement and could only be authorised through a UN Security Council Resolution specifically mandating such a step.  Regrettably, the Security Council has not been able to agree any Resolution on Syria since the conflict erupted in March 2011 and it appears most unlikely that the political will exists within the Council at present to reach agreement on such a proposal. </p><p>  I very much welcome US and Russian efforts to convene a peace conference in Geneva in the coming weeks.  If the suffering arising from this conflict is to be alleviated then clearly, more must be more done to reduce the violence and persuade all sides in Syria to commit to peace talks and the promotion of a democratic transition.  The diplomatic efforts to convene the Geneva II conference will hopefully be considerably advanced by last week's agreement by the G8 in Enniskillen on the urgent need for a political solution.</p></reply>

In 2012, the Government provided a total of &euro;639 million for Official Development Assistance.  Ireland&rsquo;s assistance is directed to development programmes and emergency humanitarian assistance in over eighty of the world&rsquo;s least developed countries.  As Minister of State with responsibility for Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme, I am aware that Irish-based aid agencies and their partners operate in some of the most sensitive and insecure locations in the world.  The Government strongly supports and promotes the efforts taken by many of these organisations to develop solid security management plans and to employ dedicated security professionals to help train staff and ensure that they are adequately protected during the course of their work.  </p><p>  I am very conscious of the need to ensure that Ireland's assistance continues to be delivered in most efficient and effective manner and that it makes a real difference in the lives of the poorest and most vulnerable.  The OECD Development Assistance Committee has highlighted Ireland as a highly effective donor and noted the high quality of our aid programme.  I am committed to ensuring that we maintain these high standards.</p><p>  To ensure that Irish Aid support is effectively delivered across all our locations, we work in partnership with national governments, local communities, NGOs, and other key multilateral partners such as the United Nations and European Union.  All agencies that are in receipt of our funding are subject to appraisal and regular internal and external monitoring to ensure that Irish aid is used in the effective and efficient manner and that it reaches the intended beneficiaries.</p></reply>

A major international Conference on Somalia was convened in London on 7 May and was attended by representatives of more than 50 countries and international organisations.  Ireland was represented by the Minister of State for Trade and Development, Mr. Joe Costello T.D.  The Conference discussed a wide range of issues relating to ongoing efforts to consolidate lasting peace and stability in Somalia after twenty years of destructive conflict, underdevelopment, and lawlessness.  A further international conference on Somalia will be organised by the European Union, in Brussels later this year.   The EU is implementing a comprehensive Strategy for the Horn of Africa which was adopted in 2011 and which covers the entire region, including Somalia.  It addresses all dimensions of the crisis including conflict, underdevelopment, and issues related to governance and human rights.   </p><p>  The continuing fragility in Somalia was tragically underlined by the attack on the UN Compound in Mogadishu last week by the Al Shabaab terrorist group, which claimed 15 lives.  </p><p>  The EU&rsquo;s support in the area of security includes our funding for the African Union peacekeeping mission, and direct engagement through a number of Common Security and Defence Policy Missions including the EU Training Mission, EUTM Somalia, which is building the capacity of the Somali National Security Forces to enable them to take over responsibility for security and law and order.</p><p>  Ireland is providing the Commander and a significant contingent of personnel for EUTM Somalia.

I refer the Deputy to my previous replies of 20 February and 16 May on the matter. Concerns regarding this case, which have been repeatedly expressed by Ireland and its partners, were borne out by the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) on 30 April 2013, which ruled that Ms Tymoshenko had been unlawfully detained. As the Deputy is aware, High Representative Catherine Ashton and Commissioner Stefan F&uuml;le issued a joint statement in response to this judgment, which urged the Ukrainian authorities to reconsider Ms Tymoshenko&rsquo;s imprisonment and to implement fully all rulings of the ECHR.   </p><p>  The EU&rsquo;s position, as set out in the Conclusions of the 10 December 2012 Foreign Affairs Council and in the joint statement of the EU-Ukraine Summit of 25 February 2013, is clear: that Ukraine must address the issue of selective justice convincingly if progress is to be made towards signature of the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement at the Eastern Partnership Summit in Vilnius in November. The European Parliament&rsquo;s monitoring mission to Ukraine, which is led by the former President of Poland, Mr Aleksander Kwa&oelig;niewski, and the former President of the European Parliament, Mr Pat Cox, has been engaging actively with the Ukrainian authorities. While there have been some positive developments, including the release of former Interior Minister Yuriy Lutsenko in April, Ireland would very much like to see further steps taken by the Ukrainian authorities that would make signature of the Association Agreement possible, including, crucially, addressing the issue of selective justice.</p></reply>

The total value of merchandise exports in 2012 was &euro;92 billion, representing an increase of 3.1% on the 2010 figure (&euro;89 billion), while services exports for 2012 reached &euro;90 billion; an increase of 21% on the 2010 figure (&euro;74 billion). The markets which recorded the highest percentage increase for merchandise exports, over the period 2010 to 2012, were Tonga, Guam, Uzbekistan, Swaziland, Maldives, Nepal, Honduras, Guinea, Namibia and Nicaragua. Ranging between 333% and 11,200%, the increases were greater than for our more established trading partners. However, it should be noted that these increases were from much lower bases and the combined total of exports to these countries accounted for less than .03% of our total merchandise exports.    </p><p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Government Trade, Tourism and Investment Strategy identifies 27 priority markets, including those with the best prospects for increased trade. Local market teams headed by our Ambassadors are in place in these markets and their work is overseen by the high level Export Trade Council, which I chair. </p><p>  Our priority markets include the UK, USA and many of our Eurozone partners, which are key markets for Ireland. The Government is also fully committed to developing and expanding engagement with key high potential markets such as the BRICS countries - Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa- which are all among our priority markets. </p><p>  Our top 10 merchandise export markets by value in 2012 were, in fact, all priority markets: the United States, UK, Belgium, Germany, France, Switzerland, Netherlands, Spain, Italy and Japan. Our exports to a number of these countries increased strongly between 2010 and 2012, with notable growth in exports to Switzerland (42%), Japan (20%), Germany (17%), United Kingdom (10%) and the Netherlands (8%).

We see enlargement as a vital tool for promoting reform, democracy and stability in Europe. During our Presidency we have worked to facilitate progress for all candidates and prospective candidates, based on an enlargement policy focussed on credibility and conditionality. </p><p>  I am pleased that discussions on enlargement and the Western Balkans feature at the Foreign Affairs Council, General Affairs Council and European Council this week. Following substantial progress in Serbia and Kosovo, I am confident that decisions will be taken on opening accession negotiations with Serbia and Stabilisation and Association Agreement negotiations with Kosovo. </p><p>  The Irish Presidency has opened a negotiating Chapter with Montenegro. We have also overseen progress on the important rule of law Chapters (23 and 24). </p><p>  On Turkey, the Irish Presidency has worked hard to reinvigorate the accession process through preparing the ground for the opening of the first negotiating Chapter in three years (22 &ndash; Regional Policy and coordination of structural instruments). These efforts will continue until the end of our Presidency.  While the recent unrest in Turkey has been a cause for deep concern, Ireland takes the view that greater EU engagement with Turkey is necessary.  The protests show Turkey needs further reforms and we believe the accession process is the best way to deliver these. </p><p>  For Iceland, no further progress is expected during our Presidency following the new government&rsquo;s decision to halt the accession process ahead of a referendum on accession. It is the democratic right of the new government in Iceland, in consultation with the people, to decide if they wish to continue accession negotiations, and we must respect their choice. </p><p>  Following the political crisis in Macedonia in the early months of this year, a decision is not anticipated on opening accession negotiations during our Presidency. However it will be important for the EU to remain engaged with Macedonia in the coming months. </p><p>  Likewise, a decision on granting candidate status to Albania is not anticipated at this time, as there has been little progress on the reforms required to achieve this. The conduct of the elections there last Sunday will be a consideration when the Council comes to review Albania&rsquo;s application for membership again in December. </p><p>  Reforms and progress have also been lacking in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Foreign Affairs Council next month should provide an opportunity for the EU to consider its overall approach to Bosnia and Herzegovina. </p><p>  Finally, the Irish Presidency has overseen the final stages of Croatia&rsquo;s accession process. Ireland very much looks forward to welcoming Croatia as the EU&rsquo;s newest Member State on 1 July, and I am pleased and honoured to be attending the accession celebrations in Zagreb on the final day of Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency on 30 June.</p></reply>

Depending on how events unfold, the outcome of that debate may have consequences for all Member States, not least among them, for Ireland. However undoubtedly, the most profound consequences would be for the UK itself, which must be allowed the time and space to take the course of action that it feels in its best interest. The place of the UK within the EU is first and foremost a matter for the British Government and people, as appropriate. While there have been many contributions to the debate on the UK&rsquo;s future relationship with the EU, the question has not been formally raised within the European Union.    </p><p>  The Treaty of Lisbon included a provision - Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union &ndash; which explicitly provides for a situation in which a Member State might seek to withdraw from the Union. It is only when a Member State makes such an application that the issues would be formally considered. Article 50 has never been invoked and I strongly hope that this remains the case. </p><p>  I have made clear, many times, my strong preference for the UK to remain a strong and influential partner within the European Union. I am convinced that the UK&rsquo;s interests are best served by their remaining an active member of the EU. The European Union is better and stronger with the UK in it. It is also in Ireland&rsquo;s interests that the UK remains a fully committed member of the EU. They remain our most important trading partner and are an important ally on many aspects of EU policy. </p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s focus, both as Presidency and nationally, has been on ensuring that the Union is properly equipped to the meet the current and future challenges facing the Union. To this end, much work has already been done to deal with the complex and exceptional economic challenges we have faced. We will continue to work with EU partners, including the UK, to guide the European Union back to the path of sustainable economic growth and job creation.</p></reply>

As the Deputy is aware, African countries have historically faced many difficulties, including food insecurity, poverty, protracted conflict, environmental degradation, weak government capacity, unequal global trading relationships, severe infrastructural weaknesses, poor governance, debt and the effects of HIV/AIDS.    </p><p>  In an effort to help the countries of the continent confront these far-reaching challenges, we allocate some 80% of Ireland&rsquo;s development assistance to Africa.  Our missions in Africa monitor developments, report to the Government, and manage our political and economic relations and humanitarian and development programmes.  Ireland also has excellent relations with its NGO partners which are a direct and reliable source of information regarding the level of humanitarian risk African countries face at any particular time.  My Department regularly reviews these various sources of information and ensures that key messages are given voice at an international level where the opportunity arises.</p><p>  Ireland continues to provide strong support to the reform of the international humanitarian system. Important lessons have been learned since the Asian Tsunami in 2004 and major steps have been taken to improve the effectiveness, predictability and accountability of the system as a whole. </p><p>  Together with other like-minded donor countries, we have worked particularly closely with the UN&rsquo;s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) to put in place new systems to improve the way in which aid is delivered and to ensure that coordination on the ground is improved through enhanced monitoring systems.  </p><p>  At EU level, there have also been improvements in coordination between Member States and the European Commission, which together constitute the largest donor of development assistance in the world.  The European Consensus on Humanitarian Aid, adopted in December 2007, commits the EU to working to provide an emergency response based on need and to upholding the principles of good humanitarian practice: humanity, neutrality, independence and impartiality.  Under our EU Presidency, Ireland is currently chairing the Council Working Party on Humanitarian Aid and Food Assistance and continues to work to enhance coordination in particular through the sharing of information at EU level in order to ensure a timely and effective response to a given crisis. </p><p>  Africa faces many challenges. Nevertheless, the continent is showing real progress towards sustainable change. In order to maintain this positive momentum and avoid losing the positive gains from development investment over the years, Ireland will continue to work in partnership with African countries to respond quickly to humanitarian challenges when they occur.</p></reply>

I am following closely developments in the talks underway and have welcomed the agreement reached last month on the land reform element of these negotiations as a very positive step forward.  I wish the parties success in reaching agreement on the other important items remaining on their agenda so that a final comprehensive peace agreement can be secured.   </p><p>  The peace process is also supported by the European Union and the wider international community.  The EU High Representative, Catherine Ashton, warmly welcomed the progress reached last month on the land reform agreement, expressing the hope that this will add fresh impetus to the negotiations with a view to the rapid conclusion of a final peace agreement. She commended the parties to the talks for their commitment to the peace process and called on them to continue to negotiate and cooperate in a spirit of goodwill in order to give the Colombian people the peace that they deserve.  </p><p>  More generally, the European Union has made clear its readiness to provide support for activities in Colombia that promote peace, truth, justice, reparation and reconciliation.  Ireland fully supports this approach.  When I met with Colombia&rsquo;s President Santos earlier this year I assured him that Ireland wishes the negotiators success in this important process and I told him that we stand ready, within available means, to share our experiences if invited to do so by the parties to the process.</p><p>  I welcome that the United Nations is also very supportive of the peace process. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon welcomed last month&rsquo;s agreement on land reform, and hopes that the parties to the talks will have further success in their efforts to reach agreement on the remaining issues. The United Nations Development Programme is playing a helpful role in this process by facilitating, together with Colombian partners and at the request of the parties to the talks, a series of consultations with civil society on themes relating to the peace process.  </p><p>  I am also keeping in touch with the views of various representatives of civil society on the process underway. At the recent Universal Periodic Review of Colombia at the United Nations Human Rights Council, Ireland expressed our strong support for the Colombian peace process and encouraged all parties to ensure adequate space for civil society actors in the process, paying special attention to the participation of women and indigenous communities.</p></reply>

With just a few days to go to the end of the Presidency we can note substantial progress in fulfilling these objectives and I can assure the Deputy that we will continue to work intensively to drive further progress.  </p><p>  The scourge of youth unemployment is the single greatest challenge facing Europe today. The Presidency secured early agreement on the Youth Guarantee which will provide jobless young Europeans with an opportunity to secure further education or training to better prepare them for the employment market. Its implementation will be supported by the decision of the European Council to allocate &euro;6 billion to a new Youth Employment Initiative.  As part of its efforts to underpin financial and economic stability in the European Union, the Presidency also secured agreement on two key elements of the Banking union proposals: the Capital Requirements Directive and the Single Supervisory Mechanism. Right up to the end of our Presidency we are working to make as much progress as we can on the Bank Resolution and Recovery Directive.  Strong progress has also been made in financial regulation files aimed at strengthening consumer protection and on proposals to combat VAT fraud.  </p><p>  To help restore stability and build solid foundations for economic recovery, the Presidency has secured agreement on the &#8220;Two-Pack&#8221; legislation which strengthens budgetary surveillance and coordination within the euro area.  It has also introduced more effective arrangements for the management of the European Semester process of economic and budgetary coordination.    </p><p>  Modernising the Single Market and reducing the administrative burden for SMEs have been priorities for Ireland as Presidency.  Agreement has been reached on files including the Accounting Directive,<b></b>the<b></b>Unified Patent Court, and the Union Customs Code<b></b>which will contribute to cutting red tape for business, facilitating growth and job creation. The Presidency also reached agreement on an amended Directive on re-use of Public Sector Information which offers new opportunities for business. One of the major achievements in the Single Market area is political agreement with the European Parliament on the updated Professional qualifications Directive.   </p><p>  One of the Presidency's strongest achievements to date has been brokering agreement<b></b>on the EU's Common Fisheries Policy reform. The Presidency reached a general approach on the Common Agriculture Policy reform<b></b>and is pushing ahead this week at the AgriFish Council to secure agreement on the package.  </p><p><b></b>External trade has been high on our agenda as a means of sustaining growth and employment in Europe. We have fulfilled one of our top priorities - securing a mandate for the start of negotiations on a Trade and Investment Partnership with the US.<b></b></p><p>  We also launched negotiations on a free trade agreement with Japan.  </p><p>  The Presidency has secured agreement or made progress on a wide range of other issues including protecting citizens from serious cross-border threats to health, strengthening provisions on water quality in the EU, improving the safety of workers in offshore oil and gas prospection, protecting workers in contact with electromagnetic fields, strengthening safety on Europe's roads through legislation on HGV tachographs or ban of cadmium and mercury in batteries.</p><p>  In the area of justice and home affairs the Presidency has delivered agreements aimed at strengthening EU's external borders and internal border security - the Schengen Governance Package and European Border Surveillance System (EUROSUR). The Presidency has also secured agreement with the European parliament on a new Directive which guarantees those suspected or accused of a crime the right to access a lawyer. Ireland successfully negotiated an agreement with the European Parliament on the European Protection Order<b></b>that improves the protection of victims of domestic violence. Breakthrough was reached on the final two legislative measures forming part of the Common European Asylum System.</p><p>  This Presidency has also worked closely with the European External Action Service and the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy on addressing current foreign policy issues, while also supporting democracy and advancing human rights, and working to strongly advance the EU's development aid agenda.  </p><p>  The Government will spare no effort in the final days of our Presidency to deliver the results set in our Presidency programme. We remain firmly committed to ensuring that our Presidency leaves a positive and lasting legacy, and tangible results contributing to stability, jobs and growth. </p><p>  One of the key issues is of course finalisation of the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) which provides for budgetary framework of the European Union for the next seven years and will provide &euro;960bn to sustain jobs and growth in Europe. </p><p>  Early next week we will publish a report setting out in detail the results of the Irish Presidency and I invite this House to judge for themselves the extent to which Ireland has realised the objectives we set ourselves at the start of the Presidency.</p></reply>

The Government have also attached great importance to providing for future flows of migration between Ireland and the United States through the extension of the so called E3 visa scheme to include Irish citizens.In this context, we very much welcomed the publication this springtime of the US Senate&rsquo;s Border Security, Economic Opportunity and Immigration Modernization Bill which provides for reform of the US immigration system.     </p><p>  The bill is progressing through the Senate system and on May 21, the Senate Judiciary Committee completed its detailed examination of proposals for comprehensive reform of the US immigration system as set out in Bill.  The Bill has gone forward for further debate by the full Senate and it is expected debates will continue over the coming weeks.</p><p>  The comprehensive draft legislation, which was drafted over several months by a bi-partisan group of eight US Senators, includes provisions that would legalise the status of thousands of undocumented Irish people and provide a path to permanent residency.  It also provides for future flows of legal migration between Ireland and the US via the proposed E-3 visa. </p><p>  The Bill is a very positive development.  Its provisions, if adopted, would help to end the great hardship and uncertainty faced by undocumented Irish in the US and their families here in Ireland.  The inclusion of a new provision to allow several thousand Irish citizens to legally avail of employment opportunities in the US every year is also particularly welcome.  </p><p>  It is important to recall that the overall issues involved are complex and sensitive ones within the US political system.  Our Embassy in Washington continues to closely follow developments and lobby as necessary, in keeping with the approach we have adopted over many years in our pursuit of a resolution of the situation facing the undocumented in the United States.    </p><p>  I have recently written to Secretary of State John Kerry in relation to immigration reform.  I have also discussed these issues recently with Senator Patrick Leahy, Chair of the Senate&rsquo;s Judiciary Committee and I intend to visit Washington DC in the coming weeks to reinforce the Irish Government&rsquo;s interest in all aspects of immigration reform.   </p><p>  I would like to reiterate my appreciation for the active support we continue to receive from a number of Irish community organisations, including the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform, the Chicago Celts and the Ancient Order of Hibernians.</p></reply>

At the time that this investment product was purchased by Credit Unions, there was no additional guarantee provided by the State.

In this context, &#8220;Principal Object&#8221; is defined as the settlor's spouse, civil partner, child, child of a civil partner or child of a pre-deceased child. The assets are chargeable to Discretionary Trust Tax while they remain in a Discretionary Trust.    Discretionary Trust Tax is chargeable as follows:</p><p>(i) A once-off 6% charge on the value of the assets in a trust</p><p>  Where the trust is created during the lifetime of the settlor the tax becomes chargeable at the date of death of the settlor, or, if later, when the youngest &#8220;Principal Object&#8221; of the trust attains the age of 21 years.</p><p>(ii) An annual 1% charge arising on 31 December of each year on the value of the assets of the trust at that date (assuming there are no Principal Objects under the age of 21 years). </p><p>  This 1% charge does not apply in a year where 31 December occurs in the twelve months immediately following the date on which the 6% charge arose. </p><p>  Discretionary Trust Tax returns (Form IT4 for the 6% initial charge and Form IT32 for the 1% annual charge) must be filed together with payment of the tax due, within these time limits:</p><p>- For the initial once-off charge; within 4 months of the due date.</p><p>- For the annual 1% charge; within 4 months of 31 December of each year.</p><p>  A breakdown between the yield of discretionary trust tax from the once off charge and the annual tax is not available. But, based on an understanding that the bulk of the yield is derived from the annual tax and, on the basis of collection trend to date, it is estimated that the full year yield to the Exchequer from the suggested increases in the rates of 1% in the once-off charge and 0.5% in the annual charge would be of the order of &euro;0.5 million. </p><p>  This estimate is provisional and subject to revision.</p><p>  It should be noted that this estimate is based upon an assumption that there would be no behavioural impact of this change, which could lead to a less than expected impact on Exchequer yield.

In 2010, the UK Government introduced a personal allowance income limit which was set at &pound;100,000 per annum. Once an individual's income exceeds the income limit threshold of &euro;100,000, their personal allowance is reduced by &pound;1 for every &pound;2 of earnings in excess of &euro;100,000.   </p><p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Programme for Government states that as part of our fiscal strategy, the Government will   <i>maintain the current rates of income tax together with bands and credits. We will not increase the top marginal rates of taxes on income.</i></p><p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the estimated full year yield to the Exchequer, estimated by reference to 2013 incomes, of abolishing the main personal and employee tax credits for income earners earning in excess of &euro;100,000 would be of the order of &euro;500  million.</p></reply>

Under EU and domestic VAT rules traders who are registered for VAT collect VAT on the goods and services that they sell.  In turn such traders are entitled to recover the VAT they incur on their business inputs used in the purchase or production of goods or delivery of services.  Consequently, if there is a decrease in value at any stage in the process the trader is entitled to a refund of the excess of VAT incurred over that collected.</p><p>  In this case, where a retailer is in a situation of net VAT gain as a result of below cost selling, this is not a loss to the Exchequer or an additional benefit to the retailer, it is merely how VAT is charged.</p><p>  With regard to the reintroduction of the groceries order on alcohol, I am informed by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation that prices in Ireland are generally not subject to control.

The minimum standards for participation are stated in the Contract notice/ eTenders advertisement. For school building projects the miniumum turnover is not set at &euro;400,000; it is determined individually for each school building project and generally set at a level which takes into account the contract size and duration. </p><p>  For less complex projects of a small to medium scale, the open procedure is generally used and all contractors meeting the minimum standards are entitled to submit a tender (thus facilitating the inclusion of small to medium enterprises and those with no experience in educational projects).</p><p>  For larger or more complex projects, where it is considered that pre-qualification of contractors is warranted, the Restricted procedure is normally used. In the   Restricted procedure, there is an intermediary qualification stage during which the numbers of applicants is reduced (or restricted) to a specified amount (normally 10). The criteria for suitability assessment, which are taken from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's Capital Management Works Framework, include company turnover, insurances, capacity to obtain a bond, personnel for the project, previous experience, and Health and Safety competence. </p><p>Guidance on this process and standard questionnaires used are available on my Department's website. </p><p>  In any procurement process my Department adheres to the rules and guidelines set down by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the EU Commission in relation to public procurement.

The initial allocations of teaching resources to schools under the GAM was based on the enrolments in the schools as at 30 September 2003.  Notwithstanding the changes in demographics, the GAM allocations for individual schools remained largely unchanged over the years until the process was reformed and streamlined for the 2012/13 school year.  The changes that were made were not designed as a savings measure but instead to facilitate the updating of the GAM allocations for individual schools which had not being done, in many cases, for nearly a decade and also to facilitate the operation of the teacher allocation and redeployment process.</p><p>  Resource hours are allocated by the NCSE as support for pupils with low incidence special needs.  This is typically done in June of each year with allocations also being made later in the year.  In order to facilitate the operation of the teacher allocation and redeployment process a network of permanent resource posts were allocated to base primary schools.  In the 2012/13 school year, 85% of all NCSE approved resource teaching hours were allocated to schools that had resource base posts.

There were a plethora of long-standing clustering arrangements in place which were not the most practical, efficient or cost effective way to allocate resources.  The new arrangements introduced in the current school year are designed to address the limitations of the previous arrangements.  Under the reforms to the teacher allocation process introduced for the current school year, schools were empowered to cluster and arrange their General Allocation Model resources in a manner that best suits their local needs, including in a manner that reduces travel between schools.  This school led process has resulted in over 97% of the overall GAM/EAL allocation being in full-time stand-alone or shared posts.</p><p>  The new arrangements relating to resource hours for individual pupils involved the allocation of a network of permanent posts in base schools and again are designed to make the system work more smoothly at school level.  85% of all NCSE approved resource teaching hours in the 2012/13 school year were allocated to schools that had resource base posts.  The staffing arrangements for the coming school year 2013/14 are outlined in Circular 0013/2013 which is available on the Department website.  When the allocation and redeployment process is completed later in the Summer schools that have complied with the arrangements outlined in the circular will be given some discretion to operate, where possible, their own temporary local arrangements in relation to the day to day work arrangements of teachers in full-time shared posts.  These arrangements are aimed at minimising any time lost in travelling between schools.</p></reply>

The scheme was extended in recent years to facilitate tuition for children awaiting a suitable educational placement and also to provide early educational intervention for preschool children with autism.</p><p>I wish to advise the Deputy that allocations to siblings under the Home Tuition scheme are reflective of the school grouping principle. This is where one teacher is allocated to a class of six pupils at the appropriate educational level, primary or post primary.  Accordingly, it is considered appropriate, as in a school situation, that a tutor can provide tuition at the appropriate educational level to more than one sibling at that level simultaneously in the home.</p><p>  The Deputy will be also aware that the NCSE is responsible for the provision of a range of educational services at local and national level for students with special educational needs. In particular, its network of Special Education Needs Organisers (SENOs) co-ordinates special needs education provision at local level and arranges for the delivery of special educational services. The SENOs act as single points of contact for parents of students with special educational needs. Another specific function of the SENO is to identify appropriate educational placements for children with special educational needs and SENOs are a valuable source of support to parents who are actively sourcing a placement for their children.</p></reply>

This includes provision for 10,575 Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) and nearly 10,000 Learning Support and Resource Teachers. These resources have been protected despite the ongoing severe financial position.</p><p>  Whereas the allocations of SNA support for individual schools may change each year in line with a schools enrolment of children with care needs, there has been no reduction to the overall number of SNA posts being provided for schools for the coming school year. This provision remains at 10,575 posts, which will ensure that all children who qualify for access to SNA support for the coming school year will receive access to such support.</p><p>  The total number of SNA posts allocated to schools for the 2012/13 school year was 10,487 posts. For the 2011/12 school year it was 10,320 posts. It is therefore estimated that there will be sufficient SNA posts to provide access to SNA support for all children who require such support in the coming school year.</p><p>  In relation to the allocation of resource teaching support for schools from September 2013, demand for support has risen again this year, due to a combination of demographic growth and increased assessments.</p><p>  Despite the fact that the overall number of posts available to the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) for allocation to schools had been maintained at existing levels, the allocations announced by the NCSE last week were reduced to take into account of the growth in demand, within the maintained number of posts, in order to ensure that equivalent allocations could be made for all qualifying children.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that I announced yesterday that I have now authorised the NCSE to retain the level of resource teaching allocations which can be provided for students with special educational needs to the 2012/13 levels. This will mean that there will not now be any reduction to resource teaching time for children over the level which applied last year.  I also committed to ensuring that the resources which will be required to ensure that the allocations can be made to schools at existing levels will be provided, including resources required to meet any late demand expected to arise between now and the start of the school year. The NCSE will shortly publish revised details of the Resource Teaching allocations for all schools, based on existing allocation levels, and will be advising schools of their revised allocations in the coming days. In the longer term, it is proposed to develop new allocations system to improve how we provide our allocations to school.  </p><p>  I am concerned that the scale of increased demand for resource teachers this year, if it were to continue, would make the current system unsustainable.  I am asking the NCSE to consider the reasons for the unprecedented 12 per cent rise in applications for resource teacher support this year, which compares with an annual 1.3 per cent increase in the number of students attending school in the current year.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that the NCSE recently published comprehensive policy advice on Supporting Students with Special Educational Needs in Schools. I have, as suggested by the Report, requested the NCSE to establish a Working Group to develop a proposal, for consideration, for a `tailored' allocation model, which will underpin a new allocation system for teaching supports for children with Special Educational Needs based on the profiled educational needs of children in schools.</p><p>  It will report to me in September on the progress of its work, to develop advice on how to reform the way the substantial additional educational resources for pupils with special educational needs are allocated in the school system.</p><p>  In the interim, I wish to ensure that children will not be disadvantaged while we move towards a new model which will ensure greater fairness and quality of education for children with special educational needs. That is why I have made the decision to maintain the existing allocation levels this year.</p></reply>

I have, as suggested by the Report, requested the NCSE to establish a Working Group to develop a proposal, for consideration, for a `tailored' allocation model, which will underpin a new allocation system for teaching supports for children with Special Educational Needs based on the profiled educational needs of children in schools.</p><p>The Working Group will report to me in September on the progress of its work, to develop advice on how to reform the way the substantial additional educational resources for pupils with special educational needs are allocated in the school system.</p><p>  In the interim, I wish to ensure that children will not be disadvantaged while we move towards a new model which will ensure greater fairness and quality of education for children with special educational needs. That is why I have made the decision to maintain the existing allocation levels this year.</p></reply>

It is an important programme, especially given the significant changes that have occurred in rental values following the economic downturn of recent years. The revaluation process is the mechanism whereby economic changes that take place in the property market are reflected in the valuation lists for rates purposes and in individual ratepayers&rsquo; rates liabilities. The purpose of a revaluation is to distribute commercial rates liabilities more equitably among ratepayers based on up-to-date values. Following revaluation, there will be a much closer relationship between rental value and commercial rates liability. Even though property values have fallen generally, some ratepayers will gain while others will lose from the process of redistribution but, overall, revaluation results in a fairer distribution of the rates burden.</p><p>  Under Irish law, there is a distinct separation of function between the valuation of rateable property and the setting and collection of commercial rates. The amount of rates payable by a ratepayer in any calendar year is a product of the valuation of that property determined by the Valuation Office and the annual rate on valuation (ARV) set annually by the elected members of the rating authority. Revaluation is the mechanism whereby movements in property valuations as a result of economic factors are reflected in valuation lists. Following the first revaluation in each area, the Valuation Act 2001 provides for subsequent, recurring revaluations to be carried out at intervals of a minimum of 5 years and no later than 10 years. Accordingly individual valuations are fixed for a 5-10 year period. On the other hand the ARV can, as determined by the elected members of the rating authority, vary from year to year and therefore so can the amount of rates payable annually.</p><p>  Valuations reflect the value of all individual properties in particular rating authority areas at the statutory valuation date (28th October 2011 for Waterford). Movements in valuations since the last date by which valuations were set (1988) reflect the relative changes to rental values within and between sectors such as retail, industrial and hospitality between 1988 and 2011. Accordingly some businesses will have an increase in their rates liability while others will experience a decrease following revaluation. </p><p>  In relation to particular cases there is a well established statutory process whereby a ratepayer, if he or she considers that the proposed valuation or any of the details contained in the Proposed Valuation Certificate are incorrect, can make representations to the Valuation Manager.</p><p>  In keeping with the principle of separation of function between the valuation of rateable property and the setting and collection of commercial rates the imposition of limits on the amount of rates that a rating authority can raise is generally a matter for decision by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and does not come within the competence of the Commissioner of Valuation whose sole responsibility lies in administering the system of rateable valuation as underpinned by the Valuation Act, 2001. However, in so far as the valuation legislation is concerned, there is a specific provision in the 2001 Act which allows the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to make an order requiring a rating authority to exercise its powers to make rates in such a manner that it does not exceed the amount of rates liable to be paid to it in the first year following a revaluation except for any increase determined by the consumer price index.</p><p>  The application of a moratorium to a revaluation because of local authority amalgamation considerations is not provided for under the Valuation Act, 2001, as the application of such an option would not affect the valuation process. The Government&rsquo;s Action Programme for Effective Local Government, Putting People First, indicates that in the context of reorganisation of local governance structures, the proposed new municipal districts will provide an opportunity to achieve a more coherent approach to rates and charges on a county-wide basis, having regard to funding requirements and the need to support employment and business competitiveness.</p><p>  The Action Programme proposes rates harmonisation to cater for differences between Annual Rates on Valuation (ARVs) of towns and counties.  The approach of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to rates harmonisation will seek to ensure, that harmonisation does not lead to significant net loss of revenue in individual counties with consequential implications for services, and that any change in rates does not impact negatively on businesses and employment.  It is important that local government reform drives down costs to business in order to protect existing jobs and sustain our economic competitiveness. </p><p>  Definitive details, arrangements and procedures in relation to the funding of district level functions, and financial relationships between district and county levels, will be developed in the context of the new local government funding arrangements generally, implementation of the new sub-county system and preparation of the legislation in relation to the reform programme.</p></reply>

While it is far too early to anticipate the eventual negotiated outcome<b></b>of the Agreement, the scope of the Council's negotiating directives to the EU Commission<b></b>is sufficiently<b></b>  wide to maximise the potential benefits of an Agreement for the EU and its Member States.</p><p>  According to assessments made by the EU Commission and other European bodies, a comprehensive Trade and Investment Partnership could over time boost EU GDP by 0.5% per annum and help create approximately 400,000 jobs in the EU.  This would be equivalent to at least &euro;86 billion of added annual income for the EU economy. Given the current very low level of economic growth in the EU and in Ireland, this will be a significant injection of economic activity and consequently of jobs.  Based on those assessments, if Ireland simply benefited in proportion to the size of our economy within the EU, a comprehensive trade and investment partnership could over time provide gains to Ireland in the order of &euro;800million per annum in increased GDP, and 4000 new jobs.</p><p>  An independent study by the London-based Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR), entitled 'Reducing Barriers to Transatlantic Trade', suggests the EU's economy could benefit by &euro;119 billion a year, up to 80% of which would come from cutting unnecessary costs imposed on business by having to comply with two separate sets of rules, and from liberalising trade in services and creating new access for exporters into the huge public procurement market in the U.S.</p><p>  While it is not possible to estimate in detail the impact on Ireland until there is greater clarity about any exchange of offers, the scale of the possible long term gains will have a positive impact on Ireland given our close trading and investment relationship with the U.S. In addition, many Irish exporters are part of European supply chains where their exports to the UK, Germany or elsewhere to the EU, feed into Europe's exports to the U.S.</p><p>  While tariffs are already low on trade across the Atlantic, the objective of abolishing even these will bring benefits to business in the short term. Tariffs that average about 3% on EU/U.S. trade may appear insignificant but even at this low level they constitute an unnecessary tax on trade with the U.S. by both foreign and indigenous companies.</p><p>  The major benefits of course will arise from reform of regulatory restrictions applied by both economies. Many of these, such as the cost of having to meet two sets of technical specifications for consumer and other products, add extensive costs to exporters. In the longer term, if the TTIP brings about a regime whereby exporters would only need to meet one set of product compliance rules, it would save significant costs for exporters of medical devices, pharmaceuticals and chemicals among others.</p><p>  In addition our agri-business sector would receive a boost if rules are changed that currently hold back our food exporters from being able to freely sell into the U.S. market, in the same way as they can into the EU.</p></reply>

This may be explained by several factors:</p><p>  Firstly, movers from the EU-12 (i.e. all recently accessed countries including EU-10 and EU-2) tend to be on average younger than the overall population in their destination countries, this will impact on relativities with native populations which will have a larger proportion of people outside of the working age.</p><p>  Often migrants enter a country without family members for both practical reasons and due to the typical age profile of migrants which are often relatively young and may not yet have started a family. This can affect statistics in that migrants may not have the same level of non-working adult dependants as native populations.</p><p>  Furthermore, mobile workers invariably have fewer ties to their receiving country. They have a predisposition to exit the country during periods of economic downturn, reflecting the fact that the main reason for their move abroad was to find work.</p><p>  In sixteen EU Member States, working age citizens of other EU countries had a higher rate of employment than the rate for nationals of their receiving country. Rates were highest in Slovenia (80.2), Latvia (76.6), the Netherlands (76.1), the United Kingdom (75.9) and Poland (75.8). The gap between the average employment rate of working age citizens of other EU countries and the local population is highest in Italy, the UK, the Czech Republic and Luxembourg. It should be noted that using the EU LFS to estimate the number and characteristics of resident foreigners, and in particular &quot;EU foreigners&quot;, can suffer limitations. Among these limitations, in the case of Slovenia, Latvia and Poland, are the small sample size which affects the reliability of data broken down by citizenship.</p><p>  In recent years the annual EU Labour Force Surveys have shown that working age citizens from the EU-10 (the group of ten countries that joined the European Union in 2004) and the EU-2 (Bulgaria and Romania acceded in 2007) had a higher rate of employment on average when they moved abroad than the residents in the receiving EU-15 countries (by a difference of +9 percentage points in 2010). Since 85% of the EU-10 as well as the EU-2 nationals living in other Member States are of working age (i.e. aged 15-64) compared to 67% of the total resident population, intra-EU movers from the EU-10 and EU-2 countries are more likely to be in the economically productive period of their lives than the native population in the receiving countries.</p></reply>

The main elements being:</p><p>i.-  The integration of the various welfare decision making processes to speed up decision making and minimise recourse to supplementary welfare payments.</p><p>ii. -  The implementation of a systematic activation process based on profiling of clients.</p><p>iii. -  The delivery of a &lsquo;one-stop-shop&rsquo; service from an integrated office location.</p><p>The first ten Intreo offices, with all elements in place, went live in 2012.  These first ten offices were Sligo, Arklow, Tallaght, Kings Inns, Ballymun, Buncrana, Coolock, Dundalk, Finglas and Killarney.</p><p>A further two Intreo offices have now opened in Newcastlewest and Blanchardstown.  It is intended to have the full service available from a total of approximately 40 offices this year and to complete the full roll-out of all service elements to all 63 offices of the Department in 2014.  As part of this process it is intended to complete the roll-out of elements (i) and (ii) above to all offices during 2013.  Element (iii) requires infrastructural works in many office locations and therefore has a longer timeline.</p><p>Costs arising during the development of the new service identity related to the initial design and design implementation, some translation costs, the cost of royalty free images and trademark search &amp;amp; registration.  The costs for these elements amounted to &euro;59,516.</p><p>A particular effort was made to keep costs down during the development of the new identity, through procuring services via public tender from various suppliers to ensure cost effectiveness.  The initial work on the development of the identity and new name and logo of the new service was carried out by Creative Inc.  Following a separate tender, work on the implementation of the new name and identity in the Department&rsquo;s offices was carried out by Language Ltd.</p><p>With regard to the costs for facilities and refurbishment, twelve offices are now providing the full Intreo service and preparations are underway in other offices.  Some of the Department&rsquo;s existing buildings will require minor structural works, while other buildings because of their condition, health and safety issues or limited space availability will either need major works or replacement offices to be sought.  Expenditure on the rollout of Intreo offices to date is estimated at almost &euro;2m.  The costs for the remainder of 2013 are not yet known and will be contingent on the contract prices finalised with the contractors on each project. These costs are kept under close scrutiny as the Department is committed to securing value for money in implementing the introduction of the various elements of the service.  A breakdown of costs on the twelve offices that have been completed is shown in the following table.</p><p>The cost for stationary is not done on an office by office basis, but rather on a centralised system with office locations placing orders when needed.</p><p><table><tr><th>County</th><th>Location</th><th>Structural *</th><th>External Signage</th><th>Internal Signage</th><th>Ancillary **</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>Buncrana</td><td>96,821</td><td>3,148</td><td>1,180</td><td>2,335</td><td>103,484</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>Ballymun</td><td>45,665</td><td>3,148</td><td>1,020</td><td>6,071</td><td>55,904</td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>Blanchardstown</td><td>285,541</td><td>3,148</td><td>1,620</td><td>46,300</td><td>336,609</td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>Coolock</td><td>147,973</td><td>3,148</td><td>1,930</td><td>9,390</td><td>162,441</td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>Finglas</td><td>-</td><td>3,148</td><td></td><td>6,027</td><td>9,175</td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>Parnell Street</td><td>54,305</td><td>6,210</td><td>7,220</td><td>28,810</td><td>96,545</td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>Tallaght</td><td>220,040</td><td>6,508</td><td>4,210</td><td>82,999</td><td>313,757</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>Killarney</td><td>69,518</td><td>3,148</td><td>3,754</td><td>7,740</td><td>84,160</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>Newcastlewest</td><td>347,073</td><td>3,148</td><td>Invoice o/s***</td><td>31,514</td><td>381,735</td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td>Dundalk</td><td>197,665</td><td>3,148</td><td>1,100</td><td>12,160</td><td>214,073</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td>Sligo</td><td>66,300</td><td>13,090</td><td>5,707</td><td>30,980</td><td>116,077</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>Arklow</td><td>98,600</td><td>6,990</td><td>2,550</td><td>7,800</td><td>115,940</td></tr></table></p><p>*Structural relates to building works including mechanical and electrical installations.</p><p><div style="padding-left: 40px; margin-bottom: 10px">**Ancillary relates to items such as Furniture, Fittings, Decorating/Painting, Electronic Queuing Systems and Security, which includes installation/upgrade of CCTV and alert systems.</div></p><p>***Awaiting invoice to authorise payment</p><p>With regard to the development of the Department&rsquo;s website there was no cost involved in making changes to the Department&rsquo;s website <i><i>www.welfare.ie</i></i><i> </i>in advance of the launch of the Intreo service in October 2012.</p><p>As a separate project the Department's website <i><i>www.welfare.ie</i></i><i> </i>was re-developed and re-launched in January 2013.  The re-development of the <i><i>www.welfare.ie</i></i><i> </i>website represents the first phase of a multiple programme of planned activity in website/online services of the Department.

It will also facilitate the delivery of more online services for customers.</p><p>As part of the overall re-development, a dedicated Intreo area was created on the site, through which employers and jobseekers can access all existing information and services in relation to supports, training and entitlements.  The web pages in this area of the site use a different colour scheme to that used in other areas of the site, but this was developed as part of the overall re-development package, at no extra cost to the project.  The Intreo logo is used in the header of all web pages and on all Intreo-related pages; this was implemented as part of the overall re-development of the header and no extra cost was incurred for its inclusion.</p><p>The Department awarded a contract for IT consultancy support for the design, development and implementation of a new <i><i>www.welfare.ie</i></i><i> </i>website on 7th September 2012 to Hewlett Packard.  The contract includes on-going maintenance and support of the website for three years.  The total cost involved is &euro;463,380 (excluding VAT).</p></reply>

Key elements of the new service include activation measures such as client profiling, early group engagement and one-to-one meetings which focus on customised employment supports and monitoring of each client&rsquo;s progress.  In addition, an integrated decision-making process leading to quicker decisions and an integrated reception providing a one-stop-shop incorporating all strands of the Department&rsquo;s employment and income support services are part of the new service.</p><p>  The Intreo roll-out is being supported by a training and development plan for all offices to equip staff and management to deliver this new service. </p><p>  The Department&rsquo;s centralised training section, Staff Development Unit, works in partnership with a dedicated Intreo Project Team and local management to address identified training needs for each Office in preparation for the provision of the new service to customers.  All of the training is being developed and delivered by in-house training resources and, to date, there has been no expenditure on external providers for Intreo-related training.  Where additional training is required following the introduction of the new service, this is provided on an ongoing basis.</p><p>  Management and staff are receiving training in a range of areas including decision-making, the habitual residence condition, community welfare service awareness, customer service, change management, non-violent crisis intervention, presentation skills and internal IT systems training.  These training programmes range from one half-day session to two weeks in duration.</p><p>  Former F&Aacute;S Employment Service Officers, who joined the Department in January 2012, undertook Adult Guidance and Education training at NUI Maynooth as part of their role-specific development.  They continue to use these skills in their daily interaction with customers regarding activation into employment or education. </p><p>  The Department is currently developing a training course for newly-appointed Case Officers to equip them with the skills necessary to operate in this new role and this may include an external training element.</p><p>  In addition, the Department is beginning a process to review and redesign its functional training programmes, focusing on the business skills required for key frontline roles in the organisation, with a view to preparing these programmes for future accreditation.  A Request For Tender will issue in this regard later this year.</p></reply>

All Medical Assessors undergo training to assess all the various illness related schemes including appeals cases. </p><p>  Since 2009, the cadre of Medical Assessors has been generally between 23-25 but the volume of assessment work has increased substantially due to involvement in new schemes and the levels of training required for these.  Backlogs have then arisen in cases due for assessment (including appeals cases) due to the combination of increased work volumes and a number of retirements/Medical Assessors on leave including sick leave/ maternity leave etc.</p><p>  As an exception to the current moratorium on recruitment in the civil and public service, my Department received sanction from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to hold a competition to appoint Medical Assessors, with a view to filling critical vacancies that had arisen following the retirement of a number of serving Medical Assessors.</p><p>  In addition, and in view of the critical control role that Medical Assessors play in assessing and reviewing illness related claims, sanction was also given to appoint additional Medical Assessors to fill vacancies which will be due to arise in the near future as a result of retirements.</p><p>  A public competition, administered on behalf of my Department by the Public Appointments Service (PAS), was held in 2012.  At the time of the interviews, four Medical Assessors had retired.  Fourteen people were placed on the panel that was established following completion of the competitive process. </p><p>  To date seven Medical Assessors have been appointed from this panel, three of whom took up duty in November 2012, with a further three commencing in March, 2013 and the most recent appointment was in early June, 2013.  Five of those placed on the panel have subsequently withdrawn from the process. </p><p>  My Department has continued to liaise with the PAS with a view to appointing the two remaining candidates at the earliest opportunity.  In this regard, two offers of appointment have been issued and the new Medical Assessors are expected to take up their positions in Autumn, 2013.</p><p>  I place great emphasis on ensuring that all claims including appeals cases are processed and reviewed in a timely manner and I&rsquo;m very pleased that the Department has been able to fill these critical vacancies and to frontload the appointment of additional Medical Assessors in advance of retirement thereby enabling the Department to deliver a quality service to our customers.</p></reply>

Parental leave entitles parents who qualify to take a period of up to 18 weeks of unpaid leave from employment, generally in respect of children aged up to eight years.  There is no provision for a social insurance based payment for periods of parental leave, but employees may be entitled to credited contributions to maintain their social insurance record for the period.</p><p>  The introduction of paid parental leave or paternity leave would have significant cost implications for employers, the Exchequer and the social insurance fund.  In addition, the question of introducing a paternity benefit payment would depend on establishing an underlying entitlement to statutory paternity leave in the first instance and in the case of paternity leave would require legislation on the part of the Minister for Justice and Equality.</p></reply>

The Advisory Group is charged with, <i>inter alia</i>, examining and reporting on issues involved in providing social insurance cover for self-employed persons in order to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable.</p><p>  The Advisory Group's overall method of working is based on producing modular reports on the priority areas identified in the Terms of Reference.  Where possible, the aim is to provide recommendations that can be acted upon in time for the annual budget, estimates and legislative cycle and to allow the Government to best address its commitments under the EU-IMF Programme of Financial Support.  The Groups report on the issues involved in providing social insurance cover for self-employed persons so as to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable was submitted to me in May 2013. </p><p>  Any proposal to change the treatment of the self-employed for PRSI contributions/benefits arising from the Group's report could only be considered in a Budgetary context.</p><p>  Self-employed persons whose businesses fail or suffer from reduced demand may, however, access social welfare support by establishing entitlement to assistance-based payments such as jobseeker's allowance.  They can apply for the means-tested jobseeker's allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.  In general, their means will take account of the level of earnings in the last twelve months in determining their expected income for the following year and, in the current climate, account is taken of the downward trend in the economy.  As in the case of a non-self-employed claimant for jobseeker's allowance, the means of husband/wife, civil partner or co-habitant will be taken into account in deciding on entitlement to a payment.</p></reply>

It was for that reason that the Government last year adopted the National Carers' Strategy with a view to giving greater public recognition to carers and their work.  </p><p>  Carers receive significant income supports from the Department of Social Protection so that people can continue living at home as far as possible.  Expenditure on carers has increased significantly in recent years.  In 2013 it is estimated to be &euro;776 million compared with an estimated outturn of &euro;771 million in 2012.  The expenditure on carers in 2012 included: &euro;509 million on carer's allowance; &euro;24 million on carer's benefit; &euro;135 million on the respite care grant and; &euro;103 million on domiciliary care allowance.  </p><p>  Carers also receive a free travel pass at an annual cost of &euro;6 million and carers who reside with the care recipient are eligible for the household benefits package at an annual cost of approximately &euro;30 million. </p><p>  I am not in a position to reverse the reduction to the respite care grant. The revised rate of &euro;1,375 is still more than what it was in 2006 when the rate was &euro;1,200. The respite care grant is paid to more than 70,000 people each year, with some 5,000 people in receipt of more than one grant as they care for more than one person.  Almost 54,000 people are in receipt of the carer's allowance and 27,000 in receipt of the domiciliary care allowance.  There are also 1,700 in receipt of carer's benefit.  Some 5,000 carers not in receipt of a carer's payment also receive the grant.  </p><p>  The supports available to carers in Ireland are among the highest rates of income support in Europe.  A person getting certain qualifying payments and also providing full-time care and attention to another person can keep their main social welfare payment and receive a half-rate carer's allowance as well.  The half-rate carer's allowance was protected in Budget 2013.  </p><p>  The respite care grant is available to all full-time carers regardless of their means while the income disregard and means test for carers allowance is the most generous in the social welfare system.  A couple under 66 with two children, earning a joint annual income of  up to &euro;35,400 can qualify for the maximum rate of carer's allowance while a couple earning &euro;59,300 will still qualify for the minimum rate.  Carers are entitled to an extra half-rate carer's allowance if they care for more than one person and a respite care grant for each care recipient.</p></reply>

The effect of the condition is that a person whose habitual residence is elsewhere would not normally be entitled to social welfare assistance or child benefit payments on arrival in Ireland. Guidelines were introduced for Deciding Officers in the Department to assist in ascertaining entitlements of such claimants to social assistance. Each case received for a determination on the Habitual Residence Condition (HRC) is dealt with in its own right and a decision is based on application of the legislation and guidelines to the particular individual circumstances of each case.  </p><p>  The guidelines regarding determination of habitual residence address the issue of returning emigrants very specifically.   The Guidelines state:   &#8220;A person who had previously been habitually resident in the State and who moved to live and work in another country and then resumes his/her long-term residence in the State may be regarded as being habitually resident immediately on his/her return to the State.&#8221;</p><p>  In determining the main centre of interest in the case of returning emigrants, deciding officers take account of: </p><p>  -  purpose of return e.g. expiry of foreign residence permit</p><p>  -  the applicant's stated intentions</p><p>  -  verified arrangements which have been made in regard to returning on a long-term basis e.g. transfer of financial accounts and any other assets, termination of residence based entitlements in the other country, or assistance from Safe Home or a similar programme to enable Irish emigrants to return permanently</p><p>  -  length and continuity of the previous residence in the State</p><p>  -  the record of employment or self-employment in another State and</p><p>  -  whether s/he has maintained links with the previous residence and can be regarded as resuming his/her previous residence rather than starting a new period of residence. </p><p>  Any applicant who disagrees with the decision on a case has the right to request a review of that decision and/or appeal to the independent Social Welfare Appeals Office. </p><p>  I am currently examining the guidelines with a view to ensuring that  the full-time caring situation is fully recognised in the decision making process.</p></reply>

I have no direct statutory function in relation to connections to the gas network.</p><p>  In 2006, the CER approved a new network connections policy which enabled reassessment of the feasibility of connecting certain towns to the gas network.  This policy was updated in 2011.  In order for any town to be connected to the gas network, certain economic criteria need to be satisfied as a prerequisite.</p><p>  The policy allows for the appraisal of a town either on its own or as part of a regional group of towns.  The policy framework provides that, over a certain period, the costs of connecting a town, or group of towns, to the network are recouped through the actual economic consumption of gas and the associated tariffs.  Otherwise, uneconomic projects will increase costs for all energy consumers.</p><p>  Having regard to the CER policy on new towns connections, Bord G&aacute;is Networks, and more recently Gaslink, have carried out a comprehensive review of towns not connected to the national gas network.  In April 2010, Gaslink published its 'New Towns Analysis Phase 3'<i></i>report.  The study included a review of the feasibility of connecting 11 towns in the West and North West region, including Sligo town.  However, the Gaslink report found that none of the towns qualified for connection on economic grounds.</p><p>  Nevertheless, Gaslink continues to review towns which did not qualify for connection under the Study and other towns on an ongoing basis.  The key factor which would qualify a town or group of towns in any future review would be a significant increase in demand for natural gas, probably resulting from the addition of a new large industrial or commercial facility.</p></reply>

The market has since developed into a well-regulated market, supporting a multiplicity of commercial operators, providing services over a diverse range of technology platforms.  Details of broadband services available in each County can be found on ComReg's website at .</p><p>  The State can only intervene to ensure access to broadband services in areas where the competitive market has failed to deliver such services, as in the case of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS) and the Rural Broadband Scheme.  The combination of private investment and State interventions means that Ireland has met the EU Commission's Digital Agenda for Europe target of having a basic broadband service available to all areas by 2013.</p><p>  With basic broadband services widely available across Ireland, the focus is now on accelerating the roll out of high speed services.  The Government's National Broadband Plan, which I published in August last, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed services of 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses, well in advance of the EU's target date of 2020, and that significantly higher speeds are available to as many homes and businesses as possible.</p><p>  During the preparation of Ireland's National Broadband Plan, the commercial market operators indicated that they expect to provide 70Mbps to 100Mbps services to 50% of the population by 2015.  Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway in both fixed line and mobile high speed broadband services, particularly in urban and semi-urban areas.</p><p>  In tandem with these commercial developments, intensive work is underway in my Department to progress a State-led investment to secure the countrywide introduction of next generation broadband access. </p><p>  In order to progress the State-led investment, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained.  A comprehensive mapping exercise of the current and anticipated investment by the commercial sector is being undertaken to identify where the market is expected to succeed and fail in the delivery of high speed broadband services over the coming years.</p><p>  The results of this mapping exercise will inform the level of Government intervention that may be required and the areas that need to be targeted in the State-led investment so as to deliver on the targets for high speed broadband contained in the National Broadband Plan.</p><p>  Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations including stakeholder engagement will be ongoing throughout 2013 with a view to the launch of a procurement process in 2014.</p><p>  Implementation of the National Broadband Plan will be complemented by the National Digital Strategy.  The first phase of the National Digital Strategy, which I intend to launch in early July, will target specific segments of society, aiming to improve digital adoption and to realise the economic and social benefits that digital technologies can bring.  </p><p>The Government remains firmly committed to ensuring that citizens, businesses and all parts of society are motivated, empowered and have the requisite connectivity to interact effectively in a digital environment.</p></reply>

The Kelvin project is a joint North-South project with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment in Northern Ireland and provides direct international telecoms connectivity between the North West of Ireland and the border regions and North America (New York) and Europe (Amsterdam).  This was achieved by building a spur from the Hibernia North transatlantic telecoms cable, which runs off the coast of Northern Ireland and bringing it ashore at Portrush.  A terrestrial fibre network was then used to connect the Kelvin connectivity from the North West of Ireland to 13 urban centres North and South, and onwards to Dublin.</p><p>  The main benefits of the Kelvin connectivity are as follows:</p><p>- low cost international connectivity to the north west and Border regions, including guaranteed backhaul costs</p><p>- high speed (reduced latency) international connectivity using the Kelvin connectivity, which makes it attractive for business using real time applications</p><p>- high capacity circuits with an availability of up to 99.999% in any service month - state of the art industry standard</p><p>- improved resilience for Ireland&rsquo;s overall international connectivity &ndash; the Kelvin network provides an alternative route for telecoms traffic out of Ireland via the north west using Kelvin for connectivity to the USA (New York) and Europe (Amsterdam) if required.</p><p>  The Kelvin Project makes Ireland and the North West more attractive for foreign direct investment and for business in general, in particular for data intensive business, as telecoms connectivity is now an important factor in business investment decisions.  The existence of the Kelvin network in the north west and Border area provides an opportunity for business interests in the region to avail of a state of the art international telecoms link to conduct business with international markets.  The IDA also uses the benefits of the transatlantic link provided by Project Kelvin to promote the north west and Border region as an attractive and viable location for new inward investment opportunities, and to secure additional projects from existing international investors.</p></reply>

The NSS serves as <b>a strategic context for spatial planning in Ireland by regional authorities in their regional planning guidelines role and for planning authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la in their statutory planning functions. It also seeks to influence investment priorities particularly in transport, housing, water services, communications, energy, health and education infrastructure.</b></p><p><b>  The 2002 NSS remains in place. However, proposals will be brought to Government later this year for a roadmap to develop a successor strategy that will take account, </b><b><i>inter alia</i></b><b>, of our significantly changed economic circumstances and to contribute to sustainable national recovery.</b></p><p>  The NSS has supported alignment and prioritisation of sectoral infrastructural investment, notwithstanding the absence of any discrete funding stream for the NSS Gateways and Hubs . T he possibility of establishing such a funding stream under the NSS remains a significant challenge in light of current budgetary constraints although it remains a matter for consideration in the context of the development of a successor NSS.</p><p>  The Gateways and Hubs Development Index (GHDI) 2012 published by the Border, dlands &amp;amp; Western Regional Assembly, and the Southern &amp;amp; Eastern Regional Assembly, in May 2013, represents an examination of Ireland's key urban centres, including the Dundalk Gateway, across a range of performance indicators. The Index provides a unique opportunity to observe and understand how Gateways and Hubs are developing including in times of economic challenge. The findings of the Index will provide a valuable resource for policy-making for Government Departments, Local and Regional Authorities and other major state agencies particularly in the context of the preparation of a successor to the NSS.</p></reply>

The discretionary granting of additional remission, as opposed to the standard rate of one quarter, will be considered where a prisoner has shown the following:</p><p>  (i) to have displayed good industry in prison and continue to be of good conduct;</p><p>  (ii) to display willingness to seek employment through education/course work whilst in prison to enhance their chances of gaining employment upon release;</p><p>  (iii) through engagement in authorised structured activity and where, as a result, the prisoner is less likely to re-offend and will be better able to reintegrate into the community.</p><p>  An essential part of the criteria for rewarding one third remission is that applicants engage in offence focused work which in turn should lead to a reduced risk of re-offending.</p><p>  While an application for enhanced remission has been received from the prisoner in question, he will be informed that as his application does not contain evidence of offence focused work (to be supported with the proper documentation), it will not be considered at the present time.  He is welcome to resubmit another application at any time with the supporting documentation.</p></reply>

In considering these requests, a number of factors are taken into account.  This vehicle is a national artefact and is of great importance to the Defence Forces and the Irish nation as a whole.  Therefore, because of its importance, it is necessary to strike a balance between making the vehicle available to the public on appropriate occasions, and ensuring that it is properly maintained and preserved.  In addition, significant Military resources are required for the transportation and security of the vehicle during the time that it is away from Military property.  The Military have made arrangements to display Sliabh na mBan in the Curragh Military Museum in an effort to increase its accessibility to members of the public and to reduce the requirement to transport the vehicle to events around the country.  I have made enquiries in relation to the particular event that the Deputy has referred to and, unfortunately in this instance it is not possible to make the Sliabh na mBan available for the reasons outlined above.</p></reply>

Applications that satisfy the eligibility criteria will be presented to an independent panel for assessment.</p><p>  Given the limited amount of quota available, the panel will conduct its assessment of all applications in an objective manner and, following a thorough examination of the information presented, the panel will recommend a list of applicants who best demonstrate evidence of a viable and sustainable enterprise.</p><p>  I expect to be in a position to announce the results of the Scheme in late August 2013.</p></reply>

These proposals cover all of the areas mentioned in the report, including  measures on access and availability of alcohol; controls on alcohol advertising and sponsorship; labelling of alcohol products, and legislation on minimum unit pricing.</p><p>  Minimum unit pricing is a mechanism of imposing a statutory floor in price levels per gram of alcohol that must be legally observed by retailers in both the on and off trade sector.  A health impact assessment, in conjunction with Northern Ireland,  is being commissioned as part of the process of developing a legislative basis for minimum unit pricing.  The assessment will study the impact of different minimum prices on a range of areas such as health, crime and likely economic impact.  It is only upon completion of this work that the precise quantification of impact from an economic and social point of view if Ireland can be understood.</p><p>  The provision of such a price measure for alcohol - as opposed to fiscal measures - is aimed chiefly at preventing the sale of alcohol at very cheap prices.  A minimum pricing regime is a proportional policy exigency that allows the State to engage another parameter to deal with managing the supply of alcohol for the purpose of preventing its misuse.  It is a policy aimed at those who drink in a harmful and hazardous manner.</p></reply>

To date in 2013 there have been 4 heart transplants with 14  patients awaiting transplantation. The National Organ Donation and Transplantation Office is progressing the deployment of specialist donor co-ordinators across the emerging hospital networks in line with best international practice. In parallel,  it is proposed to employ a public awareness campaign via social networking to enhance the public's awareness of the benefits of organ donation.</p><p>  The Programme for Government envisages the introduction of an opt-out system of organ donation, with a view  to improving the availability of organs for patients in need of transplantation.   This will require detailed consideration and further consultation and I am developing proposals for Government on this matter. The public consultation process in relation to how such an opt-out system should operate, will generate greater public awareness of the need for organ donation. </p><p>  In addition, to consent systems, there is evidence from other countries that good co-ordination at hospital level and counselling arrangements for relatives are significant factors in achieving high organ donation rates.  In conjunction with the HSE's National Organ Donation and Transplantation Office my Department is also examining what practices and organisational  changes could further improve donation rates. </p><p>  The Deputy may also wish to note that following discussions between my Department and the Road Safety Authority, the new Driving Licence Application Form contains a question asking applicants if they would like a code to be placed on their driving licence indicating their wish to become an organ donor.  Since the introduction of a new type of driving licence on 19 January, the code that will appear on new driving licences issued to people who indicate that they wish to become an organ donor, is 115.  My Department has written to the National Organ Donation and Transplantation Office and the Regional Directors of Operations in the HSE asking them to alert relevant hospital staff to this initiative and to the code which will appear on new driving licences of people who wish to donate.  My Department is also in discussion with the Department of Social Protection with a view to including a similar code on the Public Services Card.</p></reply>

Given that the number of people with dementia is expected to rise to between 141,000 and 147,000 by 2041, the Programme for Government contains a commitment to develop a National Alzheimer's and other Dementias' Strategy by 2013 to:</p><p>- increase awareness</p><p>- ensure early diagnosis and intervention and </p><p>- ensure development of enhanced community based services.</p><p>  A significant amount of preparatory work has already been completed.<b></b>A research review funded by the Atlantic Philanthropies to lay the foundations for the Strategy, titled <i>Creating Excellence in Dementia Care, A Research Review for Ireland's National Dementia Strategy</i>  was published in January 2012.  A public consultation process to inform the development of the Strategy was conducted in 2012 and a report of same published on the Department's website in February 2013.  A Working Group, representative of key stakeholders from the Department, the HSE, the medical profession and the community and voluntary sector has been established, meetings of which are on-going.</p><p>  While the development of the Strategy will have to have due regard to the constraints imposed by the budgetary situation, it is intended that it will be a transformative Strategy.  It will have a very practical focus, will be action oriented and will focus on what can be done to make a difference to the lives of people with dementia.

However, if a private designated bed is not available and a private in-patient is accommodated in a public bed, the maintenance charge is currently not levied, although the private in-patient continues to pay the fees of his/her hospital consultant.</p><p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General has reported that 45% of in-patients treated privately by their consultants were not charged for their maintenance costs because they were not occupying private-designated beds.  This situation represents a significant loss of income to the public hospital system and an indirect subsidy to private insurance companies, who cover most private patients.  I believe that this situation cannot continue and that the new charge makes sense.  Up to now insurers have enjoyed a significant subsidy, where these private patients have only paid a standard &euro;75 charge per night even though they have seen their consultant privately.</p><p>  The gap between the cost of providing this service to private in-patients and the amount that public hospitals are currently allowed to raise is estimated to be about &euro;200m per year.  The subsidy is equivalent to the cost of treating over 30,000 public patients every year.  While everyone is entitled to use a public hospital, some people chose to be treated privately, in which case they have chosen to pay the consultant and the hospital.  The Government believes that users of private services should pay for the costs of providing these services even when they are provided by a public hospital.</p><p>  As part of Budget 2013, the Government announced that it would raise &euro;60m in 2013 under this heading, and &euro;115m in a full year.  This represents a modest phasing in of the charge &ndash; as called for by the insurers themselves - and is a relatively modest extra cost on an industry that pays out some &euro;2 billion in claims costs every year.  The Health (Amendment) Bill 2013 is presently before the D&aacute;il and provides for charges to be levied on all in-patients who opt to be private to their consultant, irrespective of where the patient is accommodated in the hospital and regardless of whether they are admitted directly or through emergency departments.</p></reply>

This process involves ensuring that members have a minimum level of qualifications and that they engage in continuous professional development. </p><p>  The Health and Social Care Professionals Council (HSCPC) and the 12 registration boards to be established under the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 are responsible for protecting the public by promoting high  standards of professional conduct and professional education, training and competence among the registrants of the 12 health and social care professions designated under the Act. The Council (also known as CORU) was established in March 2007 and is working to put in place the necessary structures for registration, education and fitness to practise for the 12 designated professions.  All the registration boards and their registers for the designated professions should be established by 2015.  The legislation empowers the Minister for Health to include, if he considers it appropriate and in the public interest to do so, additional health and social care professions in the regulatory system over time, and under specific criteria.  The question of regulating further health and social care professionals, including audiologists, may be reviewed post 2015 in the context of progress made at that juncture. </p></reply>

Detailed information about the risk of clots is clearly outlined in the product information for healthcare professionals and patients. The Irish Medicines Board (IMB) has highlighted safety issues associated with use of combined contraceptives to healthcare professionals on many occasions, most recently in its Drug Safety Newsletter Edition 42 from June 2011. This risk has also been closely monitored across the EU over the years and has been the subject of a number of reviews. A further review is currently underway and is expected to be concluded in the coming months.</p><p>  To date, the IMB has received six reports of adverse reactions associated with the use of combined oral contraceptives where the patients concerned were reported to have died due to clotting related complications.  Two of these reports involved use of Yasmin and Yaz. For one of those fatalities, the patient was reported to have purchased the contraceptive online and had other risk factors that could have contraindicated the use of any oral contraceptive. </p><p>  Under the Medicinal Products (Prescription and Control of Supply) Regulations, 2003, as amended, it is illegal for prescription medicines to be supplied by mail order. This includes ordering prescription medicines through internet sites. The IMB works closely with the Revenue's Customs Service and an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to prevent the illegal sales of prescription only medicines. This co-operation has led to the seizure of many individual packets of medicines and has resulted in a number of prosecutions and other enforcement actions involving website operators.</p><p>  The IMB has consistently stressed the dangers of buying medicines online and urges consumers not to risk their health by using these illegal medicines. In cooperation with the Customs Service, the IMB follows up with the intended recipient of each of these attempted supplies and explains that the product is illegal and the health risks associated with seeking to source and use such products. </p><p>  In 2012 there were no seizures of Yaz, 63 seizures of Yasmin, 63 seizures of Yasminelle and 147 seizures of Yarina (both of which are similar products to Yaz and Yasmin).</p></reply>

Firstly, I wish to extend my deepest sympathies to the family of the child involved. The loss of a loved one is hard for family and friends at any time, but the sudden and unexpected death of a young child is particularly difficult.</p><p>  In relation to this incident, the facts are that, at 1.16 am on 18 June 2013, an emergency call was received for a baby who was reported as not breathing. The National Ambulance Service (NAS) was initially unable to obtain sufficient details of where help was needed, which led to a delay in reaching the incident.  The first emergency resource arrived at the scene 30 minutes after the initial 999 call.  The patient was subsequently pronounced dead. </p><p>  The incident has been the subject of a systems analysis, as is routine in cases where a death occurs, to ascertain whether call-taking protocols were followed.  Following an examination of the facts, the HSE is satisfied that systems and processes operated correctly and there are no plans to carry out any further review.  However, interrogation has been strengthened to try and mitigate the impact of a call where the incident location cannot be identified. In addition, HSE Communications has been requested to run a publicity campaign to improve public awareness of the need to communicate precisely the locations of incidents.  In the interest of respecting the dignity and grief of the family, I wish to make no further comment on the specific incident.</p><p>  A significant reform programme has been underway to totally reconfigure the way the HSE manages and delivers pre-hospital care services, to ensure a clinically driven, nationally co-ordinated system, supported by improved technology.  The National Control Centre Reconfiguration Project, which is endorsed by HIQA and which represents international best practice, will reduce the number of ambulance control centres to a single national control system, with significant investment in new voice, data and mapping technologies.  The project is also a key element of Future Health:  A Strategic Framework for Health Reform in Ireland 2012-2015.</p><p>  Both HIQA and the NAS have had concerns over control and dispatch structures at some control centres leading up to the development of the national control system.  Accordingly, the NAS moved the Cork and Tralee centres to its Townsend Street centre on an interim basis in May, to mitigate such concerns pending completion of the national centre.  Detailed preparations took place to ensure the safety of services during the move of the Cork and Kerry operations.  The NAS provided additional staff, training, technology and equipment to assist this process. 112/999 calls from those areas are now answered in Dublin using improved technology.  The NAS is satisfied that Townsend St, while not appropriate to the needs of the overall reconfiguration project, is nevertheless suitable and infrastructurally sound for the interim accommodation of these centres.</p></reply>

While a regional breakdown of these figures is not available, I am satisfied that the initiatives being taken by this Government are impacting positively on tourism in all of Ireland&rsquo;s regions. These initiatives include reductions in VAT and employers&rsquo; PRSI and the short term visa waiver programme.  More recently the Government extended the Employment and Incentive Investment Scheme to include tourism accommodation and introduced a diesel fuel rebate which will benefit coach operators.  </p><p>  F&aacute;ilte Ireland has funded a range of capital projects in the North West including the Sliabh Liag cliffs project and the redevelopment of Bundoran Waterworld. The route of the Wild Atlantic Way was announced recently and will provide a compelling reason for visitors to spend their holiday along the Western seaboard. F&aacute;ilte Ireland has also invested in a new state-of-the-art Discover Ireland Centre in the centre of Sligo.</p><p>  In promoting the island of Ireland as a visitor destination, Tourism Ireland also highlight the many attractions and experiences available to visitors right across the country.</p><p>  As regional development and overseas promotion are matters for the tourism agencies, I have referred the Deputy's question to Failte Ireland and Tourism Ireland for further information and direct reply.  Please contact my private office if you do not receive a reply within ten days.</p></reply>

More recently, (12 June) I announced an additional &euro;50 million to County and City Councils for regional and local roads bringing the overall amount available in 2013 to approximately &euro;400 million.</p><p>  My Department and local authorities are working closely to develop new more efficient ways of delivering the best outputs possible with the funding available to them.  In this regard, County Councils were provided with additional flexibility this year enabling them to transfer funding from their Restoration Improvement Grant to their Discretionary Grant.</p><p>  As well as this, from 2014 onward funding for major improvement schemes on regional and local road is being discontinued and the main focus will be on the maintenance and repair of roads.</p><p>   Under the Local Improvements Scheme (LIS) grant category, grants are provided to county councils for the construction and improvement of non-public roads.  Given the financial circumstances priority is being provided to the public road network/</p><p>  Local authorities may use up to 7% of their Discretionary Grant towards LIS should they wish to do so and it is a matter for local authorities to prioritise their works programme and decide if funding should be set aside from their Discretionary Grant for LIS.  I believe that local authorities are best placed to judge the priority of such works and to allocate such funds. In this way, Local Authorities may decide whether they want to operate the LIS in their area or would prefer to put their resources into regional and local public roads. The alternative is that I make a decision to establish a specific fund for the LIS. However, this would involve making a pro-rata reduction to the other road grants headings, and imposing LIS on local authorities that would prefer to prioritise public roads. I do not believe that such an approach would be in the best interests of the road network or local democracy.</p></reply>
