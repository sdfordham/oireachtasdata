It is quite clear that there are major challenges ahead, for the EU, the UK and for Ireland.</p>  <p>  The position in relation to the border with Northern Ireland in the context of Brexit is very clear and has been articulated by the Taoiseach on several occasions and again by Government on the triggering of Article 50.  Continued freedom of movement, absence of a hard border, and minimal impact on business and trade are key objectives.  The Government is clear that any manifestation of a hard border would have very negative consequences.  A key priority is to ensure the continued free flow of trade on the island and the need to avoid a hard border. Clearly in this regard the closer the trading relationship between the UK and EU is more generally the better.</p>  <p>  My Department has been preparing for the impact of Brexit since well before the referendum on 23 June 2016, with this work now intensified. The primary areas for the Department of Finance relate to the economic and financial sector implications stemming from Brexit. This work is being undertaken within the whole-of-Government framework established by the Department of the Taoiseach.  A consolidated paper providing more detail about Ireland's priorities and approach to the negotiations ahead is due to be published in advance of the European Council meeting on 29 April.</p>  <p>  The precise arrangements that will apply after Brexit will depend on the outcome of negotiations between the EU and UK that will now take place following formal notification under Article 50 on Wednesday last, 29 March.</p></reply>

The information was provided under embargo in order to allow management in the bank inform staff and staff representatives of the proposals in advance of a public announcement. I should stress that the bank officials were providing information about decisions already taken and this was not a consultation in advance of decisions being taken. </p>  <p>  I fully appreciate that the decision taken by the bank will be keenly felt in the locations concerned, both by staff and customers. It is my understanding that the bank has been consulting with staff representatives and hopes that the necessary staff reductions can be achieved on a voluntary basis by agreement. I would urge both sides to work together to achieve agreement and to utilise the resources of the State industrial relations apparatus to do this if necessary. </p>  <p>  I should stress that the Irish Government has no formal role in the commercial decisions of Ulster Bank, these are a matter for the Board and Management of the Bank and its parent company, RBS.</p>  <p>  The closures are a response to changing ways of banking due to less use of cash, increased use of technology and corresponding reduced visits to branches. That said, I expect that Ulster Bank will do everything that it can to mitigate the impacts of these branch closures on local communities, including technology and the use of alternative means of service delivery. I also expect that the bank will ensure that customers are kept informed about developments and provided with the appropriate assistance to move branches, switch to other banks and avail of alternative means of accessing financial services. The Central Bank will also have a role in ensuring that consumer protection rules are followed. The continued presence of a viable and active Ulster Bank in the Irish market will be important in fostering competition for banking services. It is vital that businesses and consumers have a range of banking options available when using financial services and accessing credit and that they continually assess their options to ensure that they are getting the best value and service possible.</p></reply>

    <ques id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-04-04a.19.q" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1291" speakername="Maureen O'Sullivan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017040400058#WRB01300"><p><i>49.</i> To ask the Minister for Finance the policy objectives that are achieved by rendering the carer's allowance, which is already subject to a means test by the Department of Social Protection, subject to taxation; if other social assistance payments are treated similarly; and if he will make a statement on the matter. <b>[16406/17]</b></p></ques>
    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-04-04a.20.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017040400058#WRB01400"><p>Carer's Allowance is a means-tested payment for carers who look after individuals in need of care and attention on a full-time basis.  The Carer's Allowance, in common with many other social welfare payments, is regarded as a taxable source of income.  The level of tax payable, if any, on such income is then determined by the personal circumstances of the recipient, taking into account factors such as the individual's other sources of income and the available tax credits and standard-rate bands. </p>  <p>  The means test for the Carer's Allowance involves assessing an individual's means based on income and assets other than their home. I am informed by the Department of Social Protection that the means test for carers allowance has been significantly eased over the years and is now one of the most generous means tests in the social welfare system, most notably with regard to the earnings of the carer's spouse.  The income disregard is &euro;332.50 per week for a single person and &euro;665 per week for a couple. This means that a couple with two children can earn in the region of &euro;35,400 and still qualify for the maximum rate of carer's allowance as well as the associated free travel and household benefits package. </p>  <p>  As Deputies will be aware the Irish income tax system is highly progressive with those on lower incomes paying proportionately less tax than those on higher incomes.  Therefore the reality is that an individual who is in receipt of a means-tested payment will in many cases not have an income tax liability as the available tax credits will reduce any tax liability to nil. A person in receipt of taxable social welfare income may claim the PAYE tax credit of &euro;1,650 per annum, in addition to his or her personal tax credit of &euro;1,650 per annum.  These standard tax credits can shelter income of &euro;16,500 from tax at the standard rate each year.</p>  <p>  A jointly assessed individual who works primarily in the home to care for an incapacitated person may also qualify for the Home Carer tax credit of &euro;1,100 per annum.  When added to the personal and PAYE tax credits, this would shelter income of &euro;22,000 from tax at the standard rate each year.</p>  <p>  It should also be noted that social welfare payments are exempt from USC so, in addition to no USC liability arising on this income, it is also not counted as income for the purposes of determining whether the USC entry threshold has been reached.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-04-04a.23.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017040400058#WRB01700"><p>I am informed by the Central Bank that, while it cannot generally comment on interactions with regulated firms, Ulster Bank Ireland D.A.C. is engaging with the Bank in relation to this matter.  </p><p>As the Deputy is aware, in November 2016, RBS announced a new complaints review process overseen by an independent third party and the automatic refund of complex fees to SME customers in Global Restructuring Group (GRG) in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland between 2008 and 2013.  I am informed that: </p><p>- Ulster Bank is working on how it can provide the same supports to its customers in the Republic of Ireland. </p><p>- Ulster Bank commenced sending letters in February to SME customers who were in GRG between 2008 and 2013 to let them know about the new GRG complaints review process and if they are included in the automatic complex fee refund. </p><p>- Ulster Bank has indicated that this is almost complete.</p><p>- The GRG Customer Helpdesk can be contacted by emailing GRGCustomerHelpdesk@rbs.co.uk or calling 1800 882 779 (ROI)/+44 184 222 6142 (International) and more information is available at . </p><p>I am confident that legislative changes since the financial crisis have equipped the Central Bank with an array of investigative, regulatory and enforcement powers to ensure that regulated financial service providers adhere to the requirements of financial services legislation.  These changes include significantly enhanced powers for the Central Bank to gather information under the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 which broadened the Banks' information gathering and authorised officer powers. </p><p>It is evident that the Central Bank is properly undertaking its enforcement role by the recent sizeable settlements in enforcement cases. </p><p>In addition to this enforcement role, the Deputy may be aware that the Central Bank is proactively regulating the financial system and has issued regulations aimed at protecting SMEs when dealing with regulated and unregulated firms as set out below.  These SME Regulations introduce specific requirements, including: </p><p>- Contacting SME borrowers who have been in arrears for 15 working days; </p><p>- Warning SME borrowers if they are in danger of being classified as not co-operating; and </p><p>- Expanding the grounds for appeal and setting up an internal appeals panel. </p><p>Under these SME Regulations, regulated financial services firms must have a complaints handling procedure in place.  Any complaints against financial institutions should first be discussed with the institution concerned.</p></reply>

    <ques id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-04-04a.25.q" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017040400058#WRB01900"><p><i>51.</i> To ask the Minister for Finance if there were concerns raised within his Department regarding the due diligence information made available to a person (details supplied) when considering a significant share purchase in a bank (details supplied) in 2010; if that concern arose due to the fact the same information was not put into the public domain, therefore possibly facilitating shareholder oppression; and if he will make a statement on the matter. <b>[16429/17]</b></p></ques>
    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-04-04a.26.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017040400058#WRB02000"><p>The bank in question was required by the Central Bank of Ireland, its regulator, to raise new capital as part of its 2011 Prudential Capital Assessment Review (PCAR). As the State was a shareholder at the time, it faced the prospect of injecting further capital into the bank to protect its investment and support the bank at a time when economic and financial conditions were extremely challenging.  However following an approach by a consortium of international investors, the State took the decision to exercise its rights to acquire the new shares being offered by the bank by way of primary issuance, but then subsequently sold on the majority of these shares at no loss or profit.  This reduced the taxpayer's net investment and had the associated benefit of signalling to the market that high quality international, professional investors were prepared to invest in Irish banks at a critical time for our country.</p>  <p>  In order to facilitate this sale of shares by the State, the Bank concerned made presentations to, and facilitated detailed due diligence by, each of these investors in relation to the Bank's business and investment strategy and progress made in restructuring and repositioning itself, including the Bank's pivotal role in helping revitalise the Irish economy.   These were decisions made by the Board and management of the bank and any associated disclosure obligations were also a matter for the bank.  I note that the sale of shares by the State did not, in itself, result in dilution for other shareholders.  If the Deputy has any concerns that other shareholders were oppressed as part of this transaction then she should consider raising such concerns with the relevant regulatory authorities.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-04-04a.29.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017040400058#WRB02300"><p>As part of the Government's Job Initiative in 2011, I introduced a temporary second reduced VAT rate of 9% in respect of tourism related services, including hotel and holiday accommodation; various entertainment services; the use of sporting facilities; hairdressing services; and various printed matter. This measure was aimed at boosting tourism and the creation of additional jobs in that sector.  The 9% rate was introduced from 1 July 2011 and was due to expire on 31 December 2013. </p>  <p>  In Budget 2014, I decided to retain the 9% rate to support the increased number of jobs already in place and accelerate the creation of new jobs. The rate was further retained in Budget 2015 in light of the job growth in the tourism sector.  However, it was incumbent on the industry to ensure that this VAT relief continued to be passed through fully to the consumer, and that if prices rose any further the case for retaining the 9% rate would diminish.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2017, in light of Brexit, I considered it would be prudent to retain the 9% reduced VAT rate into 2017. I stated that it would act as a buffer for the sector against the weakness in sterling which increases the cost of holidaying in Ireland for British tourists.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Deputy will be aware that the Programme for a Partnership Government, published in May 2016, made a commitment to work towards achieving the tourism policy goals set for 2025 through specific measures including the retention of the 9% VAT rate on tourism related services, but this itself is dependent on prices remaining competitive in the sector.</p></reply>

I have been clear in stating that my primary objective in the disposal of these assets will be recovering the maximum amount of money for the Irish taxpayer. In the case of AIB I have indicated that an IPO (Initial Public Offering) is the optimal route to recouping value from our investment. This will serve to reduce our national debt, de-risk our exposure over time yet at the same time enable us to benefit from a hoped for improvement in the banks fortunes in the medium term. </p>  <p>  The earliest possible IPO window for the bank is the second quarter of 2017 with a second window in the autumn.  Indeed, officials in my Department along with our independent financial adviser, Rothschild, have done considerable preparatory work in this regard.  In December of last year, following a competitive procurement process, three firms were appointed to act as joint global co-ordinators to lead a selling syndicate in preparation for a possible IPO. On the 23 March, I further announced the addition of five joint bookrunners and a co-lead manager to the syndicate. The firms have been appointed for an eighteen month period.  The appointment of the firms as advisers does not signal any intention or obligation for us to proceed with a transaction. Given the improved state of our national finances we are under no pressure to sell, and so any decision to do so will be subject to a number of factors, including favourable market conditions. </p>  <p>  AIB published its 2016 financial results on Thursday, 2 March 2017 and these confirmed the ongoing strong performance by the bank with sustainable profits, strong capital generation and very significant lending into the Irish economy. The proposal of a dividend payment of &euro;250m to ordinary shareholders, almost all of which will accrue to the State, is particularly significant given that it has been nine years since the bank last paid a dividend to its shareholders. These results confirm the view that 2017 represents an appropriate time to consider an IPO for the bank.</p>  <p>  Clearly, in order for us to proceed with the sale of any of our banking assets, we would need to be satisfied that the market is prepared to put a fair and reasonable value on the relevant business, bearing in mind its current performance, its future prospects and the outlook for the Irish economy.  Officials in my Department continue to monitor market conditions and the performance of banking equities with a view to planning appropriate exit strategies, consistent with what is set out in the Programme for a Partnership Government.</p></reply>

In the case of the banks, their accounts are audited by their duly appointed statutory auditor. To my knowledge, no concerns have been raised in any of the audit opinions, contained in the annual reports of these institutions, with respect to the use of this international accounting standard by any of these institutions.</p><p>I note that the Deputy has made a number of contributions around this matter over the past number of weeks.  There seem to be many concepts at play in the Deputy's questions and remarks in the Dail including accounting standards, central bank borrowings, secured lending, unsecured lending, loan sales, asset sales, sub participation arrangements, legal and beneficial ownership of assets and loans, among other concepts. </p><p>In light of the Deputy's contributions and her recognition that this is a technical matter, I would be happy to make my officials available to meet to better understand the concerns raised by the Deputy.</p></reply>

The contact channels include online, self-service, telephony, postal and a network of public offices which facilitate either walk-in services or an appointments service. I am advised by Revenue that it has an ongoing programme of improvement and modernisation of its service offering, tailoring the service to meet the needs of taxpayers and the increasing preference of taxpayers to do their business with Revenue online at their own convenience.  </p>  <p>  I am advised that Revenue actively encourages taxpayers to use the online and self-service contact channels as the quickest, most flexible and most secure facilities to conduct their business with Revenue. This approach is clearly meeting the needs of many taxpayers as reflected by the fact that, for example, there was a 16% increase in 2016 in the number of tax return forms (Form 12) filed on-line by PAYE taxpayers and a 74% increase in 2016 in the number of on-line requests for P21 Balancing Statements. This increase in the preference for on-line services is a feature across the taxpayer base.</p>  <p>  Revenue fully appreciates that some customers will be unable to avail of digital services for any one of a number of reasons. In such circumstances, I am assured by Revenue that they are committed to providing a quality customer service on alternative channels to help those customers understand or comply with their tax obligations and claim their entitlements.  In that regard, and by way of practical evidence of that, I am advised by Revenue that its increased resourcing to support those making contact by telephone led to a significantly improved service to PAYE taxpayers with call-answering rates for 2016 increasing to 97% despite an increase in the overall number of calls received. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that Revenue's customer service approach is fully cognisant of the different needs and preferences of its very diverse customer base.</p></reply>

The measures taken in this regard included a significant legislative programme that I implemented over a number of Finance Acts, as well as implementing a new fuel marker, to strengthen the regulatory framework for the distribution of fuel in Ireland.  Changes in the licensing system and mandatory supply chain reporting by all traders involved in the sale and distribution of fuel have minimised the scope for fraud in the sector. </p>  <p>  With regard to tobacco products, Ireland, like all countries with high tobacco taxes, is an attractive target for smuggling. The potential loss of revenue as a consequence of smuggling is very serious and as such tackling the issue is a key priority for Revenue.  Robust and targeted legislative action has been taken over recent years to strengthen Revenue's powers, including enhanced Revenue powers of search and inspection. The Government will continue to ensure that all legislative action necessary to combat illicit tobacco trade will be taken. </p>  <p>  On the alcohol side, duties provide a financial incentive for alcohol fraud, but there is little evidence of large scale illegal activity at present. Illicit trade in alcohol can occur through the illegal diversion of untaxed alcohol onto the market and also through the illegal production of counterfeit alcohol and Revenue is very alert to these risks.  Revenue's action is based on intelligence on criminal activity, risk based examination of commercial traffic and of stock in retail premises.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that Revenue's strategies have been very successful, and I am assured that action in these areas will continue to be a high priority.</p></reply>

The advisory enterprise supports in relation to business planning will be particularly important in assisting SMEs to diversify their exports so as to reduce their exposure to the UK; and/or re-price their products/services (if possible); and/or restructure their cost bases so they can continue trading with the UK during a period of weaker sterling.  These advisory supports will also be important in informing SMEs of private market financial supports and existing State supports that are available.</p>  <p>  Last year, the Department of Finance conducted macro-economic analysis on the impact of Brexit, which fed into the Brexit measures in Budget 2017.  My Department is also currently working with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland to assess the potential impact of Brexit on the SME sector.  It is not possible at this time to make definitive predictions of the impact of Brexit on SMEs given the uncertainties surrounding the post Brexit relationship between the UK and the EU.</p></reply>

It has to be clarified that these were concerns rather than "complaints" per se and they echo the sentiments of some other Member States. In fact the Chairpersons of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) also voiced similar sentiments recently.</p></reply>

The Commission has said publicly that the recovery amount may be reduced if other countries were to require Apple to pay more taxes.</p>  <p>  I would say that the Commission's State Aid Decision does not change the taxing rights in other countries.

While I will not comment on the tax affairs of individual taxpayers, there are a number of reasons why using this data to assert a company's effective tax rate may create a misleading picture.</p>  <p>  Calculating a company's effective tax rate requires looking at a company's profits as calculated under Irish tax law and the amount of tax charged on those profits under Irish tax law.  This information is not included in the public country by country reports.  For this reason caution is needed when using the country by country information when commenting on a company's tax affairs. </p>  <p>  For example, the profit figures filed in reports under CRD IV reports generally relate to profit calculated for accounting purposes. Companies however do not pay tax on their accounting profits, but rather on their taxable profits. There are a variety of legitimate differences in how these figures are calculated in ever country.  For example, all capital expenditure is treated differently for accounting and tax calculations. </p>  <p>  Similarly, the "tax on profit or loss" figure in the publicly disclosed information may relate to tax actually paid over to Revenue rather than the tax charge suffered by the company.  For example, where a company has losses carried forward from a previous year, this would reduce the amount of tax that must be paid over but does mean the company is not subject to a tax charge on its profits.</p>  <p>  Officials in my Department are examining the report in more detail and have arranged a meeting with Oxfam to discuss the report's contents.</p>  <p>  I would like to point out that all companies in Ireland pay the standard 12.5% rate on their trading profits which are generated in Ireland.  Higher rates of 25% and 33% apply to certain profits.   My Department has previously worked with Mr Seamus Coffey, who is currently conducting a review on the corporation tax code, on a technical paper to provide clarity about the seemingly conflicting figures and methodologies for the effective rate of tax paid by companies in Ireland.  This paper found that the effective rate paid nationally is between 10.3% and 10.7%.</p>  <p>  I strongly reject the report's suggestion that Ireland is a tax haven.  There is no clear analysis as to why Ireland would be considered as such and we do not meet any of the vague criteria that the report suggests are indicative of tax havens.  The report itself notes that international institutions, such as the IMF and OECD, do not consider Ireland to be a tax haven.</p></reply>

The test applied is that he/she considers it likely that a majority of those voting would express a wish that Northern Ireland should cease to be part of the United Kingdom and form part of a united Ireland. There is no convincing evidence at present to suggest that a majority of the people of Northern Ireland would opt for a change in its constitutional status. </p>  <p>  The Government is already extensively engaged with all EU Member States and Institutions to build understanding for the imperative of ensuring respect for all provisions of the Good Friday Agreement, including the provision for a border poll. </p>  <p>  In terms of the estimates that the Deputy refers to, the position is that there have been many reports produced by the UK parliament regarding Brexit and its implications.  However, officials in my Department are not aware of any specific estimates of costs that could relate to the Irish Exchequer. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, in the absence of any prospect of a border poll in the near future, my Department does not have any active plans to carry out the research specifically referred to by the Deputy.</p></reply>

This means that search and retrieval processes can be conducted efficiently and expeditiously so as to ensure that NAMA meets its statutory obligation to respond to FOI requests within the requisite deadline of four weeks.  NAMA's records management policy enables the extensive records' search required under FOI to be carried out with more efficiency, given that the volume of searchable records is reduced by the deletion of records of transitory or short-term value.  I am advised that NAMA's records management policy and approach has been endorsed by its internal auditors, PwC.</p>  <p>  The deletion of ephemeral or transitory records on an ongoing basis is in accordance with established best practice from corporate governance, records management and FOI perspectives.  I am advised that NAMA would not be able to meet its legal obligations under the FOI Act to respond to requests within the statutory deadlines in the absence of effective records management policies and practices.</p>  <p>  A requirement of NAMA's Records Management Policy is that records that have a business or long-term value, including email records, are stored in central document repositories, including NAMA's Document Management System (DMS) and its file server.  These repositories are searched in response to FOI requests.</p>  <p>  NAMA's policy is to retain the mail servers of staff for at least one year after their departure from the Agency.  This is to facilitate business continuity and to enable line managers to ensure that business and long-term value records are saved to the appropriate repository.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-04-04a.79.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017040400059#WRC00800"><p>In addition to the challenges posed to Ireland by the withdrawal of the UK from the EU, the Government recognises that there will also be opportunities for Ireland arising from Brexit.  The Government is keen to maximise those opportunities where possible.  In that regard, international financial services (IFS) has been identified as an area of potential opportunity arising from Brexit in relation to the movement of business from existing UK locations in addition to other businesses seeking a new EU location post-Brexit.</p>  <p>  In March 2015, the Government launched the lFS2020 Strategy, a whole-of-Government approach to further driving the growth and development of the IFS sector in Ireland.  The Strategy, led by a dedicated Minister of State for Financial Services Eoghan Murphy, is supported by all relevant public and private sector stakeholders who work closely and successfully on a joint basis.</p>  <p>  The IFS2020 Strategy combines long-term strategic thinking with the flexibility to react to domestic and international developments, including Brexit.  The Strategy, through annual Action Plans, provides a clear framework to maximise any opportunities that might arise from Brexit by ensuring that Ireland's offering for businesses considering a move of their activities out of the UK can compete with other potential locations.  The annual Action Plans enable a tailored response to deal with these challenges and opportunities as they arise.</p>  <p>  A key strategic priority of IFS2020 is the promotion of Ireland as a location for IFS and world class innovative products and services.  The 2017 Action Plan continues to emphasise the strong commitment to this strategic priority.  This Plan, which was developed in close consultation with all IFS stakeholders, was launched by Minister of State Murphy at the European Financial Forum in Dublin Castle last January.  The 2017 Action Plan places a strong focus on Brexit: it underpins the Action Plan and also features within the suite of 40 individual measures to be actioned in 2017 by the different public and private sector stakeholders involved in IFS2020.</p>  <p>  One of the key measures contained within the Action Plan for 2017 relates to the public sector financial services sub-group led by my Department.  This sub-group has a strategic and prioritised approach to the implications of the UK EU referendum on the financial services sector, including IFS.  In that regard, it works closely with the Cabinet Committee on Brexit.</p>  <p>  The IFS Ireland banner brand was a key IFS2020 deliverable which was launched in 2016.  The banner brand is the shared identity which all IFS stakeholders   Government and industry bodies use to promote Ireland on the international stage using a clearly identifiable logo and single approach across the public and private sectors.  An accompanying website, www.ifsireland.com, has also been established.  Over recent months, Minister of State Murphy has launched the banner brand in the North American and Asian markets.</p>  <p>  An IFS2020 Communications sub-group has also been established to further progress and develop IFS messaging to ensure the promotion of Ireland's IFS sector is maximised.  This Communications sub-group continues to work both with private and public stakeholders to ensure that there is consistent messaging on Ireland's IFS offering.</p>  <p>  The Action Plan for 2017 also commits the public sector and industry to actively engage on overseas promotion and marketing of the IFS sector to ensure a co-ordinated and strategic approach to the promotion and marketing of Ireland as a centre of excellence for IFS.  This includes a co-ordinated programme of overseas trade missions, a shared public sector/industry IFS calendar, the promotion of IFS as part of ministerial visits to key financial services markets, including the St. Patrick's Day visits programme, and the deployment of the IFS Ireland banner brand by IFS industry associations.</p>  <p>  Since the UK EU referendum in June 2016, Minister of State Murphy has undertaken significant visits to Asia (twice) and North America (twice), as well as numerous IFS engagements in London and Europe.  The main purpose of such visits is to promote Ireland as a destination for financial services investment.  Minister of State Murphy has used these visits to engage with key public sector and industry stakeholders to raise the profile of Ireland's IFS sector as part of the Government's ongoing programme of engagement in response to Brexit.</p>  <p>  As part of the promotion of Ireland as a location for financial services, Minister of State for Financial Services Murphy hosted the second annual European Financial Forum (EFF) in Dublin Castle on 24 of January 2017 which attracted approximately 700 delegates from 30 countries representing around 400 organisations.  As organisations consider their Brexit contingency plans, the Forum provided a unique opportunity to promote Ireland's IFS sector.  Next year's EFF will be held at the end of January, 2018.</p>  <p>  Budget 2017 allocated additional resources to the enterprise agencies, IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, in the context of Brexit.  The enterprise agencies continue to identify potential sources of new Brexit-related investment and are actively pursuing opportunities across a number of sectors, including financial services.  IFS2020 is also integrated into the wider Government planning including the Action Plan for Jobs 2017 and the new Trade and Investment Strategy (Ireland Connected) which aim to drive market consolidation and diversification, and improve competitiveness.</p>  <p>  Minister of State Murphy continues to work closely with all public and private sector stakeholders, including the enterprise agencies, to promote Ireland as the location of choice for specialist financial services and to achieve the IFS2020 job creation target of 10,000 net new jobs over its five year lifetime by its target date of 2020.</p></reply>

It fails to acknowledge the Troika's requirement that NAMA redeem 25% (&euro;7.5 billion) of its senior debt by end-2013, a target which could not have been achieved unless NAMA debtors had sold some of the assets under their control.</p>  <p>  The report also fails to acknowledge the fact that NAMA's senior Government-guaranteed debt of &euro;30 billion represented a contingent liability for Irish taxpayers and that it was a major concern for investors and for those lending to Ireland, including the Troika.  In that context, it is unrealistic and na&iuml;ve in the extreme to suggest that debtors and receivers could have withheld all assets from sale until 2017 and that NAMA did not have to reduce its guaranteed debt from an early stage.</p>  <p>  The report also fails to acknowledge that NAMA is required by law to carry out its work expeditiously.  Had NAMA debtors and receivers not sold Irish assets, NAMA would have been accused of hoarding and of preventing market recovery.  It also fails to take account of the impact of NAMA sales in generating recovery in the Irish property market.</p>  <p>  As the Deputies are aware, NAMA's purpose and objectives are set out in the NAMA Act as established by the Oireachtas.

It also calls for the investigation of a new model of community banking that could provide a suite of banking services through the Post Office Network, such as the Kiwibank model in New Zealand, where the Post Office-owned bank provides a comprehensive suite of financial services, from personal loans and bank accounts to credit cards, business banking, and insurance.</p>  <p>  The Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs have undertaken a period of consultation on this matter.  The consultation closed on 29 March.</p>  <p>  The Public Banking Forum of Ireland met with the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs to present their proposals over the period of consultation.  A representative of the Department of Finance attended the meeting.  The Public Banking Forum of Ireland presented an initial document outlining their proposals and noted that a final version of the document would be completed within approximately four weeks.</p>  <p>  The Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, assisted by the Department of Finance, will be producing a report for both the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and the Minister for Finance setting out the conclusions of the investigation into Local Public Banks.

Therefore, while significant progress has been made, due to its scale and complexity, it will take some further time to complete the Examination.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank has indicated that Phase 1 of the Examination is now complete.</p>  <p>  Phase 2 of the Examination is ongoing.  As at December 2016, nine lenders have submitted Phase 2 reports.  The remainder are still engaged in their Phase 2 reviews and interim reports/status updates have been provided as appropriate.  The Central Bank has invoked its powers to set specific timelines for lenders to complete Phase 2 of the Examination, the last of which will be completed by no later than end September 2017.  By this date, the Central Bank expects all lenders to have identified all impacted accounts and have commenced engagement with most impacted customers.  While the Central Bank expects that Phase 2 will be completed by end September 2017, payment of redress and compensation and the Central Bank's assurance will continue beyond this point for some lenders.  The Central Bank expects lenders to commence Phase 3 and 4 as impacted customers are identified.  However, it is important to note that Phases 3 and 4 (calculation of redress and compensation and implementation of the redress programme) can run concurrently with Phase 2.</p>  <p>  In all, approximately 9,900 customer accounts have been identified as impacted by lenders as part of the Examination as at end February 2017.  The vast majority of customers identified to end February 2017 have already been contacted and rates have been rectified on more than 90% of the accounts requiring such rectification.  In some of these cases, redress and compensation has also been completed.  To end February 2017, approximately &euro;78 million has been paid in redress and compensation to approximately 2,600 impacted customers arising from the Examination.</p></reply>

Examples of these investments include:</p>  <p>  - Activate Capital, which has to date provided funding for approximately 2,325 new residential units in the Dublin area with potential to support construction of up to 11,000 new units;</p>  <p>  - Ardstone Residential Partnership, which has to-date acquired sites with the potential to deliver up to 2,113 new housing units to be delivered over 5-7 years and is targeting a total delivery of up to 3,750 new units;</p>  <p>  - Wilbur Ross Cardinal Commercial Real Estate Mezzanine Debt Fund, with a focus on multiple real estate sectors, providing both pure finance and development capital, has already advanced funding for 1,700 new residential units.</p>  <p>  Activate Capital is a private &euro;500 million fund, which is financed through a &euro;325 million loan note provided from ISIF and a &euro;175 million loan note provided from KKR.  Given Activate Capital has private shareholders, it would not be appropriate to disclose the Fund's commercially sensitive information, including the level of drawdown from the fund.  This approach is in line with the normal banking confidentiality rules that apply to all private companies.</p>  <p>  ISIF is considering a number of additional investments that would support housing provision, including a Housing Investment Fund to fund the delivery of new mixed-tenure residential developments of social and private housing, in a way that is both off-balance sheet and commercial.  ISIF is also engaged in dialogue with a range of Higher Education Institutions ("HEIs") to support HEI capital programmes, emphasising on-campus student accommodation.  ISIF gave a &euro;54m long term debt facility to DCU for student accommodation and overall campus development programme.  ISIF is exploring the possibility of providing equity finance to a number of operators in the build to rent sector.</p>  <p>  Regarding infrastructure to enable residential development, ISIF seeks to work with the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund (LIHAF), Local Authorities and commercial investment.

These are a window in May/June this year and a window in the Autumn.  Fortunately we are under no pressure to sell and the timing will be influenced by market conditions.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) holds the AIB shares on behalf of the State as part of its directed portfolio.  It is important to note that payments from the ISIF to the Exchequer arising from the proceeds of the disposal of the State's shareholdings in the banks are provided for under Section 47, (4) of the NTMA (Amendment) Act 2014.  This legislation allows the Minister to direct the NTMA to make such payments to the Exchequer in respect of the proceeds of any such disposal or to take other steps as set out in the section in respect of such proceeds.</p>  <p>  Regarding the sale of financial assets, these types of transactions do not result in a beneficial impact to the General Government Balance under the European System of Accounts framework.  This is due to the fact that it is classified as a 'financial transaction' whereby it is essentially the exchange of one form of asset (shares, equities, loans) for another kind (cash).  Consequently the sale of any shareholding in AIB would not count as general government revenue.  Thus there will not be an increased capacity to spend on capital projects as a result of the sale of shares in AIB without affecting the general government balance.</p>  <p>  While not improving the deficit, cash proceeds arising from the sale of AIB shares that are transferred to the Exchequer would reduce the Exchequer borrowing requirement and result in lower general government debt.  A lower level of debt is not only beneficial in terms of the fiscal sustainability of the State but would also result in reduced interest payments in future years.  The strategy of reducing the national debt is consistent with the Government policy of repaying the borrowing previously undertaken to finance the recapitalisation of the banking sector during the financial crisis.  As I have previously stated, it is my position that the proceeds from the sale of the State's shareholdings in Irish banks, including AIB, will be used to reduce the outstanding level of public debt.</p></reply>

My Department has received a number of such proposals from both the Irish League of Credit Unions and from the Credit Union Development Association.  Proposals from both representative bodies, in relation to the funding of social housing, are at various stages of development.  While the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government is the Department primarily responsible for the formulation and implementation of policy and for the preparation of legislation in relation to housing, any such proposals would require approval of the Registrar of Credit Unions at the Central Bank before they could be implemented.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank has informed me that it has received information regarding proposals for credit unions to provide funding for social housing and is currently engaging with the sector on those proposals.  It further stated that while it does not comment on specific proposals, such investments could be facilitated by future regulations made by the Central Bank, where appropriate.  The Central Bank also stated that it is willing to consider the type of regulations that would be required to facilitate such proposals.  However, the Central Bank's key consideration in evaluating such proposals is its statutory mandate to ensure the protection of members' savings by credit unions and to ensure the well-being of the sector generally.</p>  <p>  Officials from both my Department and the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government have met with the representative bodies on a number of occasions to examine how credit unions can assist in the area of social housing.  Officials from both Departments have also met with the Central Bank.  Separately, communication is ongoing between the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government and my Department.</p>  <p>  On 1 January 2016 I commenced the final sections of the Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012 (2012 Act) following discussions with credit union representative bodies.  Following commencement of the legislation, the Central Bank introduced the Credit Union Act 1997 (Regulatory Requirements) Regulations 2016, regarding a number of areas including savings, borrowing, lending, investments and liquidity.</p>  <p>  Investment regulations made specific reference to section 43 of the Act and to further classes of investments in which a credit union may invest its funds.  The regulations provide that investments in projects of a public nature include, but are not limited to, investments in social housing projects.  The Central Bank will review the investment regulations for credit unions, including a public consultation, in 2017.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding any potential changes that may be made to the regulations, the legislative requirement for credit unions to ensure investments do not involve undue risk to members' savings will remain the overriding factor which must inform all credit union investment decisions.</p></reply>

Specifically these provisions allow for temporary deviations from the required structural budgetary adjustment, subject to strict conditions.</p>  <p>  The harmonised methodology for calculating the economic cycle used in the implementation of the SGP remains an area with limitations within the fiscal rules.  My Department has secured useful changes to this methodology over the years by consistently raising concerns and objections at European level.  These changes have partially compensated for the reality that the harmonised methodology is not suitable for small open economies.  My Department continues to advocate for improvements in the harmonised methodology and will continue to engage constructively on this and other relevant technical issues.</p>  <p>  The fiscal rules are designed to promote budgetary discipline and underpin sustainable economic growth.  While Ireland's economy is growing and debt is on a downward trajectory, the debt level is still comparably high and caution must be exercised due to the potential of rollover risk should interest rates increase.  We are a small and very open economy in a world that has more risks than usual.  Compliance with the fiscal rules underpins the Government's objective of maintaining sound public finances.</p>  <p>  In addition, I announced, in Budget 2017, a lower debt target of 45 per cent of GDP that should be achieved in the mid-to-late 2020s.  This will help to provide an additional fiscal 'shock absorber' capacity to the public finances to help deal with shocks to the economy, including the impact of Brexit.  This will complement the contingency or 'rainy day' fund to be established following the achievement of a balanced budget in 2018 which will help provide a further counter-cyclical buffer.</p></reply>

Lenders may only commence legal proceedings for repossession of the borrower's primary residence after it follows a number of steps, including making every reasonable effort under the CCMA to agree an alternative restructure arrangement (ARA) with the borrower.</p>  <p>  The CCMA recognises that it is in the interests of borrowers and lenders to address financial difficulties as speedily, effectively and sympathetically as circumstances allow.  The Central Bank has the power to administer sanctions for a contravention of the CCMA under Part IIIC of the Central Bank Act 1942.</p>  <p>  Last year I wrote to the Governor of the Central Bank to request that an assessment be undertaken of the range of available sustainable restructure solutions offered by banks and non-bank entities.  The Central Bank completed its assessment and their report is published on the Department of Finance website.  The assessment finds a comprehensive range of available restructuring solutions being offered and delivered by both bank and non-bank entities and notes considerable progress in addressing mortgage arrears since the peak.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware of many other Government initiatives aimed at resolving the mortgage arrears issue, including:</p>  <p>  - personal insolvency legislation and the Court review of personal insolvency arrangements (PIAs), which include the primary dwelling, that have been rejected by a majority of creditors;</p>  <p>  - overhaul of bankruptcy rules;</p>  <p>  - establishment of a mortgage-to-rent scheme;</p>  <p>  - making available to indebted borrowers free access to professional advice about mortgage resolution options the Abhaile Scheme.</p>  <p>  Finally Mortgage Arrears and Restructures Data released by the Central Bank on 16 March showed that to end-Q4 2016, the number of Principal Dwelling House (PDH) mortgage accounts in arrears has declined for the past fourteen quarters.  Almost 121,000 PDH accounts were also classified as restructured, of which 87% were reported to be meeting the terms of their arrangement.</p></reply>

In fact, the Chairpersons of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) also voiced similar sentiments recently.</p>  <p>  In general terms, the Government will continue, through IDA Ireland, to promote the attractiveness of Ireland as a location of choice for financial service firms that are considering moving out of London or those firms not currently based in Europe that are considering a move into the EU after a UK Brexit.  Both Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland are in close contact with their clients on the challenges and opportunities that Brexit presents.  We will, for example, continue to implement our clear strategy for driving growth in the financial services sector and we will maximise any opportunities that might arise.</p>  <p>  Ireland has a successful track record of competing for, and winning, global foreign direct investment.  One of the key pillars of that success is the growth of the International Financial Services Sector, in particular over the past 30 years.  The continued successful development of the financial services sector in Ireland is a priority for the Government.</p>  <p>  In March of 2015, the Government launched the lFS2020 Strategy, a whole-of-Government approach to further driving the growth and development of the IFS sector in Ireland.  The IFS2020 Strategy represents a clear and coherent plan for driving further growth in the IFS sector.  The Strategy, led by a specifically appointed Minister of State for Financial Services is supported by all relevant public and private sector stakeholders.</p>  <p>  In terms of the vision underpinning the Strategy, we want Ireland to be recognised as a global location of choice for specialised international financial services, building on our strengths in talent, technology, innovation and excellent client service while also focusing on capturing on new opportunities in a changing market and embracing the highest forms of governance.</p>  <p>  The IFS2020 Strategy combines long-term strategic thinking with the flexible tools to react to any domestic and international developments occurring over the period, including Brexit.  The Strategy, through a series of annual Action Plans over its life, provides a clear framework to maximise any opportunities that might arise from Brexit.  The annual Action Plans enable a tailored response to deal with these challenges and opportunities as they arise.  The IFS2020 Action Plan for 2017 was developed in close consultation with all IFS stakeholders.  It was launched at the European Financial Forum in Dublin Castle January of 2017 by Minister of State Murphy.  The 2017 Action Plan places a strong focus on Brexit and it underpins the Action Plan for 2017 while also featuring within the suite of 40 individual measures to be actioned in 2017.</p>  <p>  Since the UK EU referendum of last June, Minister of State Murphy has undertaken a significant number of visits overseas to promote Ireland as a destination of choice for financial services investment.  Opportunities in the IFS sector in Ireland were also strongly reflected in the key messages from all Government Ministers during the Saint Patrick's Day overseas programme of engagements and these will be followed-up in due course by IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland.</p>  <p>  An IFS2020 Communications sub-group consisting of relevant Government Departments and State Agencies has been established to develop and promote messaging on Ireland as a location for financial services.  This Communications sub-group continues to work both with private and public stakeholders to ensure that there is consistent messaging on Ireland's IFS offering.</p>  <p>  In regard to infrastructure capacity, there is a strong pipeline of commercial property solutions coming to the market in Dublin.  There is currently about 3.5 million square foot of commercial office stock under construction with about a further 1 million square foot under refurbishment.  There is approximately a further 5 million square foot of commercial office space with full planning permission for future developments within the greater Dublin area, along with competitive property solutions coming on stream throughout the regions.</p>  <p>  The Government's Housing Strategy aims to boost housing supply by at least 25,000 per annum by 2020.  NAMA has become an active funder of the housing market and plans to build more than 20,000 new homes.  The Strategy also includes an investment of &euro;200 million to support the development of large sites and measures to speed up the planning process for larger developments.</p>  <p>  We have good air connections with the rest of the world especially Europe and, of course, the very large number of flights to and from London and the wider UK.  Specifically, Dublin Airport offers direct flights to almost all of the major North American financial centres in addition to flights to Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Istanbul and (from this year) Doha with extensive onward connections to Asia.  Shannon airport offers direct flights year round to Boston and New York (JFK and Newark).</p>  <p>  International schooling is available in Ireland.  This international schooling includes international Baccalaureate education.  One of the measures in the 2017 Action Plan is that relevant Departments and agencies will continue to monitor the provision of international schooling in Ireland.</p></reply>

This review was carried out jointly by the Department of Finance and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and was approved by Government on 19 July 2016.  The Report sets out an assessment of the current framework and makes recommendations to provide certainty regarding the future regime.</p>  <p>  The key recommendations contained in the report are:</p>  <p>  - That coverage of the Insurance Compensation Fund will be extended to include third party motor insurance claims in the event of a liquidation of an insurer.</p>  <p>  - The level of cover from the Insurance Compensation Fund for third party motor insurance claims will be increased from 65% to 100% in line with that currently provided by the Motor Insurers' Bureau of Ireland.</p>  <p>  - The increased coverage of the Insurance Compensation Fund will be funded by a direct contribution to the Insurance Compensation Fund from the motor insurance industry via the Motor Insurers' Bureau of Ireland, to the value of 35% of the third party motor insurance claims.</p>  <p>  Work is underway on the implementation of the report's recommendations, including the drafting of amendments to the Insurance Acts.  As part of this process my Department has consulted with the relevant stakeholders.  In particular there have been discussions with industry about options for alternative funding arrangements which would provide greater predictability about their financial exposure.</p>  <p>  It is expected that a legislative proposal will be brought to Government for approval in the coming months.</p></reply>

The preliminary estimate for full-year GDP growth in 2016 is 5.2 per cent based on National Accounts data for the fourth quarter of the year.</p>  <p>  Importantly, domestic demand made a strong positive contribution to growth in 2016 with consumption increasing by 3.0 per cent in 2016.  This is crucial as domestic sectors are both jobs-rich and tax-rich.  What's more, the exporting sector appears to be holding up reasonably well despite the weakness in sterling.</p>  <p>  The economic recovery is perhaps most clearly evident in the labour market where we have now had seventeen successive quarters of employment growth.  Employment in the fourth quarter of 2016 increased by 3.3 per cent year-on-year, equivalent to 65,100 new jobs.  The number of people in employment has exceeded the 2 million mark since Q2 2016 and is now at its highest level since Q4 2008.  Encouragingly, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate fell to 6.6 per cent in February, down from a peak of over 15 per cent in 2012.</p>  <p>  However, there are several sources of uncertainty which could negatively impact on the economic outlook.  In particular, the UK's decision to leave the EU has added to concerns about the international outlook while the change in policy direction by the new US administration has also added to concerns about the international economy.  Weaker than expected trading partner growth would negatively impact on Irish growth through reduced exports.</p>  <p>  This uncertainty highlights the importance of prudent management of the public finances and of competitiveness-oriented policies that would help the Irish economy to weather any global economic downturn that may emerge.</p>  <p>  In summary, I am confident that significant economic progress can be made in the years ahead.  However, this is critically contingent upon implementing appropriate polices and that is what the Government intends to do.</p></reply>

NAMA was established to carry out a commercial mandate and it recruited the expertise that it needed to conduct its business in a professional manner.</p>  <p>  The decision of the Oireachtas in 2009 to allow NAMA to carry out its functions in an independent manner has been vindicated by its strong performance since inception.  It has made major progress in eliminating Irish taxpayers' contingent liability of &euro;30 billion which arose from the senior debt issued in order to acquire bank loan portfolios.  As of today, 95% of that senior debt has been redeemed and NAMA has indicated that it expects that all of it to be redeemed by the end of 2017.  NAMA also expects to redeem its subordinated debt by March 2020 and to produce a surplus currently estimated at &euro;2.3 billion by the time it completes its work.</p>  <p>  NAMA has also made a major contribution in driving the development of commercial and residential accommodation in the Dublin Docklands SDZ.  This will attract foreign direct investment into Ireland and will create a substantial number of jobs.</p>  <p>  NAMA has made a significant contribution to social and economic development in other respects also and in particular in the area of social housing where it has worked closely with its debtors and receivers, with the Housing Agency, with local authorities and with Approved Housing Bodies to maximise the delivery of social housing.  It also established NARPs as an innovative model to expedite social housing delivery.  NARPS has significantly reduced the up-front capital costs for local authorities in the delivery to date of over 2,370 residential units for social housing.</p>  <p>  NAMA also played a key role in the resolution of unfinished housing estates within the State.  In 2010 NAMA had exposure to 332 unfinished housing estates.  That has now reduced to 11 unfinished estates at this stage and they are expected to be resolved by end-2017.</p>  <p>  I would also point out that NAMA is seeking to facilitate and fund the delivery of 20,000 homes over the period from 2016 to 2020, subject to commercial viability.  Since 2014, NAMA funding has facilitated the delivery of 4,700 units by its debtors and receivers.</p>  <p>  I have stated consistently that I support the work of NAMA and I have full confidence that the Board and management of NAMA are achieving their commercial mandate in accordance with the NAMA Act.</p></reply>

The annual Census of Industrial Production, which is a component of SBS, is based on survey returns from a sample of about 2,000 industrial enterprises, combined with estimates for other enterprises based on Revenue data.  Similarly, the Annual Services Inquiry is based on survey returns from a sample of about 8,000 service enterprises and combines this with Revenue data to give the overall estimates.</p><p>The sample returns from each of these two surveys give an indication of whether the enterprise is involved in exporting goods or services.

The Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the performance of his functions under the Acts and the making of valuations for rating is his sole responsibility. I, as Minister for Justice and Equality, have no role in decisions in this regard. Having a modern valuation base is very important for the levying of commercial rates on a fair and equitable basis across all economic sectors. This has been the policy of successive Governments for many years and is the express purpose of the National Revaluation Programme now being rolled out by the Valuation Office. The current phase of the national revaluation programme, known as &quot;REVAL 2017&quot; covers the revaluation of all rateable properties in counties Longford, Leitrim, Roscommon, Westmeath, Offaly, Kildare, Sligo, Carlow and Kilkenny, where a revaluation is being undertaken for the first time in over 150 years. The revaluation in these counties will be completed in September 2017 and will become effective for rating purposes from 2018 onwards and the programme will then be extended to other counties. The revaluation provisions in the Valuation Acts 2001-2015 provide for the revaluation of all rateable property within a rating authority area so as to reflect changes in values due to economic factors, differential movements in property values or other external factors such as infrastructural changes in the vicinity of a property and changes in the local business environment.</p><p>Revaluation is an important instrument in redressing historical anomalies in relation to commercial rates for both urban and rural properties and between particular classes of property within a local authority area. Following revaluation there is a much closer and more uniform relationship between contemporary rental values of property and their commercial rates liability. In essence, the exercise aims to ensure that each ratepayer bears a fair share of the rates burden relative to the modern rental value of the property that they occupy. In fact, the general outcome of the revaluations conducted to date by the Valuation Office has been that about 60% of ratepayers have had their liability for rates reduced following a revaluation and about 40% had an increase, a pattern which is most welcome and is expected to be replicated elsewhere as the programme advances.</p><p>The Valuation Act 2001 provides that all buildings and lands used or developed for any purpose are rateable. The basic premise under the Act is that all properties (including buildings) and all developed land are rateable unless expressly exempted under Schedule 4 to the Act. Included in the business category would be all commercial properties across the entire economic spectrum and would typically include such entities as retail outlets; industrial units; office premises and property in the hospitality sector such as hotels and licensed premises which when taken together form the vast majority of commercial property liable for rates. On the other hand, Schedule 4 contains a list of property types which are exempt from rates such as domestic residential premises; places of public religious worship; non-profit making educational institutions; public healthcare property; agricultural land and farm buildings; and property occupied by charitable organisations. </p><p>It is important to bear in mind that pending the revaluation of all commercial properties in a local authority area, revisions of the valuation of individual properties will continue to be carried out by the Valuation Office for which there is express provision in Part 6 of the Valuation Act 2001 (as amended). The revision process, which is quite separate from the revaluation programme, provides for the updating of valuations on the existing valuation list between revaluations so that new properties can be valued and added to the list, improved and extended properties can have their valuations updated, and properties that have demolished in whole or in part can have their valuations amended or struck out as appropriate.</p><p>The following Table sets out the number of properties currently undergoing revaluation in each of the nine rating authority areas. This is an estimated number as new properties are coming on-stream throughout the process and non-rateable properties are being removed from the valuation lists. As already indicated, this is the first general revaluation of all properties in each of the nine counties since the mid-nineteenth century. However, the valuation of some individual properties in each county would have been revised under Part 6 of the Act, as new properties were added to the valuation lists, existing properties extended or properties no longer rateable removed from the lists. I am advised by the Commissioner of Valuation that there is no requirement in the legislation for the categorisation of rateable properties by business sector and accordingly that information of the number of properties being revalued by business category is not available.<table><tr><th>County Council Rating Authority Area</th><th>Estimated Number of Properties Undergoing Revaluation</th></tr><tr><td>Carlow</td><td>2,000</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>5,100</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td>3,000</td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim</td><td>970</td></tr><tr><td>Longford</td><td>1,450</td></tr><tr><td>Offaly</td><td>2,400</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon</td><td>2,100</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td>2,200</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath</td><td>2,970</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>22,190</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the performance of his functions under the Acts and the making of valuations for rating is his sole responsibility. I, as Minister for Justice and Equality, have no role in decisions in this regard. Under Irish law there is a distinct separation of function between the valuation of rateable property and the setting and collection of commercial rates. The amount of rates payable by a ratepayer in any year is a product of the rateable valuation set by the Commissioner of Valuation, multiplied by the Annual Rate on Valuation (ARV) decided annually by the elected members of each local authority. </p>  <p>  Having a modern valuation base is very important for the levying of commercial rates on a fair and equitable basis across all economic sectors. This has been the policy of successive Governments for many years and is the express purpose of the National Revaluation Programme now being rolled out by the Valuation Office.

Section 48 provides that the method of determining a property's value generally for revaluation purposes is "net annual value". Net annual value is specifically defined as the rental value for which one year with another, the building might, in its actual state, be reasonably expected to let from year to year, on the assumption that the probable average annual cost of repairs, insurance and other expenses (if any) that would be necessary to maintain the property in that state, and all rates and other taxes in respect of the property, are borne by the tenant of the property. </p>  <p>  I am advised by the Commissioner of Valuation that in accordance with the above provisions in the legislation, and in keeping with best practice internationally and well-established valuation principles and case law arising from the independent Valuation Tribunal and the higher courts, various methodologies may be used in estimating the net annual value of a rateable property. The most common valuation methodology used during a revaluation is the "comparative" method which employs direct comparison with other similar properties in the same rating area based on the rental evidence provided by occupiers to the Valuation Office or otherwise available to the Valuation Office. This method is used in relation to the valuation of retail properties, offices and industrial units. However, in some sectors of the business community, such as the hospitality sector, there may be few rental transactions and a paucity of direct comparative evidence of rental values. In these instances, what is known as the "receipts and expenditure" method of valuation is used where trading accounts are analysed to arrive at the rent which a hypothetical tenant might be reasonably expected to expend on leasing the property. Another method of valuation used from time to time in relation to specialist or unique properties, depending on the particular circumstances and type of property involved, is the "contractor's method" where the notional cost of construction, allowing for depreciation as appropriate, and the value of the site are used to arrive at the net annual value. There are no plans at this time to depart from the use of these standard valuation methodologies.</p>  <p>  In calculating the net annual value of property being revalued under "REVAL 2017", the Valuation Office uses rental information pertaining to the period around 30 October 2015, which is date by reference to which the value of every relevant property is determined in accordance with the Valuation Orders for the nine counties concerned. In this regard, I am advised that upward-only rent reviews were not a consideration in the analysis of rental transactions by the Valuation Office as upward-only rent review provisions in commercial leases were prohibited in leases entered into after 28 February 2010 which is the date that the provisions of Section 132 of the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009 came into force. Accordingly, it was no longer possible to use upward-only rents following enactment of that rent review legislation.</p>  <p>  The general outcome of the revaluations conducted to date by the Valuation Office has been that about 60% of ratepayers have had their liability for rates reduced following a revaluation and about 40% had an increase and which is expected to be replicated elsewhere as the National Revaluation Programme advances. Regarding the suggestion that increases of up to 400% in the rates burden have occurred, while such a level of increase may have occurred in some very isolated cases, I am advised by the Valuation Office that increases of this magnitude would be a rarity with only a small number of properties having their valuations increased to such a level. Possible reasons for significant increase where they occur would be that the valuation of some of these properties had not been revised to take account of improvements, extensions, etc. for some considerable time or where the valuations were historically low in comparison with the general level of valuations on that valuation list. Additionally, some properties may have undergone extensive refurbishment that was not reflected in the valuation immediately before the revaluation that is now in train. </p>  <p>  There is an extensive process to cater for ratepayers who are dissatisfied with the proposed valuations they receive from the Valuation Office. In this regard, a dissatisfied person can make representations to the Valuation Office within 40 days of the date of issue to them of the certificate of proposed valuation. The Valuation Office will consider the representations and may or may not change the proposed valuation depending on the circumstances of each individual property. If any ratepayer is still dissatisfied with the final valuation to be placed on their property, they have a right to lodge a formal appeal to the Valuation Tribunal, which is an independent statutory body established for the purpose of hearing appeals against decisions of the Commissioner of Valuation.</p></reply>

Under this legislation, it is an offence for a learner permit holder to drive unaccompanied by a qualified person, for which the learner permit holder will be issued with a Fixed Charge Notice, which, on payment, will result in a minimum of 2 penalty points increasing to 4 penalty points on conviction. </p>  <p>  There is a continuing problem with learner drivers who persist in driving unaccompanied despite this practice being illegal. Section 39 of the Road Traffic Act 2016 amends the Road Traffic Act 1961, making it an offence for the owner of a vehicle to allow their vehicle be driven by a learner driver driving unaccompanied. The section has yet to be commenced. The question of responsibility regarding owners who knowingly allow learners to drive their cars unaccompanied was highlighted during the passage of the 2016 Act through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Minister Ross accepted an amendment proposed to the Bill by Deputy Munster with regard to unaccompanied learner drivers so that people who knowingly facilitate this offence can be prosecuted. Section 39 has yet to be commenced. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that road traffic enforcement is an operational matter and, as such, is the responsibility of the Garda Commissioner. I am advised that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Roads Policing Operations Plan 2017 incorporates a programme of high visibility road safety and enforcement operations, carried out in partnership with other state agencies. The focus of the Roads Policing Operations Plan for 2017 is on the most vulnerable road user categories, including learner permit holders. </p>  <p>  Garda operations specifically target road use behaviour known to contribute significantly to collisions, including speeding. Road traffic legislation is also enforced as part of the day to day duties of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Both targeted and general methods of enforcement have a valuable role to play in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's enforcement programme, which targets locations with a view to preventing the commission of offences, detecting errant motorists, changing their behaviour and ultimately reducing death and injuries on our roads. </p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 also sets out key strategic objectives for Roads Policing which will inform and guide An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s Road Policing plans over the 5 years. The Deputy is no doubt aware of the significant investment in Garda resources currently underway. This investment is closely associated with delivery on the Modernisation and Renewal Programme.</p></reply>

The Valuation Act 2001, as amended, provides that all buildings used or developed for any purpose are rateable unless expressly exempted under Schedule 4 to the Act. However, such exemptions specifically include any "domestic premises" except for apartments which may be rateable in certain limited circumstances specified in the Act. </p>  <p>  Arising from Schedule 4 to the Act, domestic premises which provide Bed and Breakfast type accommodation and/or lodgings are not rateable. Similarly, apartments that are used as domestic premises are not rateable. However, apartments which are used for the purposes of the trade of hotel-keeping (referred to as "apart-hotels" in the Act) are rateable. I have no plans at this time to make any changes to Schedule 4 to extend commercial rates to bed and breakfast establishments or to short-term lettings facilitated by the company referred to by the Deputy.</p>  <p>  Under Section 27 of the Valuation Act 2001, as amended, an occupier of a property, a rating authority, an interest holder in a property or the occupier of any other property in that rating authority area may apply in writing to the Commissioner of Valuation for a revision of valuation. Similarly, those parties can also apply to have a property entered on a valuation list. Any party dissatisfied with the outcome of such an application may appeal to the independent Valuation Tribunal. There is also a further right of appeal to the High Court and ultimately to the Supreme Court on a point of law. </p>  <p>  Once a property has been valued and entered on a valuation list, the calculation, collection and payment of rates is entirely a matter for the rating authority concerned.</p></reply>

In that case, the Probation Service had funded the institute cited in the Deputy's question in respect of sex offender treatment services up to 2010.  In 2012 the &ldquo;Safer Lives&rdquo; treatment programme commenced and this national programme is based in Dublin and Cork.  As explained below, the programme is facilitated through PACE, a Community Based Organisation which also operates the Foothold Floating Support Service and Circles of Support and Accountability (CoSA).</p><p>&quot;Safer Lives&quot; is a group-work treatment programme for sex offenders delivered on an inter-disciplinary, co-facilitated model. The &quot;Foothold Floating Support Service&quot; provides<b></b>intensive one-to-one support for men convicted of a sexual offence following release from custody.  It provides practical and emotional support and helps re-integration process.  CoSA consists of an inner circle made up of volunteers in the community offering support to a &quot;core member&quot; (sex offender) on a weekly basis for a specific period.  It is targeted at sex offenders within their community and provides them with assistance while holding them to account for future behaviour. </p><p>&euro;1.721m in funding is committed to the PACE organisation in 2017 which includes the services being provided under the three programmes i.e. &quot;Safer Lives&quot;, Foothold and CoSA.  There is no information available to the Probation Service to the effect that any of these three programmes involve treatment abroad.</p><p>I should also mention that the Probation Service, in co-operation with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Irish Prison Service, Tusla and local housing authorities work closely using the Sex Offender Risk Assessment and Management model (SORAM ). Through SORAM, sex offenders are jointly supervised and managed in the community. This work is overseen nationally by a strategic co-located interagency team based in Harcourt Square.</p></reply>

I am assured by the Commissioner that the allocation of Garda&iacute; is continually monitored and reviewed taking into account all relevant factors including crime trends, demographics, and security assessments relating to the area in question so as to ensure optimal use is made of Garda human resources.  It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his or her Division.</p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. </p><p>This plan is on track to be achieved. This year, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves.</p><p>I am advised that, since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, there has been a total intake of some 1,400 new recruits with another 600 scheduled to enter the College by the end of this year. I am informed by the Commissioner that some 839 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide. I am also informed that another 750 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - a net increase of 700 in the total Garda strength since recruitment recommenced. </p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources she needs to allow her to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division, including the Dublin Divisions, in the coming years.</p><p>This investment in personnel is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.  In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan. This investment will facilitate the provision of more effective policing services and I have no doubt that these new resources now coming on stream will see an increase in Garda visibility in our communities.  <b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that as of the 28 February 2017, the latest date for which figures are available, the strength of each Garda Division, District and Station in the Dublin Region, was as set out in the following tables.<table><tr><th colspan="3">DMR East February 2017</th></tr><tr><td>District</td><td>Station</td><td>Total</td></tr><tr><td>Blackrock</td><td>Blackrock</td><td>90</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Dundrum</td><td>84</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Total:</td><td>174</td></tr><tr><td>Dun Laoghaire</td><td>Cabinteely</td><td>32</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Dun Laoghaire</td><td>117</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Shankill</td><td>60</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Total:</td><td>209</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>DMR East Total:</td><td>383</td></tr></table><table><tr><th colspan="3">DMR North February 2017</th></tr><tr><td>District</td><td>Station</td><td>Total</td></tr><tr><td>Balbriggan</td><td>Balbriggan</td><td>67</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Garristown</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Lusk</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Skerries</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Total:</td><td>88</td></tr><tr><td>Ballymun</td><td>Ballymun</td><td>124</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Dublin Airport</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Santry</td><td>78</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Total:</td><td>222</td></tr><tr><td>Coolock</td><td>Coolock</td><td>106</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Malahide</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Swords</td><td>72</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Total:</td><td>208</td></tr><tr><td>Raheny</td><td>Clontarf</td><td>67</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Howth</td><td>26</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Raheny</td><td>74</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Total:</td><td>167</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>DMR North Total:</td><td>685</td></tr></table><table><tr><th colspan="3">DMR North Central February 2017</th></tr><tr><td>District</td><td>Station</td><td>Total</td></tr><tr><td>Bridewell</td><td>Bridewell</td><td>162</td></tr><tr><td>Total: </td><td></td><td>162</td></tr><tr><td>Fitzgibbon Street</td><td>Mountjoy</td><td>190</td></tr><tr><td>Total:</td><td></td><td>190</td></tr><tr><td>Store Street</td><td>Immigration D/Docks</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Store Street</td><td>265</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Total:</td><td>268</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>DMR North Central Total:</td><td>620</td></tr></table><table><tr><th colspan="3">DMR South February 2017</th></tr><tr><td>District</td><td>Station</td><td>Total</td></tr><tr><td>Crumlin</td><td>Crumlin</td><td>103</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Sundrive Road</td><td>59</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Total:</td><td>162</td></tr><tr><td>Tallaght</td><td>Rathfarnham</td><td>63</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Tallaght</td><td>186</td></tr><tr><td>Total:</td><td></td><td>249</td></tr><tr><td>Terenure</td><td>Rathmines</td><td>64</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Terenure</td><td>78</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Total:</td><td>142</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>DMR South Total:</td><td>553</td></tr></table><table><tr><th colspan="3">DMR South Central February 2017</th></tr><tr><td>District</td><td>Station</td><td>Total</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Donnybrook</td><td>107</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Irishtown</td><td>49</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Total:</td><td>156</td></tr><tr><td>Kevin Street</td><td>Kevin Street</td><td>121</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Kilmainham</td><td>72</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Total:</td><td>193</td></tr><tr><td>Pearse Street</td><td>Pearse Street</td><td>290</td></tr><tr><td>Total:</td><td></td><td>290</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>DMR South Central Total:</td><td>639</td></tr></table><table><tr><th colspan="3">DMR West February 2017</th></tr><tr><td>District</td><td>Station</td><td>Total</td></tr><tr><td>Blanchardstown</td><td>Blanchardstown</td><td>148</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Cabra</td><td>62</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Finglas</td><td>108</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Total:</td><td>318</td></tr><tr><td>Clondalkin</td><td>Ballyfermot</td><td>85</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Clondalkin</td><td>90</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Rathcoole</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Total:</td><td>193</td></tr><tr><td>Lucan</td><td>Lucan</td><td>74</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Ronanstown</td><td>97</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Total:</td><td>171</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>DMR West Total:</td><td>682</td></tr></table></p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-04-04a.209.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017040400062#WRF02700"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 113, 115 to 117, inclusive, 119 to 121, inclusive, 123 to 125, inclusive, and 142 together.</p>  <p>  The Deputies will be aware that on 28 March 2017 I made a detailed statement to the House on these matters and endeavoured to answer a range of questions which were put to me.</p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputies that since then I have written to the Chairperson of the Policing Authority in accordance with section 62O(6) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act, 2005 (as amended) to report to me on its oversight of the issues which have arisen in relation to fixed charge notices and mandatory alcohol testing over the coming period.  In particular, I requested that an investigation should be conducted to examine all issues arising, addressing to the extent possible the reasons why the issues have arisen; the incidence and scale of the issues; and the solutions implemented to ensure there is no recurrence.  It is expected that the Authority will engage outside expertise to carry out this work.</p>  <p>  Deputies will appreciate that I need to await the conclusion of the Authority's work in this area before I can give a comprehensive and verified response to some of the issues raised in these Questions.</p>  <p>  An anonymous complaint was made by a person claiming to be a member of the Garda reserve in the Western Region to the Road Safety Authority (RSA), outlining a number of issues which included the operation of Mandatory Alcohol Testing (MAT) checkpoints. </p>  <p>  The RSA forwarded the correspondence to the (then) Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, who wrote to the Garda Commissioner in April 2014. He copied the correspondence and the letter to the Commissioner to Minister Shatter on 11 April, 2014. Minister Shatter wrote to the Garda Commissioner on 16 April, 2014 seeking a full report on the findings of an examination of the allegations.</p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na indicated in a detailed response to my Department in May 2014 that they had looked into the claims regarding MAT checkpoints in the Western Region and they were satisfied that correct procedures were in place to account for MAT checkpoints that ultimately did go ahead and those which did not proceed. The response was general in nature.</p>  <p>  The report indicated that further enquiries were to be conducted, and accordingly the Garda Commissioner was asked by my Department on 18 August, 2014 for an update on this matter. A further Garda report on 8 January, 2015 indicated that it was not possible to consult with the author as they had not been identified and that, given the circumstances, the matter could not be progressed.</p>  <p>  Following a submission of these reports to me on 21 January 2015, a letter issued to the Garda Commissioner at my request, asking that the Commissioner consider whether there was scope for issuing any further instructions from Garda management re day-to-day operations in relation to MAT within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  In response to that letter, a further Garda memo was received dated 2 March 2015. It indicated that the Assistant Commissioner Traffic had been directed to issue an instruction regarding monitoring the mechanisms in place surrounding the operation of MAT checkpoints. </p>  <p>  On 10 June 2016, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na notified my Department that, following an audit of the Southern Region in respect of data from the period 2009-2014, discrepancies had been identified in the breath test data held by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the PULSE system and, consequently, in the data published on the Garda website. That same month, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na directed that a National Audit should take place of all the data recorded on the Garda PULSE system relating to the number of roadside breath tests conducted at MATs in each Garda Division. This audit covered the period 1 January 2009 to 30 June 2016. A notice to this effect was published on An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's website in June 2016. In February this year, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na indicated to my Department that the full results of the breath test statistics' audit would be available by the end of Quarter 2 2017. </p>  <p>  As regards An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's communication of the concerns surrounding the system for recording roadside breath tests to the Policing Authority, I would refer the Deputies to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's public comments on this matter. </p>  <p>  Insofar as the issues concerning Fixed Charge Notices (FCNs) are concerned, my Department was first made aware of a number of errors relating to the Fixed Charge Processing System (FCPS) on 10 June 2016. In a press statement issued on the same date, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na confirmed that it had commenced a review of prosecutions in relation to all fixed charge offences. The letter from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in June 2016 indicated that a number of steps had been taken by them to ensure that no further summonses could be issued in error. They had issued an instruction to the Garda Information Services Centre not to issue any more summonses for not having an NCT certificate and an instruction to all members to (i) withdraw any prosecutions based on summonses which issued where a fixed charge notice should have issued, or where one had already issued and had been paid and (ii) refamiliarise themselves with the FCPS Policy and Procedures manual. They indicated that they were working on a short term IT fix which would be ready within four weeks to ensure that a reoccurrence could not occur and were developing a long term IT solution which would be ready for a PULSE release towards the end of 2016. They also indicated in the letter that in order to establish the extent of the situation, each District Officer had been asked to supply additional information and that the extent of the issue would not be known until that additional information had been received.</p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na subsequently provided a further update to my Department on 14 March 2017 in relation to its review of the errors surrounding fixed charge notices. The letter indicated that the review of all summonses issued in respect of fixed charge notices for the period 1 January 2014 to 27 May 2016 had been completed and that, following consultation with the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, a review of all such summonses dating back to the introduction of fixed charge notices in 2006 was under way.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the full statistics in relation to the FCN review for the period dating back to 2006 were presented by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at its press conference on 23 March 2017. In addition, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also presented at that press conference, for the first time, the figures in relation to the huge disparity between the number of breath tests conducted at MAT checkpoints as per PULSE records, compared to the number of test kits used. The Deputy will appreciate that no further statistics / statistical breakdowns in relation to either issue are available at present.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has confirmed that it has put solutions in place to deal with the procedural and practice issues that have been detected to ensure that such errors do not recur. Specifically, I have been assured by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that a permanent and comprehensive IT solution is now in place to cover the majority of FCPS issues identified and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is satisfied that the errors that occurred cannot be repeated. In the case of breath tests / Mandatory Alcohol Testing, I am informed that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na initially put in place new paper based recording and verification processes, and, in November 2016, a new specific data recording IT upgrade was installed on the Garda PULSE system. The net effect of the new IT upgrade was that personnel now have to record the serial number of the device used for each breath test plus the meter reading before and after the checkpoint was concluded.  Data from the device is now used to verify the total number of breath tests conducted at each checkpoint.</p>  <p>  Insofar as the 14,700 people convicted of road traffic offences in court following the incorrect issuing of a summons are concerned, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has indicated that it is establishing a dedicated support helpline for members of the public with queries in relation to their case. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is also writing to all affected members of the public, explaining what has happened and outlining the solution to rectify the situation. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has indicated that it has been advised by the Director of Public Prosecutions and Courts Service that these 14,700 cases must be brought back before the Courts at Circuit Court level with a view to requesting that the erroneous convictions can be set aside. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has established a dedicated team to this end and is liaising with the Court Services to expedite this process. As such, members of the public affected by the road traffic enforcement errors referred to are requested to await the aforementioned correspondence from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which will provide further clarification on the matter. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that it is unclear at this stage what the total cost to the State of the incorrect issuing of summonses to 14,700 people by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will amount to, as the level of penalties imposed on the people convicted on foot of a summons issued to them arising from an erroneous procedure is not yet known. Many persons convicted (correctly) for a number of offences may have had the offences arising from the erroneous procedure simply taken into consideration, with no additional penalty being imposed. However, persons who were fined, following a conviction for an offence that they should not have received a summons for, will have to be repaid. It is not possible at this stage to estimate the potential cost. I have already outlined that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is actively engaging with the Courts Service in relation to progressing these important matters.</p>  <p>  The Deputies will be aware that in addition to outlining the issues, how they had come to light, and the remedial steps taken so far, at her press conference on 27 March 2017 the Commissioner:</p>  <p>  - announced the restructuring of traffic policing with the creation of a new Roads Policing Unit to be led by Assistant Commissioner Mick Finn;</p>  <p>  - announced the creation of a dedicated team under newly appointed Assistant Commissioner Michael O&rsquo;Sullivan to investigate in detail the MATs issue, including with a view to identifying and holding responsible for their actions any Garda members, whether at junior, supervisory or management level, who acted improperly; and</p>  <p>  - committed to forwarding the report of this investigation to the Policing Authority and Department of Justice and Equality when completed.</p>  <p>  Assistant Commissioner Finn outlined new arrangements agreed with the Medical Bureau on Roads Safety (MBRS) to the effect that body would supply An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with its data on breath-testing devices on a quarterly basis, in order to ensure an independent benchmark against which Garda data can be measured.  The MBRS will shortly be tendering for new breath testing equipment.  New equipment which is available in the market place has the capacity to record the time, GPS location and number of persons breath-tested, and has the capacity to download the information automatically reducing the chances of errors occurring in the data.</p>  <p>  Insofar as other specific information has been sought by Deputies it has not be possible to compile this in the time available but I am seeking this information from the Garda authorities and will communicate further with the Deputies.</p>  <p>  In light of the level of public concern, the Government has today approved the commencement of a process to establish a Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.  The Government has reaffirmed the need for the extensive reform programme already underway within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to continue, and to ensure the work of the oversight bodies is not impeded by the establishment of a Commission.  I set out in my statement earlier today some of the issues that I believe should be addressed.  Drafting of the Terms of Reference will involve consultation with opposition parties and relevant statutory bodies including the Policing Authority, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman and the Garda Inspectorate and I intend to begin these consultations immediately.  Once this consultation process has been completed, I will return to Government with proposals for the establishment of the Commission and draft terms of reference.</p></reply>

The Act distinguishes between the entitlement to citizenship by birth and descent and to the acquisition of citizenship through the naturalisation process.</p>  <p>  In relation to citizenship through birth in the island of Ireland, where a child is born to non-nationals the Act specifies certain residence requirements to be met immediately preceding the birth of the child.  Citizenship through the naturalisation process on the other hand is based, among other things, on the individual having the required lawful residence in the jurisdiction of this State.

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. </p>  <p>  I am informed by the Commissioner that in regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Garda Division. It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his/her Division. The Commissioner has advised that all Garda&iacute;, not simply designated Community Garda&iacute; have a role to play in addressing community policing issues as and when the need arises and, in that sense, community policing involves far more than a single unit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  Community policing is at the heart of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. It provides a means of recognising that every community &ndash; both urban and rural &ndash; has its own concerns and expectations. In this regard I welcome the strong emphasis placed by the Garda Commissioner's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 on further developing and supporting the community policing ethos of the organisation so that Garda&iacute; spend more time in the community, gaining public confidence and trust and providing a greater sense of security. Proposed initiatives include the establishment of local Community Policing Teams (CPTs) headed by an Inspector and made up of Garda&iacute; from across a range of areas to proactively work with the community to prevent and detect crime; and the establishment of Community Safety Fora in every District comprising local Garda&iacute;, local communities and key stakeholders. </p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. This year, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Commissioner, since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, that 839 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide,16 of whom have been assigned to the Kerry Division.  I am also informed that another 750 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - a net increase of 700 in the total Garda strength since recruitment recommenced. </p>  <p>  This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources she needs to allow her to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; including Community Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division, including the Kerry Division, in the coming years.</p>  <p>  This investment in personnel is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.  In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan. This investment will facilitate the provision of more effective policing services and I have no doubt that these new resources now coming on stream will see an increase in Garda visibility in our communities.</p></reply>

These reports include details of convictions for human trafficking-related offences.</p><p>From 2009 until the end of 2015, there have been 48 persons convicted of human-trafficking related offences. 36 of these persons were convicted for offences under Section 3 of the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008, which relates to the trafficking, taking etc. of a child for the purposes of sexual exploitation. The remaining 12 were convicted for related offences including under the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998. Figures for 2016 are close to finalisation and can be provided to the Deputy in due course. These statistics do not include instances where suspected perpetrators of trafficking were prosecuted for other offences or where their illegal activities were disrupted by other means.</p><p>The main law in relation to trafficking in Ireland is The Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008. The 2008 Act<b></b>commenced in June 2008 and specifically prohibits trafficking for sexual and labour exploitation, including sex trafficking and forced labour.  The 2008 Act also criminalises trafficking for the purpose of exploitation consisting of the removal of human organs. The Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) (Amendment) Act 2013 was enacted in July 2013 to facilitate full compliance with the criminal law measures in Directive 2011/36/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council on preventing and combatting trafficking in human beings and protecting its victims, and replacing Council Framework Decision 2002/629/JHA.  Some of the main measures of the 2013 Amendment Act were as follows:</p><p>- to broaden the scope of the definition of &lsquo;exploitation&rsquo; in the 2008 Act to include exploitation consisting of forcing a person to engage in criminal activities (inside or outside the State);</p><p>- to expand the definition of the term &lsquo;labour exploitation&rsquo; to include forced begging;</p><p>- for clarity, to define the term &lsquo;forced labour&rsquo; in line with the definition set out in International Labour Organisation (ILO) Convention No. 29 of 1930 on Forced or Compulsory Labour;</p><p>Since the 2013 Amendment Act, there have been other legislative developments which are relevant to the fight against human trafficking </p><p>The Civil Registration (Amendment) Act 2014 was enacted on 4 December 2014. The Act contains a provision at section 18 to make it more difficult to broker a marriage of convenience thereby protecting vulnerable persons, usually women, from trafficking for the purpose of sham marriages. </p><p>The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 was enacted on 22 February this year, with its main provisions commencing on 27 March. The Act was the most comprehensive and wide ranging piece of sexual offences legislation to be introduced in almost a decade, and makes it an offence for a person to pay, offer or promise to pay, a person for the purpose of engaging in sexual activity with a prostitute.  The person providing the sexual service &ndash; the prostitute &ndash; is not subject to an offence.  The purpose of introducing these provisions is primarily to target the trafficking and sexual exploitation of persons through prostitution. That Act contains, at Section 27, a commitment to Report to the Oireachtas within 3 years on the operation of these provisions.</p><p>Under the Second National Action Plan to Prevent and Combat Human Trafficking in Ireland, which I launched last October, there is a commitment to keep under review the adequacy of legislation to support the prosecution of traffickers. This Action is fulfilled through ongoing monitoring of the efficacy of the current legislation and appropriate consultation with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and is informed by our engagement a range of domestic NGOs and international organisations.</p></reply>

I can inform the Deputy that since then I have written to the Chairperson of the Policing Authority in accordance with section 62O(6) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act, 2005 (as amended) to report to me on its oversight of the issues which have arisen in relation to fixed charge notices and mandatory alcohol testing over the coming period.  In particular, I requested that an investigation should be conducted to examine all issues arising, addressing to the extent possible the reasons why the issues have arisen; the incidence and scale of the issues; and the solutions implemented to ensure there is no recurrence.  It is expected that the Authority will engage outside expertise to carry out this work.  The Deputy will appreciate that we need to await the conclusion of the Authority's work in this area.  </p>  <p>  On the general issue of Garda data, I want to draw a clear distinction between the issues relating to data on alcohol breath testing and the official Recorded Crime Statistics which are published by the Central Statistics Office, as the national statistics agency.  The Garda figures for alcohol breath testing do not form part of the official recorded crime statistics and Deputies will, no doubt, recall that the systems for the production of the official crime statistics have been subject to very close scrutiny in recent years.  The CSO have carried out two comprehensive reviews of Data Quality to underpin the ongoing publication of the official crime statistics, following on recommendations of the Garda Inspectorate.  The latest such review (September 2016) records significant improvements and provides a framework to measure ongoing enhancements to the quality of crime data.  I understand that further reviews of crime data quality are planned by the CSO, and it is important to recognise that the work of the CSO in this area provides us with an important degree of re-assurance that the concerns about crime data, which have been identified by the Garda Inspectorate, are being properly addressed.  Over the last 18 months or so, important upgrades to the PULSE system and new incident recording processes have been implemented which require more detailed verification and supervision of the recording of crime incidents. It is expected that these improvements will support ongoing improvements in the quality of crime data.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will recall that the Garda Inspectorate raised a number of concerns about crime data quality in its Report on Crime Investigation which was published in November 2014.  The Inspectorate made detailed recommendation designed to improve the consistency and accuracy of data within the Garda PULSE system.  Among the steps taken to respond to the concerns identified in the Inspectorate report was the establishment of a Data Quality Team in the Garda Information Services Centre (GISC), as well as measures to strengthen PULSE governance arrangements.  These measures form part of broader steps to take forward the Inspectorate&rsquo;s recommendations, including upgrading the technology for recording of crime and policing activity.  I am advised that this process is ongoing and I have asked the Garda authorities to advise me of the outcome of this work.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-04-04a.295.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017040400065#WRJ01400"><p>Information supplied by the Dublin Airport Authority (DAA) in relation to queue times for arriving passengers at Dublin Airport shows that over 90% of all travellers are processed through immigration control in a matter of minutes with the figures being even higher for passengers of EU nationalities.  This is in the context of passenger numbers at Dublin Airport reaching record levels last year with almost 28 million passengers using the Airport.  On the rare occasions that passengers may experience delays this can be for a variety of reasons including congestion arising in the terminal building due to the number of passengers disembarking from flights at peak daily periods, delayed flights due to weather conditions, or other factors including the conducting of enhanced checks on passengers or current building works in one of the immigration areas which has reduced the space available. </p>  <p>  The allocation of immigration personnel at Dublin Airport is designed to have the maximum number of staff on duty during peak periods.  Every effort is made by immigration officers to exercise their function as speedily as possible consistent with the requirement to protect our borders and facilitate legitimate travellers.  Nonetheless, a very high number of flights within a contracted arrivals time period (which happens frequently at Dublin airport) and the consequent increased passenger numbers within these peak times, can impact on queuing times over these periods.  Although, the immigration authorities at Dublin Airport have no control over the number of flights or their arrival times, they have an excellent relationship with the Dublin Airport Authority and air carriers and work closely together to address queue management issues where they arise so as to ensure that waiting times are kept to a minimum.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that the protection of our borders is a matter of the utmost priority and that checks undertaken on passengers must be thorough and appropriate. Issues may arise that require further processing and checks of individual passengers but every reasonable effort is made to minimise the impact on travellers.  In this context, and in line with developments in other EU Member States, my Department and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to progress a broad series of initiatives to strengthen border security.  For example, since November 2016 an automated connection to INTERPOL&rsquo;s Lost and Stolen Travel Documents database was rolled out to all international airports and seaports and passengers are systematically checked against this database.  This has not had any significant impact on immigration processing times. </p>  <p>  Later this year the Irish immigration authorities will begin to process Advance Passenger Information on flights into the State from outside the EU and preparations are also under way to implement the EU Directive on Passenger Name Records (PNR).  These systems will provide further protection for our borders against crime, terrorism and illegal immigration threats.  In addition, I expect to be in a position to award a contract for the provision of automatic border control (ABC) gates in the next few months and to begin installation at Dublin Airport later in the year.  This facility will be available for EU nationals with e-passports to effectively self-immigrate through the Airport.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department will this year take on the front line checks in Terminal 2 at Dublin Airport (they already carry out this function in Terminal 1 and the Transit area of Terminal 2) which will release further Garda&iacute; for core policing duties.</p></reply>

The recruitment and appointment of the Director of the DSS, and the appointment of DSS staff, is a matter for the Mental Health Commission (a body under the Department of Health) with the approval of the Minister for Health.  My Department does not have any statutory function in relation to the recruitment and appointment of the Director.  <b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p><p>The commencement of Part 8 of the Act, which provides a legislative framework for advance healthcare directives, is a matter for the Minister for Health.</p><p>New administrative processes and support measures, including the setting up of the Decision Support Service within the Mental Health Commission, must be put in place before the substantive provisions of the Act can be commenced.  A high-level Steering Group comprised of senior officials from my Department, the Department of Health and the Mental Health Commission is overseeing the establishment and commissioning of the Decision Support Service and this work is ongoing.  </p><p>It is intended that the key preparations will be put in place during the remainder of this year under the oversight of the Steering Group to allow for commencement orders for the remaining provisions of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 that fall under my remit to be made on a carefully phased basis when the Decision Support Service is ready to roll out the new decision-making support options.  It is not possible at the moment to provide an exact time line for the finalisation of these commencement orders, not least because we will need to have the Director of the Decision Support Service in place to fully ascertain the timeline.  It is expected that the post of Director will be advertised very soon and that the Director will be in place by July.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-04-04a.304.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017040400065#WRJ02000"><p>The Valuation Acts 2001 to 2015 provide for the valuation of all commercial and industrial property for rating purposes.  The Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the performance of his functions under the Acts and the making of valuations for rating is his sole responsibility. I, as Minister for Justice and Equality, have no role in decisions in this regard.  Under Irish law there is a distinct separation of function between valuation of rateable property and setting and collection of commercial rates.  The amount of rates payable in any calendar year is a product of the valuation set by the Commissioner, multiplied by the Annual Rate on Valuation (ARV) decided annually by the elected members of each local authority. </p>  <p>  Having a modern valuation base is very important for the levying of commercial rates on a fair and equitable basis across all economic sectors.  This has been the policy of successive governments and is the express purpose of the National Revaluation Programme now being rolled out by the Valuation Office.  The Valuation Acts provide for revaluation of all rateable property within a rating authority area so as to reflect changes in value due to economic factors such as business turnover, differential movements in property values or other external factors and changes in the local business environment.  The Valuation Office is currently engaged in a national revaluation programme, the immediate objective of which is to ensure that the first revaluation of all rating authority areas in over 150 years is conducted across the country,  as soon as possible, and on a phased basis.  This is a welcome and positive development which is long overdue and on which considerable progress has been made to date. </p>  <p>  Revaluation is an important instrument in addressing historical anomalies in relation to commercial rates for both urban and rural properties and between particular classes of property within a local authority area.  The general outcome of revaluations conducted to date by the Valuation Office has been that about 60% of ratepayers have had their liability for rates reduced following revaluation and about 40% had an increase, a pattern which is expected to be replicated elsewhere as the programme advances.  The current phase of the national revaluation programme, "REVAL 2017", covers revaluation of all rateable properties in counties Longford, Leitrim, Roscommon, Westmeath, Offaly, Kildare, Sligo, Carlow and Kilkenny where a revaluation is being undertaken for the first time since the nineteenth century.  It also includes the second revaluation of South Dublin County Council area.  Revaluation in these counties will be completed in September 2017 and become effective for rating purposes from 2018 onwards.</p>  <p>  Where the Valuation Office proposes to enter a new valuation or amend an existing valuation on a Valuation List, there is an extensive process available to cater for ratepayers who may be dissatisfied with the proposed valuation.  A dissatisfied person can make representations to the Valuation Office within 40 days of the date of issue of the proposed valuation certificate.  The Valuation Office will consider any such representations and may or may not change the proposed valuation depending on the circumstances of each individual property.  If any ratepayer is still dissatisfied with the final valuation to be placed on their property following consideration of the representations, they have a right to lodge a formal appeal with the Valuation Tribunal, which is an independent statutory body established for the purpose of hearing appeals against decisions of the Commissioner of Valuation.</p>  <p>  Specifically in relation to property used in the equine industry, I am advised by the Valuation Office that there has been some apparent confusion as to the ratability of certain elements of the industry.  The Valuation Act 2001 (Schedule 3, Sections 1(a) and (b)) provides that all buildings and lands used or developed for any purpose, are rateable.  The basic premise under the Act is that all interests (including buildings) and all developed land are rateable unless expressly exempted under Schedule 4. </p>  <p>  Regarding the Deputy's specific question, I am advised by the Commissioner of Valuation that no re-classification of properties from rateable status to exempt status has occurred within the general equine industry since the Valuation Act 2001 came into force on 2 May 2002.  The only element of the equine industry which satisfies the exemption provisions in Schedule 4 is the breeding of horses. Buildings used for breeding of horses are classified as being of agricultural use and are "farm buildings" as defined in the Act.  Therefore these buildings are exempted from the payment of rates under paragraph 5 of Schedule 4.  On the other hand, buildings used for the training of racehorses, recreational equestrian purposes or livery premises are rateable under the Act because they are considered to be part of a commercial enterprise.  Such buildings would typically include stables for horses, covered riding arenas, tack rooms and ancillary buildings used to support the enterprise.  While acknowledging the important contribution which all elements of the equine industry make to the economy, there are no plans to reclassify these as exempt from rates. To do so would be at variance with the provisions in the Valuation Acts which maintains the long-standing position that all property occupied and used for commercial enterprises are liable for rates.  Exceptions to this key principle would quickly be followed by demands for similar treatment from the providers of other equally important services and products, which would be difficult in equity to resist.  This could thus substantially reduce local authority revenues, which would have to be made good by imposing corresponding increases on the remaining ratepayers.</p></reply>

The introduction of Carbon Tax was to send a price signal that there is a cost associated with the combustion of fossil fuels to the detriment of the environment.</p>  <p>  Ireland is legally bound to reduce emissions by 20% on 2005 levels in 2020 and 30% on 2005 levels by 2030, as part of the European Commission's Climate and Energy Package to tackle climate change.  The carbon tax was introduced as part of an overarching energy strategy and is a key tool to reduce emissions towards meeting these and other climate change commitments.</p>  <p>  As a matter of principle the reliefs from the carbon tax are limited to ensure as wide an application as possible.  Placing a carbon tax on fuels also offers an opportunity to develop cleaner more efficient and environmentally friendly alternative fuels.  The carbon tax is, and will continue to be, a fundamental pillar of the transition towards a decarbonised economy and society by 2050.  </p>  <p>  Accordingly, I do not intend introducing a derogation from carbon tax.</p></reply>

The data indicates that around one-third of applications received are approved automatically, while the remainder are generally allocated a status of pending.  Pending means that the applicants either have to file an outstanding return or address a compliance issue, the application is to be reviewed by a Revenue caseworker, or the applicant needs to finalise his or her application.</p><p>The purpose of the application stage of the HTB incentive process is such that would-be first-time buyers can determine whether, and to what extent, they qualify for the incentive.  The data from the application stage are only an indicator as to possible take-up of the incentive. An applicant might not proceed to claim stage or might not get mortgage approval.  Where applicable, i.e. where a contract to purchase a qualifying home has been entered into, or the individual proceeds to commence a self-build home, the individual(s) can subsequently submit a claim for a tax refund.  The necessary evidence, which is a signed contract, mortgage agreement, deposit details, details of the property for first-time purchasers or, in the case of first-time self-build claimants, evidence of drawdown of the first tranche of the mortgage, must be submitted along with the claim.  More detailed information and guidance regarding these requirements is available on the Revenue website.</p><p>Information about the loan-to-value ratios is not available at the application stage, as such figures are not usually finalised at that stage of the process.  However, this information is required when a claim is made for a refund. I am advised that the categorisations of claims by the requested loan-to-value ratios as of end March 2017 are as set out in the table.</p><p><b>Claims Received Stage Data</b><table><tr><th>LTV</th><th>No. of Claims</th><th>% of Total</th></tr><tr><td>70%-79.99% </td><td>184</td><td>18.29</td></tr><tr><td>80%-84.99% </td><td>168</td><td>16.70</td></tr><tr><td>85%-89.99% </td><td>380</td><td>37.77</td></tr><tr><td>90% &amp;amp; over </td><td>274</td><td>27.24</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>1,006</td><td>100</td></tr></table></p><p>With regard to the total potential cost of the scheme by reference to the various loan-to-value categories, the HTB incentive is by its nature a demand-led scheme there is no ceiling on the number of potential applicants so it is not possible to identify such a figure.</p><p>The cost of the incentive to the exchequer to date, is in the order of &euro;8.2 million (it was estimated that the cost in 2017 would be approximately &euro;50 million when claims in respect of 2016 were included).  My Department estimated that the cost of the incentive would be &euro;40 million in each of the years 2018 and 2019.  The estimates for the potential cost of the incentive that have featured in recent media reports are based on the number of applications received by Revenue to Stage 1 of the scheme, rather than the number of claims to date.  However, many of these applicants may never make a claim to Stage 2 for a variety of reasons.  These could include individuals who do not go on to obtain mortgage approval, who may decide to purchase a second-hand property, or who are not able to source the new home that they desire.</p><p>I am further advised by Revenue that of the claims made to date (1,006), approximately half have been paid and that the average claim paid under the incentive is some &euro;15,000.  There have been 148 claims for the maximum amount of &euro;20,000, of which 86 have been verified and refunded.</p><p>Finally, the Deputies may wish to know that Revenue now regularly publish statistics concerning the HTB incentive on its website at <i>.</i></p></reply>

Ireland has not been and will never be a brass plate location.</p>  <p>  The OECD has made a series of recommendations, as part of the BEPS process, which are designed to give tax authorities the tools necessary to ensure that profits are correctly attributed to the country where the economic activity which generates them takes place.  The BEPS recommendations will greatly enhance the ability of participating countries to ensure the correct alignment of tax and substance and Ireland is playing its part in the implementation of these recommendations.  </p>  <p>  The terms of reference of the review of the corporation tax code being undertaken by Mr Seamus Coffey includes examining further implementation of Ireland's commitments in this area.</p></reply>

The levy was charged at 35% of the Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) paid by a financial institution in 2011 and raised approximately &euro;150 million annually for the Exchequer.  In the case of a financial institution where the amount of DIRT in the base year did not exceed &euro;100,000, the levy was not payable.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Office of the Revenue Commissioners that a total of ten financial institutions were registered to pay the bank levy over the period of years 2014, 2015, and 2016.  Four of the ten are domestically owned.  The ultimate parent company of the remaining six institutions is outside of the State.</p>  <p>  In the budget statement two years ago, I announced that I intended to extend the levy for a further five years to 2021.  I indicated that the overall yield from the levy would be maintained at &euro;150 million annually but that I would undertake a review of the DIRT based methodology for calculating the levy.</p>  <p>  That review, which included a public consultation on the issue, was undertaken by my Department in early 2016.  Following that review, I decided that the DIRT based formula should be retained but that the base year for calculating the levy in 2017 and 2018 would be changed from 2011 to 2015.  I have also decided to introduce a rolling two-year series of base years which will introduce a new base year of 2017 for calculating the levy in 2019 and 2020 and a new base year of 2019 for calculating the levy in 2021.</p>  <p>  An institution's liability to the levy relates to the size of their Irish operation, since the levy is a percentage of their DIRT payment, and does not have regard to whether the institution is domestic or foreign.</p></reply>

Prior to the judgment, Revenue's position was that tolls were liable to VAT at the rate of 23%, which was collected from road users by toll operators regardless of whether they were a public body or a private operator.</p>  <p>  Following the judgment it remains that tolls collected by a body other than a body governed by public law which is engaged in the activity of making road infrastructure available on payment of a toll under national statutory provisions are liable to VAT.      </p>  <p>  With regard to pricing of tolls charged by Transport Infrastructure Ireland, I am informed by my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, that the statutory power to levy tolls on national roads, to make toll bye-laws and to enter into agreements relating to tolls on national roads is vested in Transport Infrastructure Ireland under Part V of the Roads Act 1993 as amended.</p></reply>

It was introduced by the previous Government to fill the consumer protection gap where loans were sold by the original lender to an unregulated firm.  The Act introduced a regulatory regime for a new type of entity called a 'credit servicing firm'.  Credit Servicing Firms are now subject to the provisions of Irish financial services law that apply to 'regulated financial service providers'. </p>  <p>  Under the Act, purchasers of loan books must either be regulated by the Central Bank themselves or else the loans must be serviced by a credit servicing firm that is regulated by the Central Bank.  The significant point is that the regulation is focussed at the point of contact with the customer.  Therefore relevant borrowers, whose loans are sold to third parties, maintain the same regulatory protections they had prior to the sale, including under the various statutory codes (such as the Consumer Protection Code, Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears) issued by the Central Bank of Ireland and the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 (Section 48) (Lending to Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises) Regulations 2015 which came into operation in July 2016.  It is also important to highlight that the transfer of a loan from one entity to another does not change the terms of the contract or the borrower's rights and obligations under the original contract.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Central Bank is now the competent authority for the authorisation and supervision of credit servicing firms.  Credit servicing firms must comply with all relevant requirements of financial services legislation, including the various codes and Regulations mentioned already and Fitness and Probity Standards (including minimum competency requirements).</p>  <p>  In addition to compliance with Central Bank codes of conduct, credit servicing firms will have to demonstrate to the Central Bank that they have:</p>  <p>  - Robust governance and adequate resources to ensure compliance;</p>  <p>  - Agreements with loan owners that enable the credit servicing firm to fully comply with its obligations under Irish financial services legislation; and</p>  <p>  - Adequate and effective control of loan servicing in the State to enable Central Bank oversight.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act, 2015 ensures that a regulated credit servicing firm cannot do something, or fail to do something, which would be a prescribed contravention if performed, or not performed, by a retail credit firm.  The legislation also prevents the owner of credit from instructing a regulated credit servicing firm to perform such an action.  Therefore the borrower is protected because the owner cannot give an instruction that would breach the rules but also the instruction cannot be implemented by the regulated credit servicer, over whom the Central Bank has oversight as a regulated entity.</p>  <p>  Nonetheless, my Department will continue to keep all relevant legislation under review in order to ensure that borrowers whose loans have been sold are properly protected and do not lose any protections that they previously enjoyed.  In addition, the Department of Finance expects that the Central Bank, as regulator of credit servicing firms, will be vigilant in this area and raise any specific instances where they have found consumers have not had their protections upheld or that their positions have been disadvantaged.</p></reply>

Engagement with the other stakeholders in both the public and private sector, including with Eurostat, is ongoing. </p>  <p>  ISIF informs me that whilst it has made progress in conjunction with the other stakeholders in the public and private sectors in respect of this opportunity, as well as other potential social housing investment opportunities, there are still considerable hurdles including commerciality and balance sheet treatment as identified in Rebuilding Ireland.  These hurdles must be overcome before any such proposals can be brought to a successful conclusion. </p>  <p>  Separately, ISIF is making a very substantial contribution to new private housing supply which is critical in terms of meeting the pent up demand for housing across all sectors of the market.  In line with its double bottom line mandate, ISIF has already invested in a number of significant financing platforms and projects in the construction sector, and is actively examining other investment opportunities.  </p>  <p>  ISIF has total investment commitments to housing investment vehicles of &euro;404m comprising &euro;325m in Activate Capital, &euro;25m in the Ardstone Residential Partnership and &euro;54m to student accommodation in DCU.  In addition ISIF has committed &euro;125m in total to more general real estate investment vehicles, including &euro;75m to the Wilbur Ross Cardinal Commercial Real Estate Mezzanine Debt Fund and &euro;50m to Quadrant Real Estate Advisors, both of which to date have completed some investment in housing.  Through these ISIF-supported projects, 8,400 housing units are expected to be delivered in the near term (a small portion of which has already been delivered).</p>  <p>  In addition, ISIF's current near term pipeline of potential housing projects including in the build-to-rent sector and off-campus student accommodation as well as a smaller project that may have the ability to deliver some affordable housing, indicates potential to deliver a further 8,700 units in total.</p>  <p>  ISIF is working with local authorities and private developers on the financing of housing-enabling infrastructure.  Its pipeline includes one private sector pilot housing infrastructure project (totalling approximately 3,000 units) which is actively being progressed.  Public sector projects (also totalling approximately 3,000 units) are currently being considered; the extent to which these projects can be progressed will in part depend on whether Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund (LIHAF) or other forms of financing can be leveraged to complement ISIF financing.</p>  <p>  ISIF is also currently engaging with a range of Higher Education Institutions ("HEIs") in respect of the provision by them of on-campus student accommodation.  </p>  <p>  ISIF invests on a risk adjusted basis in the various housing financing platforms and these platforms, in turn, provide finance, also on a risk adjusted basis, to developers, which can be equity or debt according to the business model of each platform.  The interest rate applied to any individual debt financing arrangement therefore relates to the level of risk and other investment factors in the underlying housing development proposal.</p></reply>

Work was carried out in the Department to assess the potential economic and financial sector implications arising, including through the ESRI-Department of Finance research programme study published in November 2015 titled 'Scoping the Possible Economic Implications of Brexit on Ireland'.  This work was undertaken within the whole-of-Government framework established by the Department of the Taoiseach.</p><p>Following the result of the UK referendum and to prepare for the forthcoming negotiations, work has been intensified across the whole of Government level including in my own Department.  A Brexit Unit within the EU and International Division was established in July 2016 to oversee and coordinate this work and to act as a key liaison point with the Department of the Taoiseach, in particular.  In addition, the Department of Finance staff complement in the Irish Permanent Representation to the EU in Brussels has been strengthened.  The challenges which we face as a result of Brexit is mainstreamed across all divisions of my Department and this is reflected in business planning. </p><p>As part of Budget 2017, the Department of Finance published the Economic and Fiscal outlook which presented a full macroeconomic projection including updated estimates of economic growth, the public finances and the fiscal space, taking account inter alia of the impact of Brexit.  In addition, the Department published detailed analysis of sectorial exposure to Brexit across the economy.  Utilising the Department of Finance sectorial exposure analysis, Budget 2017 included a number of measures to respond to the challenges of Brexit, to mitigate future risks, and to support any opportunities that might arise.  These include measures to support SMEs, entrepreneurship, agri-food and Irish exporters.</p><p>More recently, the Department has worked with the ESRI to deepen the macroeconomic analysis and a report titled 'Modelling the Medium to Long Term Potential Macroeconomic Impact of Brexit on Ireland' was published in November 2016.  In April 2017, updated macroeconomic forecasts will be published by my Department, as part of the Stability Programme Update.</p><p>We know from our own published research that the potential impact on the Irish economy is significant.  It is important to recognise that the full impact of the UK's exit is only expected to materialise over time.  As we cannot control the international environment, we will need to continue to improve our competitiveness, including by focussing on costs we can control, by boosting our productivity and ensuring sustainable public finances. </p><p>The best and most immediate policy under the Government's control to counter the likely negative economic impacts of Brexit is to prudently manage the public finances in order to ensure that Ireland's economy continues to remain competitive in the face of future economic headwinds.  In this context, in Budget 2017, I signalled a lower debt target of 45 per cent of GDP for the mid-to-late 2020s.  This will help to provide an additional fiscal 'shock absorber' capacity to the public finances to help withstand any shock including that of the impact of Brexit.  It will also complement the contingency or 'rainy day' fund which will be established following the achievement of a balanced budget in 2018 and will help provide a further counter-cyclical buffer.</p><p>Separately, Brexit will provide opportunities for Ireland to increase its share of financial services based inward investment.  Minister of State Eoghan Murphy T.D. has responsibility for Financial Services, including the implementation of the IFS2020 Strategy.  The IFS2020 Strategy is a dynamic and evolving strategy.  On January 23rd the Minister of State launched the IFS2020 Action Plan for 2017.  Brexit both underpins this year's Action Plan while also featuring in individual measures to achieve the strategic priorities of IFS2020.  We will continue to leverage our IFS2020 Strategy to maximise any opportunities  <b>. </b></p><p>The work being done by the Department will be an important input to ensuring that Ireland will be in a position to counter any negative economic impact arising from Brexit and to ensure that Ireland's interests are protected in the upcoming negotiations at EU level.  The Department will continue to monitor the economic impacts, to carry out relevant analysis and to frame budgetary policy advice in this new context.</p></reply>

The levy was charged at 35% of the Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) paid by a financial institution in 2011 and raises approximately &euro;150 million annually for the Exchequer.  In the case of a financial institution where the amount of DIRT in the base year does not exceed &euro;100,000, the levy is not payable.</p>  <p>  In the budget statement two years ago, I announced that I intended to extend the levy for a further five years to 2021.  I indicated that the overall yield from the levy would be maintained at &euro;150 million annually but that I would undertake a review of the DIRT based methodology for calculating the levy.</p>  <p>  That review, which included a public consultation on the issue, was undertaken by my Department in early 2016.  Following that review, I decided that the DIRT based formula should be retained but that the base year for calculating the levy in 2017 and 2018 would be changed from 2011 to 2015.  I have also decided to introduce a rolling two-year series of base years which will introduce a new base year of 2017 for calculating the levy in 2019 and 2020 and a new base year of 2019 for calculating the levy in 2021. </p>  <p>  The introduction of the rolling two-year series of base years has a twofold effect.  Firstly, it ensures that financial institutions entering the market over the five further years for which the levy will apply will be subject to the levy and financial institutions exiting the market will cease to be subject to the levy.  Secondly, it will help to correct, on an ongoing basis, any anomalies for individual institutions thrown up by prevailing market conditions, such as the interest rate offering, in any one year.</p>  <p>  In order to maintain the annual yield from the levy at &euro;150 million, I have to increase the rate at which the levy is charged from 35% to 59% for 2017.  This is because the assessable amount, DIRT payments in 2015, have reduced significantly since 2011.  This new rate, combined with the new 2015 base year, will preserve the existing contribution of &euro;150 million paid by the affected financial institutions.  That rate will be subject to review to ensure that the yield from the levy is not impacted from changes in interest rates and/or DIRT rates. </p></reply>

The report notes that progress on mortgage arrears is well established and clearly moving in the right direction.  In addition, the Central Bank considers the range of restructures offered by banks to be broadly appropriate in balancing consumer protection imperatives, and maintaining a mortgage market for all borrowers, and a functioning banking system.</p><p>Furthermore, the Central Bank publishes quarterly statistics on Residential Mortgage Arrears and Repossessions.  In addition, the Central Bank's Household Credit Market Report contains data on negative equity.  The latest report for the second half of 2016 is available at  and table 7 (Page 20) in the report presents the percentage of loans in default and in negative equity.  The data in the Household Credit Market Report are for 2015 and do not reflect changes to loan balances and house prices since December 2015.  The Central Bank estimates that 15 per cent of PDH loans  and 26 per cent of BTL loans were in negative equity at end December 2015 of which 10 per cent of PDH and 14 per cent of BTL loans were deemed to be performing. </p><p>The Deputy should also be aware of the most recent Central Bank Residential Mortgage Arrears and Repossessions quarterly bulletin for Q4 of 2016 which indicates that the level of mortgages in arrears is continuing to fall for the fourteenth consecutive quarter, with the cohort of loans in arrears for more than 720 days recording the sixth quarterly decline to date and a 3.2 per cent quarter-on-quarter decrease, the largest  quarterly decline in this category to date.</p></reply>

The programme involved selecting a random sample comprising nearly one in every ten of the 2,500 holders of Auto Fuel Trader Licences (any trader that produces, sells, deals in, or keeps for sale or delivery road diesel is legally obliged to hold such a licence).  Road diesel samples were taken from all traders in the programme and tested for the presence of the new marker.  No evidence of the new fiscal marker was found in any of the samples tested.  The random sampling programme was repeated in January 2017 and again, no evidence of the fiscal marker was found.  This provides very persuasive evidence that the strategy undertaken in recent years has been successful in addressing the laundering problem. </p>  <p>  Revenue works closely with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in acting against fuel fraud, and the relevant authorities in the State also work closely with their counterparts in Northern Ireland, through cross-border enforcement groups, to target the organised crime groups that are responsible for a large proportion of this criminal activity.  This work is being supported and facilitated by the setting up in 2016, in the framework of "A Fresh Start: the Stormont Agreement and Implementation Plan", of a Joint Agency Task Force, which includes Revenue as well as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and their Northern Ireland counterparts.  Revenue also works in close cooperation with the relevant authorities in other jurisdictions, the European Anti-Fraud Office and other international bodies and agencies in the ongoing programmes of action at international level to combat the illicit fuel trade.  Since 2014 there has been just one fuel laundry detection (in December 2016 in the Castleblayney area) and the level of detections of laundered fuel has decreased considerably.  The most recent detection of laundered fuel occurred during March this year at a premises in Arklow where Revenue officers seized approximately 15,000 litres of laundered fuel and an oil tanker used to transport the illicit fuel.  The new marker was a significant contributor to the detection and seizure.</p>  <p>  The penalties for offences relating to fuel fraud are laid down in section 119 of the Finance Act 2001 and section 102 of the Finance Act 1999.  On conviction following summary prosecution under these provisions, a court may impose a fine of &euro;5,000, or a term of imprisonment not exceeding 12 months, or both.  Where a person is convicted for an indictable offence, the court may impose a term of imprisonment not exceeding 5 years, or a fine not exceeding &euro;126,970, or both.  In addition, for an indictable offence under section 119 of the Finance Act 2001, if the value of the fuel concerned in the fraud exceeds &euro;250,000, including duty and taxes, the court may impose a penalty of three times the value of the fuel, or a term of imprisonment not exceeding 5 years, or both.  The current levels of fines were introduced by the Finance Act 2010 and represented significant increases over the previous amounts: for example, the fine on conviction for an indictable offence was increased from &euro;12,695 to an amount not exceeding &euro;126,970.</p>  <p>  The Courts decide on the amount of the fine to be imposed in any particular case and, in practice, do not apply fines up to the existing limits.  There are no proposals at present to increase the level of fines available to the courts.  However, the position is kept under review taking account, among other considerations, of the practical experience of the fines imposed under the current provisions.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that Revenue's work against fuel laundering has achieved a considerable level of success, and I am assured that action against fuel fraud will continue to be a high priority.</p></reply>

This vehicle should be capable of funding the delivery of substantial new mixed-tenure residential developments, comprising social and private housing.</p>  <p>  Whilst a major objective of any such funding vehicle is to leverage additionality in terms of social housing supply, it is envisaged that a substantial portion of the overall supply of new units may need to be for private housing to meet the commerciality test and to satisfy the requirements of an off-balance sheet investment model.    </p>  <p>  Although there have been a number of recent proposals in this space from private sector residential investors and developers, none have proven to be either commercial or likely to pass the requirements for an off-balance sheet model.  </p>  <p>  Engagement with a wide array of key stakeholders in both the public and private sector is ongoing and involves the input of relevant Government Departments, the CSO and others.  There is ongoing engagement, also, with the European authorities, including Eurostat, and the European Commission. </p>  <p>  Initial discussions with the EIB have taken place, and these have explored possible EIB participation in funding the housing model.  These discussions follow recent interaction between this Department and ISIF with the EIB regarding EIB support for housing projects in other Member States.  Initial discussions and soundings indicate that the EIB is interested in supporting a housing model.  Attention is now focused on developing a model which meets the off-balance sheet requirements, and one in which the EIB might participate.</p>  <p>  On the occasion of the formal launch of the EIB Group office in Ireland on 9 December 2016, I chaired the first meeting of the EIB-Ireland Financing Group, comprising relevant Government Ministers, heads of agencies and EIB senior management.  One of the purposes of the Group is to examine opportunities for using EIB financing and technical assistance to address housing, transport and other infrastructure investment requirements.  The Group is supported by three sub-groups of officials and agency representatives, one of which is tasked with addressing issues in the area of Social Infrastructure, including housing.  My officials are continuing to engage with the work of the sub-groups.</p></reply>

It is quite clear that there are major challenges ahead for the EU, the UK and for Ireland.</p>  <p>  The position in relation to the border with Northern Ireland in the context of Brexit is very clear and has been articulated by the Taoiseach on several occasions and again by Government on the triggering of Article 50.  Continued freedom of movement, absence of a hard border, and minimal impact on business and trade are key objectives.  The Government is clear that any manifestation of a hard border would have very negative consequences.  A key priority is to ensure the continued free flow of trade on the island and the need to avoid a hard border.  Clearly in this regard the closer the trading relationship between the UK and EU the better.</p>  <p>  My Department has been preparing for the impact of Brexit since well before the referendum on 23 June 2016, with this work now intensified.  The primary areas for the Department of Finance relate to the economic and financial sector implications stemming from Brexit.  This work is being undertaken within the whole-of-Government framework established by the Department of the Taoiseach.  A consolidated paper providing more detail about Ireland's priorities and approach to the negotiations ahead is due to be published in advance of the European Council meeting on 29 April.</p>  <p>  The precise arrangements that will apply after Brexit will depend on the outcome of negotiations between the EU and UK that will now take place following formal notification under Article 50 on Wednesday last, 29 March.</p></reply>

In addition, the Credit Union Act 1997 (Regulatory Requirements) Regulations 2016 (2016 Regulations) set out services exempt from additional services requirements.  </font>Where a credit union wishes to provide services to its members, other than those services that are provided for under the 1997 Act or the list of services exempt from the additional services requirements set out in the 2016 Regulations, an application may be made to the Central Bank for approval to provide such additional services in accordance with the provisions set out in sections 48-52 of the 1997 Act. </p><p>Debit card provision (and the necessary underlying payment account service) is an additional service and as such requires Central Bank approval.  The Central Bank has recently approved a suite of additional services known as a Member Personal Current Account Service (MPCAS) under the Additional Services Framework set out in sections 48-52 of the 1997 Act.  This service, which was recently approved for a number of credit unions, provides for credit unions to offer debit cards, overdrafts and a full range of payment services within an appropriate risk framework.  The Central Bank is currently processing a significant number of additional applications for this service.  Details of MPCAS and the approval process, along with the application requirements and related guidance are on the Central Bank's website.  In its communication to the sector on MPCAS on 9 December 2016, the Central Bank highlighted that it will continue to consider all applications for provision of additional services including debit cards.</p><p>Currently credit unions can provide mortgages to members, within certain maturity limits contained in the 2016 Regulations.  The 2016 Regulations set out the percentage of a credit union's loan book that can be outstanding for periods exceeding both five and ten years, as well as limits on the maximum outstanding liability to an individual member.  Under the 2016 Regulations, issued by the Central Bank in January 2016, credit unions continue to be allowed to lend up to 30% of their loan book over five years and up to 10% of their loan book over 10 years, subject to a maximum maturity of 25 years.  In addition, credit unions are able to apply to the Central Bank for an extension to their longer term lending limits (up to 40% of their loan book over 5 years and up to 15% of their loan book over 10 years).  Approval is subject to conditions set by the Central Bank.  There are currently 11 credit unions approved to avail of increased longer term lending limits.</p><p>The Central Bank informs me that the December 2016 Prudential Return indicates that for the sector overall, total gross loans over 10 years amount to c. 2.7% of total loans in the credit union sector compared to the limit of 10% (and in some cases 15%).  </p><p>The Central Bank has indicated that while it can see longer term lending, including mortgages, as part of a balanced portfolio of total lending, in their analyses, credit unions need to consider the impact of longer term lending on interest margins, return on assets and on balance sheet structure, the issue of funding longer term lending with short term funding is a challenge for the credit union business model.  The Central Bank further informs me that consumer mortgage lending is an activity that has its own unique risk profile, and proposals to become involved in mortgage lending in a significant way must be supported by an evidenced based business case. </p><p>The Credit Union Advisory Committee's (CUAC) recent report provides a number of recommendations, one of which is to conduct a full review of lending limits.  I have established an Implementation Group which is due to meet for the third time later this month.  The Implementation Group  is currently assessing each of those recommendations with a view to implementation as appropriate.  Central to its work is ensuring a full examination of lending limits and concentration limits as recommended.  I look forward to regular progress reports from the Implementation Group as these recommendations are developed and implemented.</p></reply>

It applies to the mortgage loan of a borrower which is secured by his/her primary residence.  It sets out how regulated entities must treat borrowers in or facing mortgage arrears, with due regard to the fact that each case of mortgage arrears is unique and needs to be considered on its own merits.  All such cases must be handled sympathetically and positively by the lender, with the objective at all times of assisting the borrower to meet his/her mortgage obligations.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Central Bank that while the CCMA does not provide a definition for "own merits", a regulated entity must use the standard financial statement prescribed in the CCMA to obtain financial information from a borrower in arrears or in pre-arrears.  The CCMA requires that a regulated entity's Arrears Support Unit must base its assessment on the full circumstances of each individual borrower, including:</p>  <p>  - personal circumstances;</p>  <p>  - overall indebtedness;</p>  <p>  - the information provided in the standard financial statement;</p>  <p>  - current repayment capacity; and </p>  <p>  - previous repayment history</p>  <p>  In addition, each regulated entity must consider the borrower's situation in the context of the solutions they provide.  I draw the Deputy's attention to the most recent Mortgage Arrears and Restructures Data released by the Central Bank on 16 March, which showed that to end-Q4 2016, the number of Principal Dwelling House (PDH) mortgage accounts in arrears has declined for the past fourteen quarters.   Almost 121,000 PDH accounts were also classified as restructured, of which 87% were reported to be meeting the terms of their arrangement.  This indicates that where borrowers actively engage with their lender under the CCMA,  it is more likely that an equitable arrangement will be found and that the borrower will be able to remain in their family home.</p></reply>

This plan contains a significant volume of responses to the current housing crisis, of which the Help to Buy incentive is one.  This comprehensive Action Plan takes a holistic approach in addressing the many interacting structural constraints affecting the housing market in areas such as planning and land use, as well as regulation and skills deficits in the construction sector.  While the primary focus of the Action Plan is to tackle structural constraints, fiscal supports can play a supporting and time-bound role in addressing the current problems in the housing sector.</p>  <p>  It is in this context that the Help to Buy incentive should be considered.  Its role is to complement the other measures in the Action Plan.  The extent to which the scheme could lead to an increase in residential property prices will very much depend on the speed and efficiency with which structural supply constraints are eliminated and residential building activity increases.  Therefore, the impact of the Help to Buy incentive on property prices cannot be considered in isolation from the impact of other measures contained in the Action Plan, which are primarily designed to increase supply.</p>  <p>  Regarding the Central Bank's macro-prudential rules, these were initially introduced for residential mortgage lending by financial institutions regulated by the Central Bank in February 2015, as part of its independent mandate to preserve and protect financial stability in Ireland.  These macro-prudential measures apply certain loan-to-value (LTV) and loan-to-income (LTI) restrictions to residential mortgage lending. </p>  <p>  Following a review carried out last year, the Central Bank has made some limited adjustments to these rules which came into effect on 1 January 2017.  The main change related to first-time buyers and provided that the maximum LTV of 90% would now apply to the total value of the of the property (previously the 90 per cent limit was up to the first &euro;220,000 value of the property and an 80 per cent LTV limit applied to any value above that threshold).  The maximum LTV mortgage limit for second and subsequent buyers of a primary home remained unchanged at 80 per cent of the value of the property, as did the LTI threshold limit of 3.5 times gross annual income.  These macro-prudential rules, however, do not remove the requirement on lenders to carry out appropriate credit worthiness assessments on all mortgage applications in line with the Consumer Protection Code and other consumer protection regulatory requirements.  The Central Bank is independent in these matters.</p>  <p>  I wish to assure the Deputy that my Department continues to monitor developments in the property market including property prices on an ongoing basis.  I have already committed to commissioning an independent economic impact assessment of the Help to Buy incentive which will look at, among other issues, the impact on property prices.  However, it should be remembered that the high rates of house prices reflect the supply constrained nature of the Irish residential market, and price increases were a feature of the market long before the Help to Buy incentive was introduced.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Help to Buy incentive has been introduced for two reasons - to assist first time buyers in putting together the requisite deposit to buy a home, and to encourage the construction of new homes.  As such, I am not in a position to consider changes to the scheme so soon after implementing the Help to Buy incentive, as this would disrupt the incentive effect which is designed to create the conditions to encourage the construction of new homes.</p></reply>

In the last number of weeks, information on the completed scheme in Waterford has also been provided to Insurance Ireland.  This information has been provided as part of the information sharing arrangement entered into between OPW and Insurance Ireland (Memorandum of Understanding).  The nature of this arrangement is such that it should lead to a greater availability of flood cover in previously higher risk areas, and at better prices.  In this regard, the Insurance Ireland/OPW working group, which the Department of Finance attends, now meets on a quarterly basis to support the information flow and to improve the understanding of issues between both parties.</p>  <p>  The most recent Insurance Ireland survey of approximately 85% of the property insurance market in Ireland indicates that of the 16 completed defence schemes, 90% of policies in areas benefitting from permanent flood defences include flood cover, while there has been an increase from 66% to 77% of policies in areas benefitting from demountable defences including flood cover. </p>  <p>  A sub-group has also been set up to explore the technical and administrative arrangements that may allow for the further sharing of data on flood insurance cover for those 300 areas where OPW has mapped flood risk through the CFRAM programme.  The first meeting of this sub-group was held in January. </p>  <p>  Following a meeting last July between Minister of State Canney and Insurance Ireland it was agreed that information and data on the deployment protocols, warning systems and emergency response systems in place where demountable defences are utilised would be provided to industry.  The purpose of this information is to enable the industry reassess the overall level of risk with demountable flood defences in this context.  It is hoped that this data will provide the robust information required for industry to reduce the risk it has associated with demountable defences and increase the levels of cover for these areas.  It should be noted that this information has in the last number of weeks been provided to Insurance Ireland.  The provision of information and data relating to other areas are subject to ongoing discussions. </p>  <p>  Finally, you should be aware that a consumer can make a complaint to the Financial Services Ombudsman in relation to any dealings with a Financial Services or Insurance provider during which they feel they have been unfairly treated.  In addition, individuals who are experiencing difficulty in obtaining flood insurance or believe that they are being treated unfairly may contact Insurance Ireland which operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to insurance.</p></reply>

On the 23rd of March this year I further announced the addition of five joint bookrunners and a co-lead manager to the syndicate.  The syndicate banks have been appointed until July 2018.  This provides the State with optionality on the timing of any such transaction through 2017 and 2018. </p>  <p>  A banking syndicate is a group of investment banks who are appointed to plan, structure and execute an IPO on behalf of a selling shareholder, in this case the sale of the State's shares in AIB in line with the provisions set out in the Programme for a Partnership Government.  The three global coordinators lead the transaction, performing most of the work, while the bookrunners and co-lead manager will help to ensure coverage of the broadest possible range of relevant investors both by type and geography when it comes to the marketing and sales effort.  A strong banking syndicate is critical to the successful design and execution of an IPO, building investor interest in the shares and ultimately maximising value for the taxpayer.</p>  <p>  An IPO is a complex and specialised undertaking, and my Department and their advisors have made significant progress in their preparations.  Work done by the global coordinators so far includes analysis of the bank's business plan and potential 'equity story' which involved engagement with the bank's management team, planning a comprehensive marketing programme to international investors, due diligence, offer structuring as well as other necessary workstreams. </p>  <p>  Fees are only payable to the syndicate on the completion of a successful transaction (i.e. no fees have been paid to date), and are proportional to the value of the transaction.  As such it is not possible to provide the exact quantum of fees that would be paid as no transaction has occurred.  The fees that have been negotiated by my officials are very competitive by reference to comparable transactions and are capped, while the number of banks appointed is also within precedent for an equity capital market transaction of this nature and size and does not affect the overall fee level payable.</p>  <p>  Further, the Deputy should be aware that in line with the State agreements with AIB, that all fees incurred by the State in relation to any capital transaction will be paid by the bank.</p></reply>

NAMA will focus on completing its ongoing deleveraging, its Dublin Docklands SDZ and residential funding programmes in the interim period to 2020.  NAMA's most recent annual statement which provides further insight into the Agency's expectations regarding these activities was laid before the Dail on 2 November 2016 and is also available on NAMA's website.  As the Deputy will be aware, it is through the successful completion of these objectives that NAMA currently projects a surplus in the region of &euro;2.3bn to be returned to the State once it completes it work.</p>  <p>  As per section 60(2) of the NAMA Act 2009, NAMA may use surplus funds to redeem and cancel its debt.  Surplus funds may only be returned to the Central Fund once NAMA's debt has been redeemed in full.</p>  <p>  Any NAMA surplus paid into the Exchequer will be recorded in line with EUROSTAT rules and would likely be deemed a once-off capital receipt under non-tax revenue in the Financial Statements of the Exchequer.  </p>  <p>  It will be a decision for the Government as to how any surplus returned by NAMA will be utilised.</p>  <p>  It has always been the Government's intention to use such receipts from the resolution of the financial sector crisis to pay down our debt and help reduce our debt servicing costs.  Given the uncertainty around the specific timing of or the amount that will be realised, such receipts have not been included in our debt forecasts.  Debt reduction underpinned by our lower national debt target of 45 per cent of GDP, will increase the resilience of the public finances to deal with any potential shocks which may emerge in the future.</p></reply>

More directly, credit and market conditions, mortgage default rates and the funding of mortgage credit will also be relevant factors.</p>  <p>  In particular legacy issues, such as a high level of non-performing loans on the balance sheets of Irish banks, together with other input costs were outlined in  a report published by the Central Bank of Ireland in May 2015 as factors which impact upon the pricing of variable rate mortgages in Ireland.  These legacy issues include higher costs from credit losses, higher funding costs, higher levels of capital  resulting from regulatory changes, higher required capital per euro of risk given the  severe loss experience in the crisis, higher operating cost per euro of loans given  falling balance sheets and the fixed cost base that comes with the infrastructure requirements of large retail banks.</p>  <p>  It is very important to ensure that new mortgages are sold to borrowers in a transparent manner.  The Central Bank, therefore, requires that all mortgages are advertised and sold in accordance with the requirements of financial services legislation (including Central Bank Codes), and that consumers who choose a given mortgage product (or to switch to a new product) are treated in accordance with these requirements in the context of the product they have chosen.  Additionally, the Central Bank has carried out research which showed that there is scope for borrowers to save money by switching mortgages.  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission has launched a mortgage switching tool for consumers (which itself notes the findings of the Central Bank research of cases where borrowers could make savings) and also recent changes have been made to the Consumer Protection Code which, inter alia, places an onus on a lender to provide information on other mortgage products offered by that lender which could provide savings to the borrower.</p>  <p>  The issue of mortgage interest rates is a significant one for this Government.  In overall terms, the Government is of the opinion that increased competition is the best way to ensure that retail lending rates are driven down in a sustainable way for the market as a whole and thereby promote overall consumer welfare.</p>  <p>  To that end, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) is reviewing the mortgage market with a view to setting out options for Government in terms of market structure, legislation and regulation to lower the cost of secured mortgage lending and to improve the degree of competition and consumer protection.  In liaison with the Central Bank, the CCPC has now commenced this work and announced a public consultation to gather views about the future of the Irish mortgage market. It is expected that the CCPC will produce the report outlining their proposals by the end of May 2017. </p>  <p>  This is a policy area that the Government will keep under active review in its ongoing engagement with mortgage lenders and in implementing the Programme for Government commitments to help deliver on a long term basis better outcomes for all mortgage borrowers.</p></reply>

One of the roles of credit unions for example is the creation of sources of credit for the mutual benefit of its members at a fair and reasonable rate of interest.</p>  <p>  Within the Credit Union sector, total lending has contracted since 2011 with total sector loans (before provisions) falling from &euro;5.7bn in 2011 to &euro;4.1bn in 2016.  Total sector loans (net of provisions) have fallen from &euro;5bn to &euro;3.6bn over the same period.  The average sectorial Gross Loan to Asset (LTA) ratio has fallen from just over 40 per cent in 2011 to 27 per cent in 2016.  This is in the context where total loans to Irish households (consumer credit) have contracted from &euro;17bn in 2011 to &euro;12bn in 2016.  Credit unions have maintained a circa 34 per cent share of this type of lending during the period 2011 to 2016.</p>  <p>  Lending restrictions on specific credit unions are imposed in the context of on-going matters of supervisory concern arising in individual credit unions.  Currently circa 24% of Credit Unions are operating under lending restrictions.  For those credit unions where there is an individual loan size restriction in place, the level at which the limit is imposed ensures that the vast majority of those credit unions can continue to make loans significantly more than the average loan for the sector of just above &euro;6,000. </p>  <p>  Under the terms of the Credit Union Act 1997 (Regulatory Requirements) Regulations 2016, an individual member savings limit of &euro;100,000 applies.  The Regulations also provide that credit unions could apply to the Central Bank to retain individual members' savings in excess of &euro;100,000, which were held at commencement of the Regulations and that individual credit unions with total assets in excess of &euro;100m could apply to the Central Bank for approval to increase individual member savings in excess of &euro;100,000.</p>  <p>  In recognition of the important role of credit unions as a volunteer co-operative movement in this country and my support for a strengthened and growing credit union movement, the Central Bank has agreed to an accelerated review of the savings limit.</p>  <p>  In relation to the assertion that some banks have 'monopoly control over the payments system', the Central Bank has sole responsibility for the domestic retail paper-based clearing system, but is not the primary overseer for the pan-European/external systems used for electronic payments and card payments, and for securities settlements.

On the 23rd of March this year I further announced the addition of five joint bookrunners and a co-lead manager to the syndicate.  These syndicate banks have been appointed until July 2018.</p><p>The syndicate was appointed following two separate competitive mini-competitions involving the members of Lot 3 of the Department s Capital Markets Distribution panel.  My Department appointed Rothschild as Independent Financial Advisor in December 2015, this appointment was made on foot of a tender competition launched in late November 2015, involving all of the members of Lot 1 of the Department's financial advisory panel.</p><p>Our Financial Advisory panels were constituted following an open procurement procedure in 2014.

The Government is keen to maximise those opportunities where possible.  In that regard, international financial services (IFS) has been identified as an area of potential opportunity arising from Brexit in relation to the movement of business from existing UK locations in addition to other businesses seeking a new EU location post-Brexit.</p>  <p>  Ireland has a successful track record of competing for, and winning, global foreign direct investment.  One of the key pillars of that success is the growth of the IFS sector, in particular over the past 30 years.  The continued successful development of the financial services sector in Ireland is a priority for the Government. </p>  <p>  In general terms, the Government will continue, through IDA Ireland, to promote the attractiveness of Ireland as a location of choice for financial service firms that are considering moving out of London or those firms not currently based in Europe who are considering a move into the EU after a UK Brexit.  Both Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland are in close contact with their clients on the challenges and opportunities that Brexit presents.  We will, for example, continue to implement our clear strategy for driving growth in the financial services sector and we will maximise any opportunities that might arise. </p>  <p>  This Strategy, which is known as IFS2020 Strategy, is a whole-of-Government approach to further driving the growth and development of the IFS sector in Ireland. IFS2020 represents a clear and coherent plan for driving further growth in the IFS sector.  The Strategy, led by a specifically appointed Minister for Financial Services, Eoghan Murphy, is supported by all relevant public and private sector stakeholders.  We will continue to leverage the IFS2020 Strategy as we seek to maximise opportunities that arise and drive growth in the IFS sector in the context of Brexit. </p>  <p>  We have a very strong offering and we've done extensive work to promote that offering.  Global competition for foreign investment has never been more intense.  We are aware that not every decision will go our way.  There will be an ebb and flow to this, and the flow to Ireland will be strong from decisions that have already been made in our favour.  But other cities in Europe will also be chosen by companies looking to maintain access to the Single Market, as well as cities in Ireland such as Dublin and regional centres such as Cork and Limerick, to name a few.  However, the fundamentals that attract companies to Ireland remain strong and with our proven talent and track record as a location of choice for international financial services continue to attract interest.</p></reply>

The Deputy will be aware that the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears forms part of the Central Bank's Consumer Protection Framework.  It is a statutory code and it provides a strong consumer protection framework, aimed specifically at the process to be followed by relevant firms, to ensure borrowers in arrears or pre-arrears in respect of a mortgage loan secured on a primary residence are treated in a timely, transparent and fair manner.</p><p>The overriding objective of the CCMA is to ensure the fair and transparent treatment of consumers in mortgage arrears or pre-arrears, and that due regard is had to the fact that each case of mortgage arrears is unique and needs to be considered on its own merits.  The CCMA recognises that it is in the interests of borrowers and regulated firms to address financial difficulties as speedily, effectively and sympathetically as circumstances allow.  Each regulated entity must consider the borrower's situation in the context of the solutions they provide, which may differ from firm to firm.  The CCMA does not prescribe the solution which must be offered.  At the end of the mortgage arrears resolution process (MARP), regulated entities are required to provide a three-month notice period to allow co-operating borrowers time to consider their options before legal action can commence.  The CCMA includes requirements that arrangements be sustainable and based on a full assessment of the individual circumstances of the borrower and that repossession be used only as a last resort. </p><p>As regards potential court proceedings, the Deputy should note that under the CCMA, a regulated entity may only commence legal proceedings for repossession where it has made every reasonable effort to agree an alternative repayment arrangement (ARA) with the borrowers and other clear requirements are met or the borrower has been classified as not co-operating.  This framework requires lenders to exhaust the options available from the suite of ARAs offered before taking action which may result in the borrower losing their home (whether by voluntary sale or repossession).  During the legal process, borrowers have opportunities to re-engage with lenders to find a solution.  </p><p>In conclusion, I would refer the Deputy to the Central Bank's Mortgage Arrears Report, published on my Department's website at w<i>ww.finance.gov.ie/what-we-do/banking-financial-services/publications/reports-research/report-mortgage-arrears-2016</i>, in which the Central Bank stated that 'Overall, there is strong evidence that banks and non-banks are looking to exhaust available options before moving into the legal process'.  The Deputy will be aware of the Abhaile scheme, launched by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice &amp;amp; Equality and the Minister for Social Protection, which offers indebted borrowers access to State-funded legal and/or financial advice to help them identify how best to address their mortgage arrears, including considering if a personal insolvency arrangement would suit their circumstances.  I understand that there is strong take-up of this scheme by borrowers.  It is clear that where borrowers actively engage with their lender and seek advice they are more likely to find a solution that will enable them to remain in their home.</p></reply>

The preliminary estimate for full-year GDP growth in 2016 is 5.2 per cent based on National Accounts data for the fourth quarter of the year. </p>  <p>  Importantly, domestic demand made a strong positive contribution to growth in 2016 with consumption increasing by 3.0 per cent in 2016.  This is crucial as domestic sectors are both jobs-rich and tax-rich.  What's more, the exporting sector appears to be holding up reasonably well despite the weakness in sterling.</p>  <p>  An important factor in strong export performance is competitiveness.  In this regard, significant progress has been made in recent years.  The latest figures from the Central Bank of Ireland, show that Ireland's real harmonised competitiveness indicator (a widely used measure of competitiveness in Europe) has improved by over 20 per cent between its peak in 2008 and February 2017. </p>  <p>  The gains in Irish competitiveness achieved since 2008 have been hard-won through productivity improvements and wage and price moderation.  It is important that this competitiveness is preserved and continues to support growth.  This is all the more important given the several sources of uncertainty which could negatively impact on the economic outlook.  In particular, the UK's decision to leave the EU has added to concerns about the international outlook while the change in policy direction by the new US administration has also added to concerns about the international economy.  Weaker than expected trading partner growth would negatively impact on Irish growth through reduced exports. </p>  <p>  In summary, I am confident that significant economic progress can be made in the years ahead.  However, this is critically contingent upon implementing appropriate polices and that is what the Government intends to do.</p></reply>

To facilitate this, Government policy since 2011 has been focused on ensuring that all viable SMEs have access to an appropriate supply of credit facilities from a diverse range of bank and non-bank sources.</p>  <p>  In line with Action 62 of the APJ 2017, officials from my Department will collate and examine data from AIB and Bank of Ireland on a monthly basis, including data pertaining to the various sectors.  Furthermore, my officials meet the banks on a quarterly basis to ensure an informed understanding of the wider SME bank lending environment which assists the development and implementation of policies aimed at ensuring SME access to finance and increased competition in the SME lending sector. </p>  <p>  In terms of monitoring the requirements for SMEs, my Department commissions biannual surveys to ascertain the demand for credit by SMEs.  This survey series, most recently conducted by Behaviour and Attitudes on behalf of my Department, is the most comprehensive survey of SME credit demand in Ireland, covering 1,500 respondents and involving over 6,000 direct telephone calls to SMEs.  SMEs of all sizes trading in all sectors, excluding property development and speculative activities, are included.  The survey covers demand for credit from both bank and non-bank sources. </p>  <p>  I would draw the Deputy's attention to the most recently published Department of Finance SME Credit Demand Survey covering the April to September 2016, which can be found at www.finance.gov.ie/sites/default/files/20161205%20SME%20Credit%20Demand%20Survey%20April%20to%20September%202016_0.pdf.</p>  <p>  The results of this survey show that, when pending applications are excluded, 84% of credit applications to banks were approved or partially approved.  Demand for credit remains subdued and the latest survey shows only 23% of requested bank finance in the previous six months down from 26% in March 2016. </p>  <p>  Purchases, replacement or lease of new vehicle/equipment is now provided as the main reason for applying for bank finance with 29% stating this is why they requested bank finance.  Working capital/cash flow requirements were provided as the second highest reason for applying for bank finance with 27% of respondents stating that they required finance for this purpose.  When asked about sources of finance for working capital, internal funds/retained earnings were the main finance source of working capital with 73% of working capital coming from this source (up 6%).  The survey also showed continued positive trends in terms of trading performance, profitability and employment. </p>  <p>  I am pleased to note that, to the end of December 2016, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland has lent circa &euro;544 million to 12,589 SMEs supporting an estimated 67,150 jobs.  These figures represent a significant increase in lending by the SBCI during 2016.  The SMEs who received SBCI finance are from a variety of business and economic sectors and are spread across every region of the country.  More than 80% of loans are for investment purposes and the average loan size is &euro;43,000.  There is a broad geographical spread of the SMEs supported with approximately 85% of them based outside Dublin.  The SBCI is using its significant funding capacity, of over &euro;1 billion, to support Irish SMEs investing in and growing their businesses.</p>  <p>  Over 32,500 businesses and entrepreneurs used the Government's Supporting SMEs Online Tool in 2016, over three quarters of them using the Online Tool for the first time.  The campaign is a cross-governmental initiative developed to help small businesses and entrepreneurs learn the full range of potential Government supports available to them.  The Supporting SMEs Online Tool is available at www.supportingsmes.ie/.</p>  <p>  The Credit Guarantee Scheme encourages additional lending to small businesses by offering a partial Government guarantee to banks against losses on qualifying loans to eligible SMEs.  The Credit Guarantee (Amendment) Act was brought through the Oireachtas in 2016, allowing the scheme to assist more small and medium sized enterprises secure loan finance. In 2017 the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation will prepare and launch a revised Credit Guarantee Scheme, which will now be operated by the SBCI, to ensure a greater supply of credit for Irish SMEs.</p>  <p>  The Microenterprise Loan Fund, administered by Microfinance Ireland, provides loans of up to &euro;25,000 to small businesses who have been refused credit by commercial banks.  Microfinance Ireland works in partnership with the Local Enterprise Offices nationally to administer this fund.  This scheme is currently being reviewed by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation with a view to making proposed changes to enhance its effectiveness.</p>  <p>  The Credit Review Office helps SME or Farm borrowers who have had an application for credit of up to &euro;3 million declined or reduced by either Bank of Ireland or Allied Irish Banks, and who feel that they have a viable business proposition.  They also examine cases where borrowers feel that the terms and conditions of their existing loan, or a new loan offer, are unfairly onerous or have been unreasonably changed to their detriment.  This is a strictly confidential process between the business, the Credit Review Office and the bank. The Credit Reviewer, John Trethowan and his team, have overturned over 50% of the refusals that have been appealed to the Office.  Further details are available at www.creditreview.ie/.</p>  <p>  The Government remains committed to the SME sector, as reflected in the Programme for a Partnership Government, and sees it as a key engine of ongoing economic growth.  Consequently, my Department and the Credit Review Office, working with the other relevant Departments and Agencies, will continue to monitor the availability of both bank and non-bank credit on both a macro and sectorial basis in order to ensure that sufficient access to finance is available to facilitate indigenous SMEs, to reach their full potential in terms of growth and employment generation.</p></reply>

The lack of a sufficient supply response to date reflects structural constraints within the housing market.</p>  <p>  Rebuilding Ireland, The Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness reflects the Government's commitment to addressing the ongoing issues in the housing market.  The Action Plan contains 113 actionable measures across five key pillars namely to Address Homelessness, Accelerate Social Housing, Build More Homes, Improve the Rental sector, and Utilise Existing Housing.   These actions are designed to help address the structural constraints evident in the housing market by, inter alia, streamlining the planning system, removing infrastructure blockages and supporting the delivery of affordable housing. </p>  <p>  A Help to Buy tax incentive was introduced in Budget 2017 as a complement to the structural measures contained in Rebuilding Ireland.  The initiative seeks to do this by providing immediate support to first time buyers helping to ensure the availability of adequate, affordable mortgage finance for first time buyers as new residential housing output comes on stream. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that during the Committee Stage debate on the relevant section of Finance Act 2016, I agreed to commission an independent impact assessment on the effects of the Help to Buy incentive.  My officials have issued a Request for Tender (RFT) for the production of such an assessment.  It stipulates that the study should assess whether the policy objectives on the supply of new homes are being met, what impact (if any) the scheme is having on new and second-hand house prices, and what impact the scheme is having on the residential property market generally.  The output of this assessment will be a written report to be completed and submitted to me by 31 August 2017.</p></reply>

In this regard the Government has developed a number of initiatives to ensure that the supply of credit in the market is sufficient to meet the existing and future needs of SMEs.</p>  <p>  In line with Action 62 of the APJ 2017, officials from my Department will collate and examine data from AIB and Bank of Ireland on a monthly basis, including data pertaining to the various sectors.  Furthermore, my officials meet the banks on a quarterly basis to ensure an informed understanding of the wider SME bank lending environment which assists the development and implementation of policies aimed at ensuring SME access to finance and increased competition in the SME lending sector. </p>  <p>  In terms of monitoring requirements for all SMEs including the retail sector, my Department commissions biannual surveys to ascertain the demand for credit by SMEs.  This survey series, most recently conducted by Behaviour &amp;amp; Attitudes on behalf of my Department, is the most comprehensive survey of SME credit demand in Ireland, covering 1,500 respondents and involving over 6,000 direct telephone calls to SMEs. SMEs of all sizes trading in all sectors, excluding property development and speculative activities, are included.  The survey covers demand for credit from both bank and non-bank sources.  </p>  <p>  I would draw the Deputy's attention to the most recently published Department of Finance SME Credit Demand Survey, covering the period April to September 2016, which can be found at www.finance.gov.ie/what-we-do/banking-financial-services/sme-credit-lending. </p>  <p>  The SME State Bodies Group, chaired by my Department, provides a forum for the development and implementation of policy measures to enhance SMEs' access to a stable and appropriate supply of finance.  As the Deputy will be aware, the Action Plan for Jobs over the past number of years has set out a range of commitments to ensure viable SMEs can access appropriate finance at a reasonable cost from both bank and non-bank sources.  These Government policies have supported year on year increases in new lending to SMEs, as measured by the Central Bank.     </p>  <p>  The Government remains committed to the SME sector and sees it as the key engine of ongoing economic growth. I can assure the Deputy that my Department, working with other relevant Departments, Bodies and Agencies, such as the Credit Review Office, will continue to monitor the availability of both bank and non-bank credit so as to ensure that Irish SMEs have sufficient access to finance.</p></reply>

To qualify for a Primary Medical Certificate, an applicant must be permanently and severely disabled within the terms of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994 and satisfy one of the following conditions:</p>  <p>  -  be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs;</p>  <p>  -  be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs;</p>  <p>  -  be without both hands or without both arms;</p>  <p>  -  be without one or both legs;</p>  <p>  -  be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg;</p>  <p>  -  have the medical condition of dwarfism and have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs. </p>  <p>  The Senior Medical Officer for the relevant local Health Service Executive administrative area makes a professional clinical determination as to whether an individual applicant satisfies the medical criteria.  A successful applicant is provided with a Primary Medical Certificate, which is required under the Regulations to claim the reliefs provided for in the Scheme.  An unsuccessful applicant can appeal the decision of the Senior Medical Officer to the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal, which makes a new clinical determination in respect of the individual.  The Regulations mandate that the Medical Board of Appeal is independent in the exercise of its functions to ensure the integrity of its clinical determinations.</p>  <p>  The criteria to qualify for the Scheme are necessarily precise and specific.  After six months a citizen can reapply if there is a deterioration in their condition.</p>  <p>  The Scheme represents a significant tax expenditure.  Between the Vehicle Registration Tax and VAT foregone, and fuel grant provided for members of the Scheme, the Scheme represented a cost of &euro;65.1 million in 2016.  This does not include the revenue foregone to the Local Government Fund in the respect of the relief from Motor Tax provided to members of the Scheme.  </p>  <p>  I recognise the important role that the Scheme plays in expanding the mobility of citizens with disabilities and that the relief has been maintained at current levels throughout the crisis despite the requirement for significant fiscal consolidation.  From time to time I receive representations from individuals who feel they would benefit from the Scheme but do not qualify under the six criteria.  While I have sympathy for these cases, given the scale and scope of the Scheme, I have no plans to expand the medical criteria beyond the six currently provided for in the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994.</p></reply>

Only where an appeal under Section 29 is upheld, may the Secretary General of my Department direct a school to enrol a pupil.</p>  <p>  In respect of children with ASD who cannot be accommodated in mainstream education, they may be enrolled in special classes or special schools where more intensive and supportive interventions are provided.  Special classes are for students who have a recommendation for a special class placement in their professional reports.</p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through its network of Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), co-ordinates special needs education provision at local level and arranges for the delivery of special educational supports to schools.  It is also the role of the NCSE to make appropriate arrangements to establish special classes in schools in communities where the need for such classes has been identified.  The NCSE have informed my officials that SENOs are currently working with the schools in the area to establish special classes for 2017/18 school year.</p>  <p>  SENOs are a valuable source of support to parents who are actively sourcing a placement for their children and the parents of the child referred to by the Deputy are encouraged to contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs and request assistance in identifying educational placements.  Contact details are available on www.ncse.ie.</p>  <p>  The NCSE also works in collaboration with the Educational Welfare Services (EWS) of the Child and Family Agency which is the statutory agency that can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child or can offer assistance where a child is out of school.  The EWS may be able to offer assistance and advice on securing a school placement within a pupil's area.  The contact details for the EWS is Educational Welfare Services, Child and Family Agency, Floors 2-5, Brunel Building, Heuston South Quarter, Dublin 8. Telephone 01 7718500 email: ewsinfo@tusla.ie.</p>  <p>  Children with autism may be eligible for home tuition if a school placement is not available for them and/or where a determination is awaited in respect of an expulsion or refusal to enroll taken under section 29 of the Education Act, 1998.  Details in relation to the Home Tuition Grant Schemes are available on my Department's website at www.education.ie.</p>  <p>  The Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2016, published on 6th July 2016 and passed second stage on 17th November 2016, provides that where a school has places available it must admit all applicants.  The Bill also contains a provision for the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) to designate a school for a child who has no school place for reasons related to the child&rsquo;s special educational needs, and for the Child and Family Agency to designate a school for a child who has no school place (other than a child with special educational needs).  The NCSE or the Child and Family Agency will not be able to increase a school&rsquo;s capacity, a school must have places available for a designation to be made.</p></reply>

Substantial research, analysis, consultation with service users and stakeholders, and piloting have gone in to the development of this model and all of the evidence points to the fact that this new system will deliver better outcomes for children. </p>  <p>  No school will lose supports as a result of the implementation of the new model.  In addition, no school will receive an allocation, for the support of pupils with complex needs, less than the allocation they received to support such pupils during the 2016/17 school year.  No allocation made for such pupils by the NCSE will be removed from schools as long as that pupil remains in the school. </p>  <p>  An additional 900 teaching posts have been provided to support the introduction of this new allocation model.  The provision of an additional 900 teaching posts is a very significant investment in the provision of additional teaching support for pupils with special educational needs in our schools.  This is additional to an increase of 41% in the number of resource teachers allocated to schools annually by the NCSE since 2011. </p>  <p>  The additional funding will provide additional supports to over 1000 schools who are identified as needing additional supports as a result of the new model.  Supports for children with special educational needs is a key priority for this Government.</p>  <p>  The revised allocation model replaces the generalised allocation process at primary and post primary school level for learning support and high incidence special educational needs, and the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) allocation process which provided additional resource teaching supports to schools, to support pupils assessed as having Low Incidence disabilities.</p>  <p>  Schools have been advised that they will be able to appeal whether the data used to calculate their school profile was correct and complete and whether it was correctly applied in the calculation of their 2017/18 allocation.</p>  <p>  DES Circulars 0013/2017 and 0014/2017 outline the basis on which the Education Research Centre determined the allocations for all schools.  </p>  <p>  In advance of the submission of an appeal, schools were asked to read carefully the DES circulars and in particular the relevant section, which relates to the breakdown of the allocation, which may be under consideration for appeal. </p>  <p>  The NCSE has published details of the appeals process on the NCSE website: www.ncse.ie. </p>  <p>  Schools were advised that should a school wish to appeal they should do so by March 31st 2017. </p>  <p>  519 schools had submitted appeal applications to the NCSE by 31st March, 2017, while some appeals are still being received.  The appeals process is being administered by the NCSE as opposed to my Department. </p>  <p>  The NCSE has advised schools that all appeals will be processed by 31st May, 2017, however, some of the appeals may also be concluded before that date. </p>  <p>  The model will also allow for some additional provision for exceptional circumstances or where a school&rsquo;s enrolment levels increase very substantially prior to the next review of the model.  The National Council for Special Education will support schools in managing their special education teaching allocations in the first instance.  Only in very exceptional circumstances, where it can be demonstrated that the schools profile has changed very significantly since the allocation was made to the school, may an additional allocation of hours be made to the school. </p>  <p>  Guidelines for schools on the organisation, deployment and use of their special education teachers to address the need of pupils with special educational needs are also being prepared and will be published shortly.</p>  <p>  The Guidelines will support schools to reflect on how they can review and manage their timetabling practices to ensure the timetable is sufficiently flexible to meet the needs of all pupils in their school who have special needs.  The Guidelines encourage schools to ensure they deploy their resources appropriately to meet the needs of all of the children in their school who require additional teaching support, including pupils with emerging needs, or new entrants. </p></reply>

The review process is being overseen by a steering committee comprising officials from my Department and from the Departments of Social Protection and Children and Youth Affairs, as well as the Higher Education Authority. </p>  <p>  This is a complex policy area that involves three Government Departments.  The review has examined existing data and the supports that are currently available for lone parents, with a view to identifying the specific challenges faced by lone parents in accessing higher education.  The intention is to identify measures and best practice that will address those challenges in the future.</p>  <p>  The review was sufficiently progressed to inform policy discussions between the relevant Departments in advance of Budget 2017.  In this context, I secured additional funding of &euro;1 million in Budget 2017 to support more lone parents to participate in higher education.  This new funding will be used to respond to the recommendations contained in the review. </p>  <p>  The additional funding I received for lone parents in Budget 2017 will be complemented by measures announced by my colleague, the Minister for Social Protection, to assist lone parents to return to education.  These measures include the reintroduction of the &euro;500 annual cost of Education allowance. </p>  <p>  The Minister for Children &amp;amp; Youth Affairs also is introducing a programme of affordable child care which will be of significant help to lone parents who are using childcare.</p></reply>

Knowledge Transfer Ireland (KTI) now has responsibility for setting direction for research performing organisations (RPOs) best practice to enable compliance with IP policy and procedures.</p>  <p>  The publication of the national IP protocol in 2012, and its subsequent refresh in 2016, sought to establish policy and guidelines on the interactions between industry and Ireland&rsquo;s Higher Education Institutes, including the treatment of intellectual property.  It provides guidelines and sets expectations for the RPOs and for industry.</p>  <p>  The national IP Protocol 2016 comprises two volumes:</p>  <p>  -  the National IP Protocol policy document which sets out the framework underpinning research collaboration and access to intellectual property from state-funded research</p>  <p>  -  the IP Protocol Resource Guide which provides an overview of the national IP management guidelines and links to resources and template documents, available for industry and RPOs.  It also provides an overview of the knowledge transfer structures in Ireland and the kinds of agreements that can be used to formalise research-industry engagements.</p>  <p>  The protocol explains the National IP Management Requirements and requires that RPOs have in place and operate internal IP management systems that meet or exceed these.  The protocol also includes &ldquo;good practice&rdquo; that will normally be followed.  However, industry and RPOs are free to adopt a different approach where this is in the best interests of successful relationships and research commercialisation.   Practices are also highlighted that may be followed if industry / RPOs choose to do so.</p>  <p>  The IP Protocol is a key reference source for Ireland&rsquo;s HEIs and research funders. HEIs have developed IP policies that are in line with national guidelines and good practice.   These will include policy on spin-out formation.  The detail of policies will differ amongst institutions. </p>  <p>  The research funding agencies for the publicly funded research system all require that the higher education institutions own the intellectual property arising from research projects that they fund. Each University and IoT has a set of policies that cover how they will govern the use of that IP.</p>  <p>  The national IP Protocol explains that commercialisation may benefit HEIs and provide incentives to the researchers involved in creating IP. IP may include protectable IP and know-how. Furthermore, the national IP management requirements make provision for HEIs to have in place a system for sharing of income from commercialising within the organisation, including with relevant researchers.</p>  <p>  The national IP Protocol is clear on the policy and processes to identify, protect and commercialise IP that arises in HEIs. This includes guidance on licensing of IP. A suite of Model Agreements, available for use if HEIs and companies choose, covering a range of IP licensing scenarios is available on the KTI website.</p>  <p>  In addition, all HEIs are requested yearly as part of their governance statements to state that a code of conduct for Governing Body members and a Code of Conduct for Employees has been adopted and is being monitored.   Guidelines for these codes are included in the IOT and University Codes of Governance (section 3.2).</p>  <p>  The University Code of Governance has been implemented since 2007 and was updated in 2012.  A copy of the code is available here:</p>  <p>  www.hea.ie/sites/default/files/university_code_of_governance_2012.pdf.</p>  <p>  The Institutes of Technology Code of Governance published in 2012 replaces an earlier document published in 2003:   A copy of the code is available here:</p>  <p>  www.hea.ie/sites/default/files/code_of_goverance_jan_2012final_updated_0.pdf.</p>  <p>  At institutional level, the Code of Conduct for employees and members of governing authorises would include statements related to conflict of interest and outside employment.  </p>  <p>  In the financial memorandum signed by both the HEA and HEIs it is a mandatory requirement that they comply with the codes of governance for IoTs and universities, while their annual governance statement also confirms that the approved Code of Governance has been put in place and implemented, and that a Code of Conduct for Employees has been implemented and monitored.

Variables used in the compilation of the HP Index include those related to demographic growth, dependency ratios, education levels, single parent rate, overcrowding, social class, occupation and unemployment rates.

This practice was known as &lsquo;rolled-up holiday pay&rsquo;.</p>  <p>  The practice was changed with effect from 1 September 2015 to bring the method of remunerating casual and non casual teachers into line with the European Union Working Time Directive following a decision of the European Commission. The terms of the revised payment arrangements are outlined in Circular 0015/2015.  Accordingly, casual and non-casual teachers employed by schools and ETBs are no longer paid &lsquo;rolled-up holiday pay&rsquo; and now receive a separate payment in respect of annual leave. </p>  <p>  There is no reduction in the overall take-home pay of the individual teacher under the revised arrangements. The method devised involves extracting a percentage from the current hourly/daily rate paid to the teacher and then paying that percentage back to the teacher at the next school holiday period. In accordance with Circular 0015/2015, payments in respect of annual leave are made to teachers at the Christmas holidays, Easter holidays and summer holidays in respect of hours worked in the previous term. Any entitlement to holiday pay up to the day of payment is paid at these times.  </p>  <p>  Circular 0015/2015 was agreed through the Teachers Conciliation Council, which is the recognised forum for considering the terms of employment of teachers and comprises representatives of the teacher unions and school management bodies as well as my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p></reply>

Substantial research, analysis, consultation with service users and stakeholders, and piloting have gone in to the development of this model and all of the evidence points to the fact that this new system will deliver better outcomes for children. </p>  <p>  No school, including the school to which the Deputy has referred, will lose supports as a result of the implementation of the new model. In addition, no school will receive an allocation, for the support of pupils with complex needs, less than the allocation they received to support such pupils during the 2016/17 school year. </p>  <p>  For the introduction of the new allocation model, from September 2017, the NCSE &lsquo;Low Incidence&rsquo; allocations which had been made for each school during the preceding 2016/17 school year, have been used to establish the complex needs component of the new model for each school. The use of this data has ensured that the most up to date data on the distribution of pupils in this category across the school system has been used. Standardised test data over a number of years, as set out in DES Circular 0013/2017, have been used for all primary schools.</p>  <p>  An additional 900 teaching posts have been provided to support the introduction of this new allocation model. The provision of an additional 900 teaching posts is a very significant investment in the provision of additional teaching support for pupils with special educational needs in our schools. This is additional to an increase of 41% in the number of resource teachers allocated to schools annually by the NCSE since 2011. </p>  <p>  The additional funding will provide additional supports to over 1200 schools who are identified as needing additional supports as a result of the new model. Supports for children with special educational needs is a key priority for this Government. The new funding will ensure that all schools receive a sufficient allocation of special education needs resources to provide additional teaching support to all pupils, including pupils who have yet to enrol in their school, who require such support. </p>  <p>  In relation to the particular school referred to by the Deputy in his question, this school had a General Allocation Model allocation of 50 hours for the 2016/17 school year, which combined with 30.18 resource teaching hours allocated to the school by the National Council for Special Education, gave a total allocation to the school of 80.18 additional teaching hours for the 2016/17 school year.</p>  <p>  As the profiled allocation for the school did not indicate an increased allocation requirement for the school for 2017/18, the school has maintained its existing level of allocation.</p>  <p>  The special education teaching allocation for this school for 2017/18 is 80.18 hours.</p>  <p>  There has therefore been no reduction to the special education teaching allocation for this school.</p>  <p>  Schools must notify the Department on Form S.E.T. Cluster 2017, Appendix D of the primary Staffing Schedule, of their clustering arrangements for their new Special Education allocation.</p>  <p>  Completed forms should be returned to the Department&rsquo;s Primary Teacher Allocations Section as soon as possible but no later than close of business on 30th March 2017. </p>  <p>  S.E.T. hours that are clustered into new full-time permanent posts and received before this deadline will be automatically approved by the Department. Schools that do not return the completed form within the above timeframe or where all of a school&rsquo;s S.E.T hours are not clustered into full-time posts will be included, as appropriate, in the Department led clustering process. </p>  <p>  Guidelines for schools on the organisation, deployment and use of their special education teachers to address the need of pupils with special educational needs are also being prepared and will be published shortly.</p>  <p>  The Guidelines will support schools to reflect on how they can review and manage their timetabling practices to ensure the timetable is sufficiently flexible to meet the needs of all pupils in their school who have special needs. The Guidelines encourage schools to ensure they deploy their resources appropriately to meet the needs of all of the children in their school who require additional teaching support, including pupils with emerging needs, or new entrants. </p>  <p>  The NCSE has announced the commencement of an independent appeals process through which schools may appeal the allocation made to their school if they believe the data upon which the allocation is based is incorrect or has been incorrectly used.  </p></reply>

In order to plan for school provision and analyse the relevant demographic data, the Department divides the country into 314 school planning areas. The GIS uses data from a range of sources, including the Central Statistics Office, Ordnance Survey Ireland, the Department of Social Protection and my Department's own databases. With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises at primary and post-primary level to determine where additional school accommodation is needed. </p>  <p>  My Department is included among the prescribed bodies to whom local authorities are statutorily obliged to send draft development and local area plans or proposed variations to development plans for comment and observations. This enables local authorities to reserve future school sites in areas designated for proposed housing development.  </p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s 6 Year Capital Programme prioritises building projects for areas where there is increased demography including County Kildare.  The Capital Programme also provides for devolved funding for additional classrooms for schools where an immediate enrolment need has been identified or where an additional teacher has been appointed.</p>  <p>  There are currently 29 major capital projects that are being progressed in County Kildare. This is in addition to over 50 smaller scale projects that have been approved devolved funding under my Department&rsquo;s additional accommodation scheme.</p></reply>

Variables used in the compilation of the HP Index include those related to demographic growth, dependency ratios, education levels, single parent rate, overcrowding, social class, occupation and unemployment rates.

With regards to the current year ONP funding (2017) and the rationale used, this has been calculated taking into account student enrolment numbers and head office costs. The 2017 initial allocation is higher than the initial 2016 allocation by over &euro;150,000.</p>  <p>  Since 2012, the overall grant has reduced slightly. This is to be expected as grant rates decreased in line with national budgetary cuts while enrolments in Cavan and Monaghan Education and Training Board (CMETB) have remained static.  The context for such budget measures was the need to reduce Government expenditure so that the country&rsquo;s finances could be stabilised and brought back to affordable levels.</p>  <p>  The improvements in the economy have now started to result in some improvements in the funding levels for the ETB sector. The first step in this regard was the additional once-off funding that was provided to this sector in 2015 and 2016.  CMETB received additional funding in the amount of &euro;121,951 in 2015 and &euro;443,000 towards the end of 2016.</p>  <p>  The ONP grant is provided for the general running costs of schools and head office. SOLAS is the national agency with responsibility for the development and provision of further education and training which is responsive to the needs of learners and the requirements of a changing economy. Funding for initiatives provided in response to the local employment and economic situation is primarily routed through SOLAS.</p></reply>

Where the introduction of new technology is planned, there should be consultation with members of the school community including parents. The cost and other implications must be fully considered by the Boards of Management before a decision is made.  It is a matter for each individual school to determine which particular measures are most suited to its individual circumstances and to how the school concerned organises teaching and learning.  The Department does not gather information on the uptake of tablet devices in schools.</p>  <p>  An advice sheet on the adoption of tablets in schools is available on the PDST-Technology in Education (PDST-TIE) website, detailing what tablets can offer a school, educational considerations, purchasing considerations and software.</p>  <p>  As part of the new Digital Strategy for Schools my Department will provide advice on ICT equipment and digital learning tools that are best suited to support learning and teaching in schools. &euro;210 m will be allocated over the period of the Strategy, with the first tranche of &euro;30 m already distributed to schools in respect of the 2016-2017 school year. Work on the implementation of the Strategy is now underway.</p></reply>

It focussed on schools and on the necessary capacity building required to achieve a step-change in outcomes for learners that will benefit our society and the economy. The review outlines 47 actions. 21 of these actions have been identified for initial priority implementation, and have been incorporated within the Action Plan for Education. These include: (a) All STEM teaching should be delivered by qualified STEM teachers (b)Introduce computer science, including coding, as a Leaving Certificate subject. Following the STEM Education Review Group's report work has commenced on the development of a STEM Education Policy Statement.</p><p>- We have established an Implementation Advisory Group for the Digital Strategy for Schools 2015-2020.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-04-04a.684.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1351" speakername="John Halligan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017040400076#WRU01500"><p>In 2015 the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGSFN) carried out a study on the future skills needs of the hospitality sector. The objective was to assess demand arising within the sector in Ireland including hotels, restaurants, bars, canteens and catering over the period to 2020. The aim was to ensure that there will be the right supply of skills to help drive domestic hospitality sector business and employment growth. The report which was published in November 2015, provides a clear and coherent framework for the development of talent in the hospitality sector in the years ahead to help drive both hospitality business and employment growth which is one the key goals of the Government&rsquo;s Tourism Policy Statement &ndash; People, Place and Policy-Growing Tourism to 2025.</p>  <p>  The Study assesses skills demand at all NFQ levels, with a particular focus on career progression opportunities for those at lower skilled levels to help fill anticipated job openings. The report provides a set of recommendations designed to address the skills requirements of the sector over the period to 2020.  A key recommendation in the report was the need to set up a National Oversight and Advisory Group comprising all of the key hospitality stakeholders.</p>  <p>  Following on this recommendation, the Hospitality Skills Oversight Group was established early last year.  Chaired by SOLAS for the first year, it has held eight meetings so far. Membership of the Group includes the Restaurant Association of Ireland, the Irish Hotel Federation, Irish Hospitality Institute, Licensed Vintners Association, Vintners Federation of Ireland, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Department of Education and Skills, Department of Social Protection, Higher Education Authority, Skillnets, SOLAS, ETBs, IoTs, DIT and Quality and Qualifications Ireland.  The role of the Group is to monitor progress on the implementation of the recommendations of the EGFSN and to provide a forum for on-going collaboration in addressing the skills needs of the sector and to identify and progress actions to overcome barriers on its implementation.</p>  <p>  The Group will publish a progress report later this year.  To date work has been undertaken on careers promotion via a range of fora, the launch of the Tourism Insight online programme - aimed at promoting careers in tourism and hospitality with particular reference to transition year and Youthreach participants.  The NCCA has recently published a draft new specification for Junior Certificate Home Economics which has a strong emphasis on culinary skills and retains the cookery examination component. Members of the group participated in a dedicated focus group with the NCCA on the new specification. Audits of both higher and further education facilities and courses are underway. A Restaurant and Hospitality Skillnet has been established which aims to address key skills requirements of restaurants and catering companies to help drive the domestic hospitality sector, employment growth, talent attraction and retention.  Funded through the National Training Fund by my Department, the network plans to design tailored programmes covering all aspects of the restaurant, food and beverage industry to SMEs nationally with a particular focus on career progression for those at lower skilled levels to help fill anticipated job openings and increase retention levels within the sector and is well placed to address key recommendations of the EGFSN 2015 Report.</p>  <p>  Earlier this year, I launched the Action Plan to expand Apprenticeship and Traineeship in Ireland 2016-2020, setting out how state agencies, education and training providers and employers will work together to deliver on the Programme for Government commitments on the expansion of apprenticeship and traineeship in the period to 2020. The Plan sets out how we will manage the pipeline of new apprenticeships already established through the first call for proposals in 2015 and also commits to a new call for apprenticeship proposals later this year, to provide for the needs of all sectors, including hospitality and tourism. Over the lifetime of the Action Plan, 50,000 people will be registered on apprenticeship and traineeship programmes representing a doubling of current activity. Work is progressing on the development of a new Commis Chef Apprenticeship led by the Irish Hotels Federation and the Restaurants Association of Ireland working with Kerry Education and Training Board. It is planned that this programme will commence later this year.  The Apprenticeship Council also recently approved development funding for a separate proposal to develop a Chef de Partie Apprenticeship.  The Apprenticeship Council will continue to work with the proposers of these new programmes to develop them into sustainable apprenticeships that can be delivered on a nationwide basis. The funding for planned and forecast expansion in 2017 will see an additional &euro;20 million provided.</p>  <p>  In 2015 a new Career Traineeship initiative was initiated by SOLAS in collaboration with the ETBs and enterprise to develop a more effective model of work-based learning, primarily at NFQ levels 4 and 5, incorporating best national and international research and practice. Networks have been created to facilitate partnerships between ETBs and employers to identify training needs, design training programmes, recruit learners and deliver training on and off the job. The Career Traineeship model of work-based learning is currently being piloted with the hospitality and engineering sectors, with the involvement of seven ETBs.</p>  <p>  Last year, over 8,000 higher education students undertook courses in this sector and provision was planned for over 6,700 beneficiaries within the further education and training sector.</p>  <p>  The work of the EGFSN and the Skills and Labour Market Research Unit in SOLAS, particularly in the provision of forecasts for existing and future skills needs across various sectors including hospitality, will continue to support and inform the work of my Department on the overall implementation of the National Skills Strategy 2025 and the Action Plan for Education 2016-2019 to ensure we plan and provide for Ireland's skills requirements across all sectors.</p></reply>

The Regulations are clear in this regard.  In addition, the housing loan scheme available to lower income first-time buyers from local authorities is subject to a rigorous credit policy that underpins the scheme and aims to ensure prudential lending.</p>  <p>  I have no plans, at this time, to alter the Regulations in respect of their application to first time buyers only.

Section 56 of the Valuation Acts 2001 to 2015, as amended by section 8 of the Local Government (Business Improvement Districts) Act 2006, provides that I, as Minister, can make an order directing a rating authority to limit the overall amount of income it could raise through rates in the year following a revaluation to the total amount of rates liable to be paid to it in the previous year, adjusted for inflation. Rate limitation orders have been made in each of the local authorities that have undergone a revaluation to date and I will be making further orders later this year in respect of the rating authorities currently undergoing revaluations. It is not possible to determine the quantum of the change to the ARV in each of the relevant local authorities in advance of the completion of the revaluation process, which I am informed will be later this year.</p></reply>

SICAP&rsquo;s aim is to reduce poverty, promote social inclusion and equality through local, regional and national engagement and collaboration. SICAP is a key priority of Government and its vision is to improve the life chances and opportunities of those who are marginalised in society, living in poverty or in unemployment through community development approaches, targeted supports and inter-agency collaboration, where the values of equality and inclusion are promoted and human rights are respected. </p><p>While SICAP provides supports to disadvantaged communities, funding is  allocated to Programme Implementers based on the terms and conditions of the SICAP contract.  The particular case (the provision of  two electric delivery vans) would not be eligible for SICAP, which relates to current funding only.  </p><p>My Department also has responsibility for the Communities Facilities Scheme which was officially launched on 10 March 2017.  The Scheme is targeted at disadvantaged urban and rural areas, but not exclusively so, and will fund projects that seek to enhance communities, address disadvantage and improve social cohesion at a local level.  The total scheme allocation is &euro;2 million for 2017 with each Local Authority getting an allocation of &euro;64,500.  The funding relates to capital projects only.</p><p>The Scheme is being administered by the Local Community Development Committees (LCDCs) under the remit of the Local Authorities on behalf of my Department.  The Scheme will include capital funding for projects falling under the following (non-exhaustive list) of areas:</p><p>-  Development/renovation of community centres</p><p>-  Community amenities</p><p>-  Youth clubs</p><p>-  Sports/recreation facilities</p><p>-  Improvements to town parks and common areas and spaces.</p><p>In line with the ethos of the Scheme, applications for funding for projects targeting the following (non-exhaustive) indicative list of groups or issues should receive priority:</p><p>-  Youth</p><p>-  Older people</p><p>-  Immigrants</p><p>-  Refugees</p><p>-  Ex-prisoners and families of prisoners/ex-prisoners</p><p>-  Projects promoting cultural activity</p><p>-  Projects promoting equality</p><p>-  Community Development projects</p><p>-  Projects promoting Integration</p><p>-  Projects under the Creative Ireland 2017-2022 initiative.</p><p>Further details, including contact details for each LCDC, can be found on my Department&rsquo;s website, at the following link:</p><p>.</p></reply>

A number of private equity firms have expressed an interest in purchasing mortgage debt portfolios from commercial banks with a view to exploring the potential for them to access the MTR scheme model for the borrowers in occupation of the mortgaged property.  They are seeking an alternative arrangement that would see the mortgaged property staying in the funding firm&rsquo;s ownership and the property itself leased back to the local authority in circumstances where the borrower is eligible for MTR and the borrower would therefore remain in their own home.  </p><p>One of the outcomes of the Review is that in order to test the operability of alternative funding models for the scheme, the Housing Agency will work with a number of financial entities who have come forward with an interest in working with the MTR scheme to progress a number of pilot alternative lease arrangements.  In advance of these pilots, a targeted marketing exercise is currently being carried out by the National Development Finance Agency, on behalf of my Department, to test the suitability of the leasing arrangements to ascertain if they would be viable for a mortgage to rent cohort.  These pilot projects are in a developmental stage and so the detailed contractual and lease arrangements have yet to be agreed and my Department is working with the Housing Agency in this regard.</p><p>A detailed financial assessment of the structure of the funding of the MTR scheme will be undertaken in advance of the budgetary process for 2018.  The assessment will be informed by the early impact of the other actions proposed by the Review, as well as the outcome of the experience with the pilot lease arrangements, and the availability of financial resources overall.</p></reply>

With the completion of the HAP roll-out and the ending of the scheme&rsquo;s pilot phase, I recently signed a Ministerial Direction, instructing local authorities to continue to offer HAP tenants access to other forms of social housing through the transfer list.  This refreshed direction ensures that following completion of the HAP pilot phase, HAP tenants still get all the benefits of HAP and are no less likely to get a different form of social housing support.</p><p>The practical operation of transfer lists is a matter for each local authority to manage, on the basis of their scheme of letting priorities.  The setting of such schemes is a reserved function of the local authority and as such is a matter for the elected members.  I understand that the majority of HAP households do avail of the option to be placed on a transfer list.

The Commissioner for Valuation has sole responsibility for all valuation matters except appeals of valuation procedures set out under the Valuation Acts 2001 to 2015 which come under the remit of an independent Valuation Tribunal.  The Valuation Acts come under the aegis of my colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality.</p>  <p>  Under Part 5 of the Valuation Acts 2001 to 2015, the Commissioner of Valuation is conducting a revaluation of all commercial and industrial properties throughout the State.  To date, revaluations have been completed in South Dublin County Council, Fingal County Council, D&uacute;n Laoghaire Rathdown County Council, Dublin City Council, Waterford City and County Council and Limerick City and County Council.  I understand that revaluations in 10 local authorities, including Carlow, Kildare, Kilkenny, Leitrim, Longford, Offaly, Roscommon, Sligo, South Dublin and Westmeath County Councils are due to be completed this year with valuations to take effect for rates purposes for 2018.</p>  <p>  I am aware of recent media reports that certain business owners have stated that they will face higher rates bills. However, it is not the purpose of a revaluation to increase or decrease the total amount of commercial rates collected by local authorities but rather to ensure that the valuations used for rating purposes are up-to-date and reflect current market conditions.  With this in mind, it is possible that some ratepayers may see the rateable valuation of their properties increase while other ratepayers may see the rateable valuation of their properties decrease.  Section 56 of the Valuation Acts 2001 to 2015, as amended by section 8 of the Local Government (Business Improvement Districts) Act 2006, provides that I, as Minister, can make an order directing a rating authority to limit the overall amount of income it could raise through rates in the year following a revaluation to the total amount of rates liable to be paid to it in the previous year, adjusted for inflation.  Rate limitation orders have been made in each of the local authorities that have undergone a revaluation to date and I will be making further orders later this year in respect of the rating authorities currently undergoing revaluations.</p>  <p>  Independent oversight of the local government sector is provided by the National Oversight and Audit Commission (NOAC), which was established in July 2014 under the Local Government Reform Act.  Its functions are wide ranging, involving the scrutiny of performance generally and financial performance specifically, supporting best practice, overseeing implementation of national local government policy and public service reform by local government bodies.</p></reply>

However, the owner is entitled to a refund if the property is vacant for specified purposes, these being if the premises are unoccupied for the purpose of additions, alterations or repairs; where the owner is bona fide unable to obtain a suitable tenant at a reasonable rent; and where the premises are vacant pending redevelopment.  The collection of rates and the determination of eligibility for a refund in this context are matters for each individual local authority.</p>  <p>  The Local Government Act 1946 provided that the owner was entitled to a 100% refund in most local authority areas.  Separate legislation governed refunds in the cities of Dublin, Limerick and Cork, where the same criteria for refunds applied but only 50% of the rates paid were refundable.</p>  <p>  With effect from 1 June 2014, when the relevant provision commenced, the Local Government Reform Act 2014 gives discretion to the elected members of individual local authorities to vary the level of rates refunds that apply in individual local electoral areas within the authority&rsquo;s administrative area. The Local Government (Financial and Audit Procedures) Regulations 2014 provide that the decision to alter the rate of refund should be taken at the annual budget meeting and that the rate of refund decided in respect of the relevant local electoral area shall apply to eligible persons for the year to which the budget relates.  The absence of a decision to vary the refund means that the existing legislative provisions regarding the rate of refunds apply (either 100% or 50% as set out above).</p></reply>

Full details of the supports offered by the Abhaile Service are available from <i>www.keepingyourhome.ie.</i>Under the restructuring option, local authorities will arrange where SO borrowers require financial and legal advice outside of that provided via MABS, to pay the cost of these fees to a maximum of &euro;1,000 excluding VAT. </p><p><b>Table 1: Shared Ownership Loans by Local Authority Area to end Q3 2016 </b><table><tr><th><b>Local Authority</b></th><th><b>Total</b></th></tr><tr><td>Carlow County Council</td><td>28</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan County Council</td><td>26</td></tr><tr><td>Clare County Council</td><td>113</td></tr><tr><td>Cork City Council</td><td>71</td></tr><tr><td>Cork County Council</td><td>411</td></tr><tr><td>DLR County Council</td><td>73</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal County Council</td><td>152</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin City Council</td><td>989</td></tr><tr><td>Fingal County Council</td><td>181</td></tr><tr><td>Galway City Council</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>Galway County Council</td><td>47</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry County Council</td><td>67</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare County Council</td><td>307</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny County Council</td><td>89</td></tr><tr><td>Laois County Council</td><td>200</td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim County Council</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick City and County Council</td><td>119</td></tr><tr><td>Longford County Council</td><td>35</td></tr><tr><td>Louth County Council</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo County Council</td><td>27</td></tr><tr><td>Meath County Council</td><td>61</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan County Council</td><td>21</td></tr><tr><td>Offaly County Council</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon County Council</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo County Council</td><td>99</td></tr><tr><td>South Dublin County Council</td><td>127</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary County Council</td><td>104</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford City and County Council</td><td>214</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath County Council</td><td>70</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford County Council</td><td>37</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow County Council</td><td>51</td></tr><tr><td><b>Grand Total</b></td><td><b>3777</b></td></tr></table></p></reply>

The scheme is targeted at owners of vacant properties who cannot afford or access the funding needed to bring their properties up to the required standard for rental property. </p>  <p>  Subject to the suitability of the property for social housing, and the agreement of the property owner, the cost of the necessary repairs will be met upfront by the local authority or an AHB.  This allows for the property owner to sign-up to a lease arrangement for a length that is linked to the value of the repairs, subject to a minimum period of 10 years.  The value of the repairs will then be offset incrementally against the agreed rental payment over a defined period within the lease.  The scope and cost of the works required, and the recoupment of the works cost through the lease payments, will be agreed between the property owner and the local authority or AHB.  The maximum cost of repairs allowable under the scheme is &euro;40,000.</p>  <p>  A property owner can either choose to arrange for a contractor to carry out the repairs themselves, or the local authority or AHB can arrange this instead.  Property owners will not be required to take on landlord responsibilities; the local authority or AHB will be the landlord and will have on-going management and maintenance responsibilities in respect of the properties. </p>  <p>  Property owners availing of the Repair and Lease scheme may qualify for other schemes such as the Home Renovation Incentive or the Better Energy Homes scheme for the works done to bring their properties to the required standard.  In this regard it is important to note that the capital advance for payment of the repairs works is not a grant payment and will be fully repaid by the property owner through the offset arrangements agreed under the lease for the property.  While local authorities and AHBs may be in a position to provide information in relation to other funding opportunities, it is the responsibility of the property owner to consider the requirements of any such scheme and apply for same.  In making any such application, the property owner should advise the relevant scheme administrator of their participation in the Repair and Leasing Scheme.</p></reply>

Kildare County Council received approval for the proposals at Maynooth, Naas and Sallins.  </p>  <p>  I am seeking additional funding for LIHAF under the Capital Mid-term Review 2016-2021, but it will be a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, to consider in the context of other demands for the available funds.  In the event that more funds are secured, local authorities will be able to resubmit proposals that did not receive funding or to advance other new proposals that would meet LIHAF objectives.</p></reply>

However, I presume that the Deputy's question refers to lands in public ownership or held in trust by the State, specifically in the Dublin North West constituency, which may be suitable for housing.</p>  <p>  The Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness sets out a number of actions to increase and accelerate housing delivery, across all tenures, to help individuals and families find homes.  There is a broad suite of actions proposed under Pillar 3 of the Action Plan, entitled Build More Homes, which provides for the use of publicly owned land banks for provision of housing in a more pro-active and strategic way. </p>  <p>  In particular, Action 3.5 of Rebuilding Ireland commits to the establishment of a centralised database of publicly owned lands, that are potentially suitable for the development of housing, whether by the State or by private sector housing providers.</p>  <p>  Initially, the exercise involves identifying and mapping sites in local authority and public ownership, with appropriate lands to be master-planned to deliver increased mixed tenure housing, including social and more affordable homes, to meet demand. </p>  <p>  The map will form part of the broader National Land Supply Management Strategy, which is being developed within the context of the new National Planning Framework, to be titled Ireland 2040: Our Plan.  Once established, the map will be updated regularly to record the development and use of these lands, including those located in the Dublin North West constituency, to ensure that the best possible information is publicly available.  The project is an iterative process and will be completed in phases. </p>  <p>  Phase 1 of the mapping project is well underway and involves the mapping of approximately 700 sites in local authority ownership and those held by the Housing Agency under the Land Aggregation Scheme, showing their location, size, boundaries and other information.  I expect to be in a position to publish this mapped data set, together with lands zoned for residential development, in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  Phase 2 of the project involves the mapping of other publicly owned lands with housing potential.  In this regard, my Department is currently working with some of the associated key stakeholders of these lands to identify all potentially suitable sites, with the initial focus on lands in the main urban areas where demand is highest, i.e. Dublin, and the cities of Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford. </p>  <p>  A third phase of the project will involve the mapping of local authority and approved housing body social housing construction projects.  This will include new build projects under the Social Housing Capital Investment Programme, the Capital Assistance Scheme, the Capital Advance Leasing Facility as well as regeneration projects.  </p>  <p>  At its heart, Rebuilding Ireland is focused on increasing and accelerating housing delivery, across all tenures.  The active pursuit of housing provision on State lands, including local authority lands, will continue to be an important part of delivering on this overall ambition.</p></reply>

The precise timing for the advancement of each of these projects, including completion dates, is a matter for the relevant local authorities and AHBs concerned, in the first instance.  However, within the overall 21,000 social housing solutions targeted for delivery this year, some 4,500 of these will be delivered through new builds/acquisitions and a significant proportion of these will involve new construction. </p><p>Further project approvals are being added to the pipeline as they are developed by local authorities and AHBs, details of which will be included in the next quarterly report under the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan.  I am keen that all local authorities advance their social housing projects as speedily as possible and I have assured them that funding is in place to support their activity in this regard.</p></reply>

The retirement age of 55 years of age was introduced because of health and safety considerations related to the job.  Since the enactment of the Health, Safety and Welfare at Work Act 1989, underpinned by subsequent legislation, each fire authority, as an employer, has a statutory duty to avoid placing employees at risk.</p>  <p>  A collective agreement was reached between the Local Government Management Services Board and the trade unions involved (SIPTU and ATGWU) in November 2002.  This collective agreement provided, inter alia, for the appointment of an Expert Group which in turn would advise as to the retirement age for retained firefighters.  The Expert Group's Report on Retirement Age recommended that the retirement age for retained firefighters remain at 55, with provision for an annual extension, subject to medical assessment, up to 58 years of age.  Following the publication of the report of the Expert Group in April 2003, a circular was issued by my Department in November 2003 setting out the age requirements for retained firefighters.  This Circular specifically stated that under no circumstances should any fire-fighter who does not have a written contract of employment with a higher retirement age be employed beyond age 58. </p>  <p>  I have no plans to change the age limit.</p></reply>

There are shortages in the supply of rental accommodation in key locations, particularly in urban areas.  In some of these areas there is also significant demand for transitory short-term accommodation.  In this context, providing short term rentals at higher prices may be an attractive option for landlords.  However, a determination by An Bord Plean&aacute;la in a particular case has determined that the exclusive use of a residential apartment for short-term holiday lettings is a material change of use requiring planning permission. </p>  <p>  The implications of this case have raised a number of regulatory and other related issues, such as tax liability, residential tenancy regulation, support for tourism, and planning.

Housing output fell by over 90%, from peak construction of 93,000 homes in 2006 to just over 8,301 in 2013, and while current levels of house completions are increasing, reaching almost 15,000 new homes in 2016, this level is still well short of the 25,000 homes required each year to meet demand.  </p>  <p>  Recent reports show that demand for housing remains strong, driven by economic growth and increasing numbers of households as well as pent-up demand built up over years of under-supply, as evidenced by annual average price increases of approximately 9% on a national basis and between 8.7% and 10.2% in Dublin.  However, it should be noted that average prices are still well below the peak levels recorded in 2007, according to the CSO&rsquo;s Residential Property Price Index.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s multi-stranded Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness is aimed, inter alia, at increasing supply of new homes across all tenures, as well as bringing vacant or under-utilised homes back into use to meet both current and future demand.  While we are still at an early stage of implementation, there is already strong evidence that the focus on increasing and accelerating supply in Rebuilding Ireland is starting to work.  The latest residential commencements and completions data show that house-building activity is continuing to strengthen.  Completions for the 12 month period to end January 2017, stood at 15,256 homes, an 18% increase year on year.  Likewise, commencement notices for 13,334 new homes were submitted in the twelve month period to end January 2017, an increase of 44% year on year.  Identification and development of key sites in the major urban areas where demand is greatest and the recent announcement of &euro;226 million of enabling infrastructure investment to facilitate construction of some 23,000 homes by 2021 are further initiatives that will significantly impact on supply and thereby help to counteract price inflation.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the very significant increase in the Government&rsquo;s social housing investment programme to &euro;5.35 billion over a six-year period is already ramping up social housing supply. Last year, &euro;935 million was spent providing nearly 18,400 social housing supports.  Almost 5,300 homes were built, refurbished or acquired and some 12,000 Housing Assistance Payment tenancies were established.  Looking ahead, I have published the Social Housing Construction Projects Status Report - Q4 2016 (available on www.rebuildingireland.ie), detailing the pipeline of over 500 social housing projects, involving the construction of over 8,400 homes at various stages in the process.  </p>  <p>  While a very significant amount of work has been carried out since the publication of Rebuilding Ireland, I am fully aware of the considerable further progress required to activate housing development sites and to increase and accelerate delivery to the scale required. </p>  <p>  The housing market is complex and no one single fix will address all the issues.  Nonetheless, I believe that, through the multiplicity of actions currently being progressed through Rebuilding Ireland to increase the supply of high quality homes to at least 25,000 per annum by 2021, the Government has created the conditions required for the restoration of a more sustainable and normally functioning housing market capable of providing homes, at affordable price points to buy or rent, where and when they are required.</p></reply>

CE is intended for the long-term unemployed and other specified disadvantaged groups, including those who are in receipt of Farm Assist, a means-tested payment which is aimed at low income farmers.</p>  <p>  The aim of CE remains as an active labour market programme with the emphasis on progression into employment and/or further education and training.  The main cohort of CE participants is made up of the long-term unemployed in receipt of jobseekers allowance.</p>  <p>  While it is possible for a self-employed person to meet the basic criteria of receipt of a CE-qualifying payment (specifically jobseekers allowance) for the requisite period of time (12 months), they may not meet the criteria of being unemployed during that qualifying period.  For CE, the maximum amount of days worked permissible for a jobseeker is 30 days within the 12-month qualifying period.  If a self-employed person is in receipt of jobseekers allowance and meets the criteria outlined above, they can be considered for CE on a case-by-case basis.</p>  <p>  Those who do not meet the CE eligibility criteria are advised to contact their local DSP Intreo Office where a case officer will be happy to discuss the other employment and training options that are open to them.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The decision was communicated by the Board of CIB to all CIS and MABS Boards and to all staff on the same day.  </p>  <p>  The decision comes after a lengthy and extensive analysis of options for organisational restructure of CIB&rsquo;s service delivery partners, including detailed consultation with all stakeholders on the need for a more streamlined governance model.  This process followed in the wake of a feasibility study, conducted as part of the implementation of CIB&rsquo;s Strategic Plan 2012 &ndash; 2015. </p>  <p>  The restructured governance arrangements are being implemented at local company board level only.  The decision taken reduces the number of individual local CIS and MABS company boards from ninety three (93) to sixteen (16).

There will be no disruption to CIS and MABS services for those who use them. </p>  <p>  The valuable work carried out by the employees and volunteers working in CIS services and the employees of MABS services will continue as heretofore. A more streamlined governance structure will result in a more targeted use of valuable staff resources, re-directed to increased front line service delivery, made possible by reduction in the current significant administrative burden associated with maintaining ninety three (93) individual companies nationwide.  The changes will bring the CIS and MABS organisations more into line with modern public service governance guidelines and requirements where significant State funding is involved.  </p>  <p>  In 2017, CIB is set to receive State funding of &euro;54 million, of which &euro;15 million is allocated to CIS services (including &euro;13.1 million to the 42 local Citizens Information Services, &euro;1.2 million to Citizens Information Phone Services and, the balance, &euro;0.7 million to central and other supports), and &euro;24.6 million is allocated to the network of MABS services (including &euro;15.4 million to the 51 local MABS, &euro;0.3m to National Traveller MABS, &euro;2.0 million to MABS National Development Company, &euro;3.3million to the MABS Dedicated Mortgage Arrears initiative, &euro;3.5 million to the Abhaile service, and the remaining &euro;0.1m to MABS central supports).</p>  <p>  Following on from the Board&rsquo;s February decision, a Restructuring Implementation Group is being set up by CIB to examine all aspects of implementing the new sixteen (16) board model.  This work will include examination of the establishment costs of the new structure and the potential for future savings derived from the reduction in the administrative burden associated with ninety three (93) individual local companies.  Current costs are an aggregate of the costs incurred by each of the ninety three (93) local companies on items such as audit fees, professional fees (including legal services), payroll administration and board of director expenses.  While cost is not the driver of the restructuring project, some efficiencies are likely to result from moving to a reduced sixteen (16) company model.   </p>  <p>  The aim of the project is to improve existing governance arrangements and optimise the benefits from operating a more modern, streamlined and customer focused service delivery model.  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Abolishing the bereavement grant provided a significant annual saving and allowed my Department to protect other core social welfare payments such as the State pension. </p><p>The number of bereavement grant claims in 2013 was 23,716, and this represented an increase of approximately 4% on 2012.  Based on a similar yearly increase each year since 2013, it is estimated that the number of bereavement grant claims that might arise in 2018, were the scheme to be re-introduced, would be in the region of 28,858, and this number would likely increase in future years.

These include a weekly paid widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s (contributory and non-contributory) pensions, which are based on contributions or a means test, and a once-off widowed or surviving civil partner grant of &euro;6,000 where there is a dependent child.  A number of social welfare payments, including State pension, continue in payment for six weeks following a death.  In Budget 2016, the Government increased the payment after death period to 12 weeks for carer&rsquo;s allowance.  Guardian payments are available where someone cares for an orphaned child.  A special funeral grant of &euro;850 is paid where a person dies because of an accident at work or occupational disease.</p><p>Additionally, the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme provides assistance to eligible people in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs and those of their dependants.  Under the SWA scheme, the Department of Social Protection may make a single exceptional needs payment (ENP) to help meet essential, once-off and unforeseen expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet from their weekly income, which may include help with funeral and burial expenses.  The Government has provided &euro;31.5 million for exceptional and urgent needs payments in 2017. </p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

At the end of January, there were 2,842 CA applications awaiting decision. </p><p>The average waiting time for new carer's benefit (CARB) applications at the end of January 2017 was 7 weeks.  The figures for 2016 are unavailable.  At the end of January, there were 312 CARB applications awaiting decision. </p><p>Applications for CA increased 20% in 2016, compared to 2015.  This increase has impacted on the volumes of applications awaiting decision.  Furthermore, delays in processing are often caused by the submission of incomplete application forms or the failure to submit required documentation that is requested on the application form. </p><p>The processing target that is set for the carer's allowance scheme is 70% awarded within 12 weeks; in January that target was reached with 76% of applications awarded within 12 weeks.  Reducing waiting times is a priority for my Department and we are working hard to make this happen. </p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

I am pleased to inform the Deputy that this extension is now in place with self-employed contributors, who meet the qualifying conditions, benefitting from the scheme with effect from 27 March 2017.  This means that people who work for themselves and pay PRSI at class S can now get the same regular dental and optical examinations, free of charge, that until now were only available to employees.  They can also get a grant for hearing aids of 50% of the cost, to a maximum of &euro;500 per aid, every 4 years.</p>  <p>  The re-introduction of treatments on the scheme is planned for October 2017.  This will include the re-introduction of an annual scale and polish treatment on the dental scheme and the periodic provision of spectacles and associated optical services to all qualified PRSI contributors.  The full details of the changes will be advertised closer to the implementation date.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the position for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The current agreement is the Convention on Social Security between the Government of Ireland and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland which was signed in Dublin on 14 December 2004 (Schedule 1 to S.I. No. 701/2007).  This Reciprocal Agreement covers the following social protection payments:</p><p>- Illness Benefit;</p><p>- Occupational Injuries Benefit;</p><p>- Maternity Benefit;</p><p>- Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit;</p><p>- Invalidity Benefit;</p><p>- State Pension [Contributory];</p><p>- Widow/er&rsquo;s and Surviving Partner&rsquo;s [Contributory] Pension;  and</p><p>- Guardian&rsquo;s Payment [Contributory].</p><p>It also consolidated the terms of earlier agreements, modified them to take account of legislative changes both in Ireland and the UK and extended their scope to the Isle of Man, Jersey, Guernsey, Alderney, Herm and Jethou [Channel Islands].</p><p>The Bilateral Agreement with the UK provides, therefore, for broadly similar entitlements as apply under the EU Regulations on the Coordination of Social Security Systems.  The latter commenced to apply to the UK, as with Ireland, on the accession of both countries to the then EEC, now EU, on 1 April 1973.  The provisions of the EU Regulations on the Coordination of Social Security Systems, in general, replace the provisions of any existing bilateral social security agreements where the EU Regulations apply to an EU Member State.  In the case of our bilateral agreement with the UK, it only applies to people to whom EU Regulations on the Coordination of Social Security Systems do not apply.</p></reply>

It provides employers with two levels of payment - &euro;7,500 or &euro;10,000 over two years, paid in monthly instalments, provided the employment is maintained.  The rate of payment depends on the length of time the person employed has been on the Live Register. </p><p>Up to the end of February 2017, just over 12,900 people have gained employment through the scheme.  Expenditure on the programme is shown in table 1 below.</p><p>Table 1: Expenditure on JobsPlus 2013-2017<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Amount</th></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>&euro;1.04m</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>&euro;11.883m</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>&euro;22.63m</td></tr><tr><td>2016 (Provisional)</td><td>&euro;23.994m</td></tr><tr><td>2017 (to end February)</td><td>&euro;4.915m</td></tr></table></p><p>My Department has established relationships with employers, representative bodies and other stakeholders at a national level and this is co-ordinated by employment engagement managers throughout the Department&rsquo;s divisions who co-ordinate the service at local level.  JobsPlus is publicised as a matter of course in employer networking events and briefings on the services offered by the Department, at jobs fairs and at events during National Jobs Week, which takes place annually.  My Department also engages with enterprise agencies to encourage their client companies to recruit directly from the Live Register and to avail of the services my Department provides, including JobsPlus. </p><p>My Department is currently undertaking a Focused Policy Assessment on JobsPlus and the outcomes for participants will be examined in this and in a forthcoming counterfactual impact evaluation which is planned for later this year.  Preliminary analysis of a sample of Jobsplus employees has shown that over 87% of participants remain off the Live Register between 30 and 36 months after commencing their JobsPlus employment.  I consider this a very favourable result and I believe it demonstrates the positive effect that JobsPlus has in getting people who are long-term unemployed into work.</p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The payment continues to be paid in respect of children up to their 18th birthday who are in full-time education, or who have a disability. </p>  <p>  Child Benefit is currently paid to around 627,000 families in respect of some 1.2 million children, with an estimated expenditure in the order of over &euro;2 billion in 2017.  </p>  <p>  It is not possible to accurately predict the full year cost of increasing the cut off point for eligibility for child benefit from 16 to 18 years of age.  This is because the Department has no way of measuring with any degree of accuracy the number of children who are not in education.  However, according to the most recent figures from the Department of Education and Skills the national retention rates at second level are in excess of 90 per cent.  This would suggest that the number of additional children between 16 and 18 years currently not eligible as they are not in full time education would be relatively low and would not result in a substantial increase in current Child Benefit expenditure.  However, breaking the link between school attendance and Child Benefit for 16 and 17 year olds could also have unintended consequences in relation to retention rates at second level.  </p>  <p>  It is also worth noting that under EU regulations Child Benefit is defined as a family benefit and is exportable in cases where the claimant is working in Ireland but where the children are living abroad.  We have no way of predicting with any degree of accuracy the potential in-flow in this category for children who turn 17 and are not in secondary education in other Member States. </p>  <p>  Any changes to the eligibility criteria for Child Benefit would have to be considered in an overall budgetary context.</p></reply>

There are two State pensions.  Firstly, the State pension (non-contributory) is a means tested pension and is funded by general taxation.  Secondly, the State pension (contributory) is not means tested and is paid from the Social Insurance Fund. </p>  <p>  Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying for a contributory pension have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension (contributory), all contributions paid or credited over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement. </p>  <p>  The home-makers scheme makes qualification for a higher rate of State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme, which was introduced in and took effect for periods from 1994, allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age (or caring for incapacitated people over that age) to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes, subject to the standard qualifying conditions for State pension contributory also being satisfied.  This has the effect of increasing the yearly average of the pensioner, which is used to set the rate of their pension. </p>  <p>  My Department has estimated that the annual cost of extending the Homemakers scheme to allow people to avail of the full 20 years currently allowed under the scheme, encompassing periods prior to 1994, could cost some &euro;290m in 2017, and this figure would rise at a faster rate than the rate of the overall cost of State pensions.  This is a very significant cost, and the main beneficiaries would be people who already have significant household means, and who do not therefore qualify for a means-tested payment.</p>  <p>  Where someone does not qualify for a full rate contributory pension, they may qualify for an alternative payment.  If their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a State pension (non-contributory), which amounts up to 95% of the maximum contributory rate.  While this payment is subject to a household means-test, there are very significant disregards which mean that over 70% of such pensioners qualify at the full rate.</p>  <p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

My Department will spend approximately &euro;232 million this year on these elements of the household benefits package for over 425,000 customers.  The cost of the telephone allowance scheme had risen significantly each year, as the number of eligible customers grew.  At the end of September 2013 there were almost 396,000 receiving the telephone allowance compared to approximately 316,000 people in 2007.  This was an increase of 25%, or an average increase of approximately 4% per annum. </p>  <p>  The Government is keenly aware of the impact of Budget decisions on the Department&rsquo;s clients, and strives to ensure that the money available is targeted in the most effective way.  In Budget 2016, the first increase in the basic rate of the State pension in seven years was given.  This increased the personal rate of the State pension (non-contributory) to &euro;222, and that of the State pension (contributory) to &euro;233.30.  There was also a &euro;2.50 increase in the rate of the Fuel Allowance, from &euro;20 to &euro;22.50 per week.  </p>  <p>  In Budget 2017, I announced a further increase in the rate of State pensions by &euro;5, bringing the maximum personal rate of the State pension (non-contributory) to &euro;227, and that of the State pension (contributory) to &euro;238.30.  </p>  <p>  Therefore, over the past two Budgets, the maximum weekly rate for State Pensions has increased by &euro;8 per week, which is the equivalent of over &euro;34 per month.  The value of these increases is significantly in excess of the value of the telephone allowance previously provided.</p>  <p>  Any decision to restore the telephone allowance would have to be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations.  To date, the Government has concentrated additional resources on increasing the rate of the pension, rather than on the Household Benefits package.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

In such cases, the Department may meet all expenses necessarily incurred in the burial of a person.  The Department may obtain repayment of those expenses from the estate of the deceased person or from any person who was liable to maintain the deceased person immediately before his or her death.

In this context we are of course also guided by the aspiration contained in Article 3 of the Constitution as amended by the people in 1998.  </p>  <p>  The principle of consent and the possibility of a change in constitutional status in Northern Ireland is a fundamental part of the Good Friday Agreement, which was endorsed by the people of this island North and South.  The trigger for a referendum in this jurisdiction is connected with the calling of a border poll, under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement, in Northern Ireland.  This occurs when the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland considers it likely that a majority of those voting would express a wish that Northern Ireland should cease to be part of the United Kingdom and form part of a united Ireland.  At present, the Government does not believe it likely that such a border poll in Northern Ireland in the near future would result in constitutional change; that is also the view of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.  In those circumstances, such a poll now might only increase uncertainty and division at an already difficult and sensitive time.  </p>  <p>  In the event of any such referendum in the future, the Government would proceed according to the requirements of the Constitution and in accordance with the principles and procedures of the Good Friday Agreement.  The Deputy will appreciate that the prospect of any such referendum in the future would be a most significant step for the Government and for the country and could only proceed on the basis of extensive preparation and appropriate consultation.</p>  <p>  There are of course aspects of this constitutional issue which relate to my Department&rsquo;s ongoing work.  In the context of Brexit, the Government has made clear its determination to ensure respect for all aspects of the Good Friday Agreement, including those relating to a possible change in constitutional status for Northern Ireland, regardless of the UK&rsquo;s status within the EU.   </p></reply>

The war has entered into its third year, the country is on the brink of famine, the political process has stalled and, despite recent conclusions by the UN Panel of Experts on Yemen that an outright military victory by either side is no longer a realistic possibility, fighting continues with increasingly devastating consequences for the civilian population.</p>  <p>  Yemen was on the agenda of the Foreign Affairs Council in Luxembourg yesterday.  We agreed Council Conclusions reaffirming the EU's serious concern about the Yemeni situation, and urging the parties to lay down arms and negotiate a peace agreement.  We also called on them to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian assistance.  Along with my European colleagues, we confirmed our commitment to increasing the EU's engagement with Yemen, once a political solution to the conflict is agreed.  </p>  <p>  The Conclusions made special reference to children who, along with women and other vulnerable groups, are paying the heaviest price in this war.  Of particular concern are reports emerging of violations of the rights of the child, recruitment of child soldiers, and attacks on schools and health facilities, which deny children access to education and health care.  Nearly four fifths of all Yemeni children need humanitarian assistance, and UNICEF estimates that at least one child dies every ten minutes from preventable causes.  The only way to improve the outlook for these children is to put an end to the conflict.  </p>  <p>  UN Special Envoy for Yemen, Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed, announced last week that a new framework for peace negotiations has been presented to the warring parties.  The Special Envoy called on the International Community to encourage the parties to make the concessions necessary for a peace agreement.  As is often the case, Ireland&rsquo;s voice is stronger when raised in conjunction with our EU partners, and the EU has made clear that it will increase its efforts to support UN actions to reach a political settlement to this crisis.  </p>  <p>  I have also discussed Yemen with the UAE Minister for Foreign Affairs, Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, and with the Saudi Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Dr Nizar bin Obaid Madani.  I raised concerns about the appalling humanitarian situation in Yemen resulting from the conflict and about attacks which have directly impacted on civilians.    </p>  <p>  We will also continue to provide humanitarian assistance to Yemen.  Ireland has been a significant donor to the crisis, giving almost &euro;6 million since the conflict began.  We intend to maintain a similar level of support in 2017, and Ireland will attend a High-Level Pledging Conference for Yemen in Geneva on 25 April, jointly hosted by Sweden, Switzerland and the OCHA.  </p>  <p>  Finally, this conflict has been characterised by allegations of violations of human rights, including rights of the child, and international humanitarian law.  Ireland has been consistent in calling for an impartial, international investigation into these reports.  Unfortunately, consensus at an international level to launch such an investigation has not been possible.  However, through the EU, we will continue to call on all parties to this conflict to co-operate with the National Commission of Inquiry, as well as with the enhanced OHCHR Yemen Office, and to allow investigators full access to all parts of Yemen.  Ireland will continue to call for all alleged violations of human rights and international humanitarian law to be investigated, and for those found guilty of violations to be held accountable.  </p></reply>

The Resolution stated that these settlements have no legal validity and are a major obstacle to peace; it called for an immediate end to settlement activities, and underlined negative trends operating on the ground.  It also called on all states to distinguish in their dealings between the State of Israel and the occupied territory.</p>  <p>  In all these aspects the Resolution echoed the positions already taken by the European Union, to which Ireland had made a significant contribution.  I very much welcomed and supported this important Resolution by the Security Council. </p>  <p>  The broader international community also expressed itself at the Paris Conference on the Middle East, which I attended on 15 January.  The conference Declaration focused on international support for the two state solution and for the principles that must underlie any peace agreement, and called for an end to unilateral actions that hinder the realisation of that goal. </p>  <p>  Resolution 2334 and the Paris Declaration together constituted a clear statement of the policies and positions of the international community as a whole.</p>  <p>  Going forward, however, it is evident that the political process to reach an agreement on these lines is stalled. The initiative by France which culminated in the Paris Conference helped focus attention on the difficulty but could not restore momentum to the process.</p>  <p>  The position of the new US Administration will obviously be an important factor in the next developments, but this has not yet become clear. </p>  <p>  Ireland continues to participate actively, both in my own interventions at the Foreign Affairs Council and at official level, in EU level discussions on how to defend and reactivate the two state solution.</p></reply>

Since the UK Referendum result last year my Department, like other Government Departments, has been preparing for and engaging on the Brexit process.  The 2017 Allocation for my Department included an initial allocation to support the Brexit negotiation process. </p>  <p>  Specifically my Department received an additional allocation of &euro;3.2M which facilitated the transfer back to my Department from the Department of the Taoiseach of 14 staff to facilitate the establishment of a new and enlarged EU Division which has overall responsibility for the management of the Brexit negotiations.  In addition programme funds to support the secondment of Irish staff to the EU institutions and enhanced public communications and debate on the EU issues were also transferred.   </p>  <p>  It is clear that these exit negotiations will be complex and intensive.  The Department has therefore allocated an additional budget of &euro;2M from the extra allocation provided as part of the 2018 Budget process.  This budget will be used to increase the number of staff assigned to the management and support of the negotiations and to increase the level of support provided to our colleagues across all Government Departments and agencies.  This will result in the assignment of additional staff resources to our missions in Brussels, London, Paris, and Berlin and in the Department here in Dublin.  Some of these additional resources have already been put in place, with the remainder to follow in the immediate period ahead. </p>  <p>  It is becoming clearer that there are other implications arising from Brexit that the Department will need to manage.  There has been a sustained increase in passport applications from Britain and Northern Ireland follow the UK vote to leave the EU last June.  In addition there has been a substantial and sustained increase in the number of Foreign Birth Registrations (that is, the process of acquiring citizenship through an Irish-born grandparent) right across the world.  </p>  <p>  My Department is continually monitoring the additional needs associated with management of this Brexit process and engaging with the Department for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p></reply>

Resident Embassies are an important resource in this regard as they allow us to deepen our understanding of the local context and to communicate clearly and effectively our priorities and concerns.  </p>  <p>  The positive decisions taken by two important international partners to open Embassies here reflect the increasing economic, political and people to people links that Ireland enjoys with both countries.  We share values, co-operating closely constructively within the UN on global priorities such as climate change and human rights.  We also enjoy growing bilateral interests, including increased trade.  Ireland&rsquo;s place at the heart of the EU is now of growing importance to our international partners.</p>  <p>  My New Zealand counterpart, Murray McCully, visited Dublin in January and we discussed then the possibility of his government deciding to open an Embassy here.  I am delighted that Minister McCully announced on 24th March that New Zealand will open an Embassy in Dublin.  This decision testifies to the ever growing political, economic and cultural links between our two countries.   As Minister McCully noted when he announced the decision to open an Embassy, our countries enjoy a very warm relationship which is underpinned by our shared values.  We work closely together on issues such as climate change, disarmament, and human rights, and are also both members of the Small Advanced Economies Initiative.  The new Embassy will help us to deepen our friendship, strengthen our co-operation and further develop our trade and economic links.  </p>  <p>  The announcement by Peru&rsquo;s government of its decision to establish an Embassy in Dublin was made shortly before President Higgins made an official visit to Peru.  When the President, accompanied by my colleague Minister Varadkar, met with Peru&rsquo;s President, Foreign Minister and other Ministers, the decision by Peru to establish an Embassy in Dublin was warmly welcomed.  My Peruvian counterpart, Ricardo Luna Mendoza, extended to me recently St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day greetings and he took that opportunity to express his strong conviction that the opening of an Embassy of Peru in Dublin will contribute to enhancing our bilateral relations and also to our collaboration on common global interests such as democracy, human rights, the rule of law and trade.  I share fully Minister Luna&rsquo;s objectives and I look forward to working with him and his officials in the period ahead.</p></reply>

Migration was the main focus of the informal European Council held in Malta on 3 February, at which a Declaration addressing the external aspects of migration was issued.  The Declaration restates the EU&rsquo;s commitment to assist Libya.  Priority is to be given to supporting the Libyan national coast guard; ensuring adequate reception capacities and conditions for migrants; supporting the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) in stepping up assisted voluntary return activities; and enhancing information campaigns and outreach addressed at migrants in Libya and other countries of origin and transit.  Priority will also be given to reducing pressure on Libya&rsquo;s land border, including through enhanced border management capacity; monitoring of alternative routes and possible diversion of smugglers&rsquo; activities; supporting initiatives by Member States directly engaged with Libya; and deepening dialogue and co-operation with neighbouring countries. </p>  <p>  Ireland along with its EU partners is very concerned about the conditions of migrants and refugees in Libya.  The issue was addressed at the most recent Foreign Affairs Council.  The EU called on the Libyan authorities to redouble their efforts to improve the human rights situation in the country.  The EU is committed to assisting the Libyan authorities in this endeavour by enhancing the protection of migrants, helping to improve conditions in detention centres, ensuring adequate reception facilities, looking for alternatives to detention, and increasing assisted voluntary return from Libya.  The EU will make use of the EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa and will increase co-operation with the IOM and the Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees in support of these commitments.  </p>  <p>  There is no "deal" with Libya.  Rather the EU is proposing a number of ways to help Libya to manage and control the flow of migrants risking their lives.  The EU will continue to be guided by its commitment to human rights and humanitarian concerns in this regard.</p></reply>

Draft 'Migration Compacts' have been drawn up for the first five priority countries identified under the Migration Partnership Framework: Niger, Nigeria, Mali, Senegal and Ethiopia.</p>  <p>  The objective of these Migration Compacts is to improve cooperation on readmission and return of those not entitled to reside in the EU; to prevent irregular migration and counter smuggling and trafficking in human beings; to reinforce the current international protection system for refugees in the partner countries; and, crucially, to address the root causes of irregular migration.   Ireland has consistently been clear in all discussions on the EU&rsquo;s response to the migration crisis that addressing the root causes is essential.   </p>  <p>  Engagement with the five priority countries continues to develop, and the third progress report &ndash; showing tangible progress - was presented by the European Commission to the European Parliament, European Council and the Foreign Affairs Council in March 2017. </p>  <p>  Ireland supports Migration Compacts as a key instrument to stem irregular migration and prevent human trafficking and we will continue to engage positively in the process.  We are working particularly closely with Ethiopia, one of the five priority countries identified, and one of Irish Aid&rsquo;s key partner countries.</p>  <p>  Human rights and humanitarian values are at the core of the EU and Member States' approach under the Partnership Framework.  The EU and its Member States are committed to enhancing human rights safeguards in all negotiations on migration and mobility and to ensuring cooperation frameworks with third countries are built on these principles.</p></reply>

In the Programme for Government we have set out our ambition to make progress towards the UN target of providing 0.7% of GNP to Official Development Assistance (ODA) as resources permit.  </p>  <p>  Over the past two years we have managed to increase funding allocations for ODA, providing an increase of &euro;40 million in 2016 and a further &euro;10 million for 2017.  The total 2017 allocation for ODA is &euro;651 million.  </p>  <p>  Annual Budget allocations for ODA, as with all public expenditure, are a matter for Government, and are set in the context of available resources, our commitments and the competing budgetary demands.  For 2018, when the Estimates process begins, I and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade will be making the strongest possible case for a continued increase in the allocation to ODA.  </p>  <p>  Our priorities for the aid Programme are very clearly laid out in our policy - "One World One Future".  In line with our commitment to the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals, our aid programme is sharply focused on delivering our goals of reducing poverty and hunger, promoting inclusive and sustainable growth and building more equitable and better systems of governance, particularly in our key partner countries.   </p>  <p>  Detailed financial allocations are made annually across the aid programme in response to existing needs, humanitarian crises and overall programme priorities.  Clear criteria are in place to inform the budget allocation process.  Sub-Saharan Africa remains our priority region, where we direct assistance to the poorest communities, particularly in our key partner countries.  Our aid programme focuses on delivering real and sustainable improvements to the lives of some of the world poorest and most vulnerable people in the areas of basic health, education, agriculture, and food production.  </p>  <p>  Grants to partners are made to support development and humanitarian programmes.  Eligible partners include civil society organisations and missionary organisations, multilateral organisations and national and local governments in partner countries.  All partners are assessed to ensure that they have the appropriate governance systems in place, that they can ensure proper accountability of funds and that they have the capacity to deliver effectively.</p></reply>

I would emphasise that, while we have never been part of a geographical subgroup, ever since joining the then EEC in 1973 we have worked closely with on a sector-by-sector or issue-by-issue basis with like-minded partners.  Much of this work takes place between Permanent Representations in Brussels and in the margins of Councils but capital-to-capital contact is also important.</p>  <p>  Substantial analysis of how best to develop this further, both by country and by sector, has already been undertaken.  The extensive programme of meetings at political and official levels with all other Member States on Brexit has also underscored the importance of networking with partners.  Discussions with many Member States have revealed that they too are very mindful of the need to intensify alliances post-Brexit and are also looking at how best to do so.  Some of them, especially those whose broad approach to economic issues such as trade and the digital single market is consistently similar to ours, have expressed an interest in co-operating further with us.

There are numerous channels for Irish-British engagement, some of which were developed in the context of the Good Friday Agreement and some of which were established more recently.  All will be used to the full, not least given the UK&rsquo;s exit from the European Union.    </p>  <p>  These channels include the British Irish Council (BIC), the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference (BIIGC), the British Irish Parliamentary Assembly (BIPA) and a formal process established in 2012 involving summits between the Taoiseach and the UK Prime Minister, supported by a Joint Work Programme managed at official level by the heads of all government departments in Dublin and London.  At political level, there are ongoing and frequent contacts between myself and my ministerial colleagues and our UK counterparts. </p>  <p>  The last summit meeting of the British Irish Council was held in Cardiff in November 2016, and the next summit is scheduled to take place in Northern Ireland in June 2017.  These summit meetings have been complemented by regular meetings for the specific work sectors. </p>  <p>  BIC meetings such as these provide Ireland with valuable opportunities to engage with devolved administrations.  We take care in particular to maintain close contacts with the Scottish and Welsh governments, with First Minister Sturgeon visiting Dublin late in 2016 and the Taoiseach meeting with the Welsh First Minister in Cardiff in recent weeks. </p>  <p>  Parliamentary links are also vitally important and must continue in earnest given the UK&rsquo;s exit from the EU.  I look forward to addressing the next plenary meeting of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, to be held in Kilkenny in May 2017.  BIPA Committees continue to meet regularly to examine areas of shared importance across the BIPA member jurisdictions (Ireland, the UK, Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland and the Crown Dependencies), including Brexit, while the regular interaction between other parliamentary committees is to be welcomed and encouraged. </p></reply>

The protection of human rights in Northern Ireland law, incorporating the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), is one of the key principles underpinning the Good Friday Agreement. </p>  <p>  At their first meeting in London on 26 July 2016, the Taoiseach and Prime Minister May reaffirmed that the Good Friday Agreement is and will remain the foundation for co-operation between the Irish and British Governments on Northern Ireland.  It is important to underline that the ECHR system is separate and distinct from the European Union, and current process of the UK exit from the European Union has no impact on the UK&rsquo;s participation in that system.  In this regard, I welcome the clarification last week in the UK Government&rsquo;s White Paper on withdrawal from the EU that it has no plans to withdraw from the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>  <p>  In the crucial area of human rights it is important that both Governments do all they can to engender confidence by demonstrating their commitment to both the letter and spirit of the Agreement.  In Northern Ireland, the human rights provisions support the confidence and willingness of all communities to participate in the agreed political institutions of the Agreement and ensure that every citizen is guaranteed equal status and equal protection under law. </p>  <p>  The Good Friday Agreement is clear that there is an obligation to incorporate the European Convention on Human Rights into Northern Ireland law and this is a continuing obligation.  The Government has underlined this obligation in the context of British Government proposals, not connected with Brexit, to repeal the UK Human Rights Act, which incorporates the ECHR into domestic law, and to introduce a domestic Bill of Rights.  In this regard, the Government has stressed to the British Government the importance of fully meeting its human rights obligations under the Good Friday Agreement and will continue to monitor the situation closely.</p></reply>

The Government is doing everything it possibly can in our ongoing engagement with the Egyptian authorities to seek to have this young man returned to his home and his family at the earliest possible time.  </p>  <p>  The Government has repeatedly appealed to the Egyptian Government to release this young man, and has stressed in particular the humanitarian grounds for returning him to Ireland.  The Taoiseach has made repeated representation to Egypt&rsquo;s President el-Sisi, and I have raised the case on many occasions with my counterpart, Foreign Minister Shoukry.  We have called for him to be released under the terms of Egyptian Decree 140; we have called for him to be released under the so-called &lsquo;Youth Amnesty&rsquo; scheme, and we have made the case for his release on humanitarian grounds.  The Egyptian Government&rsquo;s consistent response has been that it cannot intervene while the matter is before the courts, and that the President can only consider the use of the discretionary powers that he has to release this citizen when the trial has ended and a verdict has been decided by the judges.  </p>  <p>  The Government maintains open lines of communication at all levels with the Egyptian Government on the case.  I once again urged the Egyptian Government to release this citizen without further delay when I met with my Egyptian counterpart, Foreign Minister Shoukry, in Brussels on March 6th while the Taoiseach again wrote to the Egyptian President in recent days.</p>  <p>  We have made it clear to the Egyptian authorities that we hold them responsible for ensuring this citizen&rsquo;s welfare while he remains in their custody by carrying out regular medical checks and providing all required medical treatment.  </p>  <p>  Our Embassy in Cairo has paid an unprecedented number of consular visits to this citizen.  The most recent consular visit was on March 29th.  </p>  <p>  The trial in which this citizen is a defendant will be back in court on 5 April.

The Programme for a Partnership Government highlights this commitment, making specific reference to pursuing the issue of the Dublin Monaghan bombings.   </p>  <p>  The All-Party motion on the 1974 Dublin Monaghan bombings adopted in this House on 25 May last year has, like those adopted in 2008 and 2011, been conveyed to the British Government.  These motions call on the British Government to allow access by an independent, international judicial figure to all original documents relating to the bombings.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to actively pursuing the implementation of these all-Party D&aacute;il motions, and has consistently raised the issue with the British Government.  The Taoiseach has raised the issue with Prime Minister May, emphasising the Government&rsquo;s continued support for the D&aacute;il motions.  I have also raised the matter on a number of occasions with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, James Brokenshire, and am actively engaging with the British Government on an ongoing basis, as are my officials.  </p>  <p>  In our discussions, I have advised Secretary of State Brokenshire that the D&aacute;il motions represent the consensus political view in Ireland that an independent, international judicial review of all the relevant documents is required to establish the full facts of the Dublin Monaghan atrocities.  I have also underlined to the Secretary of State that the absence of a response from the British Government is of deep concern to the Government and indeed this House, and emphasised the urgent need for a response from the British Government.</p>  <p>  Secretary of State Brokenshire has acknowledged the importance that the Government and D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann attach to this case, but indicated that the British Government is still considering how it could respond in a way which would adequately address the motions and be consistent with its obligations.</p>  <p>  The Government will continue to pursue this matter with the British Government, urging it to provide a satisfactory response to the motions that have been adopted by this House.  The Taoiseach and I will also continue our engagement with party leaders in the Oireachtas on the issue.</p>  <p>  There are many families throughout these islands and beyond who continue to deal not only with the awful pain of losing a loved one, but also with the struggle for answers decades after these traumatic events.  Accordingly, the establishment of a new comprehensive framework for dealing with the past, as envisaged in the Stormont House Agreement, is a priority for the Government.</p>  <p>  There has been intensive engagement on legacy issues as part of the discussions currently underway in Belfast.  There remain a number of outstanding points, but I am very conscious of the urgent need to achieve progress, so that the institutions can be established and start working to meet the needs of victims and survivors and support broader societal healing and reconciliation.  The Government will continue to work with the British Government and the parties to achieve the establishment of these legacy institutions as soon as possible.</p></reply>

The public is advised that the turnaround time will vary depending on factors such as seasonal demand.  Turnaround times for each category of applicant are updated weekly on the Passport Service website.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, there has been a surge in passport applications in recent months.  There are currently over 70,000 applications in the system and application numbers so far this year are over 20% higher than for the same period last year.  The average processing time for renewal applications submitted through the An Post Passport Express service is currently 16 working days (one day over the target 15 working day turnaround).   </p>  <p>  With respect to the specific case that the Deputy refers to, the application was received on 24 March and I am satisfied that the estimated issue date is in line with the notified turnaround timelines for Passport Express.</p>  <p>  As a matter of best practice my Department advises customers to apply at least six weeks prior to travelling and to submit their application through Passport Express only if they have no immediate travel plans.  There are a limited number of appointments available at the Passport Offices in Dublin and Cork for those travelling in three weeks or less.  These appointments can be made online.</p>  <p>  The Passport Service has put in place a number of measures to manage the high volume of applications, including the recruitment of 230 Temporary Clerical Officers.  The majority of these officers are now in place. </p>  <p>  The new online passport application service for adult renewals which was launched last week will result in considerable efficiencies and should further assist in alleviating pressure on passport processing.  The service offers a target turnaround of ten working days (plus postage).  It is convenient and secure and I ask the Deputy to encourage eligible applicants to use this channel.</p>  <p>  To ensure timely applications I would also urge the Deputy to assist in promoting the free email reminder service for passport holders whose passports are due for renewal.

There are currently over 70,000 applications in the system.  Between 1 January and 31 March over 250,000 applications were received, representing an increase of 26% over the same period last year. The current processing time for adult renewal applications is 16 working days (just one day over the target turnaround time of 15 working days).  Some categories, such as first-time applicants and those reporting their passports lost or stolen have taken longer, due to extra security checks.</p>  <p>  The exceptional volume of applications is likely be sustained into the summer months and my Department has worked hard to put in place a number of measures, including additional staffing resources, to mitigate the impact.   </p>  <p>  A total 230 Temporary Clerical Officers (TCOs) have been assigned to the Passport Service to assist with the processing of passport applications and to respond to customer queries via phone, email and social media.  This is an increase of 59 officers over the number recruited in 2015.  The great majority of these TCOs are already in place and the remaining officers are expected to join in the coming weeks.  My Department has also requested the Public Appointments Service to assign additional Clerical and Executive Officers to fill recent vacancies in the Passport Service.</p>  <p>  The new Online Passport Application Service for adults renewing their passport which I launched last week will assist greatly in managing increased volumes of applications in the months and years ahead and in meeting target turnaround times.  The service allows citizens to renew their passport books and cards online twenty four hours a day from wherever they are in the world.  It removes the requirement to have a form witnessed and is a fast, secure and convenient way to renew a passport.   </p>  <p>  I have circulated a note to all Deputies on the new online service and I would appreciate assistance in raising awareness among constituents.  I would also ask the Deputy to continue to help promote good practice in her communications with constituents.  As a matter of best practice and to avoid unnecessary stress, applicants should allow six weeks for a passport application.  Applicants should check the validity of their passport before booking travel.  If travel is already booked, applicants should consult the Passport Office website to ensure they use the correct channel for their application.  The Passport Office offers a free renewal reminder email service to Passport holders and I urge passport holders to avail of this service.  See www.dfa.ie for more information. </p>  <p>  I will continue to closely monitor the situation to ensure the effective deployment of staff and other resources in order to minimise the impact of the exceptionally high demand on turnaround times for applicants and on customer service.</p></reply>

The church is a relatively modern building built by the Board of First Fruits c. 1830.  The OPW engaged a firm of conservation architects to complete an architectural and structural appraisal of the condition of the church and round tower with a view to developing a future works programme for the site.  The commission also includes the production and installation of information panels at the site.</p>  <p>  The round tower is the earliest surviving structure on the site and was part of the early Christian Monastery founded here in the 8th Century.  The round tower is in reasonable condition and has no visible cracks or movement joints on the external surface.  The flaunching (mortar) on the top of the tower and the interior and exterior walls were to be inspected as part of the project but it is not anticipated that any significant structural issues with the tower will be discovered.</p>  <p>  The architectural assessment and condition report is currently being finalised and will shortly be available at which time the OPW will be in a position to determine what remedial works will be required to stabilise the building.</p></reply>

Total state backed investment under the Plan amounted to &euro;42 billion over the period.</p>  <p>  The substantial progress made in securing sustained economic growth and the further strengthening of the public finances has enabled the Government to commit an additional &euro;5.14 billion in Exchequer Capital funding in support of the Capital Plan.  &euro;2.2 billion of this amount has already been pre-committed to support the Government's Action Plan on Housing and Homelessness, while in Budget 2017 the Government also allocated additional capital funding for 2017, with carry-over implications for 2018 and 2019.  The result of all of this is that there now remains &euro;2.655 billion of additional uncommitted capital resources to be allocated over the period 2018-2021 on the basis of the outcome of the mid-term review of the Capital Plan that is now underway.</p>  <p>  It is expected that the review process will be completed in Quarter 3 of 2017, in time to enable the Government to make final decisions in due course on how the remaining additional capital funding should be allocated.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that a public consultation has been launched on the Review to ascertain the views of the public and key stakeholders on what our national infrastructure priorities should be and to seek views on infrastructure investment priorities beyond the period of the current Capital Plan, which will help formulate a longer term Capital Plan for the next 10 years.</p></reply>

The Act provides a very broad definition of public bodies at Section 6(1) and further provides that all new public bodies comprehended by this definition will automatically come under freedom of information (FOI) legislation, unless specifically exempted by order.  This reversed the system under previous legislation whereby new bodies would have to be brought into the scope of the legislation by order.</p>  <p>  The Act also provides the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform with the power to make an order bringing a body under the Commissioner's remit if it is financed, wholly or partly, or directly or indirectly by means of monies provided by a Minister of the Government.  I am sure that the Deputy would share the view that there has been substantial progress and a planned and structured approach of continuing to extend the Commissioner's remit is one that he would share.</p>  <p>  With regard to the issue of Business Improvement District (BID) Companies, I am advised that FOI does not apply as the bodies do not meet the criteria set out in Section 6 (1) of the Act.  Under the governing legislation, overseen by my colleague, the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, a Business Improvement District company is required to be limited by guarantee and formed and registered under the Companies Act.  The board of directors will be made up of businesses or their representatives and nominees of the local authority.  At least two thirds of the directors must be ratepayers or ratepayer representatives.</p>  <p>  I understand that the BID Companies are established under the Companies Act to implement the BID Scheme in particular areas.  The Company implements the BID Scheme which is funded through a levy from business owners in the area.  Given the composition and role of BID Companies, I do not currently have any plans to bring them within the scope of Freedom of Information but the matter could be considered under any future wider review of bodies to be brought under FOI.</p></reply>

This is a scheme of humanitarian assistance, targeting aid at those worst affected properties, for which there are no alternative, feasible measures.</p>  <p>  The Office of Public Works is finalising the administrative arrangements for this scheme and working jointly with Local Authorities and the Department of Social Protection.  Initial funding of &euro;2 million for the scheme has been allocated this year.  I expect to be able to appraise Government of the administrative arrangements and announce further details of these arrangements shortly.</p>  <p>  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has indicated that the administrative arrangements for the Voluntary Homeowners Relocation Scheme will help it identify those farmyard buildings worst affected by the flooding during Winter 2015/2016.  That department will work with these individual farms to determine if there are any alternative remedial works to protect those farmyard buildings at risk.  This approach will inform the feasibility of any future once-off targeted scheme for Voluntary Farm Building Relocation.</p>  <p>  Lake Levels and Shannon Group</p>  <p>  The Shannon Flood Risk State Agency Co-ordination Working Group met on six occasions in 2016 and on one occasion to date in 2017.  Information about the Group is available on the OPW website, www.opw.ie.</p>  <p>  The Group took a decision in October 2016 to trial the lowering of the lake levels on Lough Allen, within the existing statutory framework, during the Winter 2016/2017 to help mitigate potential flood risk.  A protocol was agreed between ESB, Waterways Ireland and the OPW to lower the late Autumn and Winter minimum lake levels in Lough Allen by approximately 0.7 metres with the first reduction implemented in October 2016.  The Group has agreed that the trial will be repeated later this year, commencing in late Autumn.</p>  <p>  The Group is also developing a plan for strategic maintenance, to help reduce further deterioration of the River Shannon, and is considering the development of viable flood risk reduction measures in the Shannon Callows, as a further commitment to enhance co-ordinated activities by the relevant State Agencies.  These plans are taking into account the environmental, legal and resource implications involved.</p>  <p>  Interdepartmental</p>  <p>  The Interdepartmental Flood Policy Co-ordination Group that I chair met four times in 2016.  Last November the Group presented for consideration and agreement by Government an interim report setting out progress on its work and making appropriate recommendations for consideration by Government at this time.  The report is available on the OPW website, www.opw.ie.  Progress continues to be made by sector leads on recommendations within the interim report and those policy areas identified that require further action.  While the OPW remain in contact with sectorial representatives, who are members of the Group, I will convene a meeting of the Group in the coming weeks to start the process to co-ordinate a final report for consideration by Government.</p>  <p>  Flood Forecasting</p>  <p>  A Steering Group to establish a National Flood Forecasting Service has met on nine occasions to date, agreed a Terms of Reference and prepared and agreed an implementation plan comprising a number of phases, including an initial set-up phase (scheduled for completion by Q3 2018) and a development and trial phase (scheduled for completion by Q1 2020).  Given the complexities involved in establishing, designing, developing and testing this new service, it is anticipated that it will take at least 5 years before it is fully operational and it is estimated it will require a staffing complement of 15 full-time posts.  Met &Eacute;ireann has appointed one new staff member to date to lead the project.</p>  <p>  IPP Pilot</p>  <p>  The Interdepartmental Flood Policy Co-ordination Group is considering the potential costs and benefits associated with the introduction of an individual property protection scheme.  The Group is being informed by two different pilot projects, which are currently underway in Thomastown and Graiguenamanagh in County Kilkenny and Crossmolina in County Mayo.  In respect of the Kilkenny pilot, the OPW is funding the costs of a research and feasibility study into the potential provision of individual property protection.  No funding has yet been drawn down by the Council on the pilot study, which is due to conclude and make recommendations in April.  In Crossmolina, consultants have undertaken surveys of individual properties and Mayo County Council has procured a contractor who is currently installing the defences at the relevant properties.  To date, no funding has been drawn down by the Council.  The Co-ordination Group&rsquo;s work, when completed, will be submitted to Government for consideration in the context of the merits of the introduction by Government of any scheme to support individual property protection measures.</p>  <p>  Minor Works Review</p>  <p>  A review of the Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme is currently underway with a view to examining the criteria for consideration within the Scheme, including for example the various thresholds for the assessment of benefit. Consultations are underway with Local Authorities with a view to examining any potential improvements, administrative or financial, which will encourage applications under the scheme.  It is expected that the review will be completed shortly.</p>  <p>  Riparian</p>  <p>  Work to develop guidance to clarify the rights and responsibilities of landowners in relation to the maintenance of water course on or near their lands is at an advanced stage and will in the coming weeks be subject to legal advice before being finalised.</p></reply>

Given the volume of spending, in the order of &euro;12bn per annum on goods, services and works, it is essential that a strategic approach is adopted and value for money is achieved.  The Office of Government Procurement (OGP) was established to drive the reform agenda, adopt a strategic approach and professionalise public procurement, leverage the State's spending power and deliver significant savings to the State.</p>  <p>  Framework agreements are one of a number of ways in which the Office of Government Procurement (OGP) engages with the market to achieve value for money in the delivery of much needed public services.  Framework agreements are established through competitive procurement processes and are agreements with suppliers or service providers which set out terms and conditions under which specific contracts can be made during the term of the agreement.  Once established, public sector bodies can then avail of goods and services from the suppliers on the Framework.  In general, contracts emanating from framework agreements take one of the following two forms:</p>  <p> - by means of direct draw down (i.e. the Contracting Authority does not need to hold a mini competition as there is a single supplier or a rota from which the next available supplier is chosen) - the framework establishes a panel of suppliers that compete for specific contracts awarded (mini-competitions) by Contracting Authorities over the lifetime of the agreement.</p>  <p>  The OGP carries out market analysis to assess the need for a good or service and the nature of the market for that good or service.  In consultation with public service bodies the OGP develops and manages the process to establish a framework.  Whilst the OGP facilitates contracting authorities through supporting mini-competitions under frameworks, it is the Contracting Authority that is legally responsible for any drawdowns/mini-competitions or awards given under the framework agreement.</p>  <p>  In this regard, it should also be noted that competitions can be cancelled for a variety of reasons, e.g. each tender has a provision that allows for cancellation, for example where no tenders are submitted by the framework suppliers; where no suitable tenders or no suitable requests to participate were submitted; where the public body's requirements have changed; or where the proposal is more expensive than anticipated.  Given the remit of the OGP and the value of aggregated arrangements such as frameworks, it is important that our approach to the market done is such a way that ensures value for money for the taxpayers and fairness for those suppliers competing for the procurement opportunity.  The small number of cancellations, whilst unfortunate, are necessary to ensure value, suitability of good or service and the appropriate approach to market.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the OGP that the latest available data on the eTenders system for 2016 indicates that of the 688 competitions run by the OGP in 2016 on behalf of Contracting Authorities throughout the State, 15 competitions were recorded as cancelled.  I am advised that this figure is subject to change as work continues on processing tender competitions which commenced in 2016.</p>  <p>  In relation to the specific cases referred to by the Deputy, the competitions were cancelled by the client after due consideration of the circumstances of the particular cases.  The OGP advises clients having regard to the procurement regulations.  The procurement regulations provide inter alia for due process for all parties.</p>  <p>  From the OGP perspective, the costs for cancelling competitions are not recorded separately and are absorbed into overall running costs.</p></reply>

The purpose of this review is to evaluate if the legislation has met its objectives of providing appropriate transparency on "who is lobbying whom about what"; drawing on the submissions received in the public consultation process.  My Department undertook the first review as required and I expect to bring the report to Government shortly.  Subsequent reviews will be required every 3 years.</p>  <p>  Responsibility for the implementation of the Regulation of Lobbying Act 2015 rests with the Standards in Public Office Commission (SIPOC).  SIPOC is an independent statutory body and as such is not accountable to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform or to the Government in the performance of its functions.  However SIPOC has established a register for recording lobbying activity which may be viewed at www.lobbying.ie.  If the Deputy wishes he may search the register under any names, organisation, or Designated Public Official to see who has registered as lobbying whom about what.</p>  <p>  A person or organisation communicating with any Designated Public Official where that interaction meets the definitions contained in the Act (that is, a person within the scope of the Act, communicating with a Designated Public Official about a relevant matter) is required to register as a lobbyist and report the communication in their return for the relevant period.  The Act makes no distinctions regarding where the communication takes place.  Furthermore advice may be sought from the Standards in Public Office Commission (SIPOC) if any uncertainty exists.</p>  <p>  Determining whether a communication falls outside of jurisdiction is not based solely on whether it physically takes place outside of the country.  Each case will have to be reviewed by the Regulator (SIPOC) based on its own set of facts to determine in what circumstances a communication would fall within or outside of jurisdiction, and whether and how the Act may apply.</p>  <p>  It is recognised that there may be difficulties with extra-territorial enforcement of the Act.  All those lobbying Irish Designated Public Officials outside of the State are encouraged to comply with the spirit of the legislation to ensure transparency.</p></reply>

The Action Plan contains 276 actions for delivery across Government, State agencies and other bodies to support the economic and social progress of rural Ireland.  Each action has been assigned to a lead body which will be responsible for implementation of the action within a definite timescale, as set out in the Plan.</p>  <p>  Realising our Rural Potential  is a three year plan to be delivered over the period up to 2020 and actions will commence at different points over that period.  However, priority actions for delivery over each 6-month period will be identified on a rolling basis and reported on at the end of the 6-month period.

The scheme is expected to support over three hundred projects across the country in 2017 and to create employment in the conservation and construction industries, while helping to regenerate urban and rural areas.</p>  <p>  Applications from members of the public for this &euro;2 million Scheme were accepted in local authorities throughout the month of February and have now closed. </p>  <p>  The Structures at Risk Fund enables conservation works to heritage structures in both private and public ownership, which are protected under the Planning and Development Acts and are deemed to be at significant risk of deterioration.  Structures must be on the local authority Record of Protected Structures.  The fund, administered through the local authorities, seeks to encourage the regeneration and reuse of heritage properties and to help to secure the preservation of protected structures which might otherwise be lost.  Applications from members of the public for the 2017 Structures at Risk Fund were accepted in local authorities throughout the month of February and have now closed. </p>  <p>  Details of both these schemes are available on all local authority websites.</p>  <p>  In the context of a particular building, especially one which is on the Record of Protected Structures, the best advice for the owner may be to contact the Architectural Conservation Officer from the Local Authority who will be able to advise on the various types of funding available to assist with the building.</p>  <p>  The Heritage Council, which my Department funds, also provides grants for the protection and preservation of the built heritage.  It is primarily a matter for the Heritage Council to decide how its funding should be allocated across the range of research, education and conservation programmes it supports annually having regard to competing priorities for limited resources.  Grant schemes for 2017 are advertised by the Heritage Council on its website www.heritagecouncil.ie.</p></reply>

This Bill will enable the granting of full eligibility for general practitioner and other health services to all children in respect of whom a Domiciliary Care Allowance (DCA) is paid.  Granting a medical card to all children in respect of whom a DCA payment is made will benefit approximately 9,800 children in this cohort who do not currently qualify for a medical card.  The legislation was passed in the Seanad last Thursday, 30th March 2017. The Bill was signed by the President on 31st March 2017.</p>  <p>  Pre-registration with the HSE for the DCA medical card will be available from 1st May 2017.  This can be done on-line or paper-based.  These medical cards will be certified for use from 1st June 2017. </p>  <p>  For a child in receipt of DCA but who currently does not have a medical card, the parent or guardian will register for the scheme either online or through a paper-based form.  For a child who is currently eligible for a medical card (under discretion or otherwise) and is confirmed to be in receipt of DCA, the HSE will automatically issue them a medical card.  For a child who is currently eligible for a GP Visit Card (under discretion or otherwise), this card will automatically be upgraded to a full medical card.</p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their income and assets while the State pays the balance of the cost.  The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.</p>  <p>  When the NHSS commenced in 2009, a commitment was made that it would be reviewed after three years.  The Report of the Review was published in July 2015.  Arising out of the Review, a number of key issues have been identified for more detailed consideration across Departments and Agencies.</p>  <p>  An Interdepartmental/Agency Working Group has been established to progress the recommendations contained in the Review.  This Group is chaired by the Department of Health and includes representatives from the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the HSE, the Revenue Commissioners, and when required, the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF).  These recommendations include examining the treatment of business and farm assets for the purposes of the financial assessment element of the Scheme, the implementation of administrative reforms to the Scheme, and a review by the NTPF of present pricing arrangements in private residential facilities.  This work is currently underway.  An initial report on progress was submitted to the Cabinet Committee on Health in September 2016.</p>  <p>  Once all of the relevant Review recommendations have been considered, any amendments required to the Scheme will be identified.  Changes which require legislative implementation will be addressed collectively, and it is important to remember that the NHSS is largely underpinned by primary legislation.</p>  <p>  As noted by the Deputy, the Programme for a Partnership Government has also committed to reviewing the NHSS to remove any discrimination against small businesses and family farms.  This review is currently underway.</p></reply>

The focus of this initiative will be those lists with large numbers of long waiting patients, including Ophthalmology.</p>  <p>  In addition to this Daycase Initiative, the NTPF has been working closely with my Department and the HSE to agree an approach to the remaining 2017 allocation.  The HSE is currently developing 2017 Waiting List Action Plans for Inpatient/Daycase procedures and Outpatient appointments to reduce the number of patients waiting more than 15 months by the end of October.  The Inpatient/Day case Plan is being developed in conjunction with the NTPF's approach to the utilisation of its remaining &euro;10m funding for patient treatment in 2017.</p>  <p>  The HSE has now submitted Draft Waiting List Action Plans for Inpatient Daycases.  My Department is currently reviewing and evaluating this plan and engagement is ongoing with the HSE and the NTPF towards its finalisation.  The Outpatients Plan has been significantly progressed and I expect that it will be submitted shortly.</p></reply>

Government policy is to ensure there is equitable access for public patients, that the proportion of private activity is appropriately controlled and that the statutory charges for provision of services to private patients are collected by public hospitals. </p>  <p>  When a patient is admitted to hospital, he/she has the option of being treated as a public or a private patient.  A patient's status in this regard is determined in the first instance according to whether or not he/she chooses to waive his/her right to be eligible for public inpatient services and in doing so chooses to be admitted as the private patient of a consultant whose contract permits private practice.  </p>  <p>  All patients who opt to be treated privately in a public hospital are subject to charges, as provided for by the Health (Amendment) Act 2013.  Detailed operational procedures in this regard, including arrangements in relation to patients who wish to avail of private health insurance to meet the costs due, are managed by the HSE.  I have therefore asked the Executive to respond directly to the Deputy in relation to this aspect of the questions asked.</p></reply>

I welcome the fact that the HSE has committed that no child will wait longer than 4 months for such a procedure by the end of the year. This would bring Ireland in line with waiting times in the NHS in the UK.</p>  <p>  At my request, a Scoliosis Waiting List Action Plan 2017 has been jointly developed by the HSE and the Children's Hospital Group. The HSE has submitted a final draft, which will be published shortly. As part of the new proposal to address the spinal fusion waiting list, a number of children have been identified as clinically appropriate to have their scoliosis surgery in other hospitals, such as the Mater, Cappagh and Temple Street. Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital Crumlin has begun contacting families whose children are considered to be suitable for outsourcing to seek their permission to share their child&rsquo;s medical file with the relevant hospitals. Cappagh and the Mater have begun to review these patients&rsquo; files and are developing a care plan for each patient.</p>  <p>  As a result of the recent recruitment campaigns, two nurses have started which will facilitate an additional day a week of theatre in Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital Crumlin from 7 April. A number of nurses are due to commence in post in April and a consultant is due to commence in June, which will mean an increase in theatre capacity by a further two days a week from July 2017. The Minister met with scoliosis advocacy groups last week to update them on progress. In addition, a group also met with senior HSE management to discuss improvements in all aspects of scoliosis services.</p>  <p>  In relation to the current waiting list numbers, as this is a service issue, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly. </p></reply>

In this regard, monthly payments of up to &euro;208.50 have continued to be made by the Health Service Executive to 4,700 people who were in receipt of the Mobility Allowance.</p><p>The Government decided that the detailed preparatory work required for a new Transport Support Scheme and associated statutory provisions should be progressed by the Minister for Health.  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the Programme for Partnership Government acknowledges the ongoing drafting of primary legislation for a new Transport Support Scheme.  I can confirm that work on the policy proposals for the new Scheme is at an advanced stage and I anticipate that this will be brought to Government shortly.  The proposals seek to ensure that:</p><p>- There is a firm statutory basis to the Scheme's operation;</p><p>- There is transparency and equity in the eligibility criteria attaching to the Scheme;</p><p>- Resources are targeted at those with greatest needs; and</p><p>- The Scheme is capable of being costed and is affordable on its introduction and on an ongoing basis.</p><p>The Deputy may be interested to note that people who previously benefitted from the now closed Motorised Transport Grant, may, if they satisfy the criteria under that scheme, be eligible for tax relief under the Drivers and Passengers with Disabilities Tax Relief Scheme.  This scheme is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Finance and is operated by the Revenue Commissioners.  Details of the scheme can be found on www.revenue.ie.</p></reply>

This service provides prompt assessments in the Emergency Department. Most Level 3 hospitals have either a service in place or have been allocated one through the Programme for Government. For the latter, recruitment is taking place and where the liaison service is not yet in place the local service has an alternative arrangement whereby the person is assessed by a liaison nurse or NCHD and the consultant on duty for that day provides advice on management. </p>  <p>  In addition to this, the National Clinical Programme (NCP) for the Assessment and Management of Self-Harm in Emergency Departments began in December 2014. This Clinical Programme is a part of an overall strategy and specifically addresses the care and treatment required by people who present to the Emergency Department of acute hospitals following an episode of self-harm or with prominent suicidal ideation. It aims to provide a standardised specialist response to all such people and, by so doing, reduce the numbers leaving Emergency Departments without an assessment, link people into appropriate care, and involve families and friends as appropriate with an overall aim of reducing repetition of self-harm which is known to be associated with an increased risk of completed suicide. The continuation of this programme is identified as a priority in the HSE National Service Plan 2017. This NCP has trained and deployed 33 senior mental health nurses at Clinical Nurse Specialist level to Emergency Departments around the country. This facilitates an onsite, rapid response to those who have self-harmed and/or are suicidal. It supplements and works with the Liaison Psychiatry Service to provide a bespoke response to those who are suicidal or have self-harmed. </p>  <p>  With regard to the specific information requested, as these are service matters these queries have been referred to the HSE for reply.</p></reply>

Two changes were made to the Primary Childhood Immunisation Schedule with the introduction of Men B and Rotavirus for all babies born on or after 1 October, 2016.  As the first doses of these vaccines are administered to children when they reach two months, the changes to the immunisation schedule took effect from 1 December, 2016.  All vaccines administered through the Primary Childhood Immunisation Schedule are provided free of charge.  Ireland is the second country in Europe to make the vaccine available free of charge as part of its national immunisation programme.  </p>  <p>  In December 2013, NIAC issued guidance relating to the use of Bexsero in the control of clusters or outbreaks of Meningococcal B disease.  The vaccine has been used in accordance with this guidance, along with other measures, to control outbreaks of the disease. </p>  <p>  In June 2014, NIAC recommended immunisation with Meningitis B vaccine for all previously unimmunised close contacts of meningococcal disease.  Currently people who are contacts of cases that are not part of clusters are prescribed antibiotics as a prophylactic measure.</p>  <p>  The introduction of the vaccine to the childhood immunisation programmes means that all children born on or after 1 October 2016, including those in "at risk groups", will automatically receive the vaccine.  There are no plans at this stage to introduce a catch-up programme for older children.  Those who have a medical card are eligible to have the vaccine administered by their GP free of charge.

The NMBI have advised that the applicant applied for registration in October 2014. However, the file was closed in October 2015 as a number of documents were still outstanding from the applicant. A new application was received in March 2016 and the final requested document was received in the NMBI in June 2016. I understand from the NMBI that further information/clarification was requested and a decision to refuse registration was made in August 2016. The NMBI notified the applicant of this decision to her address in the USA. The NMBI have recently e-mailed a scanned copy of this decision letter to the applicant.

It is not at present (nor was it ever) authorised in Ireland for the treatment of cancer. </p>  <p>  As with all licensed medicinal products in Ireland, product information for Roaccutane is available to patients and healthcare professionals.  The product information is comprised of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC), mainly for the doctor and the Package Leaflet for the patient.  These documents are issued when a medicinal product is first authorised for use, and are reviewed and updated as necessary to reflect the current state of knowledge of the medicinal product and the risks associated with its use.  Both are available on the HPRA website.  </p>  <p>  Roaccutane is authorised as a prescription only medicine, subject to the Medicinal Products (Prescription and Control of Supply) Regulations.  The requirements for specific monitoring of the patient are described in detail in the SmPC in relation to psychiatric disorders, severe skin reactions, allergic reactions, liver enzymes, serum lipids and the pregnancy prevention programme.  Monitoring in these circumstances is through ongoing review of the patient by the prescribing doctor, as part of their clinical practice.  Educational materials to support safe and appropriate use of Roaccutane by healthcare professionals and patients have also been approved by the HPRA and are accessible from its website.</p>  <p>  The guidance to support appropriate use and monitoring of Roaccutane&reg; is based on assessment of the currently available data, which changes over time, as new information is generated on an on-going basis from a variety of sources, including post marketing experience of global adverse reaction data, further studies, literature reviews, etc.  </p>  <p>  Assessments are carried out on an ongoing basis by EU regulatory authorities to determine if the benefits of a particular medicine continue to outweigh the potential risks and to consider if steps need to be taken, such as updates to the product information, to further highlight/minimise the risks.  A review of all retinoid-containing medicines, including Roaccutane is currently underway at EU level, considering the measures currently in place for pregnancy prevention, as well as warnings and recommendations in the product information related to depression, anxiety and suicidal behaviour.  </p>  <p>  Roaccutane has not been banned from any markets for regulatory reasons.

Current policy is outlined in the Steering Group Report of the National Substance Misuse Strategy.</p>  <p>  The overall volume of alcohol consumption and the pattern of binge drinking predict the incidence of alcohol-related harm in Ireland.  Price, availability and marketing of alcohol are key factors in its supply which in turn impacts on the volume and pattern of alcohol consumption.  The strategic objective with respect to the supply of alcohol products is to ensure that the supply and price of alcohol is regulated and controlled in order to minimise the possibility and incidence of alcohol-related harm.  This will be achieved by, addressing issues such as - reducing the supply of cheap alcohol - controlling the availability of alcohol - preventing the sale of alcohol to children under 18 years of age and restrictions on alcohol marketing and sponsorship.</p>  <p>  It is important to change the culture around drinking and future proof our children from harmful drinking.  The Public Health Alcohol Bill includes provisions to address these strategic objectives.  The Bill addresses alcohol as a public health measure for the first time.</p>  <p>  How affordable alcohol is to the average consumer has a direct impact on consumption - as the price of alcohol increases, consumption rates and harms decrease.  Strong and cheap drink is favoured by young people, who have the least disposable income and the highest prevalence of binge drinking.  Minimum unit pricing of alcohol products sets a minimum price per gram or unit of alcohol.  It is a targeted measure, designed to prevent the sale of alcohol at very cheap prices and will have a substantial impact on alcohol consumption.  The Bill introduces a minimum unit price for alcohol products which will help prevent alcohol being sold at pocket money prices.</p>  <p>  A licence is required to sell alcohol and this should be reflected in how it is displayed for sale. The separation of alcohol and its reduced visibility in mixed retail shops will stop children associating alcohol with everyday household grocery items.</p>  <p>  Alcohol marketing increases the likelihood that adolescents will start to use alcohol earlier and will drink more if they are already using alcohol. The Bill will restrict the amount of advertising that children are exposed to - alcohol free advertising zones around schools, parks, etc. Regulations on the content of advertising will ensure that alcohol advertisements are not appealing to children. We are banning sponsorship of events where majority of participants are children/aimed at children. We are reducing the association between alcohol products and events that appeal to children and restricting advertising of alcohol products at some sporting events. This is the first step in severing link between alcohol and sport.</p>  <p>  The most recent European School Survey Project on Alcohol and Other Drugs shows that use of alcohol and of heavy episodic drinking was less common among Irish students compared to the other countries in the survey.</p>  <p>  The Department has also referred your question to the Health Service Executive in relation to alcohol related admissions of children to paediatric hospitals in Dublin. The HSE will reply directly to you. </p></reply>

It is envisaged that the General Scheme will be completed by the end of June 2017.  Once the General Scheme has been completed, a memo will be submitted for Government approval, and once approved by Government, I intend to submit the General Scheme to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health for pre-legislative scrutiny. </p><p>The proposed legislation will take cognisance of the 2014 Supreme Court judgment in the MR &amp;amp; Anor <i>v</i>. An tArd Chl&aacute;raitheoir &amp;amp; Ors (surrogacy) case, which found that the birth mother, rather than the genetic mother, is the legal mother.  It is envisaged that the legislation will establish a mechanism for transfer of parentage from the surrogate (and her husband, if she has one) to the intending parents. </p><p>In addition, it is envisaged that under the surrogacy provisions at least one of the intending parents will have to be genetically related to the child.  Surrogacy will be permitted on an altruistic basis where the payment of defined and receiptable reasonable expenses will be allowed, however, commercial surrogacy will be prohibited.</p><p>The intention of the legislation in this area is to protect, promote and ensure the health and safety of parents, others involved in the process (such as donors and surrogate mothers) and, most importantly, the children who will be born as a result of AHR. </p></reply>

The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has overall responsibility at central level for the INTERREG and PEACE programmes and the SEUPB is an agency under its remit.  These cross border Programmes are 85% funded by the EU.  I am pleased to note that following intensive discussions by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform with the Department of Finance in Northern Ireland, agreement was reached at the end of October 2016 on a safeguard clause that has enabled funding agreements to be put in place and Letters of Offer to issue to programme beneficiaries for both PEACE and INTERREG.</p>  <p>  Approximately &euro;47.5m worth of EU INTERREG VA Programme funding has been offered to eight innovative cross-border health and social care initiatives.  The funding will be used to reduce health inequalities, transition health services from an institutional to community-based setting and increase efficiencies through increased use of e-health technologies, on both sides of the border. </p>  <p>  Match-funding for the projects is provided by the Departments of Health in Ireland and Northern Ireland alongside the Scottish Government. </p>  <p>  A number of the successful projects will be led by the Health Service Executive on behalf of the CAWT Partnership; these projects are in the areas of Mental Health, Acute Services, Health and Well-Being and Children&rsquo;s Services.  In addition, CAWT is a partner in a project on Primary Care and Older People which is led by NHS 24 (Scotland). </p>  <p>  CAWT has an excellent track record in delivering INTERREG Projects and I am pleased that they have been successful in securing funding for these projects. Implementation of the projects will make a difference to people&rsquo;s lives and importantly will demonstrate real collaboration in achieving the project aims.

Addressing the Forum, I took the opportunity to highlight that one of my priorities has been to address the impact of the change in the sterling exchange rate and lower commodity prices in some sectors, which have caused cash flow difficulties for farmers. </p>  <p>  Therefore I was pleased to facilitate the &ldquo;Agriculture Cashflow Support Loan Scheme&rdquo;, which was developed by my Department in co-operation with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) and makes &euro;150 million available to farmers throughout Ireland at interest rates of 2.95%.  Distributed through AIB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank, it provides tillage farmers with a low cost, flexible source of working capital and will allow them to pay down more expensive forms of short-term debt, ensuring the ongoing financial sustainability of viable farming enterprises.  The loans are for amounts up to &euro;150,000 for up to six years and are flexible with interest only facilities of up to three years.  Although there are no official figures as yet on the total drawdown from the Scheme, very strong interest has been reported.  </p>  <p>  Also the Tillage Investment Scheme under TAMS II opened for online applications on 8 March 2017.  The specific areas of investment include Minimum Disturbance Tillage Equipment, Sprayers, Rain Water Harvesting, Grain Storage and Grain dryers.  This Tillage Scheme is the latest of the Targeted Modernisation Schemes (TAMS II) to be launched under the Rural Development Programme 2014-2020.  The Scheme is co-funded by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD).

Ireland opted to apply clawback on the sale of entitlements without land.</p>  <p>  EU Regulations state that the application of "clawback" must not present a substantial obstacle or prohibition of the transfer of entitlements in a Member State.  Ireland is one of the only Member States in the EU that operate a "conacre" system, and widespread corresponding short term leasing of entitlements.  In many cases the only option open to Irish farmers at risk of losing entitlements due to non usage is to lease entitlements without land to a farmer who has "naked" hectares to use them, thereby safeguarding their assets.  The introduction of "clawback" on leased entitlements would present a significant obstacle to this option.</p>  <p>  The option to lease entitlements without land is critical for many Irish farmers who are unable to obtain sufficient hectares of land to use their entitlements annually.  Under the Single Payment scheme the rotation of entitlements safeguarded farmers&rsquo; entitlements but this is not available under the Basic Payment Scheme where 100% of farmers&rsquo; entitlements must be used at least once every two years.  A large number of farmers in Ireland depend on the availability of affordable leased/rented land to use their entitlements.  If farmers are unable to obtain leased/rented land through unavailability or high price they are at risk of losing their Basic Payment Scheme entitlements permanently through non-usage.  In many cases the only option open to them is to lease their entitlements without land to a farmer who has naked hectares to use them, thereby safeguarding their assets.</p>  <p>  Decisions in relation to Basic Payment Scheme entitlements including &lsquo;clawback&rsquo; are made in consultation with the Direct Payments Advisory group which includes members of the main farming bodies and agricultural education and advisory services.  Following consultation with this group a decision was made to reduce the level of &lsquo;clawback&rsquo; on the sale of entitlements without land from 50% in 2016 to 20% in 2017.  The group did not express support for the option to apply &lsquo;clawback&rsquo; to the lease of entitlements without land. </p></reply>

This facilitated the export of meat unfit for human consumption.  21 Brazilian establishments are concerned.  Most of them produce for the domestic market and only 4 of them are approved for meat export to the EU. </p><p>My Department is closely monitoring this case through our Embassy in Brasilia who are in direct contact with the Brazilian authorities, and through the European Commission. </p><p>As soon as the story broke on Saint Patricks Day, the European Commission asked for clarification from the Brazilian authorities.  It is the Commission which approves the Third Countries for export of meat into the EU on behalf of MS. </p><p>On 19 March the Brazilian authorities (MAPA) confirmed that they had been informed of the Federal Police Operation on 17 March.  Based on information received, they suspended certification from the 4 establishments under investigation that were approved for export to the EU.</p><p>On 20 March the Commission requested full information on all exports to the EU from the 4 establishments since 1 January 2017, and asked the Brazilian authorities to recall any consignments in transit.  The Commission also suggested the suspension of certification from all other establishments approved for export to the EU, pending the outcome of a full investigation. </p><p>On 21 March I wrote to Commissioner Andriukaitis, supporting the suggestion to suspend certification from all other establishments approved for export to the EU.</p><p>Food safety is a shared responsibility between national and EU authorities.  Food business operators in the EU also carry out their own quality and safety checks in line with their responsibilities to ensure that their products are safe. </p><p>My Department is in charge of carrying out controls on imports (at Border Inspection Posts &ndash; BIPs). The EU imposes strict hygiene and safety controls on food imports, and in particular on animal products for which documentary, identity and physical checks are compulsory for meat products imports.  These are implemented here in Ireland by veterinary staff from my Department at the Border Inspection Posts. </p><p>The checks on all Brazilian product are now being intensified in light of current developments.  Following on from a meeting of the Chief Veterinary Officers of the EU on 24 March it was unanimously decided at the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed that there would now be 100% physical checks on all Brazilian shipments presented for import to the EU as well as 20% microbiological checks on said consignments.  </p><p>On the subject of removing beef from the EU-Mercosur FTA talks, I have been very active in highlighting the potentially damaging impact of a Mercosur deal on the European agriculture sector, and on the beef sector in particular.  Following intense lobbying from Ireland and other EU Member states, the Commission decided to exclude a TRQ for beef when it exchanged offers with Mercosur on 11 May 2016.<b></b></p><p>I will continue to raise the issue with Commissioners Malmstr&ouml;m and Hogan, both within and outside the Council of Agriculture Ministers.  I will also continue to monitor the situation closely in co-operation with my Member State colleagues, as well as with my Government colleagues.</p></reply>

Protecting existing shares and existing access arrangements will be the top priority.  As both I and An Taoiseach have stated before, we intend to ensure that fisheries remains high on the Brexit agenda in the EU and that Ireland obtains the best possible outcome from the negotiations.</p></reply>

We don't know yet what changes the UK may seek to the current arrangements. </p>  <p>  What we do know is that there is a strong desire and expectation from parts of the UK fishing industry to ensure that non-UK fishermen will no longer have access to the UK Zone.    </p>  <p>  In theory, the UK could indeed restrict access to their waters and/or seek to gain larger quota shares at the expense of others.  However, that could only happen if the UK were content to ignore the potential repercussions that would certainly arise from the EU side. </p>  <p>  In a worst case scenario, an extreme 'hard Brexit' outcome would be a fundamental threat to the well-being of the seafood sector.  On average, 36% of the Irish landings are currently taken from UK waters.  However, for some of our most important stocks the figures are even higher. </p>  <p>  Limitations on access and, more worryingly, any attempt by the UK to increase its current quota share at the expense of Ireland and others must, and will be, be resisted strenuously.  These twin threats, on access and quota, could also lead to increased activity by other EU vessels in the waters around Ireland threatening the long term sustainability of our stocks. </p>  <p>  Now that Article 50 has been invoked, the UK will cease to be a Member State of the EU from March 2019, unless an extension is sought and granted.  The EU itself will continue, as will the Common Fisheries Policy. </p>  <p>  We must now concentrate all our efforts on the Brexit negotiations at this time to safeguard our interests.  The discussion on the post Brexit CFP will undoubtedly occur in earnest once the Brexit arrangements are clear and I do not intend to pre-empt the outcome of negotiations at this early stage. </p>  <p>  In February, I hosted a dedicated Civic Dialogue on the potential impacts of Brexit for the seafood sector as whole.  This was very well attended by stakeholders from across the industry and gave a clear insight into the real dangers that a 'hard' Brexit presents for our fishing communities.  </p>  <p>  I will remain in close contact with fisheries stakeholders as the issues develop and work with them and my fellow fisheries Ministers in the EU to ensure that we are all fully prepared for what are likely to be extremely complex negotiations.   </p>  <p>  I have recently held a further series of meetings with key fisheries Ministers and am coordinating a like minded group of 8 Member States to ensure that fisheries remains a top priority in the negotiations to come.  Protecting existing shares will be a top priority for that group.  As both I and An Taoiseach have stated before, we intend to ensure that fisheries remains high on the Brexit agenda in the EU and that Ireland obtains the best possible outcome from the negotiations.</p>  <p>  In conclusion, I would like to assure the Deputy that I will be unequivocal in opposing any dilution of our existing EU quota shares, including protecting the benefit to Ireland of the Hague Preferences, and any limitations on our existing rights of access.</p></reply>

It will be important to ensure that the CAP is seen as an effective and relevant policy instrument in helping to achieve broader societal goals, such as job creation and economic growth, particularly in rural areas at risk of social exclusion.  </p>  <p>  Market volatility is an issue we have seen cause considerable difficulties for our farmers in recent times and I am particularly interested in how we can build farmer&rsquo;s resilience to deal with this in the event of future crises.  The use of modern and innovative measures such as hedging arrangements, futures markets and fixed price contracts are areas worth considering, while the direct payments system provides certainty and stability to farmers in the face of market volatility, and should continue to be a key component of the future CAP.</p>  <p>  I agree that our deliberations on any further reform of CAP should take account of the need to encourage generational renewal.  This has been a priority and the current CAP, which was agreed during the Irish Presidency in 2013, allowed for supplementary payments from the National Reserve for young educated farmers and for their prioritisation in the assessment of applications under various rural development measures.  Generational renewal will remain a priority in my department's assessment of any proposals emerging on the reform of CAP.</p></reply>

This facilitated the export of meat unfit for human consumption.  21 Brazilian establishments are concerned.  Most of them produce for the domestic market and only 4 of them are approved for meat export to the EU. </p>  <p>  My Department is closely monitoring this case through our Embassy in Brasilia who are in direct contact with the Brazilian authorities, and through the European Commission. </p>  <p>  As soon as the story broke on Saint Patrick's Day, the European Commission asked for clarification from the Brazilian authorities.  It is the Commission which approves Third Countries for export of meat into the EU on behalf of MS. </p>  <p>  On 19 March the Brazilian authorities (MAPA) confirmed that they had been informed of the Federal Police Operation on 17 March.  Based on information received, they suspended certification from the 4 establishments under investigation that were approved for export to the EU.</p>  <p>  On 20 March the Commission requested full information on all exports to the EU from the 4 establishments since 1 January 2017, and asked the Brazilian authorities to recall any consignments in transit.  The Commission also suggested the suspension of certification from all other establishments approved for export to the EU, pending the outcome of a full investigation. </p>  <p>  On 21 March I wrote to Commissioner Andriukaitis, supporting the suggestion to suspend certification from all other establishments approved for export to the EU.</p>  <p>  Food safety is a shared responsibility between national and EU authorities.  Food business operators in the EU also carry out their own quality and safety checks in line with their responsibilities to ensure that their products are safe. </p>  <p>  My Department is in charge of carrying out controls on imports (at Border Inspection Posts &ndash; BIPs).  The EU imposes strict hygiene and safety controls on food imports, and in particular on animal products for which documentary, identity and physical checks are compulsory for meat products imports.  These are implemented here in Ireland by veterinary staff from my Department at the Border Inspection Posts. </p>  <p>  The checks on all Brazilian product are now being intensified in light of current developments.  Following on from a meeting of the Chief Veterinary Officers of the EU on 24 March it was unanimously decided at the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed on March 29th that there would now be 100% physical checks on all Brazilian shipments presented for import to the EU as well as 20% microbiological checks on said consignments.  </p>  <p>  My Department and I are of course continuing to monitor this matter closely and ensure that all requirements for the import of any food product into Ireland are met fully.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.  This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment by the telecommunications sector and a State intervention in those areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.  </p><p>A key principle of the NBP is to support and stimulate commercial investment through policy and regulatory measures.  Commercial investment since the publication of the NBP has considerably exceeded expectations.  To date, the commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2.5bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.  </p><p>There has been significant progress in relation to broadband rollout so that today, approximately 1.4m or 61% of premises in Ireland can get high speed broadband of a minimum of 30 Megabits per second.  The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector, which is continuing to expand this footprint.  </p><p>Today the 4th April, I formally published  an updated High Speed Broadband Map which is available at .  The updated Map shows the following categories of areas for delivery of broadband:  </p><p>- The BLUE areas represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or have indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services,  </p><p>- The AMBER areas on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the areas that will require State Intervention and are the subject of the current procurement process.  </p><p>It is intended that all premises will have access to services of at least 30 megabits per second when the procurement process is completed and the network rolled out.  </p><p>The updated map indicates that the villages of Camp, Cloghane and Brandon falls within a BLUE area and will be covered by a commercial operator.  Premises that are located in between the villages of Camp and Cloghane that are not served by  a commercial operator will be included in the State Intervention procurement process under the NBP.  </p><p>Individuals can check whether their premises is in a BLUE or an AMBER area by accessing the High Speed Broadband Map and entering their Eircode.  </p><p>With the publication of the updated High Speed Broadband Map the State Intervention Area has now been finalised.  A formal procurement process is in train to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area.  The procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years.  The timeframe for the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders, during the procurement process.  During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated a 3-5 year timeline to rollout a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP.  </p><p>The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the rollout of the network once a contract is awarded.  </p><p>The Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and/or high demand and a prioritisation programme.</p></reply>

As part of these proposals, I am examining the option of increasing the range of devices liable for a television licence.  The growth of Internet Protocol TV (IPTV) as a delivery mechanism for television services, as well as the availability of a much wider range of devices for media consumption means that traditional viewing habits are changing.  Recent TAM reports show that the percentage of households which are no longer deemed to have a television as defined by the current regulations has risen from 6% in 2013 to 8% in 2016.</p>  <p>  In advance of any amendment to the current regulations, I intend to write to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Communication, Climate Action and Environment, to seek their views on which types of devices should remain exempt.  </p>  <p>  I have also requested that the Committee examine the longer term issue of the future funding of public service media.  As the Deputy may be aware, the Committee is currently considering this issue following a period of public consultation and stakeholder engagement.  I look forward to receiving their report in due course which will help inform future funding policy for public service broadcasting.</p></reply>

It makes &euro;5 stamps available to the public through retail outlets.  These stamps are collected in a savings booklet which can then be used to pay for all or part of a home heating bill.  The aim of the scheme is to offer a convenient solution that helps householders to save towards the cost of their home heating bills.  </p>  <p>  My Department has committed to funding the scheme on a pilot basis for two years.  The scheme is currently operating in parts of Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow.  In total, 70 retailers are selling stamps and promoting the scheme, with 55 fuel suppliers accepting the stamps as part or full payment for all deliveries.  In Dublin, the stamps are available in the Finglas and Cabra areas, with 20 retailers and 12 fuel suppliers participating in the scheme in those areas.  As the two year pilot period will draw to a close in the middle of this year, the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul have informed me that they have no plans to expand the geographical areas where the stamps are offered.  </p>  <p>  At the conclusion of the two year pilot, an evaluation will be undertaken which will attempt to determine the impact the scheme has had.  Similar savings schemes have been operated for a number of years in Northern Ireland where they have been found to increase households savings performance.</p></reply>

However, we expect that, where a State chooses to develop a nuclear power industry, this will be done in line with the highest international standards with respect to safety and environmental protection.  The Irish Government have been aware since 2009 of the UK&rsquo;s plans to build new nuclear power stations at sites judged as potentially suitable.</p><p>There is regular contact at official level on a range of nuclear related matters between Ireland and the United Kingdom.  This contact is formalised in the biannual meetings of the UK-Ireland Contact Group on Radiological Matters.  This group includes Departmental officials and representatives from the relevant Regulatory bodies - the United Kingdom's Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) and the Environment Protection Agency (EPA) Office for Radiological Protection.  Ireland has been actively involved in the consultations process on the proposed new build programme which is a standing agenda item at UK-Ireland Contact Group on Radiological Matters meetings.  </p><p>The Government asked the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland (RPII), now merged with EPA, to prepare a report on the potential radiological implications for Ireland from the proposed new nuclear power plants in the UK including Hinkley Point C and Wylfa.  This expert report, published in 2013, is available at:</p><p><i></i></p><p>A principal finding of the report is that the routine operation of the proposed nuclear power plants will have no measurable radiological impact on Ireland or the Irish marine environment.  This report continues to inform Irish engagement on the UK new nuclear build programme.</p><p>In relation to the development at Hinkley my Department recently received a letter from the UK Department of Business, Energy &amp;amp; Industrial Strategy asking if Ireland considered whether notification under the Espoo Convention, which deals with trans-boundary environmental impacts, would be useful.  In response my Department stated that such future notification would be useful.  </p></reply>

Progress continues to be made in delivering on this Government&rsquo;s commitment to ensure every household and business in Ireland has access to high speed broadband, regardless of where they are located.</p>  <p>  The National Broadband Plan (NBP) is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment by the telecommunications sector and a State intervention in those areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.  </p>  <p>  A key principle of the NBP is to support and stimulate commercial investment through policy and regulatory measures.  Commercial investment since the publication of the NBP, including over the last 12 months has considerably exceeded expectations.  To date, the commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2.5bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.  </p>  <p>  There has been significant progress in relation to broadband rollout so that today, approximately 1.4m or 61% of premises in Ireland can get high speed broadband of a minimum of 30 Megabits per second.  The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector, which is continuing to expand this footprint.  </p>  <p>  I formally published  an updated High Speed Broadband Map today which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie.  The updated Map shows the following categories of areas for delivery of broadband: </p>  <p>  - The BLUE areas represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or have indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services,  </p>  <p>  - The AMBER areas on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the areas that will require State Intervention and are the subject of the current procurement process.  </p>  <p>  The updated Map shows that there are approximately 1.8m  premises in the BLUE areas,  representing 77% of the total premises in Ireland.  The remaining 23%, which comprises some 542,000 premises are in the AMBER areas and are expected to be served by the State Intervention.  </p>  <p>  It is intended that all premises will have access to services of at least 30 Megabits per second when the procurement process is completed and the network rolled out.  </p>  <p>  With the publication of the updated High Speed Broadband Map the State Intervention Area has now been finalised.  A formal procurement process is in train to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area.  The procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years.  </p>  <p>  The timeframe for the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders, during the procurement process.  During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated a 3-5 year timeline to rollout a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP.  </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the rollout of the network once a contract is awarded.  </p>  <p>  The Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and/or high demand and a prioritisation programme.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.  This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment by the telecommunications sector and a State intervention in those areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.</p>  <p>  A key principle of the NBP is to support and stimulate commercial investment through policy and regulatory measures.  Commercial investment since the publication of the NBP, including over the last 12 months has considerably exceeded expectations.

The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector, which is continuing to expand this footprint.  </p>  <p>  The latest ComReg quarterly report highlights that over 65% of all broadband customers now avail of high speed broadband services  ( > 30 Megabits per second).  It also indicates that uptake over the past quarter includes an increase in customers availing of Fibre to the Premises (FTTP) of  over 20.2%.  While this represents only 7,623 premises, this is a large increase over a short period and is a very encouraging indicator of the popularity of FTTP products.  It also indicates that the commercial sector is moving towards FTTP as the solution of the foreseeable future.  </p>  <p>  Today the 4th April, I formally published  an updated High Speed Broadband Map which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie.  The updated Map shows the following categories of areas for delivery of broadband:  </p>  <p>  - The BLUE areas represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or have indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services,  </p>  <p>  - The AMBER areas on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the areas that will require State Intervention and are the subject of the current procurement process.  </p>  <p>  It is intended that all premises will have access to services of at least 30 Megabits per second when the procurement process is completed and the network rolled out.  </p>  <p>  Individuals can check whether their premises is in a BLUE or an AMBER area by accessing the High Speed Broadband Map and entering their Eircode.  </p>  <p>  With the publication of the updated High Speed Broadband Map the State Intervention Area has now been finalised.  </p>  <p>  A formal procurement process is in train to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area.  </p>  <p>  The procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years.  Intensive dialogue with bidders is continuing and the three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution.  This provides for a future proofed solution for the 25 years of the contract and beyond.  A fibre-to-the-home solution means that householders and businesses may get speeds not just of 30 Megabits per second but much higher, potentially up to 1000 Megabits per second.  </p>  <p>  The timeframe for the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders, during the procurement process.  During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated a 3-5 year timeline to rollout a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP.  </p>  <p>  In the short-term I am working to ensure measures are put in place to assist in the rollout of the NBP State Intervention network once a contract is awarded and to improve mobile phone and broadband access in Ireland.  </p></reply>

Emissions Trading is a &quot;cap and trade&quot; scheme, whereby an EU wide cap or limit is set for participating installations.  This cap is reduced over time so that total emissions are reduced.  Within this cap, &quot;allowances&quot; for emissions are auctioned or allocated for free.  Individual installations must report on their emissions on an annual basis and surrender sufficient allowances to cover their emissions, purchasing additional allowances if necessary.</p><p>The ETS includes 11,000 installations (101 in Ireland) and accounts for roughly 45% of EU emissions (25% of Irish emissions).  The ETS was launched in 2005 and is currently in its third phase, covering the period 2013 to 2020.  </p><p>  Negotiations are currently under way regarding the design of the ETS for the post-2020 (Phase IV) period.  On the basis of European Commission proposals, Member States in the Council, including Ireland, have been engaged in negotiations to ensure that the reformed ETS is able to meet its GHG reduction objectives in a cost-effective manner.  The proposed reforms to the ETS are also aimed at, inter alia, addressing persistently low prices within the ETS over recent years.  </p><p>  At a meeting of the Environment Council on 28 February, which I attended, agreement was reached on a general approach on the revised ETS proposal, a position Ireland was able to support.  This will now enable the Council to begin negotiations with the European Parliament on the proposal.  It is currently anticipated that this process will reach a conclusion later this year.</p><p>On the basis that negotiations to reform the ETS currently underway at EU level are aimed at addressing current weaknesses, I do not have any plans to adopt any additional carbon price support measures to apply to ETS installations in Ireland.</p></reply>

As you will be aware, I have already announced that I am appointing the Irish Aviation Authority (IAA) as the Competent Authority to deal with aircraft noise management at Dublin airport.     As I previously stated, I wish to ensure that there are robust consultation requirements with all key stakeholders, including local residents.  It is proposed that the Statutory Instrument will outline requirements concerning the collaborative working arrangements to apply between the Competent Authority and the various statutory bodies that have roles and expertise in relation to noise management.  Insofar as public participation arrangements are concerned, before the IAA as Competent Authority makes any decision about noise-related operating restrictions at the airport, there will be an obligation for public consultation and all stakeholders will be able to give their views.</p>  <p>  As Regulation 598/2014 is already applicable in the State since June 2016 and Regulations to ensure the appointment of a competent authority and provide for the other necessary provisions are imminent, I have no plans to consult further on the matter prior to the making of those Regulations.</p></reply>

Both services were operated on the same commercial basis and licensed under the Public Transport Regulation Act 2009.The Deputy is aware that Bus &Eacute;ireann is currently loss-making and that those losses are primarily related to the performance of its Expressway services. Those services are operated by Bus &Eacute;ireann on a commercial basis in a similar fashion to any other commercial licensed bus service. Commercial licensed bus services do not receive any taxpayer funding, in contrast to those socially necessary but financially unviable services which make up the PSO network.   Decisions regarding commercial licensed bus services are matters for the operator concerned and Bus &Eacute;ireann has announced changes to ​a limited number of Expressway services, including a withdrawal of the X7 Expressway route from Clonmel to Dublin. I am informed that the route loses a significant amount of money each year and it is no longer commercially viable for the Company.</p>  <p>  I have repeatedly stated that in these instances the National Transport Authority (NTA) stands ready to assess the impact of any route withdrawal or re-configuration and has the statutory powers to ensure continued transport connectivity. In the case of the X7, the NTA has amended the scheduling of some Rural Transport Programme services to ensure connections with the other commercial licensed bus service which continues to link Clonmel to Dublin. The NTA has published its assessment of the X7 withdrawal and has invited feedback on that assessment and I would encourage the Deputy to provide any feedback he might have to the NTA.</p></reply>

This Policy outlines best practice in relation to processing of data by staff within the Department and its Offices in instances where personal data is provided to an external body for processing. The objective of the policy is to ensure that personal data held by my Department and its Offices is processed in accordance with the provisions of the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003.

The Protocol describes the ways in which enterprise can expect to work with the State-funded research base. It applies to Research Performing Organisations (RPOs) and to enterprise.</p>  <p>  All knowledge producing organisations, public and private, have the potential to generate intellectual property. A major focus of this Government is to ensure an increase in research activity and associated investment in research, based on the widely held understanding, across developed economies, that commitment to research and development generates economic and social returns.</p>  <p>  KTI was established by Enterprise Ireland in partnership with the Irish Universities Association (IUA) in late 2013. It was created as the result of the recommendation from a Government-led task force that reviewed the state of "business to research base" engagement in 2012 and is embedded in the Government Report &lsquo;Putting Public Research to work for Ireland&rsquo;. </p>  <p>  KTI&rsquo;s role is to make it simple for enterprise to engage with the State funded research base in Ireland through increasing visibility of opportunity and offering consistent approaches to transactions. Clarity in respect of IP policy assists both public bodies and companies to do business more efficiently and successfully. </p>  <p>  As part of its role, and in consultation with my Department, KTI reviewed and updated the National IP Protocol in 2016 (first published in 2012) setting out the policy and the framework for engagement between industry and the research base. To do this, an extensive review and consultation on the Protocol in practice commenced in 2014. A revised IP Protocol was presented for Government approval in late 2015 and published in January 2016. </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s national strategy is based on developing excellent science in our universities, IOTs and other research performing organisations and ensuring that science forms the foundations of a vibrant knowledge transfer ecosystem which involves quality teaching and learning drawing from the frontiers of knowledge and also effective collaborations between academia and enterprise.</p></reply>

The criteria cover when a member of the Defence Forces is on active service within the meaning of section 5 of the Defence Act 1954 or deemed to be on active service within the meaning of section 4(1) of the Defence (Amendment) (No 2) Act 1960 i.e. when engaged in action in the course of operational duties at sea; or when engaged in operations in aid of the civil powers. Furthermore, under section 6 (2) (d) of the 2005 Act this exemption applies when members of the Defence Forces are engaged in training directly associated with such active service. The 2005 Act is not prescriptive on the time frame or duration of training for active service. </p>  <p>  Therefore when a member of the Defence Forces is engaged in training, directly associated with active service, to be undertaken for any period of time in advance of departure on active service, then the provisions of section 6 (2) of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 do apply.</p></reply>

Our membership of the EU, and our continuing access to the EU single market, is undoubtedly one such key factor. But it's also the case that companies are drawn here by many other reasons, including our talented workforce, excellent infrastructure, pro-enterprise policy environment and our long established track record as a successful home to global business.

AIM encourages children with disabilities to attend mainstream pre-school where they can socialise with their peers.  The degree of support provided depends on the needs of the child availing of the ECCE Programme, in the context of the pre-school service registered with my Department.  The ECCE Programme is provided for 3 hours per day for 5 days per week.  The supports provided under AIM  will benefit children with a range of disabilities, including autism.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Department of Education and Skills administers the Home Tuition Grant Scheme which provides funding towards the provision of a compensatory educational service for children who, for a number of specific reasons, are unable to attend pre-school and primary school.

The financial commitment to the operational budget of the European Defence Agency is in accordance with EDA funding principles, based on Gross National Income (GNI) key.  The EDA Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) Protection project allowed the Defence Forces access to the results of research, studies and development work packages undertaken by the programme.  CBRN is a key capability for the Defence Forces, participation in this project enables the Defence Forces to remain at the leading edge of capability developmentin this key area.  The project commenced in 2012 and finished in 2015.</p><p>The EDA Counter Improvised Explosives Devices Manual Neutralisation Techniques project was set up to address Counter Improvised Explosives Devices Manual Neutralisation Techniques (C-IED MNT) training, which has been identified as a crucial skill/capability to be developed.  Manual Neutralisation Techniques is a method used by Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) and Improvised Explosive Device Disposal (IEDD) Operators who, on occasions, cannot use remote or semi remote techniques to render an IED safe and these complex explosive devices have to be neutralised manually.  For example, MNT is used where there is an immediate threat to the life of a hostage who has an IED attached to them.  The project began in 2014 and will run for four (4) years.</p><p>Participation in EU Battlegroups demonstrates Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to the development of EU capabilities in the area of crisis management and contributes to our overall credibility within the Union.  Ireland&rsquo;s continuing active engagement in EU Battlegroups enhances our capacity to influence the ongoing development and evolution of the rapid response capacity of the EU, in particular, the role Battlegroups can play in reinforcing and acting as a strategic reserve for UN operations. </p><p>To date Ireland has participated in the Nordic Battlegroup in 2008, 2011 and 2015, the Austro-German Battlegroup in 2012 and both the German led and UK led Battlegroups in 2016.  The total costs directly associated with Irish participation in EU Battlegroups between 2014 and 2015 amounted to just under &euro;3.85 million.  This figure includes direct payroll costs which would have been incurred in the normal course.

This policy is an integral part of the wider bird control management program, which is line with best international practices and seeks to reduce the risk of bird strikes during critical phases of flight. </p>  <p>  The airfield at Baldonnel is cultivated with FESCUE grass which was specifically sown and grown to prevent birds landing and nesting in the grass and thereby being a hazard to the aircraft.  A contractor is hired to top the grass at a height of 9 inches throughout the growing season.  The clippings are returned.  The frequent topping of the grass and the return of clippings are required to produce an appropriate level of soil fertility to support adequate grass growth.  The crop type does not have the nutrient needs for grazed cattle silage and the clippings are required to maintain nutrient levels in the soil.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, the Air Corps receive no funding from the annual harvesting of silage on the airbase.  As there is no harvesting of silage, the issue of income from harvesting does not arise.</p></reply>
