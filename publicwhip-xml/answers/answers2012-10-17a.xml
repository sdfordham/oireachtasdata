The British legislation giving effect to the St. Andrews Agreement included a specific requirement on the Executive to adopt a strategy setting out how it proposed to enhance and protect the development of the Irish language.  </p><p>  Since the restoration of the devolved Institutions on 8 May 2007, the question of an Irish Language Act for Northern Ireland is a devolved matter and is the responsibility of the Northern Ireland Executive.  In that regard, my colleagues the Minister for Arts, Heritage &amp; the Gaeltacht, Mr Jimmy Deenihan T.D. and Minister of State Dinny McGinley T.D. have had ongoing discussions on the matter with his counterpart, the Northern Ireland Minister for Culture, Arts and Leisure, Ms Car&aacute;l N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n MLA.

We remain fully committed to the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and the St Andrews Agreement, including the provisions relating to the Irish language.</p></reply>

This will be the first time that Ireland has held the Presidency of the EU during a time when the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement are fully operational.  As such, this is a unique opportunity to deepen our cooperation with the Executive, and the Deputy can be assured that the Government will maximise the benefits to be derived from this.</p><p>  In discussions at recent meetings of the North South Ministerial Council (NSMC), we have availed of the opportunity to set out for our Northern Ireland Executive counterparts the value of working together to gain mutual benefit from the upcoming Irish EU Presidency.  It is clear to both sides that at a time when major negotiations are taking place on new transnational programmes, there is a need to deepen dialogue at all levels.  Naturally the Irish EU Presidency will feature prominently among the issues to be discussed at the forthcoming plenary meeting of the NSMC on 2 November.</p><p>  It was agreed at the plenary meeting on 15 June 2012 that EU matters were to be included in future as an agenda item for all relevant Ministerial meetings.</p><p>  At a practical level the Government is working to involve Northern Ministers in Presidency events where this is possible.  Several opportunities for Northern participation in Presidency-related events, initiatives and conferences have already been identified.  Active consideration is also being given to possible participation of Northern Ministers in informal meetings and other events in the energy, justice, sport, tourism, trade and business, research and innovation and transport areas. </p><p>  We have also agreed with Northern Ireland Ministers to the secondment of a small number of officials from the Northern Ireland Civil Service to work in our system in the run up to and during the Presidency.  We are continuing our longstanding high-level briefings for senior NI officials in regard to the priorities each EU Presidency.  The most recent such briefing, in regard to the Cypriot Presidency, took place in Dublin on 5 September. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-10-17a.15.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/951" speakername="Eamon Gilmore" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012101700062#WRA01000"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 59 together.</p><p>  The people of Syria have been devastated by eighteen months of brutal violence.  The numbers are horrifying &ndash; more than 19,000 killed in the violence, 2.5 million people in Syria in desperate need of assistance, over 1.2 million Syrians displaced within their own country and over quarter of a million Syrians now refugees in neighbouring countries.  Recent reports have described indiscriminate shelling of densely populated areas, excessive use of force and random targeting of innocent civilians.  There is urgent need for additional food, medical care and shelter as we face into the harsh winter months.  Particular concern has been expressed for the 500,000 Palestinian and 100,000 Iraqi refugees living in Syria. </p><p>  My colleague Minister of State, Joe Costello visited the region in August to witness firsthand the humanitarian consequences of this devastating crisis.  In Za&rsquo;atari refugee camp, 80 kilometres north of the Jordanian capital Amman, close to the Syrian border, he heard directly from Syrians who had recently fled the violence. </p><p>  The Minister also saw how the staff of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the agency responsible for the camp, was struggling with limited resources to provide even the most basic services such as shelter, food and water.</p><p>  In meetings with the Jordanian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Nasser Judeh, the Jordanian Minister for Planning and International Cooperation, Dr. Jafar Hassan, and the International Committee of the Red Cross, Minister Costello was briefed on how this refugee burden is placing huge pressure on their country &ndash; one with a high pre-existing refugee population coupled with severe resource constraints. </p><p>  As early as March this year, Ireland provided &euro;500,000 in emergency funding to the International Committee of the Red Cross, the UNHCR and the World Food Programme to provide life saving assistance inside Syria and in the neighbouring region. </p><p>  Informed by the Government&rsquo;s visit to Jordan, in August we were able to mobilise an additional &euro;1.6 million of humanitarian assistance to the International Committee of the Red Cross, UNHCR, the World Health Organisation and the International Rescue Committee.</p><p>  In advance of the approaching winter, Ireland has allocated an added &euro;150,000 in non-food items for the UNHCR from our Rapid Response stocks in Dubai.  Since March this year Ireland has therefore provided &euro;2.25 million in humanitarian assistance. </p><p>  Even if the reality on the ground is disheartening, we must continue to promote a peaceful settlement with the ultimate aim of political transition in Syria. Ireland is fully supportive of the newly appointed UN/Arab League Joint Special Representative, Lakhdar Brahimi, and his efforts to negotiate a ceasefire and chart a political path ahead.  </p><p>  In parallel, international pressure needs to be maintained to bring an end to the violence and compel the Syrian regime to stop its bloody repression. Ireland, along with our international partners, has been advocating for a strong UN Security Council Resolution.  I believe that this is now long overdue. There is a need for effective leadership and action on the part of the Security Council, imposing sanctions on those who continue to wage war on innocent civilians and who fail to meet their international obligations.  </p><p>  It is very clear that, while this is a humanitarian crisis, it is driven by politics and will only be solved with a political solution.  From the beginning, Ireland has recognised this, striving to respond to the humanitarian needs of the populations affected by the violence whilst working simultaneously for a sustainable political solution, based on accommodating the legitimate democratic aspirations of the Syrian people.  I can ensure you we will continue to maintain these efforts.</p></reply>

Higgins, accompanied by Mr Joe Costello T.D., the Minister of State at my Department with responsibility for Trade and Development, recently concluded an official visit to Chile, Brazil and Argentina.  The visit provided a valuable opportunity to build upon existing links with these three countries.  The busy schedule included comprehensive meetings with the Presidents of each country visited, as well as contacts with Irish communities, and business engagements.  </p><p>  In all contacts, President Higgins and Minister Costello availed fully of opportunities to promote Ireland as a stable and desirable investment, business and education partner.  In Chile, a business network event was hosted by the Embassy of Ireland and was attended by Irish companies and their local partners.  The programme in Argentina also had a business component with the Irish State Agencies and Irish companies participating in a business event hosted by Enterprise Ireland.  </p><p>  Brazil, now the world&rsquo;s sixth largest economy, is a priority market under the Government&rsquo;s Trade Strategy.  President Higgins&rsquo;s visit, and the accompanying Enterprise Ireland mission of 42 companies and third level institutions led by Minister Costello, raised Ireland&rsquo;s profile in this key high growth market.  A number of agreements with Brazilian partners were finalised, including announcements of export contracts secured by Irish companies and agreements signed between third level education institutions.  Another key event was the launch of the participation of Irish third-level institutions in a Brazilian scholarship programme that focuses on Science and Technology.  Under this programme, we look forward to up to 4,000 Brazilian students studying in Ireland at under-graduate level over the next four years, as well as up to 1,500 post-graduate students.</p><p>  The President&rsquo;s programme included other opportunities to build Ireland&rsquo;s profile in South America.  The President delivered well-received addresses at the University of Diego Portales in Chile, and at the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil. President Higgins also addressed a seminar in Chile organised in connection with next January&rsquo;s European Union &ndash; Community of Latin American and Caribbean States Summit, and was the keynote speaker at a seminar in Buenos Aires on migration from Ireland to Argentina.  The programme also recognised the commitment to human rights protection and promotion that Ireland and these three countries share.</p><p>  I look forward to bilateral contacts increasing with Chile, Brazil and Argentina.  I am confident that such links will include greater business ties but will also encourage deeper political and cultural contacts as well as a wide-range of people-to-people connections.  Increased contacts in all areas will bring related benefits in terms of more trade, investment and ultimately jobs and prosperity.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-10-17a.22.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/951" speakername="Eamon Gilmore" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012101700063#WRB00500"><p>Ireland has consistently stressed that conditions in Gaza are already intolerable, that problems in areas such as education, sewage and drinking water are progressively worsening, and that these conditions, allied to a growing young population and huge unemployment, are creating textbook conditions for militant groups to flourish and recruit. The recent UN report &lsquo;Gaza in 2020&rsquo; only reinforces these messages. I visited Gaza myself in January this year, to see conditions for myself.  The blockade makes it impossible for local authorities or international organisations to keep pace with the need for basic services in a rapidly growing population. The UN report underlines this. Schools in Gaza already work on double shifts, and there is presently a demand for an additional 250 schools.   In recognition of these problems, Ireland has provided &euro;12m to UNRWA since 2010 to provide basic education, health and social services to Palestinian refugees, and a further &euro;500,000 to UNRWA&rsquo;s food aid programme in Gaza. But outside aid can at best only ameliorate the problems, as long as the blockade stifles normal economic activity.</p><p>The Government&rsquo;s conviction that the   blockade causes unnecessary hardship for the civilian population in Gaza and those working to assist them is made clear unequivocally to the Israeli authorities at every opportunity. In my meetings with PM Netanyahu and FM Liberman in January, I stressed the futility of the blockade, and that it is counter-productive to Israel&rsquo;s security concerns. Ireland will continue to raise these concerns and to urge the Israeli authorities to fundamentally alter their policies in relation to Gaza and open up the border crossings to all normal commercial, humanitarian and human traffic, as called for in Security Council Resolution 1860 of January 2009.</p></reply>

In addition to their country of primary accreditation, many Ambassadors are also accredited to additional countries on a non-resident basis which enhances the cost-effectiveness of our external representation.    Our missions abroad perform a wide range of functions in pursuit of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy interests.  These include representing and advancing government policies with other States and in international organisations, in particular the EU and the UN; economic and cultural promotion; frontline consular and passport services to Irish citizens overseas; engaging with Irish communities and harnessing the resource they offer in assisting economic recovery; and programme management, particularly in Irish Aid priority countries.</p><p>  The size and scale of our diplomatic network is considered by the Government on an ongoing basis. Any decision to adjust the State&rsquo;s external representation by closing, opening or relocating missions, will have regard to national priorities and available resources.</p></reply>

My Department has always played an important and active role in promoting Ireland as a tourist destination, in particular through our Embassy Network, and we are working very closely with the Department of Tourism, Transport and Sport and Tourism Ireland to promote The Gathering. In some cases dedicated events have been organised to launch the initiative: just last week, for example, President Higgins and Minister of State Costello launched The Gathering in Argentina at an Embassy organised event. In many other cases Embassy events are being leveraged to promote the initiative and, where suitable, speaking engagements and media/radio interviews are also being used to support the scheme.    Along with the Taoiseach and Minister Varadkar, I launched The Gathering in Dublin Castle on 11 May 2012. Following on from this launch we sent a joint letter to all Global Irish Network Tourism Advocates on 14 May. Network members are working with our Embassy Network and Tourism Ireland to promote the Gathering across the world. More recently, I played a central role in many of the events surrounding the Navy-Notre Dame American football match in Dublin, which was sponsored by The Gathering. </p><p>  I have also used my overseas travel to promote the initiative. To give some specific examples: during my St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day visit to Montreal and Toronto, I launched the international campaign for The Gathering in Canada; during my September 2012 visit to New York, along with Minister Varadkar, I was guest of honour at a reception co-hosted by the Consul General and Tourism Ireland to promote The Gathering to a large audience drawn from tourism professionals and the Irish community; I took the opportunity to promote the initiative in an interview last week with Lib&eacute;ration, an influential French newspaper.</p></reply>

Such violence is totally unacceptable.  The disturbances in Carrick Hill/Carlisle Circus resulted in injuries to 65 PSNI officers.  I condemn those involved in violence against the police service and I am pleased to note that charges have been brought in a number of cases.  These riots caused serious concerns regarding community relations in advance of the parades commemorating the centenary of the signing of the Ulster Covenant, which took place on Saturday 29   September. In the event, the parades, which involved 208 bands and over 30,000 marchers, passed off without violence, following extensive behind-the-scenes efforts, although several breaches of the Parades Commission determinations were reported to the authorities. </p><p>  I commend the First Minister and Deputy First Minister for moving quickly to defuse the situation and using their offices to liaise with the various interested parties, as well as the efforts of MLAs, Councillors, the churches and community representatives.   </p><p>  Respect is the key to preventing and resolving violence related to parades and sectarianism, and I applaud efforts to facilitate dialogue between residents and parade organisers. I have discussed this matter with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland on a number of occasions since she took up office, and we agreed to work together to support efforts to address division and sectarianism and to help promote the shared future agenda.</p><p>I would like to welcome the apology provided by the Royal Black Institution for the incident outside St Patrick&rsquo;s Church in Carrick Hill on 25   August, and hope that this will clear the way for further progress in relation to parades in Belfast.  </p><p>  Irish Government officials monitored events leading up to the Covenant parade closely and used every opportunity to underline the importance of dialogue and respect. They remained in regular contact with local residents and clergy in advance of the parade, as efforts were made to address residents&rsquo; concerns. At the request of the residents, the feeder parades were monitored on the ground by my officials. Both the Taoiseach and myself were fully briefed as the situation evolved, and I was heartened that the parade passed off peacefully. </p><p>  It must be recognised that the Parades Commission also played a key role in working to promote a peaceful outcome to the Covenant parade. It continues to work to address the parades issue in a very challenging environment, and it is essential that the determinations of the Parades Commission are respected and upheld as the rule of law.</p><p>  The scenes of rioting in early September made international headlines and underlined the urgent need to address the root causes of division and sectarianism in Northern Ireland. They also underlined the potential for sectarian acts to destabilise the situation generally and for new flashpoints to emerge. In the absence of a clear strategy to address the causes of division in Northern Ireland, events such as those we have seen in recent weeks risk damaging community relations in general, undermining economic regeneration strategies for Belfast and tarnishing Northern Ireland&rsquo;s improving international reputation for stability and political progress. </p><p>  These events underline the importance and urgency at this time of the Northern Ireland Executive delivering on and implementing an agreed Strategy for Cohesion, Sharing and Integration.</p></reply>

The Agreements are required as a result of World Trade Organisation (WTO) rulings that the unilateral trade preferences previously granted to the ACP countries established unfair discrimination between developing countries.   The negotiations have been protracted, and at times difficult.   By the end of 2007, when a WTO waiver expired, one full Agreement had been concluded with Caribbean States and seven interim Agreements were agreed and initialled with 21 other ACP States, either individually or in regional groupings.  Negotiations towards full Agreements are continuing.   Several years ago, there were well-founded concerns that momentum was being lost in the process and that the original shared commitment to the achievement of Agreements which serve the development needs of African countries was being lost.  However, agreement was reached at the EU-Africa Summit in November 2010 that both sides should move &ldquo;to conclude Economic Partnership Agreements that support socioeconomic development, regional integration and the integration of Africa into the global economy&rdquo;.  </p><p>  The European Commission last year engaged actively and flexibly in renewed negotiations with the ACP countries at the regional level.  The Commission also made a proposal in September 2011 to set a deadline of 1 January 2014 for the conclusion of the negotiations.  The European Parliament has given a first reading to the Commission proposal and has voted to recommend an extension of the proposed deadline to 1 January 2016.   The proposal is currently under consideration by the Council of Trade Ministers.   At their meeting last March, the EU Trade Ministers acknowledged the need for flexibility and pragmatism on both sides to find solutions to outstanding issues.</p><p>  Throughout the process of negotiating Economic Partnership Agreements, the Government has at all stages made it clear that Ireland supports a negotiating approach that is as flexible as possible under WTO law and underlines the importance of a strong partnership approach.  We will continue to work for the conclusion of Agreements which serve the development needs of our developing country partners.</p></reply>

Ireland works closely with the World Bank through the Department of Finance and through the Government&rsquo;s aid programme, Irish Aid, which is managed by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  The World Bank Group supports developing countries in their fight against poverty by providing the financial and technical assistance needed to promote trade and investment. In 2011, the Department of Finance provided &euro;18 million to the International Development Association, one of the five agencies within the World Bank Group, which in turn provides grants and long term, zero interest loans to the world&rsquo;s poorest countries. In addition Irish Aid contributes to a number of global and programme country trust funds managed by the Bank Group focusing on the fight against hunger, the provision of basic needs, private sector development, and fragile and conflict affected states.</p><p>  Minister Costello discussed the strong relationship between Irish Aid and the World Bank, over a wide range of our development priorities including hunger, nutrition and agricultural productivity. The Bank provided him with a valuable update on its work in fragile and unstable States.  He was in a position to brief senior officials on the findings of his recent visit to Jordan where he saw at first hand the scale of the refugee crisis as a result of the conflict in Syria.</p><p>  The Minister also discussed Ireland&rsquo;s forthcoming EU Presidency role, and especially our focus on facilitating substantive discussions on the EU&rsquo;s approach for the formulation of the framework for global development after 2015.  He also engaged Bank officials on the crucial role of the private sector in driving economic growth, creating jobs and reducing poverty.  He briefed the Bank on the development of the new Africa Strategy of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and discussed the opportunities for Irish business in Africa in the context of increasing two way trade between Ireland and Africa.  </p><p>  We look forward to further meetings at Ministerial level with the World Bank and to developing a closer working relationship on development and on economic and trade issues.</p></reply>

Firstly, the issue of encroachment on the land of the Masai people by safari companies.  Ireland has been to the fore in highlighting the challenges facing pastoral communities such as the Masai people, the violation of their human rights and the need to find sustainable solutions to land conflicts.  We have also emphasised the substantial contribution that pastoral communities make to environmentally sustainable economic development in Tanzania. The Irish Embassy in Dar es Salaam has taken a lead in highlighting pastoralist community concerns, including through the EU, and the issues have been raised at the highest levels of Government. Through our existing Irish Aid bilateral programme in Tanzania, Ireland is providing annual support of &euro;400,000 to pastoralist civil society groups to strengthen their capacity for advocacy and engagement with national and local development processes.</p><p>  Secondly, the death of Trent Keegan in Kenya.  Notwithstanding Mr. Keegan&rsquo;s connections with Ireland, he was a citizen of New Zealand travelling on a New Zealand passport.  While I am aware that the circumstances of Mr. Keegan&rsquo;s death remain unresolved, Ireland has no consular role or standing in this matter.    </p><p>  Finally, the person referred to by the Deputy first came to the attention of my Department in 2008 when he was living in Tanzania.  Since then my Department, through the Embassy in Tanzania and Consular Assistance Section in Dublin, has afforded all possible consular assistance to the person mentioned.    The Embassy pursued his concerns in attempting to seek a meeting with District Commissioner and also through the Foreign Ministry.  Also, my Department has kept him  fully up to date with correspondence from the Tanzanian Ministry for Foreign Affairs on this matter.  </p></reply>

We have repeatedly raised this case with the Bahraini Ambassador in London and through our Ambassador in Riyadh who is accredited to Bahrain.   Officials in my Department again conveyed our strong concerns to the Bahraini authorities through diplomatic channels after the Court of Cassation&rsquo;s decision on 1 October to uphold the prison sentences against a number of doctors, including some who trained in Ireland. </p><p>  Given the great concerns and doubts which have surrounded the case of the medics from the start, and particularly in light of the well-documented reports of ill-treatment to which many of those originally detained were subject, I believe that the Bahraini Government should consider exercising clemency and releasing those medical professionals who have now been imprisoned. Such an act of clemency would also be very much in the wider interests of promoting urgently needed reconciliation and national dialogue within Bahrain.  I therefore urge King Hamad and the Bahrain Government to take account of the widespread international concerns which exist and to agree to release those now imprisoned following the verdict in the Court of Cassation.  </p><p>  I also again urge the Bahraini authorities to follow up on the recommendations of the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry Report, particularly the recommendation that an independent and impartial body should conduct effective investigations of all allegations of torture in detention.  I believe that such investigations would demonstrate Bahrain&rsquo;s determination to ensure mistreatment in custody cannot happen again, and would contribute to initiating a genuine process of reform.</p></reply>

There are particular concerns in the United States where addressing the position of the undocumented Irish and reforming our migration arrangements are priorities for the Government in its contacts with the US Administration and Congress.  </p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s keen interest in a resolution of the situation for undocumented Irish migrants is well recognised and accepted by our contacts within US Administration and Congress. Their advice to us remains that comprehensive reform of the US immigration system and procedures is likely to be the only manner by which this can be achieved. </p><p>  With a view to building some positive momentum around immigration issues, we have focused our efforts on enabling Irish people to apply for E-3 temporary U.S. work visas. The passage of existing draft legislation by Congress to extend this scheme to Irish citizens would make up to 10,500 E-3 visas available each year. The level of support achieved to date for this draft legislation among members of Congress is encouraging.   However, further progress will have to await the outcome of the Presidential and Congressional elections in November.</p><p>  Through our Embassy in Washington, the Government will continue to work closely with our friends in Congress and with Irish-American community representatives and ensure that every opportunity is taken to put an E-3 visa scheme in place.

But that time is not unlimited.&rdquo;  This is consistent with the serious, patient and protracted efforts of the United States Government over many years.  The US has worked closely with the European Union and the Governments of Russia and China, to engage Iran in a diplomatic dialogue to resolve the serious concerns surrounding Iran&rsquo;s nuclear programme.   These concerns are shared by Ireland and its EU partners, by the wider international community and by the International Atomic Energy Agency.  All recent reporting and analysis of the issue has acknowledged continuing US efforts to discourage any immediate recourse to military action against Iranian sites.</p><p>  The Government, in concert with our European partners, fully support a diplomatic solution to this issue. Furthermore, the Government has equally and consistently been clear in advocating with EU and international partners that it is only through the path of diplomatic negotiations that the serious issues arising from Iran&rsquo;s nuclear programme can be resolved. It is regrettable that thus far Iran has not been willing to engage in negotiations on the issue with the necessary seriousness and commitment. We hope very much that this will change.</p></reply>

SG Ban and I reviewed the current disheartening situation on the ground in Syria, with mounting casualties now estimated at well over 20,000 people killed in the past twenty months.  We agreed that it was regrettable that such deep divisions continue to exist on how to end the conflict, not least within the UN Security Council itself but also among the Syrian population and within the ranks of the Syrian opposition. </p><p>  We shared the view that the EU and the international community must redouble their efforts to end the nightmare of the Syrian people.  In particular, we agreed that newly-appointed Joint Special Representative Brahimi needs all our support in his task of rejuvenating the Annan Plan and the Geneva Communiqu&eacute; with the hope of finding a new way towards peace and a political settlement involving transition. </p><p>  I also reiterated Ireland&rsquo;s strong view that what is needed above all now is a robust Chapter VII UNSC Resolution which would include sanctions and a comprehensive arms embargo.   This would go a long way towards cutting off the flow of arms to all sides and compel those who are responsible for violating the human rights of the Syrian people to stop their reprehensible actions.</p><p>  I also underlined Ireland&rsquo;s strong support for a referral of the situation in Syria to the ICC, given the clear need and duty which we have vis-a-vis the Syrian people to ensure there is some form of accountability for the many serious human rights violations which have taken place.</p><p>  The United Nations, principally through OCHA (the Office of the Coordinator for Humanitarian Affairs), is playing a central role in international efforts to mobilise the substantial resources which are now required to deal with the humanitarian emergency confronting Syria and its neighbours.   Ireland, for its part, is playing a significant role in supporting UN agencies and others in their relief operations. To date, we have contributed a total of &euro;2.25 million in humanitarian assistance, principally channelled through UNHCR, ICRC and WHO.   Minister of State Costello had extensive discussions with the UNHCR during his visit last August to the Zatari refugee camp in Jordan which UNHCR operates and which is now accommodating some 35,000 Syrian refugees fleeing the conflict.</p></reply>

I confirmed that we were looking forward to working with Serbia during our six-month Presidency.    On 25 September, Minister of State Creighton visited Belgrade as part of a five day official visit to the region. She was there both as the representative of the Chair in Office of the OSCE and to build working relationships with some key interlocutors involved in Serbia&rsquo;s progress towards the EU, in the context of Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency next year.</p><p>  The Minister of State held a series of meetings with leading figures in the new Serbian government and parliament, including Prime Minister Dačić and Deputy Prime Minister for European Integration, Suzana Grubje&scaron;ić.   Both recognised that, due to the recent elections in Serbia, and the time taken to form a new government, there had been little progress on the reform agenda in the previous 6 months. However, they committed to renewed efforts and underlined the steps which the new government has taken towards implementing the agreements reached in the dialogue with Pri&scaron;tina.

This included the possibility that a date for opening of accession negotiations might be fixed during our semester.</p><p>  Since then, the Commission&rsquo;s assessment in its report on enlargement, issued on 10 October, was that Serbia continues on its way to sufficiently fulfilling the political criteria. While recognising progress, the Commission pointed to further work needed on rule of law issues and relations with Kosovo before it could recommend the opening of accession negotiations. The Commission is to report further to the Council as soon as the necessary progress has been achieved.</p><p>  The Commission&rsquo;s report of 10 October will now be considered by EU Member States with a view to taking decisions on its recommendations at the General Affairs and European Council meetings in December.</p></reply>

This will be the major overarching theme of the Irish EU Presidency.</p><p>  Over the past 20 years the Single Market has boosted Irish exports and created thousands of jobs.  One of the aims of the Single Market Act II, which was published by the European Commission on 3 October, will be to respond to changes in the economy over the coming years, particularly by exploiting the potential of the digital economy for business and consumers and contributing to growth and jobs creation.  Ireland will also seek to promote external trade during its Presidency and will hold a meeting of Trade Ministers in Ireland during the Presidency which will focus on the EU-US trade relationship.  There will also be a strong focus on tackling the causes of unemployment, and in particular youth unemployment.</p><p>  As Presidency Ireland will work to restore confidence and stability in Europe&rsquo;s economy by seeking to effectively implement economic governance measures and reach agreement on banking proposals to strengthen supervision.  The Government is supporting the current Cyprus EU Presidency in its efforts to secure agreement on the EU&rsquo;s budget from 2014-2020.  We stand ready to take any remaining tasks that fall to us on 1 January next to ensure that the EU has a budget that can underpin economic growth and job creation in Europe through programmes of major importance to Ireland and other Member States such as CAP, CFP and the Horizon 2020 framework for research and innovation, to name but a few.</p><p>  In relation to the Common Foreign and Security Policy, as Presidency, we will actively support the High Representative and the EEAS in promoting effectiveness and coherence in the EU&rsquo;s response to current foreign policy and security challenges.  While the Foreign Affairs Council agenda is mainly driven by current events, the crisis in Syria, the Middle East Peace Process and the Iran nuclear issue seem likely to remain high on this agenda in the first half of 2013.</p><p>  In the area of development aid, we will focus on themes including shaping the post-2015 framework for international development as we look beyond the 2000 Millennium Development Goals.  This issue will figure prominently at the Informal meeting of EU Development Ministers in February 2013.   We are also planning to organise an international conference in Dublin, bringing together the themes of hunger, nutrition and climate justice, working in close cooperation with Mary Robinson.  It will aim to bring the voices of local communities in developing countries to bear on the policy debate on the future of global development.</p><p>  In my role as Chairman of the General Affairs Council during the Presidency, I will ensure that EU Enlargement will also be a priority for the Irish Presidency.</p></reply>

Some 82 projects which have received funding from the EU or its member States have been damaged or entirely destroyed by Israeli actions in this period, with damage estimated at &euro;30 million. While I am not aware of any Irish-funded work which was destroyed, some of the projects had been funded by the Humanitarian Response Fund, to which we have made contributions.   Some of the damage may have been inflicted inadvertently in genuine security-related operations.  The largest single item, amounting to about one third of the total, was the complete destruction in late 2001/early 2002 of Gaza Airport, which the EU and other donors had been preparing for re-opening. Most of the damage and destruction carried out was concentrated during the periods of the second intifada (2001-2004) or during Operation Cast Lead, the Israeli military operation in Gaza, in late 2008/early 2009.    Nonetheless, it remains evident that much of the destruction caused has been quite deliberate and includes structures such as solar panels, wells and cisterns as well as refugee housing for people already displaced from elsewhere.</p><p>  The EU is deeply concerned about the destruction of humanitarian and development assistance projects funded by European taxpayers.   But I am just as concerned about the much wider practice of the continuing destruction of Palestinian homes and infrastructure, of which this is just the most visible element.    This practice is equally abhorrent and unjustified.</p><p>  This is an issue of ongoing and widespread concern within the EU.   It was included in the issues addressed in the May 2012 Foreign Affairs Council Conclusions.  Partners are continuing to examine measures to prevent such destruction, especially of EU-funded works.</p></reply>

The agreed programme for this year was presented to the Export Trade Council at its 16 February meeting. It is still too early to discuss the EI programme of Trade Missions for 2013, having regard also to ongoing Ministerial travel planning related to our EU Presidency.    The Deputy will be aware that Russia has been identified as a key high-growth and high-potential market for Ireland under the Strategy and Action Plan for Irish Trade, Tourism and Investment to 2015. The local market team, chaired by our Ambassador, with the participation of the relevant State Agencies, is working actively to expand trade, investment and education links.  </p><p>  During a visit to Russia in November 2011, I co-chaired a meeting of the Ireland-Russia Joint Economic Commission. The meeting provided an opportunity to explore how our trade and business links with Russia could be further developed. My visit led to a follow up meeting with a sectoral focus in Dublin in May of this year at which a Work Programme was adopted. On that occasion, the Russian delegation met the Minister of State for Trade and Development, Joe Costello T.D. who subsequently led an Enterprise Ireland Trade Mission to Moscow from 18-22 June. During this Mission, Minister of State Costello participated in a large number of business engagements organised by the Embassy and State Agencies, as well as in high-level political meetings.</p><p>  I believe that through this combination of high level contacts and work on the ground on a daily basis by our Embassy and the State Agencies, our trade relations with Russia will continue to strengthen. In 2011, Irish merchandise exports to Russia increased by 34% to &euro;507 million making Russia, for the first time, one of our twenty most important markets for exports of merchandise. Strong levels of export growth have continued into 2012 with merchandise exports of &euro;401m for the first 8 months of the year, an increase of 15% over the same period in 2011. The Russian market is an important one for indigenous companies, accounting for over 10% of indigenous exports in 2011.</p></reply>

I am satisfied that all funding to NGOs is allocated and monitored on the basis of the highest oversight standards at all stages of the funding cycle, including audit.  Funding proposals submitted by NGOs are rigorously appraised against clear criteria by Irish Aid staff and, as appropriate, by external experts.  The criteria include a proven organisational capacity for the effective use of funding and an assessment of management and oversight systems within partner organisations.  </p><p>  Audit is a fundamental component of good governance and the primary responsibility for complying with audit obligations rests with the NGOs funded by the Department. Contracts signed between the Department and NGO partners stipulate that annual audited accounts must be submitted to the Department as part of the annual reporting process. In the interests of transparency, Irish Aid also requires NGOs to publish their audited accounts on their websites. </p><p>  Departmental procedures to ensure that funding is used for the intended purposes include regular field monitoring visits, annual narrative and financial reporting against agreed objectives and budgets, evaluations, audits and ongoing reviews of compliance. </p><p>  In common with other Departments, expenditure under the two Votes of the Department of Foreign Affairs is audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  In addition, the Department has its own Evaluation and Audit Unit, which is staffed by professionals and has responsibility for the internal audit function.  Using a risk-based audit approach, it carries out and manages a range of evaluations, audits and Value for Money reviews, including reviews of NGO partners.  Recent audits carried out have included those of the major Irish development NGOs, Concern, Goal and Tr&oacute;caire.</p><p>  In addition to these robust internal systems, the Department has an independent Audit Committee which reports to the Secretary General. It provides an independent appraisal of audit reports and of the Department&rsquo;s audit and evaluation arrangements.  The Committee meets regularly with the Secretary General and senior management of Irish Aid and annually with the Comptroller and Auditor General. It also publishes an annual report on its work.</p><p>  The Government attaches the highest importance to ensuring effective audit and evaluation of all public expenditure.  In my Department, regular reviews of the overall audit approach, audit work programmes and resource levels will continue to be undertaken by management to ensure that audit systems and coverage remain appropriate to the risks and challenges facing the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, including Irish Aid.</p></reply>

I indicated, in response, that we look forward to working with him during our forthcoming EU Presidency.    A more detailed discussion on the question of Albania&rsquo;s relationship with the EU took place the following day when Minister of State Lucinda Creighton T.D. visited Tirana as part of a five day official visit to the region. She was there both as the representative of the Chair in Office of the OSCE and to build working relationships with some of the key interlocutors involved in Albania&rsquo;s progress towards the EU, in the context of Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency next year.</p><p>  She met with Prime Minister Sali Berisha and with Minister for Integration Majlinda Bregu, both of whom reiterated their commitment to EU integration and set out the progress that had been achieved in Albania&rsquo;s reform process over the past year. They expressed the hope that this would result in the granting of candidate status later this year. Minister Creighton welcomed the progress made. She also reiterated the OSCE&rsquo;s readiness to continue supporting Albania in addressing outstanding issues in the areas related to judicial reform, the fight against corruption and strengthening the rule of law, all of which are important in the context of the country&rsquo;s EU aspirations. </p><p>  Since then, the Commission&rsquo;s assessment, in its report on enlargement issued on 10 October, was that Albania has indeed made good progress.

The Commission is to report further to the Council as soon as the necessary progress has been achieved. </p><p>  The Commission&rsquo;s report of 10 October will now be considered by EU member States with a view to taking decisions on its recommendations at the General Affairs and European Council meetings in December. </p></reply>

Alongside its foreign policy, diplomatic and consular functions, the Embassy Network is a key platform for the promotion of Ireland&rsquo;s trade, investment and tourism objectives. A significant part of my Department&rsquo;s contribution to national economic recovery has centred on using the Embassy Network to disseminate the Government&rsquo;s economic message and help restore our international reputation.    The transfer of certain trade promotion functions to my Department on 1 June last year was in one sense a formal recognition of the trade promotion work carried out by the Department of Foreign Affairs and its diplomatic and consular missions over many years. The most significant institutional innovation was establishment under the responsibility of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Export Trade Council, which I chair, and which oversees coordination and implementation of the Government&rsquo;s Trade Strategy.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Trade Strategy sets out concrete targets in trade, tourism and investment to be met by 2015 as well as a programme of actions conducive to achieving these targets. The responsible Ministers and Heads of State Agencies are members of the Export Trade Council as are senior representatives of certain other Departments and, importantly, a number of private sector individuals with relevant experience. The Council has met three times, most recently on 20 September. Earlier this year, I reported to Government on progress in implementing the Strategy in 2011. </p><p>  The Trade and Promotion Division of my Department supports the work of the Export Trade Council. This involves regular engagement at Headquarters with Enterprise Ireland, the IDA, Bord Bia, Tourism Ireland, Culture Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland as well as other Departments in order to build a Team Ireland approach both at home and abroad. The Division also acts as the interface between the Embassy Network and other relevant Government Departments, the State Agencies and the private sector. Ireland&rsquo;s bilateral relations, economic as well as political, with other countries are the responsibility of geographical Divisions and Units of my Department. Trade and Promotion Division liaises with them, particularly with respect to the priority countries identified under the Trade Strategy. </p><p>  Local market teams, chaired by Ambassadors with State Agency participation, are in place in all these priority countries. The local teams&rsquo; market plans for 2012 were reviewed by the Export Trade Council in February, their mid- year progress reports in September. On foot of guidance from the Council, we aim to further increase the value of mid- and end-year progress reports by sharpening their focus on the impact of actions taken on the realisation of agreed objectives. The local market teams are gradually becoming better coordinated and it is notable that shared effort is not confined to standout promotional occasions such as St Patrick&rsquo;s Day and high level visits. All concerned understand that it is imperative that optimum use is made of State resources in support of the objectives of the Trade Strategy.  </p><p>  Another area where progress has been made since my Department assumed certain trade promotion functions is the annual programme of Minister-led Enterprise Ireland Trade Missions.  In December, Enterprise Ireland now submits a draft programme for the following year to the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and to me. The programme is agreed between our two Departments and presented to the Export Trade Council. My Department manages the missions led by the Minister of State for Trade and Development, Mr. Joe Costello TD., and by me. This year, we have led Enterprise Ireland Trade Missions to Turkey, Russia, the UK and Brazil; before the end of the year, Minister Costello will also lead missions to Italy and to South Africa.  </p><p>  Finally, my Department now co-ordinates the Joint Economic Commissions with a number of high growth and emerging countries. Following my co&ndash;Chairmanship of the Ireland Russia Joint Economic Commission in Moscow in November 2011, a delegation of Russian officials, including co chairs of the sectoral working groups established in areas of mutual interest, met their Irish counterparts here in May and agreed a work programme. The China-Ireland JEC will meet here on Friday, preceded by a first meeting of a Joint Investment Promotion Working Group. On 30 November, the Irish side will host the Joint Economic Commission with South Korea.</p></reply>

There are particular concerns in the United States where addressing the position of the undocumented Irish and reforming our migration arrangements are priorities for the Government in its contacts with the US Administration and Congress.     The Government&rsquo;s keen interest in a resolution of the situation for undocumented Irish migrants is well recognised and accepted by our contacts within US Administration and Congress. Their advice to us remains that comprehensive reform of the US immigration system and procedures is likely to be the only manner by which this can be achieved. </p><p>  With a view to building some positive momentum around immigration issues, we have focused our efforts on enabling Irish people to apply for E-3 temporary U.S. work visas. The passage of existing draft legislation by Congress to extend this scheme to Irish citizens would make up to 10,500 E-3 visas available each year. The level of support achieved to date for this draft legislation among members of Congress is encouraging.   However, further progress will have to await the outcome of the Presidential and Congressional elections in November.</p><p>  Through our Embassy in Washington, the Government will continue to work closely with our friends in Congress and with Irish-American community representatives and ensure that every opportunity is taken to put an E-3 visa scheme in place.    I met with Irish community lobby groups for immigration reform during my visit to New York in September and discussed this issue in some detail with them.  We agreed to continue to work together on this important endeavour.</p></reply>

The EU High Representative, Baroness Ashton, has led negotiations for the E3+3 group (UK, France, Germany, US, Russia and China) with Iran at three negotiating sessions this year as well as at a number of ancillary meetings. The E3+3 Foreign Ministers met at the General Assembly session in New York last month to consider how to proceed.</p><p>  I am satisfied that the EU, along with its other partners, is doing everything it can to put pressure on Iran to change its course and to negotiate seriously so to address the major concerns which exist regarding its nuclear programme.  Regrettably, it has been necessary to impose several rounds of EU sanctions as part of this.   A further round of sanctions was agreed at the Foreign Affairs Council which I attended on Monday.</p><p>  The E3+3 have shown both great patience and creativity in exploring every avenue for agreement. I believe that there are those in Iran who also wish to reach agreement.   However, the regime as a whole has thus far failed to respond and to engage in serious negotiation.  I very much hope that they will do so soon.</p><p>  The UN Security Council has also found it necessary to adopt six resolutions and impose four rounds of sanctions in relation to Iran&rsquo;s nuclear programme. In adopting such Resolutions, the members of the Security Council would benefit at all times from the advice of the UN Secretary General and of the Office of the UN Legal Counsel as to the resolutions in question being in full accordance with the provisions of the UN Charter.  Security Council Resolutions once adopted are, of course, binding on all UN member States. </p><p>  Ireland has shared the widespread international concerns about the nature of Iran&rsquo;s nuclear programme.  These concerns are felt most strongly by other states in the region and are by no means confined to Israel.  There can be no doubt that this issue has increased instability and could even conceivably lead to conflict in an already very troubled part of the world. </p><p>  I will continue to make the case strongly to our EU and other international partners that the issues arising in connection with Iran&rsquo;s nuclear activities can only be resolved through diplomatic negotiations and not by any other means.</p></reply>

On Serbia, while recognising progress, the Commission pointed to further work needed before it could recommend the opening of accession negotiations. In particular, Serbia needs to pay attention to the rule of law, notably the judiciary and the rights of vulnerable groups and Serbia needs to take steps towards a visible and sustainable improvement of relations with Kosovo. I agree with the Commission&rsquo;s assessment.  Whether a date for opening accession negotiations with Serbia can be set during Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the Council in 2013 is dependent on a number of factors. In the first instance, Serbia will have to fulfil the requirement of an improvement in relations with Kosovo. Secondly, the Commission will have to report that Serbia has achieved the necessary degree of compliance with EU membership criteria. Then the Council will assess this report before coming to a decision.   Accession is the result of a negotiation, and the eventual outcome and timeframe in respect of any application cannot be predicted. </p><p>Turning to the concerns raised in relation to LGBT rights in Serbia, as I have already stated publicly, I greatly regret   the decision of the Serbian authorities to ban the Belgrade Pride Parade for the second year in a row on security grounds. </p><p>  The European Union is first and foremost a community of values based on respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. These are values upon which European Union is built, and it is essential that Serbia, as a candidate country for membership, respects them. Serbia will be expected to demonstrate that it can fully protect the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) persons in Serbia before the country can be admitted to the EU.  </p></reply>

Malala Yousafzai is an admirable young woman who received Pakistan&rsquo;s first national peace award last year, and was also nominated for the International Children&rsquo;s Peace Prize.  </p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s diplomatic relations with Pakistan are maintained by secondary accreditation via our Embassy in Ankara.  Therefore I have requested that officials at the Embassy maintain contact with relevant EU colleagues in Islamabad regarding this case.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that since this incident the High Representative / Vice President of the European Commission Catherine Ashton and the Secretary General of the United National Ban Ki Moon have both issued statements condemning this attack.  I share their condemnation; such incidents are unacceptable.  Like many others, I admire Malala Yousufzai&rsquo;s courageous efforts to promote the fundamental right to education.  She has arrived in England for specialist treatment and I wish her a full and speedy recovery.</p><p>  The EU engages in regular dialogue with Pakistan on human rights and democratic principles, including the right to freedom of opinion and expression.  The EU has called on the Pakistani authorities, at the highest level, to adopt measures to protect individual and minority rights in line with its Constitution and with international human rights standards and conventions.  The EU has made clear to the Government of Pakistan that under its constitutional and international requirements it has a responsibility to protect its citizens. </p><p>  Ireland attaches great importance to the fundamental human rights of freedom of expression and opinion.  I will continue to work with my international colleagues through the mechanisms of the EU and the UN to ensure that these rights are protected.  Furthermore, I have asked officials in my Department to monitor and report on the ongoing situation in Pakistan.</p><p>  In relation to this specific case of Malala Yousafzai, I would also like to reiterate and support the recent statement by UNICEF which called on all parties in Pakistan to respect all children&rsquo;s rights, including education in a safe and protective environment.</p></reply>

It has transformed a continent that for so long was torn apart by war and division, shattering the lives of millions.  I am delighted that this contribution has been given the strongest possible recognition by the Norwegian Nobel Committee, who awarded the Union the Nobel Peace Prize last week.  The history of the European Union is one of evolution and transformation as it has grown and deepened to meet the challenges of each era. </p><p>  The challenge for our generation is the unprecedented economic crisis that has faced the Union and, more especially, the euro zone over the past number of years.  The topic of how best to move beyond crisis and return Europe to a growth and job creating trajectory has been the subject of discussion at most, if not all, of my meetings with colleagues in the European Union.  It has dominated discussions at the European Council.</p><p>  A great deal has been achieved.  We have put in place the rescue packages and mechanisms for Member States in difficulties which were needed to stabilise matters in the immediate context &ndash; we didn't have these when the crisis began.</p><p>  We have tightened the rules and our ability to enforce them through steps such as the six-pack of the legislation adopted last year and through the Fiscal Treaty.  We have strengthened our coordination and governance arrangements through the Europe 2020 process, the Euro Plus Pact and the European Semester.</p><p>  We are improving our ability to anticipate where problems may arise, including through the two-pack of legislation which I hope will be adopted as quickly as possible. </p><p>  At the end of June, we adopted a Compact for Growth and Jobs to help advance that vital agenda.  It sets out an ambitious programme of work at national and European level. Driving it forward will be an important priority of the Irish Presidency in the first half of next year. </p><p>  Importantly, at the end of June, Heads of State or Government also agreed to break the vicious circle between sovereign and bank debt and we are now working through the steps needed to secure that outcome. This will help to address one of the key brakes on Europe's recovery.</p><p>  Every step of the way we have seen the European Institutions &ndash; the Commission, the Council, the European Council and European Parliament &ndash; have worked together to seek common solutions to shared problems.  </p><p>  It is clear, however, that we need to give careful thought to whether the Economic and Monetary Union we now have, including these new arrangements put in place since the crisis broke, is sufficient to meet the needs and the challenges of the future.  In June, President of the European Council was to examine this question, in close cooperation with the Presidents of the Commission, ECB and Eurogroup.  He will present an interim report to the European Council on 18/19 October and a final one by the end of the year. </p></reply>

Ireland's diplomatic relations with the Philippines are maintained by secondary accreditation via our Embassy in Singapore.</p><p>  I believe that the signature of this Framework Peace Agreement is a positive step towards a long-lasting peace in Mindanao which will lead to further stability and prosperity.  This will be good not only for Mindanao, but for the whole of the Philippines.  I commend President Aquino of the Philippines and the commitment of the MILF leadership in reaching the agreement.</p><p>  This Framework Agreement is of course not the final step of the peace process.  It does, however, signal a new phase in which the Government and the MILF will now work as partners in the implementation of its provision.  Implementation of this Agreement will require engagement by the Government and MILF, and also cross-sector public participation.</p><p>  In relation to the Deputy's enquiry on the possibility of offering assistance to the Government of the Philippines over the past few years, successive Irish Governments have shared the experience and insights gained during our peace process with groups operating in conflict situations from many different parts of the world.   A small Conflict Resolution Unit was created in my Department in 2007 to facilitate this work and to assist those striving for peaceful settlements elsewhere.   In this and other ways, Ireland is making a strong national contribution to conflict resolution and mediation efforts around the world. </p><p>  As Chair-in-Office of the Organisation for Security for Cooperation in Europe for 2012, one of our main priorities has been to draw on Ireland's experience of conflict resolution and peace-building to facilitate efforts to resolve conflicts in the OSCE area.  In April, I hosted in Dublin a major conference which was entitled 'Shared Future: Building and Sustaining Peace, the Northern Ireland case study'. Since then, we have hosted a number of smaller, follow-up activities.</p><p>  Ireland has welcomed a number of foreign delegations to Ireland for study visits.  While the circumstances of all conflicts are different, my Department would consider a request from the Philippines to facilitate such a visit to Ireland subject to the availability of resources.</p></reply>

The CPN movement is a grouping of civil society groups and activists, and describes its focus as being that of achieving peace and social transformation through democratic means.  It is important to acknowledge that the overall trend in relation to human rights in recent years in Colombia has been positive, with progress on the promotion and protection of human rights.    While many challenges remain, the Colombian Government's efforts in this area deserve our support as we encourage further progress.  I note that President Santos has stated in regard to the CPN that an expansion of voices and spaces for political expression enriches Colombian democracy. </p><p>  In this regard, the Government of Ireland actively supports representatives of civil society in Colombia in their efforts to address the legacy of the conflict through democratic and peaceful means.  Since 2009, Irish Aid has provided NGOs and Irish missionaries with funding of over &euro;3.5 million for projects in Colombia. &euro;100,000 in Irish Aid funding was approved in April 2011 for an Inter-American Commission on Human Rights project which seeks to protect the rights of human rights defenders in Colombia as well as in Venezuela and Ecuador.  Funding for 2012 is currently under consideration. </p><p>  The Colombian Government is open to dialogue and engagement on human rights with Ireland and with the EU.

As the Deputy will be aware, in my recent address at the United Nations General Assembly, I again confirmed the Government's commitment to the aid programme and to reaching the 0.7% UN target as soon as we possibly can.      Despite the enormously challenging budgetary environment we have managed to maintain our ODA levels above 0.5% of GNP. This is an important and significant achievement and a very clear indication of our commitment to the poor and hungry in the world and it is making a real difference in the lives of millions. The 0.7% target can only be achieved with the restoration of sustainable growth in the economy.  This is the Government's absolute priority and we are working extremely hard to achieve this goal.</p><p>  The Government remains ambitious for, and committed to, the aid programme.

Minister Costello reiterated Ireland's continuing support for UNICEF, through Irish Aid, the Government's aid programme.     The meeting focused in particular on the shared concern of the Government and of UNICEF with the continuing global hunger crisis, which is the central priority of our aid programme.  Ireland and UNICEF are cooperating closely in addressing under-nutrition and have jointly promoted the international Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN) movement.  This is a global initiative which brings together different Governments and development agencies to tackle hunger and under-nutrition with a particular focus on maternal, infant and child under-nutrition.

Ireland has made a strong contribution from the outset to the development of this policy.  It has now become broadly accepted by almost all parties as the goal which must be achieved if this conflict is to be settled.   Regrettably, progress towards this goal has been much less satisfactory.   The EU acts supportively in a number of ways.   First and foremost, we seek to encourage and press both parties into engaging in serious direct negotiations, because we recognise that this is the only way to reach a comprehensive agreement and to end the occupation.  Frankly, we have been very disappointed by the inability to get talks restarted.  The reasons are complex but primarily there has been little real engagement by the Israeli Government in the process.</p><p>  The EU is also active in relation to specific issues on the ground which we believe are having a negative effect and threaten to make a peace agreement based on a two-state solution impossible to achieve.   The Foreign Affairs Council in May issued strong Conclusions, to which Ireland actively contributed, which highlighted these issues, many of which revolve round Israeli settlement building, and which called for urgent changes in policy.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-10-17a.122.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/951" speakername="Eamon Gilmore" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012101700065#WRD02000"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 47 and 53 together.</p><p>  There can be no doubt that the Israeli military justice system is failing to provide adequate protections and safeguards for Palestinian children. </p><p>  The testimonies from Israeli soldiers contained in the Breaking the Silence report make for harrowing reading.   The testimonies indicate a frequent use of violence that requires urgent investigation within the Israeli state structures over and above the limited actions taken to date.  Former soldiers testify to feeling afraid to speak up to protect detainees.   Police and soldiers must feel that their actions will be called to account.  Serious abuses are not just contrary to human rights law but, I believe, contrary to the genuine interests of Israel, as they only serve to deepen divisions between Israelis and Palestinians.</p><p>The report by a delegation of British lawyers on the treatment of Palestinian children under the Israeli occupation reveals in particular the disparity between the treatment afforded to Palestinian children under military law and that afforded to Israeli children under civilian law.  This mirrors a more general pattern of injustice under the occupation.   I believe that in any society there should be equal treatment of children, irrespective of religion, race or ethnicity.   I therefore welcome the steps recently introduced by Israel, such as increasing the age of majority for Palestinian children from 16 to 18, to bring military law governing juvenile justice more into line with civilian law. However, it is clear that a   more comprehensive reform programme is required, most urgently in the rules governing the interrogation process. </p><p>  The UK report highlights a failure to meet international norms in describing how children are interrogated without the protective presence of a parent or guardian and often suffer physical violence during interrogation.  I believe the most effective safeguard would be the audio-visual recording of interrogations.  This would protect Palestinian children against mistreatment while also providing protection to Israeli officials against vexatious allegations.  A further problem is that the location of many police stations and detention centres within Israeli settlements means that parents can be unable to see their children in detention for extended periods.</p><p>  These are not new or insoluble issues.  Police forces all over the developed world, including in these islands, have had to modernise their methods and increase their safeguards for detainees, because these kinds of abuses can become endemic if allowed.  Methods and standards which Israelis rightly regard as unacceptable for use in relation to their own children should not be employed on Palestinian children.</p><p>  My officials have raised the issue of violence during detention directly with the Israeli authorities, most recently in a meeting earlier this month.  We have urged that effective investigations be carried out into any allegations of mistreatment of children during detention.  I have asked my officials to raise this issue again tomorrow in a meeting which they will be having with the Israeli Foreign Ministry and to relay my concern that urgent reform of the rules governing interrogation is required. </p></reply>

Comprising 56 participating States from Europe, Central Asia and North America, the OSCE is the world's largest intergovernmental regional security organisation, dealing with a range of issues in the areas of democratisation, human rights, arms control and economic and environmental security.   As Chairperson-in-Office, I bear overall responsibility for the executive action of the organisation and the co-ordination of its activities.  These responsibilities include representing the OSCE in various contexts and supervising activities relating to conflict prevention and post-conflict rehabilitation.  </p><p>  I am pleased to report that the general assessment of the first nine months of our Chairmanship has been very positive.   We have been productive across all dimensions of the OSCE's work.   In February, I addressed the UN Security Council on our priorities and met with UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-Moon.  I visited Armenia, Georgia and Azerbaijan in June and underlined the Chairmanship's commitment to making progress towards peaceful settlement of the &quot;protracted conflicts&quot; in the region through the peace processes supported by the OSCE and the international community.  Minister of State Creighton visited Moldova in September and conveyed our strong support for the Transdniestria settlement process;  she has also visited a number of Western Balkan countries which feature on the OSCE's agenda.  </p><p>  We have hosted a number of successful high-level Conferences in Dublin and Vienna throughout the year.   In April, I hosted a high-level conference in the Royal Hospital Kilmainham, entitled 'Shared Future: Building and Sustaining Peace, the Northern Ireland case study'.  This event provided a unique opportunity to listen to a first-hand account of the peace process and its relevance to broader conflict resolution activities.  The Dublin Conference on Internet Freedom took place on 18-19 June in Dublin Castle. It focused on ways to ensure that the internet remains an open, global and public forum for freedom of opinion and expression and a platform for facilitating the exercise of other human rights and fundamental freedoms.</p><p>We are now preparing intensively for the annual Ministerial Council, which will be held in the RDS in Dublin from 6-7 December.  This will be the largest ever gathering of Foreign Ministers in Ireland.   Approximately 1,200 delegates are expected to attend.  We expect that the attendance will include US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the Russian Foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov.    The Ministerial meeting is a significant opportunity to showcase Ireland to Ministers and delegates from over sixty countries, including from the EU, North America, Russia and Central Asia. </p><p>  Ireland's Chairmanship of the OSCE has provided us with a unique opportunity to provide leadership in the search for solutions to some of the world's most intractable conflicts.  In sharing our own experience of successful conflict resolution, we have been able to make a tangible contribution to this vital part of the OSCE's work.   We hope that the forthcoming Dublin Ministerial meeting will crown our efforts with a number of important decisions across the full range of OSCE interests and activities.   Our OSCE Chairmanship has necessitated close and sustained engagement with major international players.   I believe that it has served to enhance significantly our international profile and that the benefits of this will endure long beyond our Chairmanship year.</p></reply>

The Good Friday Agreement also recognises the legitimacy of whatever choice is freely exercised by a majority of the people of Northern Ireland with regard to its status, whether they prefer to continue to support the Union with Great Britain or a sovereign united Ireland.  </p><p>  The Agreement further recognises that it is for the people of this island alone to exercise their right of self determination on the basis of consent, freely and concurrently given, North and South, to bring about a united Ireland.</p><p>  The Agreement also commits the Secretary of State to direct the holding of a poll if it appears likely that a majority of those voting would express a wish that Northern Ireland should cease to be part of the UK and form part of a united Ireland.  </p><p>  These conditions do not exist at present and I have not raised the matter with my UK counterparts.  </p><p>  In accordance with the Constitution, the Government is firmly committed to uniting in harmony and friendship all the people who share this island in all their identities and traditions.  </p><p>  This is best achieved through full implementation of the Agreements and through measures to address sectarianism and division in Northern Ireland and to advance reconciliation on the island.  </p><p>  The first meeting of the North South Inter Parliamentary Association on Friday 12 October was another important step in this regard, for which the Ceann Comhairle and the Speaker of the Northern Ireland Assembly, Mr. William Hay MLA, both deserve great credit.</p><p>  The Government also attaches particular importance to ensuring the closest economic co-operation in support of jobs and recovery.

Seven of our nine priority countries are in Sub-Saharan Africa - Tanzania, Zambia, Lesotho, Mozambique, Uganda, Ethiopia and Malawi.    In recent years Ireland and other donors have moved towards a programmatic approach to providing aid, aligned with the national planning of our partner countries.

I briefed the Secretary General on our planning for Ireland&#8217;s upcoming Presidency of the European Union, which will include substantive discussion on the EU&#8217;s approach to the achievement of the MDGs and policy on the post-2015 framework for international development.  My colleague, Minister of State Joe Costello  <font color="#2F2F2F"> T.D., met with UN Deputy General Secretary, Mr. Jan Eliasson, during his visit to the UN earlier in September and had a wide- ranging exchange of views on development issues, including progress on the MDGs.</font></p><p>  The Millennium Development Goals were agreed by world leaders at the United Nations in 2000 as the framework for international development policy up to 2015.  They provide a clearly measurable way to track progress in the fight against global poverty.  The Goals are central to Ireland&#8217;s overseas development programme and to the Government&#8217;s development policy.  </p><p>  At a global level, the UN issues a report each year outlining progress in meeting the MDGs and identifying areas and regions which are lagging behind.  The most recent report was issued in June 2012.  Three of the MDGs have already been reached.  These are the goals of halving the extreme poverty rate, halving the proportion of people without access to clean drinking water and significantly improving the lives of at least 100 million slum dwellers.  In addition, considerable progress has been made in relation to education.  Parity in primary school enrolment for boys and girls has been reached and overall school enrolment rates have increased significantly, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa.  There has been substantial progress in addressing HIV and AIDS , with the number of people in developing countries accessing retroviral therapy increasing from 5.1 million in 2009 to 6.5 million in 2010, the largest year on year increase ever recorded.  However, the global targets on maternal health, access to sanitation and reducing hunger, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, remain well off track.</p><p>  When the EU Development Ministers met in Luxembourg earlier this week, Ireland emphasised the importance of maintaining international efforts to achieve the MDG targets by 2015. </p><p>  An MDG Special Event is scheduled to be held at the UN in New York in September 2013.  It will be a crucial opportunity to review progress at senior intergovernmental level in advance of the 2015 target date. During our EU Presidency in the first half of 2013, Ireland will focus on preparation for these discussions.  In addition to preparing for the Foreign Affairs Council (Development) in May, we will also host an informal meeting of EU Development Ministers in Dublin in February 2013 to ensure the strongest possible EU contribution for this September 2013 Special Event  and to begin substantive discussion on the framework for global development after 2015.</p></reply>

In recent years there have been frequent and substantial new findings of oil and gas in Africa, including in some of the partner countries the Government supports through our development cooperation programme, Irish Aid.    Because of the development challenges that many of the resource-rich African countries still face, and given that many of these resources are non-renewable, it is vital to ensure that revenues generated are fully transparent, are used to improve the lives of the poor and that resources are extracted in a manner that protects the environment. </p><p>  We know and we have seen that the so-called &lsquo;natural resource curse&rsquo; can be avoided with the right institutions and policies, nationally and internationally. There are many important efforts ongoing to support transparency and accountability in that regard. </p><p>Proposals for the revision of the EU Transparency and Accounting Directives are currently being negotiated in Brussels, and the Government is very supportive of the efforts being made to improve transparency among EU multinational companies involved in extractive and logging industries in developing countries. These revised Directives follow on from recent US legislation compelling multinationals based there to publicly report how much they pay governments for access to oil, gas and minerals.   They also complement the Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative (EITI) initiative, which has been developed under the EU-Africa Governance Partnership.</p><p>  Ireland has also been very supportive of efforts by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to promote the accountability, transparency and effective management of natural resources, for example through the recently updated OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. These Guidelines clarify how companies can identify and better manage risks throughout the supply chain, vital in halting the illegal exploitation of natural resources in fragile African states which has been fuelling conflict across the region for decades. </p><p>  Finally, we continue to support efforts at the country level through the strong partnerships that we have built up with Governments, civil society and the private sector in Africa. In this way we are promoting improvements in governance and accountability, the protection and promotion of human rights, and the efficient and effective use of resources, including those derived from domestic revenue sources.</p></reply>

There are particular concerns in the United States where addressing the position of the undocumented Irish and reforming our migration arrangements are priorities for the Government in its contacts with the US Administration and Congress.  The Government&rsquo;s keen interest in a resolution of the situation for undocumented Irish migrants is well recognised and accepted by our contacts within US Administration and Congress. Their advice to us remains that comprehensive reform of the US immigration system and procedures is likely to be the only manner by which this can be achieved. </p><p>  With a view to building some positive momentum around immigration issues, we have focused our efforts on enabling Irish people to apply for E-3 temporary U.S. work visas.  The passage of existing draft legislation by Congress to extend this scheme to Irish citizens would make up to 10,500 E-3 visas available each year.  The level of support achieved to date for this draft legislation among members of Congress is encouraging.  However, further progress will have to await the outcome of the Presidential and Congressional elections in November.</p><p>  Through our Embassy in Washington, the Government will continue to work closely with our friends in Congress and with Irish-American community representatives and ensure that every opportunity is taken to put an E-3 visa scheme in place.  I met with Irish community lobby groups for immigration reform during my visit to New York in September and discussed this issue in some detail with them.  We agreed to continue to work together on this important endeavour.</p></reply>

While fully recognising the importance of freedom of expression, Ireland also recognises the need for respect for all religions or beliefs.  Religious hatred or intolerance cannot be accepted.  We condemn any advocacy of religious hatred that constitutes incitement to hostility and violence.    We recognise the deep feelings and anguish of those who have been gravely offended by the reprehensible contents of the video referred to by the Deputy in his Question. The international community is united in its concern against any serious instances of derogatory stereotyping, negative profiling and stigmatisation of persons based on their religion or belief. </p><p>  Violent attacks on people and property are never justifiable. The United Nations is founded on the principle that diplomatic engagement and dialogue between nations are essential to peace and human development.   Attacks on diplomatic missions, such as we saw recently in Benghazi, are attacks on that principle.  They are never acceptable and must be condemned. </p></reply>

The total value of merchandise exports in 2011 was &euro;91,595m, up 2.4% from 2010, while merchandise imports were valued at &euro;48,286m, up 6% on 2010. This resulted in a merchandise trade surplus of &euro;43,309m. For the first eight months of 2012 merchandise exports amounted to &euro;62,493 million and imports to &euro;32,591 million representing a trade surplus of &euro;29,902 million. Services exports also increased last year, from &euro;74.3bn in 2010 to &euro;81.4bn in 2011.  Below is a table listing total merchandise trade figures for the years 2009 to 2011. As the Deputy will note, the value of this trade increased in 152 of the 223 places listed over the three year period. Total trade with our EU partners increased to &euro;80,432million from &euro;76,737 in 2010.</p><p>While the USA, UK and other EU partners continue to be key markets for Ireland, the Government is also fully committed to developing and expanding engagement with key high potential markets.  The BRICS countries - Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa- are among the 27 priority markets identified in the Government Trade Strategy and, by the end of this year, all five countries will have received Minister- led trade missions in accordance with the programme for 2012.</p><p>In addition, there is also a focus on other emerging markets, such as Turkey and markets in South East Asia and the Gulf.  Furthermore, the Africa Strategy, launched in September 2011, acknowledges the significant progress in terms of economic and social development taking place throughout the continent. It recognises that demand for goods and services is growing from African countries and that Irish-based companies are well placed to play a greater role with the assistance of my Department, our Embassy network and State Agencies.</p><p><table><tr><th>Bilateral Trade - Figures in &#8364;000</th><th><div>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-10-17a.170.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/951" speakername="Eamon Gilmore" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012101700067#WRF01100"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 66 and 67 together.</p><p>  As outlined in my reply to Deputies Martin and Adams yesterday the 16th October 2012 [34339/12 (137), 42928/12 (145) and 42808/12 (151) ], the Government is committed to making Jobs and Growth the central focus and thematic approach to the Irish Presidency. To successfully deliver on that objective we need to tackle the ongoing financial crisis, and restore stability to the Eurozone, but the focus must be on generating growth in the EU economy and getting Europe back to work.  </p><p>  During the Presidency the Government will deliver on its ambitions through a range of policy and legislative measures that cut across a broad range of policy areas which will push forward the growth and jobs agenda.  As an export-driven economy, Ireland has reaped the benefits of the European Single Market, but the global economy has evolved.  One of the aims of the Single Market Act II, which was published by the European Commission on 3 October, will be to respond to changes in the economy, particularly by exploiting the potential of the digital economy for business and consumers.  </p><p>  As Presidency Ireland will work to underpin and stimulate research and innovation across the EU for the coming decade by advancing agreement on the Horizon 2020 framework programme which can play an important role in boosting the EU economy, generating smart and sustainable growth and jobs, and strengthening the Union&rsquo;s global competitiveness.  The Presidency will deliver a major effort in the field of research and innovation with a range of thematic events planned and a commitment to advance decisions on key legislation in this rapidly growing area where the EU can become a global leader.  </p><p>  Ireland will make significant advances in the external trade agenda during its Presidency and will hold a meeting of Trade Ministers in Ireland during the Presidency which will focus on the EU-US trade relationship.  </p><p>  The Presidency will make special efforts to address the problem of youth unemployment across the EU and will work closely with partners to seek solutions to tackle this fundamental challenge.  </p><p>  Europe&rsquo;s economy can only grow if there is stability and confidence in the EU economy.  For this reason, the Irish Presidency will work to ensure the effective implementation of recent economic governance measures, and to make progress on the Banking Union proposals.  The third main priority of the Irish Presidency will be the EU&rsquo;s future budget to underpin growth and to sharpen Europe&rsquo;s global competitiveness.  The Irish Government supports the Cyprus Presidency in its efforts to reach agreement on the MFF and stands ready to take forward the necessary implementing legislation to ensure that the EU has a budget to support programmes that are of major economic importance to Member States such as CAP, CFP and Horizon 2020 (the EU's future framework programme for research and innovation) for the 2014-2020 period.  These programmes can play a key role in spurring economic growth and creating employment.  </p><p>  Work on the Irish Presidency is a top priority across all Departments as the Presidency nears.  The Government met with the College of Commissioners on 3 October in Brussels and the President of the European Parliament also visited Dublin on 3-4 October.  We were pleased with the outcomes of the both meeting which confirmed that there is broad agreement between the Government and partners on the main priorities and objectives that we have identified at this stage of planning for our Presidency.  Issues discussed at the meetings will feed into the drafting of the Presidency programme which will be published in December.  </p></reply>

Settlement construction is not only illegal under international law, but it inherently involves injustice to Palestinians and further erosion of their rights and freedoms. Furthermore, settlement construction undermines the ability of Palestinian leaders to pursue negotiations with Israel, and increasingly makes it difficult for such negotiations to be successful, by making the creation of a viable Palestinian state increasingly hard to achieve on the ground. </p><p>  It is unambiguous EU policy that the relentless construction of settlements in the West Bank (including East Jerusalem) is undermining the viability of a future Palestinian state, and is an obstacle to peace. This is a clear message that Ireland and our EU partners relay to the Israeli authorities at every appropriate opportunity.</p><p>  Recognising that developments on the ground are threatening to make a two-state solution impossible, the Foreign Affairs Council in May adopted Conclusions that restated, and in many respects advanced, EU positions on issues such as the Palestinian depopulation of Area C and evictions and demolitions in East Jerusalem. Many of these issues are part and parcel of the settlement project. I have suggested that the EU will need to revisit this issue in the near future to review developments and ascertain what, if any, measures the EU could adopt that might encourage Israel to halt the expansion of settlements.  The possible exclusion from the EU of settlement products is one option for consideration in that regard. </p><p>  Ultimately, only the achievement of a comprehensive peace agreement will resolve the issues of the occupation and settlements, and the pursuit and support of the Middle East peace process remains a major priority of the EU and the international community, despite the many frustrations this has entailed.</p></reply>

Ireland has made a strong contribution from the outset to the development of this policy.  It has now become broadly accepted by almost all parties as the goal which must be achieved if this conflict is to be settled.   Regrettably, progress towards this goal has been much less satisfactory.</p><p>  The EU acts supportively in a number of ways.  First and foremost, we seek to encourage and press both parties into engaging in serious direct negotiations, because we recognise that this is the only way to reach a comprehensive agreement and to end the occupation.  Frankly, we have been very disappointed by the inability to get talks restarted.  The reasons are complex but primarily there has been little real engagement by the Israeli Government in the process.</p><p>  The EU is also active in relation to specific issues on the ground which we believe are having a negative effect and threaten to make a peace agreement based on a two-state solution impossible to achieve.   The Foreign Affairs Council in May issued strong Conclusions, to which Ireland actively contributed, which highlighted these issues, many of which revolve round Israeli settlement building, and which called for urgent changes in policy.   I am pressing for a follow-up Council discussion within the next couple of months.</p><p>  Finally, on the Palestinian side the EU is the major provider of humanitarian support for refugees and technical support and capacity-building for the Palestinian administration.  Ireland plays an active role in all of these strands of engagement, including through support provided by Irish Aid.&rdquo;</p><p>  Further to that reply, I do not think there is any lack of a forum for the parties to express their grievances, rather the opposite. I know the idea of a secretariat has been suggested occasionally in the Oireachtas, but I have to say that in my meetings with the parties both in the region and elsewhere, no-one has ever suggested this to me. There are already permanent representatives and staffs operating in the field on behalf of the EU, the US, the UN and the Quartet. The problem is not one of a lack of structures, but a lack of political will to use them.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-10-17a.180.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/951" speakername="Eamon Gilmore" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012101700067#WRF01800"><p>As I have previously stated, the human rights situation in Iran is profoundly disturbing, and the period since the Presidential election of 2009 has been characterised by an intensification of human rights abuses on many fronts. Although it is difficult to gain reliable statistics and information on human rights abuses in Iran, there are a number of reputable and thorough sources and reports such as the reports of the UN Rapporteur on Human Rights in Iran through which governments can monitor the human rights situation in Iran. It is clear from these sources that the deterioration of the human rights situation in Iran continues to be a grave concern.   The Iranian authorities continue to deny civil and political rights in Iran, including in relation to freedom of expression and assembly, arbitrary arrest, and torture and other cruel treatment in detention. This highly targeted repression has been particularly stringent against not only academics but also members of Iran&#8217;s religious and ethnic minorities, political activists, journalists and bloggers, human rights defenders and members of the legal profession in Iran who represent clients detained by the authorities. These actions are in clear violation of Iran's international obligations under the International Covenant for Civil and Political Rights, of which Iran is a signatory. I would also condemn the ongoing detention under house arrest of the two leading opposition politicians, Mir Hossein Moussavi and Mehdi Karroubi, who contested the 2009 presidential election against President Ahmadinejad.</p><p>  I am particularly concerned by the overall high level of executions and the widespread practice of executions after unfair trials, without the right of appeal, and for offences which according to international standards should not result in capital punishment. I am also concerned about the continuing imposition of the death penalty against minors in violation of Iran&#8217;s obligations under the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the practice of secret executions in Iran which has been highlighted by the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Iran.</p><p>  The international community continues to speak out against such abuses. EU High Representative Ashton, in statements issued on 21 June and 5 January this year, has expressed her concerns regarding Iran&#8217;s repressive policies towards minorities and the worrying increase in executions contrary to the worldwide trend towards the abolition of the death penalty. I fully support her calls on Iran to abandon discriminatory policies, to halt all pending executions and to introduce a moratorium on the death penalty. In this regard I welcome the decision by the Iranian authorities to acquit and release Pastor Yousef Nadarkhani on 28 September, who was sentenced to death for apostasy and had been detained for three years. </p><p>  The EU has also repeatedly raised human rights issues in contacts with the Iranian authorities and adopted a travel ban and asset freeze against those responsible for grave human rights violations in April last year, further extended to additional persons last October. This sends an important political signal to those in the judicial system and elsewhere in the Iranian regime who perpetrate human rights abuses. I fully support the strong Conclusions on human rights in Iran issued by the Foreign Affairs Council on 10 October last year. Ireland will continue to be active at EU level in pressing for stronger EU action in relation to the human rights situation in Iran. </p><p>At UN level, Ireland co-sponsored a General Assembly resolution in October last year expressing the international community&#8217;s deep concern at the human rights situation in Iran, and calling upon the Government of Iran to take a number of specific and urgent steps to improve the situation, including providing unfettered access to the Special Rapporteur appointed last year to examine Iran&#8217;s human rights situation. <font color="#2F2F2F">On March 22, Ireland co-sponsored the UN </font>Human Rights Council&#8217;s R<font color="#2F2F2F">esolution on </font>Iran<font color="#2F2F2F"> which </font>  welcomed the report and recommendations of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Iran and expressed serious concern at the developments noted in that report as well as the lack of access permitted to the Special Rapporteur. The Council extended the mandate of the Special Rapporteur for one year and called upon Iran to cooperate fully and permit access to the country.</p><p>  At a bilateral level, my Department engages in ongoing dialogue with the Iranian Ambassador and his Embassy on these issues. My officials regularly hold meetings with the Ambassador to convey our grave concerns at the human rights situation in Iran. Ireland will continue to raise human rights in Iran, bilaterally and at the EU and UN, at all appropriate occasions.</p></reply>

Yet we remain conscious of the serious obstacles that must be overcome if Africa is to enjoy a stable and prosperous future.  Ireland attaches high importance to the development of relations with the countries of Africa, to supporting economic and social development and to responding to the needs of people affected by war and natural disasters.  Through our humanitarian and development engagements, Ireland is active in addressing the causes and consequences of conflict and hunger in the continent, and in ensuring that aid workers deployed to deliver assistance and capacity building support in African countries are free to do so without undue interference.  </p><p>  Africa is the main geographic focus for Ireland&rsquo;s development cooperation programme, with 80 per cent of the aid budget devoted to the objective of ending extreme poverty and hunger, especially in the poorest countries of sub-Saharan Africa.  Our missions in Africa monitor developments, report to the Government, and manage our political and economic relations and humanitarian and development programmes.  Ireland also has excellent relations with its NGO partners which are a direct and reliable source of information regarding the level of humanitarian risk African countries face at any particular time.  My Department regularly reviews these various sources of information and ensures that key messages are given voice at an international level where the opportunity arises. </p><p>  In the Horn of Africa, a year on from the devastating famine which resulted in the deaths of many  thousands of people, the humanitarian situation remains extremely fragile.  The region was affected by one of the worst droughts in decades, where an estimated 12.4 million people were reported to be in urgent need of food.  While a huge relief effort, followed by good rains last autumn, saved hundreds of thousands of lives, the crisis forced many more from their homes, devastated their livelihoods and left them vulnerable to future hunger shocks.  At present the total number of food insecure people in the Horn of Africa is approximately 8 million people, with the majority of those in need of humanitarian assistance in Somalia.</p><p>  Ireland will chair the Council Working Party on Humanitarian Aid and Food Assistance during our EU Presidency in the first half of 2013.  We will continue to engage actively in pushing for a strongly coordinated approach to the humanitarian requirements in the Horn.  </p><p>  I recognise the skilled and often courageous work undertaken by Ireland&rsquo;s aid workers. They work in environments of food insecurity, poverty, protracted conflict, environmental degradation, weak government capacity, severe infrastructural weaknesses and poor governance. During my visit to Somalia last July I witnessed at first hand the excellent work being carried out on the ground.  Supporting democratic change across Africa is helping to improve the conditions in which Irish aid workers operate. Our national approach in the continent is guided by the Africa Strategy of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, which was launched in September 2011.  It sets out a framework for our policies in the political, development and economic areas in order to ensure that our engagement is as comprehensive, coherent and effective as possible.  A fundamental principle of our approach is an emphasis on the promotion of political progress including the resolution of conflict, the strengthening of democracy, and respect for human rights and the rule of law.</p><p>  Africa faces many challenges. Nevertheless, the continent is showing real progress towards sustainable change. In order to maintain this positive momentum and avoid losing the positive gains from development investment over the years, Ireland will continue to work in partnership with African countries to respond quickly to humanitarian challenges when they occur.</p></reply>

I refer the Deputy to my previous reply on 11 July. Since then, on 29 August, Ms. Tymoshenko&rsquo;s appeal against her conviction was rejected by Ukraine&rsquo;s High Specialised Court.  This was a very disappointing outcome.  Indeed, the EU has made it clear that further progress towards the signature and ratification of its Association Agreement with Ukraine would require a number of positive steps on the resolution of the issue of politically motivated trials and convictions, including that of Ms. Tymoshenko, as well as the fair and transparent conduct of the parliamentary elections taking place on 28 October.  I fully support this position.  It is a matter of regret that Ms. Tymoshenko and others will not be permitted to take part in the elections.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that Ms. Tymoshenko has been visited by a wide range of international contacts, although a visit proposed by the Vice-President of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly was recently denied.  I would continue to urge the Ukrainian authorities, as a minimum, to facilitate such visits as well as all medical and human rights related visits.  I made the concerns of the Irish Government on this known to Ukraine&rsquo;s Foreign Minister Gryshchenko when we met recently at the UN General Assembly. </p></reply>

Human rights concerns remain central to our foreign policy.  With its EU partners, Ireland closely monitors the human rights situations in many countries, including post-conflict countries, throughout the world.   We do this on the basis of information obtained from a variety of sources, including both official channels and non-governmental/civil society organisations.  Where and when the situation warrants, we make known our concerns about human rights violations to the Governments in question.</p><p>  Ireland supports the use of the full UN human rights machinery in responding to human rights abuses, including supporting the role of UN Human Rights Treaty Monitoring Bodies, Special Procedures and Mandate Holders and the convening, where appropriate, of Special Sessions of the UN Human Rights Council.  At the UN, the EU regularly makes statements on the human rights situations in a number of countries from all regions.  Ireland is fully associated with these statements.</p><p>  Ireland has been a consistent and strong supporter of the International Criminal Court, recognising it as an essential means of combating impunity for the most serious violations of international humanitarian law and human rights law.</p><p>  The Government is committed to the promotion of full observance of universal human rights standards.  Active participation in multilateral organisations including the EU, UN and the Council of Europe provides an opportunity for Ireland to voice its concerns regarding human rights abuses.  Through these organisations, international pressure can be brought to bear on those responsible for violation of human rights.  Ireland will continue to use these mechanisms as a means of highlighting violations of human rights and furthering their protection.</p></reply>

I have repeatedly condemned the unacceptable human rights violations and brutality which are now estimated to have claimed well over 20,000 lives since the conflict first erupted in March 2011.    There is no doubting the widespread international revulsion generated by the conflict over the last 20 months and in particular by the violence and killings associated with the repressive actions of the Syrian regime.  The international community has been prompt to express its indignation and to compel the Syrian regime to change course, notably through the adoption of a series of resolutions on the human rights situation in Syria by the UN General Assembly Resolution in February and by the UN Human Rights Council, in March, June and September. </p><p>  The UN Human Rights Council has also initiated a process of inquiry through the establishment in August 2011 of the UN Independent International Commission of Inquiry.  Mandated to investigate all alleged violations of international human rights law in Syria since the beginning of the conflict, and, where possible, to identify those responsible, the Commission, in its 15 August 2012 report, concludes that Government forces and its affiliated militia have committed crimes against humanity, war crimes and gross violations of human rights, all pursuant to a State policy. The report also found reasonable grounds to believe that serious abuses had been committed by anti-Government armed groups, although these did not reach the gravity, frequency and scale of violations committed by Government forces. This report may well pave the way for the situation in Syria to eventually be referred to the International Criminal Court (ICC), a course called for by UN Human Rights Commissioner Pillay and which Ireland has long supported. We are also highly supportive of efforts underway at the UN that aim at building up cross-regional support for formal referral to the ICC by the UN Security Council.  </p><p>  The European Union has, of course, also reacted to the human rights violations in Syria.  It has adopted a series of robust economic, political and diplomatic measures to compel the Syrian regime to cease its reprehensible attacks against its own people.  While actively supporting the efforts of the UN/Arab League Joint Special Representative Ladhkar Brahimi to achieve a ceasefire and mediate some sort of peaceful settlement, the EU has continued to impose tough sanctions targeted on the Assad regime and those who support the repression.  Last Monday&rsquo;s Foreign Affairs Council which I attended adopted additional restrictive measures to step up the pressure on the Syrian regime to change course and halt its unacceptable violence and repression. </p><p>  In saying all this, we must also acknowledge that the current paralysis of the international community is a major impediment to stopping the daily abuses suffered by ordinary Syrians. The UN Security Council need to step up to its responsibilities and give a lead in the international community&rsquo;s efforts to halt the violence. Ireland, for its part, will continue to call for a strong UN Chapter VII resolution that would impose robust sanctions and notably a comprehensive arms embargo which is now long overdue in the current circumstances prevailing in Syria. </p><p>  Ultimately, such a Resolution and united action on the part of the Security Council represents the best opportunity for ending the conflict and ongoing human rights violations and setting in train a process of urgently needed political reform and transition in Syria.  Ireland and its EU partners will continue to work steadfastly in support of this aim.</p></reply>

Requirements for less than that amount may be awarded by unadvertised selective tender whereby a number of suitably qualified service providers are asked to submit competitive quotes.</p><p>The information requested by the Deputy for the years in question is set out in the following tables.</p><p><b>Table 1: Consultancy Expenditure 2008-2012(YTD) </b></p><p><table><tr><th><b><font face="Times New Roman">Year </font></b></th><th><b><font face="Times New Roman">Vote 27 Consultancy Expenditure </font></b></th><th><b><font face="Times New Roman">Vote 27 Number of Consultants </font></b></th><th><b><font face="Times New Roman">Vote 28 Consultancy Expenditure </font></b></th><th><b><font face="Times New Roman">Vote 28 Number of Consultants </font></b></th></tr><tr><td><font face="Times New Roman">2008 </font></td><td><font face="Times New Roman">&#8364;4,429,056 </font></td><td><font face="Times New Roman">87 </font></td><td><font face="Times New Roman">&#8364;243,738 </font></td><td><font face="Times New Roman">11 </font></td></tr><tr><td><font face="Times New Roman">2009 </font></td><td><font face="Times New Roman">&#8364;1,427,091 </font></td><td><font face="Times New Roman">50 </font></td><td><font face="Times New Roman">&#8364;58,425 </font></td><td><font face="Times New Roman">3 </font></td></tr><tr><td><font face="Times New Roman">2010 </font></td><td><font face="Times New Roman">&#8364;1,494,615 </font></td><td><font face="Times New Roman">50 </font></td><td><font face="Times New Roman">&#8364;66,645 </font></td><td><font face="Times New Roman">2 </font></td></tr><tr><td><font face="Times New Roman">2011 </font></td><td><font face="Times New Roman">&#8364;1,778,499 </font></td><td><font face="Times New Roman">45 </font></td><td><font face="Times New Roman">&#8364;25, 878 </font></td><td><font face="Times New Roman">3 </font></td></tr><tr><td><font face="Times New Roman">2012 YTD </font></td><td><font face="Times New Roman">&#8364;982,060 </font></td><td><font face="Times New Roman">53 </font></td><td><font face="Times New Roman">&#8364;2,000 </font></td><td><font face="Times New Roman">1 </font></td></tr></table></p><p><b>Table 2 Details: Vote 28 (Foreign Affairs</b></p><p><b>2008 </b></p><p><table><tr><th><font face="Times New Roman">Name of Consultant </font></th><th><font face="Times New Roman">Nature of Work </font></th><th><font face="Times New Roman">Fees Paid (&#8364;) </font></th></tr><tr><td><font face="Times New Roman">Art Agnew </font></td><td><font face="Times New Roman">Human resources </font></td><td><font face="Times New Roman">691 </font></td></tr><tr><td><font face="Times New Roman">Bianconi Research Ltd.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-10-17a.207.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/951" speakername="Eamon Gilmore" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012101700068#WRH00300"><p>There are many automatic border control machine systems in operation around the world with different criteria required to use these machines.  Some systems operate on the basis of a trusted traveller programme where pre-registration is required.  Others incorporate pre-registration with other requirements.  In the case of US Global Entry, access is limited to US citizens, lawful permanent residents, Dutch citizens, South Korean citizens and Mexican nationals.  A further series of systems operates on the basis of biometric technology.  IRIS in Britain makes use of the fact that the pattern of the iris in each person's eye is unique.  A registered passenger looks into a special camera at the IRIS barrier in the immigration arrival hall and the system compares his or her iris pattern with others stored in a secure database.  Another series of systems works by using facial recognition technology to compare a person's face to the photograph recorded on the chip in his or her e-passport.  Over the past year, the UK Border Agency has installed ePassport gates at London Heathrow, London Gatwick, Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff, East Midlands, Luton, Manchester and Stansted.  Irish ePassports meet the current criteria to use the ePassport gates in the UK.  ePassports have been issued in Ireland since October 2006 and are distinguished by a chip symbol which appears at the bottom of the front cover of the passport book.</p></reply>

Irish VAT law is guided by the EU VAT Directive, with which it must comply, and this provision mirrors Article 132, paragraph 1(i) of the VAT Directive, which provides that EU Member States must exempt from VAT such education.  VAT exemption in this context means that schools do not charge VAT on the services they supply but cannot recover VAT on the goods and services that they purchase.  As such, schools cannot claim back the VAT paid by them for service utilities or service charges.  VAT law relates to particular goods and services.  In this respect, the VAT exemption for education must apply to all providers of school education.  It is not possible to distinguish between the various forms of school providing that education.  As it is not possible under Irish or EU VAT law to exempt schools from paying VAT on their inputs, the various costings outlined in the Deputy&rsquo;s questions cannot be provided.  However, I would point out that a 0% VAT rate applies to the supply of books and as such there is no VAT charged on school text books being purchased by schools.</p></reply>

This will serve to broaden the tax base and increase betting duty receipts.   The Finance Act 2011 provides for the taxation of bets that remote bookmakers enter into with persons in the State. This means, for example, that a business which engages in online bookmaking and which accepts bets from people in this country will be liable for betting duty on those bets, irrespective of where that business is based. The existing betting duty (1%) will be applied to such bets. The Finance Act also provides for the taxation of Betting Exchanges under the new arrangements; however the calculation of the tax will take account of their particular business model, in other words a 15% tax on the commission charged. In addition, excise duties are being applied to the granting and renewal of remote bookmakers&rsquo; and remote betting intermediaries&rsquo; licences. </p><p>  The Betting (Amendment) Bill, which was published in July, will establish the regulatory framework for these licences. The tax changes provided for in the Finance Act can only be implemented once the Betting (Amendment) Bill is enacted. </p></reply>

Intensive discussions were held with our European partners and particularly President Trichet of the ECB in the run-up to the announcement of our stress tests on 31st March last year. At that time the President believed that such action was not in the interests of Ireland or the Euro Area. This matter was discussed again with President Trichet on a number of occasions including the Ecofin meeting in Poland in September 2011.

As is noted in the correspondence supplied by the Deputy, there is already a strong focus on cash businesses, given their potential high-risk nature.  Revenue uses a wide range of methodologies to identify those who under-declare their income and/or are operating in the shadow/hidden economy, and deploys the full range of compliance interventions to tackle those risks. Activities undertaken can include covert surveillance, cold calls to businesses and venues as well as pre-arranged aspect queries on specific items.  I am further advised by the Commissioners that regarding the retail and wholesale motor vehicle parts and accessories sector, 17 Audits have been carried out so far in 2012, yielding &euro;331,165.  In 2011, 37 audits were carried out in this sector, yielding  &euro;483,070. These statistics are compiled from Revenue&rsquo;s records and I am informed that for the purpose of their records, the motor vehicle parts and accessories sector includes the tyre distributor industry.</p><p>  Revenue holds meetings with trade and representative bodies nationally and locally through the Hidden Economy Monitoring Group where the risks posed by shadow/hidden economy activities are discussed.  Furthermore, Revenue encourages anyone who has specific information regarding any business that is engaged in tax evasion, to submit the details to their local Revenue office. </p><p>  The Commissioners also advise that their tax and duty compliance programmes are under constant review to ensure that they are focussed on the areas of greatest risk, including risks from the shadow/hidden economy.  </p><p>  Lastly, regarding VAT registration, the Deputy should be aware that a trader supplying goods is not required to register for VAT unless their annual turnover exceeds &euro;75,000.</p></reply>

However, I wish to advise the Deputy that, under section 291A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, a company can claim allowances for capital expenditure incurred on the provision of intangible assets for the purposes of its trade. These allowances apply to expenditure on a broad range of assets (e.g. patents, copyright, trademarks, know-how) that are recognised as intangible assets under generally accepted accounting practice.  The allowances, in providing relief for this expenditure, are intended to encourage companies to manage and develop the intellectual assets of their business. </p><p>  Allowances for an accounting period are computed by reference to the amount charged to the profit and loss account in respect of amortisation of the intangible asset relative to its cost. Companies can alternatively opt for a write-down of expenditure over 15 years at a rate of 7 per cent per annum and 2 per cent in the final year. As the expenditures concerned - and, accordingly, the allowances - can be for very substantial amounts, the set-off of the allowances against the related income is restricted. In particular, the aggregate amount of allowances and deductible interest on borrowings, if any, in respect of intangible assets may not exceed 80% of trading income (before the set-off of allowances and any such interest) related to those intangible assets. This ensures that at least 20% of the relevant income will continue to be chargeable to corporation tax in an accounting period. Any unused allowances and interest can be carried forward to subsequent accounting periods for offset against trading income related to the intangible assets (subject to the 80% restriction)  .</p></reply>

Because of the significant amount of relief from both VRT and VAT available to purchasers of vehicles under the Disabled Drivers and Passengers scheme, it is appropriate that vehicles provided under this scheme should be provided by authorised dealers to facilitate the monitoring of various elements of the scheme.</p><p>  The Deputy may also wish to note that comprehensive information relating to the relief scheme is available on the Revenue website </p><p>(<i><font color="#0000FF"></font></i>   ).</p></reply>

Accordingly, any insurance recovery in respect of damage to that car is a disposal /part disposal for capital gains tax purposes.  Where the car is damaged (but not a write-off) and the entire insurance monies (or all but an amount not reasonably required) are used to restore the car, the taxpayer can claim to have the proceeds not treated as a disposal at the time, in effect the gain (if any) is deferred pending the ultimate disposal of the car.  Where a car used for the purposes of a trade or profession is written-off and the insurance proceeds are used to acquire another car, the taxpayer can similarly claim to defer any capital gains tax on the gain (if any) that arises.  It is not readily possible to provide details of such claims.  Where the proceeds of an insurance recovery are not used, as above, to repair/replace the car then the gain (if any) would be chargeable, subject to the annual exemption of &euro;1,270 provided for in the capital gains tax code in the case of gains made by individuals.</p><p>  A car used exclusively for private purposes is not a chargeable asset for capital gains tax purposes &ndash; it being regarded as a wasting asset.

Insurance and reinsurance transactions, that is premium payments and insurance proceeds, are exempt from VAT.  Therefore, there is no outstanding VAT liability on monies paid by insurers directly to those insured for the cost of repairs since the trader supplying the repair services is liable to account for the VAT.</p></reply>

At the core of all arrangements is reliance upon capitation as the principal determinant of funding.  My Department provides funding to Community and Comprehensive schools on a budget basis that is based mainly on pupil numbers, but also take into account additional factors which vary from school to school such as age of buildings, size of school etc.</p><p>  With regard to the VEC sector financial allocations are made to VECs as part of a block grant. VECs are given a high level of autonomy in the management and appropriation of this grant and each is allowed to distribute its allocations in line with its priorities and perceptions of need.  My Department provides funding to voluntary secondary schools by way of per capita grants.  The Deputy may wish to note that Circular 48/2009 clarifies issues relating to the allocation of funding to voluntary secondary schools.  The circular states that capitation funding provided for general running costs and funding provided for caretaking and secretarial services may be regarded as a common grant which the Board of Management can allocate according to its own priorities.  I have no plans to amend the present capitation funding arrangements.</p></reply>

This decision to phase out post-primary education was taken by the Trustees in the context of demographic changes in the area and because the school has experienced a steady decline in student numbers in recent years. Current enrolments in feeder primary schools indicate that this decline will not be reversed. With such a decline in numbers, the Trustees considered that it would be difficult for the school to offer a broad and balanced post primary curriculum. My Department has concurred with the Trustee's decision .   In communicating the decision to phase out post-primary provision, commencing in September 2013 and concluding in June 2015, in the school concerned, the Trustees have indicated that the school will assist parents in exploring alternative school places, where appropriate, for their children over that period.  The National Educational Welfare Board can also assist parents in securing school places for their children.</p></reply>

The appointment of officers to undertake work on the revaluation programme is provided for under section 19(2) and the appointment of officers to undertake the revision of the valuation lists is provided for under section 28(2).  These officers are not appointed to or assigned to local authorities who have no function in the organisation of their work programme. The officers, so appointed, carry out the valuation work under the Commissioner&rsquo;s direction and, for the duration of their appointments, remain within the Commissioner&rsquo;s jurisdiction.</p><p>  One of the key motivations for the Valuation (Amendment) Bill, which had its second stage reading in the Seanad on 11th October, 2012 is the need to speed up the revaluation programme. Towards this end, a number of initiatives are planned such as the piloting of a self-assessment scheme of valuation in one local authority area, which if it proves successful could be extended to other areas. There is also provision in the Bill to allow for the assessment of valuations by contract valuers under an external service delivery scheme which is also to be initiated by a pilot project and which if  successful, can be further employed as the Commissioner decides. </p></reply>

The Office of Public Works (OPW) which is responsible for the adjoining St. Endas Park at Rathfarnham, would greatly prefer it if the recycling facility in question was relocated as its general appearance distracts considerably from the entrance to St. Endas.  OPW has engaged with South Dublin County Council in the matter and will continue to do so in an effort to find an equitable solution.</p></reply>

Whether such a study would produce meaningful financial information is debatable. The cost of answering a Parliamentary Question and indeed the time taken to answer all questions will vary considerably according to the nature of the question asked. This would inevitably result in significant differences in the costs among Departments and indeed within a Department from time to time.</p><p>  No staff in my Department are assigned full time to dealing with Parliamentary Questions. Parliamentary Questions are dealt with, as the need arises, by the staff in the sections dealing with the particular issue(s) raised in individual Parliamentary Questions. The number and level of staff and the time spent on an individual answer depends on the complexity and importance of the issue raised the form in which the information exists in the Department and the form of the proposed response, i.e. whether oral or written. Since my own Department was established in 2011 and to date in 2012 I have responded to some 1,600 Parliamentary Questions.  Undoubtedly a considerable amount of time is spent answering all these questions however it is not possible to quantify the cost for the reasons outlined above. </p><p>  As the processing of individual Parliamentary Questions is undertaken as part of the normal day to day work of individual sections within Departments it would be unnecessarily burdensome to isolate the administrative costs of processing Parliamentary Questions from the overall administrative costs of each Department.  <i></i></p><p>  It may be of interest to the Deputy to learn that my Department is currently exploring a range of options with a view to securing process improvement and time savings in responding to PQs.</p></reply>

Occasionally, legal advice is urgently required from a person who is known to have expertise in a particular area and is familiar with the work of the Office.  In such cases, Counsel is directly engaged under the DPA arrangements.</p><p><bu>Office of Public Works (OPW)</bu></p><p>The Office of Public Works uses the services of the Office of the Attorney General and the Office of the Chief State Solicitor (CSSO) for legal advice.  I would further advise that all procurement of external counsel by the CSSO, on behalf of the OPW, was handled by that Office, upon the nomination of the Attorney General.</p><p>For areas which the CSSO did not have the necessary expertise, OPW entered into a service level agreement with the CSSO in 2005, which negotiates rates with a number of legal firms for the provision of legal advice.  Eight panels were formed in areas where such specialised legal expertise was identified as being required, and a panel of solicitors created for each area.</p><p>The costs associated with the provision of advice to the OPW by the Office of the Attorney General and the office of the Chief State Solicitor are borne by their respective Votes.</p><p>The table below outlines the legal services procured by OPW in the period 2008-to date in 2012.</p><p><table><tr><th><b>Advisor</b></th><th><b>2008</b></th><th><b>2009</b></th><th><b>2010</b></th><th><b>2011</b></th><th><b>2012</b></th><th><b>Reason</b></th></tr><tr><td><b></b><br /><br /><b>McCann Fitzgerald  Solrs</b><br /><br /><b></b><br /><br /><b></b><br /><br /><b></b><br /><br /><b></b><br /><br /><b></b><br /><br /><b></b><br /><br /><b></b></td><td><b></b><br /><br /><b>175,195.28</b><br /><br /><b></b><br /><br /><b></b><br /><br /><b>14,860.20       </b><br /><br /><b></b><br /><br /><b></b><br /><br /><b></b><br /><br /><b>605.00</b><br /><br /><b></b><br /><br /><b>18,266.56</b><br /><br /><b></b><br /><br /><b></b></td><td><b></b><br /><br /><b>133,571.89</b><br /><br /><b></b><br /><br /><b></b><br /><br /><b>112,403.18</b><br /><br /><b>    </b><br /><br /><b></b><br /><br /><b></b><br /><br /><b>  2,673.00</b><br /><br /><b>   </b><br /><br /><b>  27,975.37</b><br /><br /><b>    </b></td><td><b></b><br /><br /><b>   5,638.60</b><br /><br /><b></b><br /><br /><b></b><br /><br /><b>65,710.66</b><br /><br /><b></b><br /><br /><b></b><br /><br /><b></b><br /><br /><b></b><br /><br /><b></b></td><td><b></b><br /><br /><b>39,494.82</b><br /><br /><b></b><br /><br /><b></b><br /><br /><b>51,456.88</b><br /><br /><b></b><br /><br /><b></b><br /><br /><b></b><br /><br /><b></b><br /><br /><b></b><br /><br /><b>12,411.02</b><br /><br /><b></b><br /><br /><b></b></td><td><b></b><br /><br /><b>21,832.57</b><br /><br /><b></b><br /><br /><b></b><br /><br /><b>26,301.99</b><br /><br /><b></b><br /><br /><b></b><br /><br /><b></b><br /><br /><b></b><br /><br /><b></b><br /><br /><b>9,098.62</b><br /><br /><b></b><br /><br /><b>9,069.33</b></td><td><b></b><br /><br /><b>Decentralisation Programme</b><br /><br /><b></b><br /><br /><b></b><br /><br /><b>National Conference Centre</b><br /><br /><b></b><br /><br /><b>Engineering Services</b><br /><br /><b></b><br /><br /><b>Project Advice </b><br /><br /><b></b><br /><br /><b>Property Maintenance Advice</b></td></tr><tr><td><b></b><br /><br /><b>Beauchamp Solrs</b></td><td><b></b><br /><br /><b></b><br /><br /><b> 2,398.22</b><br /><br /><b></b></td><td><b></b><br /><br /><b></b><br /><br /><b></b><br /><br /><b></b><br /><br /><b>2,590.61</b></td><td><b></b><br /><br /><b></b><br /><br /><b></b><br /><br /><b></b></td><td><b></b><br /><br /><b></b><br /><br /><b></b><br /><br /><b></b><br /><br /><b></b><br /><br /><b></b><br /><br /><b>4,963.32</b></td><td><b></b><br /><br /><b></b><br /><br /><b></b><br /><br /><b></b><br /><br /><b>3,450.59</b><br /><br /><b></b><br /><br /><b></b><br /><br /><b></b><br /><br /><b>16,184.76</b></td><td><b></b><br /><br /><b></b><br /><br /><b>Procurement Advice</b><br /><br /><b></b><br /><br /><b>Personnel Advice</b><br /><br /><b></b><br /><br /><b>Historic Properties</b><br /><br /><b></b><br /><br /><b>Property Maintenance Advice</b><br /><br /><b></b></td></tr><tr><td><b></b><br /><br /><b>William Fry Solrs</b></td><td><b></b><br /><br /><b>11,885.40</b></td><td><b></b><br /><br /><b></b><br /><br /><b></b><br /><br /><b></b></td><td><b></b></td><td><b></b></td><td><b></b></td><td><b></b><br /><br /><b>Project &amp;

The obligation on me as a Minister is to declare my interests which I have done.  These interests are well known.  The situation where a Minister might be required to step aside from a decision making process is set out by the Guidelines for Office Holders prepared by the Standards in Public Office Commission.</p><p>  Accusations against any business of breach of competition law is matter for the Competition Authority and I have no function in this matter.  The Competition Authority is the statutory body responsible for the enforcement of competition law in the State.  Section 29 (3) of the Competition Act 2002 provides that the Authority is independent in the performance of its functions.  Under section 30(1)(b) of that Act, the Competition Authority is responsible for investigating alleged breaches of the Act.  Investigations and enforcement matters generally are part of the day-to-day operational work of the Authority and I have no direct function in these matters.  </p><p>  Separately, under section 30 subsection (1) of the 2002 Act, the Authority can study and analyse any practice or method of competition affecting the supply and distribution of goods or the provision of services or any other matter relating to competition.  Availing of this provision the Authority has carried out a number of in-depth market studies in various sectors of the economy including professions, banking, transport, private health insurance and the grocery sector.  The Authority has published its reports into these sectors and made recommendations aimed at improving competition in these areas.  This work which is often referred to as a market study generally involves a detailed economic analysis of a sector in its entirety. </p><p>  Under section 30 subsection (2), I, as Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, can request the Competition Authority to carry out a study or analysis of any practice or method of competition affecting the supply and distribution of goods or the provision of services.  Such a request however is not a request to carry out an investigation into alleged criminal behaviour.  One exercise involves an in-depth economic analysis of a market; the other involves a criminal investigation into alleged breaches of the law.</p><p>  In its 2011 Annual Report the Competition Authority acknowledges that allegations of anti-competitive activities in the concrete and cement industries are being investigated by it on foot of information received.  Furthermore, I understand court cases are ongoing in relation to these matters.

Social welfare fraud undermines public confidence in the entire system as well as being unfair to other recipients of social welfare payments and taxpayers.</p><p>For 2012, my Department has a target of reviewing 985,000 individual welfare claims and achieving &euro;645 million in control savings. Up to the end of August 2012, some &euro;456 million in estimated control savings has been reported and over 821,000 reviews have been carried out.

They do not include any cases of departmental error or any cases where the customer voluntarily told the Department of a change in their means or circumstances, which resulted in an adjustment to their rate of payment.  Control savings are not actual monies recovered by the Department but are a good indication of the increase in social welfare expenditure that would occur without these activities taking place.  These activities also have a deterrent or knock-on effect, which are not readily quantifiable in monetary terms.  Control savings are used as a performance indicator for year-on-year activities.</p><p>My Department is very conscious of its obligation to protect public money and is determined to ensure that abuse of the system is prevented and is dealt with effectively when detected.</p></reply>

As part of this broader review process the scheme criteria were widened to include One Parent Family Payment and Disability Allowance recipients who have been eligible to participate on JobBridge as of the 28<sup>th</sup> May 2012.</p><p>  Currently, the JobBridge Scheme requires that an internship should not be part of a training contract (e.g. as part of a training course for a professional qualification from the Law Society or one of the Accountancy Bodies or Architects). In addition, the programme currently limits access to full time third level education during the time they are with the host organisation.  </p><p>  The rationale behind this approach is that such training contracts with professional bodies come with terms and conditions including remuneration. In such circumstances, it is not appropriate to use an initiative such as the JobBridge scheme when training contracts are in place.  </p><p>  However, it must also be articulated that the Scheme is open to Host Organisations to provide internship opportunities for qualified architects. Furthermore, I can advise that existing terms and conditions of the Scheme including eligibility criteria will be re-examined as part of the independent evaluation of the Scheme currently being undertaken by Indecon International Economic Consultants. </p><p>  This evaluation will assess the design, delivery and impact of the JobBridge Scheme, it will provide details of the nature of the work experience of the participants; a measurement of the relevance of that experience to the labour market and progression into employment. When published the report will also present recommendations on how the Scheme might be improved. It is at this stage that further consideration will be given to amending the terms and conditions of the Scheme.</p><p>  It is worth noting that there are eight architect internship vacancies currently advertised on the JobBridge website <i></i>.  </p></reply>

It is intended to submit proposals on school-age childcare to Government for their consideration.  </p><p>Officials in the Department have also met with some of the representative groups to discuss a number of issuing affecting lone parents including their initial views in relation to childcare.

Given the scale of the fiscal crisis and because spending on social protection accounts for nearly 40% of current Government expenditure, you will appreciate that savings have to be found in the social welfare system.</p><p>  As social structures in Ireland are changing rapidly, the structures of our social support need to change to accommodate this and the changes to State pension have been made in the context of changing demographics and the fact that people are living longer and healthier lives. This has obvious and significant implications in relation to the future costs of State pension provision given that the period for which a pension will be paid will be greater than the current time period.  </p><p>  In addition to the budgetary imperative, there is an important long-term policy context for the proposed changes to State pension, which includes reform of pension rate bands and gradual increases in age of retirement for State pension There are currently six people of working age for every pensioner and this ratio is expected to decrease to approximately two to one by 2050.  Therefore, the task of financing increasing pensions will fall to a diminishing share of the population.</p><p>  The State pension is a very valuable benefit. Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  Recent changes to State pension supports the direct link between contributions made and the rate of pension received which underpins State pension policy.  By aligning the rate of pension paid with the contribution made ensures that those who contribute more during a working life benefit more in retirement than those with lesser contributions.  </p><p>  The change in relation to State pension (contributory) introduced in legislation from 1st  September 2012 set out a wider graduation of yearly average bands and corresponding pension rates. The aim of this change is to ensure that the rate of pension entitlement is more closely related to the level of social insurance contributions a person has paid (including credited contributions, where applicable) over their working lives. </p><p>  Overall, there are currently 308,752 State pension (contributory) claims in payment, at maximum and reduced rates. Of this number, there are 107,549 State pension (contributory) claims in payment at a reduced rate, where the claimants have a contributions yearly average of between 10 and 47. Everyone in receipt of a State pension (contributory) has a contributions yearly average of at least ten paid contributions as this is one of the qualifying criteria.</p><p>  The changes introduced from 1  September 2012 only affected those who qualified for State pension (contributory) after that date and who had an average of between 10 and 39 contributions per year. The maximum rate of pension remains unchanged and the rate payable to people with an average of between 40 and 47 contributions per year also remains unchanged.  However, those who have fewer contributions will receive a lower rate of pension.  This change moves somewhat closer to the total contribution approach where those who pay more, benefit more. Since 1 September 2012, 1,800 claimants have been awarded a pension below the 98 per cent maximum rate.</p><p>  It is important in assessing any rates of payment that we focus on the real impact of social welfare payments. In this regard, it should be noted that older people do not experience the levels of poverty that existed in the past. This can be clearly seen in a wide range of data such as the significant reduction in the &lsquo;risk of poverty&rsquo; rate from 27.1% in 2004 to 9.6% in 2010. The consistent poverty rate over the same period also declined from 3.9% to 0.9%.</p></reply>

Jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit is based on a person&rsquo;s social insurance record and jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance is based on weekly means. A fundamental qualifying condition for a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment is that a person must be available for full-time work.</p><p>  Under EU Regulations, in certain circumstances a person on jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit may retain payment for a period of up to 13 weeks, while seeking work in another EU Member State. However, it is not possible to transfer jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance in the same way.  Jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance is listed by EU Regulation 883/2004 as a special non-contributory cash benefit and, as a result, it is paid &ldquo;exclusively in the Member State in which the persons concerned reside, in accordance with its legislation&rdquo;.  A jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance customer, to retain his or her payment, is therefore required to remain in the State. </p><p>  Locally, however, arrangements may be made between a local office and a person on jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, permitting the person to travel abroad for a job interview or a short holiday.</p><p>  A person who travels abroad to take up a job offer would not be entitled to jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance as they would not be available for full time work and would not be resident in the State. Additionally, there are no plans to introduce an assistance payment for persons who wish to go abroad to take up a job offer.</p></reply>

The Act gives primary responsibility to planning authorities to identify and protect the architectural heritage, including thatched buildings, by including them on the Record of Protected Structures. Inclusion on the Record of Protected Structures places a duty of care on the owners and occupiers of protected structures and also gives planning authorities powers to deal with development proposals affecting them and to seek to safeguard their future. In the first instance, therefore, the owner of a thatched property should refer to the relevant local authority to ascertain if the property is included in the Record of Protected Structures.</p><p>  My Department, with the assistance of an Expert Advisory Committee representing key stakeholders, is currently concluding a review of the operation of Part IV of the Planning and Development Acts 2000-2012. The review will consider the need, in the light of current economic circumstances, for alternative ways of supporting the conservation of protected structures.</p><p>  While the overall number of thatched roofs declined in the second half of the 20th century, increased legislative protection for the architectural heritage and heightened awareness of this part of our national heritage has meant that this decline has stabilised.</p><p>There are a number of State financial supports currently available to owners/occupiers of thatched structures. In 2012 my Department is providing &#8364;500,000 in grant-aid assistance through a <i>Structures at Risk Fund</i> administered by local authorities to assist with works to safeguard structures protected under the Planning and Development Acts 2000-2012 and, in certain cases, works to structures within Architectural Conservation Areas. I have approved offers of funding for the conservation of two thatched structures in 2012 under this scheme, which is administered by the local authorities. The closing date for applications for 2012 has now passed.</p><p>  The Heritage Council, which is funded by my Department, also administers a Heritage Management Grant Scheme under which applications for the conservation of thatched structures are considered. However, I understand that the closing date for applications for this scheme for 2012 has also passed.</p><p>In partnership with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Heritage Council also administers a grants scheme to REPS 4 participants on the conservation and repair of traditional farm buildings called the <i>Traditional Farm Buildings Grant Scheme,</i> which is now open for applications. Grants are available under this scheme to carry out approved conservation works to the exterior of farm outbuildings, including roofs.</p><p>  I further understand that the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government administers a grant scheme for the renewal or repair of thatched roofs of owner-occupied houses.</p><p>  The level of funding available in 2013 and future years for these schemes will be subject to the normal Budgetary and Estimates processes. As the Deputy can appreciate, the scope for additional funding for the conservation of the built heritage is constrained by the significant reduction in the public finances.</p><p>Finally, as part of an Architectural Advice Series, my Department plans to publish an advice book on thatching in 2013, which will include further practical advice and guidance on aspects of conserving and restoring thatched structures.  The nine previously published booklets in the series cover areas such as roof and energy efficiency for traditionally built buildings and the full series is accessible on my Department&#8217;s website at .</p></reply>

In November 2007, the Commission published the decision paper &ldquo;Vision for the Regulation of Electrical Contractors with respect to Safety&rdquo; (CER/07/203) which sets out the Commission&rsquo;s high-level approach to the regulation of electrical contractors with respect to safety.  Most recently, I have given CER consent to draft regulations designating Restricted Electrical Works under Section 9 (E) subsection (1) of the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 inserted by the Energy Miscellaneous Act 2006 and this work is underway.  Once these works are designated it will be illegal for anyone other than a Registered Electrical Contractor to complete these works.</p><p>  For clarity, the CER recommends that only Registered Electrical Contractors are used to complete electrical work, regardless of whether that electrical work is covered by the aforementioned proposed regulations.  Separately, the Minister for Justice and Equality has introduced SI No. 144 of 2012, the Private Security (Licensing and Standards) Regulations 2012, which introduces new licensing requirements for personnel involved in the installation of CCTV and access control (among other activities).  These regulations and any review of these regulations are not within my remit.</p><p>  It is recognised that the installation of CCTV and access control (among other activities) may include some electrical work that will fall under this licensing requirement.  Being licensed under the Private Security (Licensing and Standards) Regulations 2012 is not a substitute for being a Registered Electrical Contractor and does not satisfy the recommendation that only Registered Electrical Contractors be used to complete electrical work.  </p></reply>

The obligation currently requires that the amount of biofuel brought to the market is not less than 4.166% of the relevant disposal of petroleum road transport fuels.  The biofuel obligation has successfully delivered increased amounts of biofuel in Ireland resulting in 145 million litres of biofuel being placed on the Irish market in 2011.</p><p>  This obligation will increase over time which will require suppliers of road transport fuels to make certain that even higher volumes sold are biofuel.  I am currently examining the possibility of implementing the first increase to the Biofuel Obligation from 2013.  I will be taking into account all relevant factors, including developments in the Irish market and in the UK and other EU markets as well as sustainability considerations.

My Department administers a very diverse and complex brief.  The Department has a small cohort of permanent staff, some 245 full time equivalents at present. Its remit includes oversight of very complex policy areas and direct procurement of major services where protection of the State&rsquo;s interest must be paramount.  This situation necessarily requires my Department to procure specialist external professional advice notably in legal, financial and technical areas to enable it to discharge its responsibility to deliver quality services and protect the interests of the State and the taxpayer.  Projects for which my Department is responsible include the intensive and nationwide campaign on Digital Switchover, strategic review of oil refining capability, complex telecommunications contracts such as the MANs and the National Broadband Scheme, and oversight of compliance with the Corrib consent conditions (the cost of which is recouped from the developer).</p><p>In addition the very limited in&ndash;house technical resources in areas such as geoscience, energy and telecommunications makes it imperative to have recourse to a certain amount of external professional services in these areas.  Many of these outsourced services relate to specialist, technical, defined term projects which are externally funded.  The table below reflects the above context. In procuring these specialised services, my Department always seeks to ensure value for money and the keeping of expenditure to the minimum necessary.  In this regard, the Deputy might note that expenditure from my Department&rsquo;s consultancy services and value for money and policy reviews budget has reduced from &euro;2.249m in 2008 to &euro;1.372m in 2011.</p><p>Details on arrangements entered into by bodies under the aegis of the Department are a day to day matter for the bodies themselves.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-10-17a.528.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/947" speakername="Pat Rabbitte" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012101700068#WRS01700"><p>The State is not a provider of telecommunication services, except in instances of clear market failure such as in the cases of both the National and Rural Broadband Schemes.  Such interventions are always subject to EU State Aid clearance to ensure no unacceptable level of market distortion takes place.</p><p>  The Rural Broadband Scheme (RBS) was launched last year in recognition of the fact that despite the widespread availability of broadband throughout Ireland, there still remained individual premises that were unable to receive affordable broadband provision.  In total, there were 102 applications from persons living in County Westmeath (including 21 from the general area of Ballynacargy) who consented to receive offers of service from Internet Service Providers participating in the Scheme. Offers of service were made to all of these applicants during the period from April to the end of July this year.</p><p>  The response to date by industry suggests that virtually all eligible applicants under the Scheme are capable of obtaining a broadband service from a supplier using one of the available technology platforms i.e. DSL, fixed or mobile wireless, cable or satellite.  Obviously, where a commercial service is shown to be available, the State cannot intervene with a subvention for alternative services as to do so would be a breach of State Aid rules.  The combination of private investment and State interventions means that Ireland will meet the EU Commission&rsquo;s &ldquo;Digital Agenda for Europe&rdquo; target of having a basic broadband service available to all areas by 2013.</p><p>  The Government accepts that the widespread availability of high speed broadband is a key requirement in delivering future economic and social development.  With basic broadband services now widely available across Ireland, the challenge is to accelerate the roll out of high speed services.  The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published recently, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed services of at least 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses, well in advance of the EU&rsquo;s target date of 2020, and that significantly higher speeds are available to as many homes and businesses as possible.</p><p>  The Plan commits to high speed broadband availability across the country &ndash; specifically: 70Mbps &ndash; 100Mbps will be available from the commercial market operators to more than half of the population by 2015; at least 40Mbps, and in many cases faster speeds, to at least a further 20% (and potentially as much as 35%) of the population during the lifetime of the Government; and a minimum of 30Mbps for every remaining home and business in the country, also during the lifetime of the Government.</p><p>  During the preparation of the Plan, the commercial market operators indicated that they expect to provide 70Mbps to 100Mbps services to 50% of the population by 2015.  The areas to be provided with those services will be determined by the commercial market operators.  One of the first steps in delivering on the 30Mbps and 40Mbps commitments will be the completion of a formal national mapping exercise to determine the exact position in relation to commercial service providers&rsquo; existing and planned broadband services throughout the country.  Preparatory work has commenced within my Department to expedite this mapping exercise.</p><p>  The mapping exercise will identify the areas of the country where there is market failure in the provision of high speed broadband services.  It will also identify where the market is expected to succeed and fail in the delivery of high speed broadband over the coming years.  Until that process is complete, the precise areas of the country which will require State intervention will not be known.  I would reiterate however, that the Government remains committed to the delivery of the speeds referred to above, to ensure that all parts of Ireland, including areas such as Ballynacargy, will have at least 30Mbps connectivity.  </p></reply>

The charge is set at &euro;200 and liability for it falls, in the main, on owners of rental, holiday and vacant properties . It is a matter for an owner , whether resident in Ireland or elsewhere, to determine if he or she has a liability and, if so, to declare that liability and pay the charge.   </p><p>  Under the Act, it is a function of a local authority to collect non-principal private residence charges and late payment fees due to it, and all charges and late payment fees imposed and payable to a local authority are under the care and management of the local authority concerned. In this regard, application of the legislation in particular circumstances is a matter for the relevant local authority. Guidelines have also been issued to local authorities in relation to the operation of the &ldquo;care and management&rdquo; provisions of the Local Government (Charges) Act 2009 and local authorities are expected to implement these guidelines appropriately. </p><p>  The NPPR charge has been in operation for 4 years and has been the subject of much public discussion and commentary prior to, and following, its introduction .  Failure to declare a liability in respect of, or to fail to pay, the charge on non-principal private residences, are offences. I urge all liable parties who have not paid the charge on non-principal private residences to contact their local authority as a matter of urgency. Property owners who are unsure of their liability should, in the first instance, contact their local authority.</p></reply>

Under the Regulations, a wide range of obligations are imposed on vehicle producers, authorised treatment facilities, vehicle owners and local authorities. </p><p>  Certificates of Destruction are issued by authorised treatment facilities as prescribed in article 19 of the Regulations. These Regulations require that a Certificate of Destruction is issued on the deposit of a vehicle, falling within the scope of the regulations, at the authorised treatment facility concerned. Article 22(1)(a) of these Regulations also requires authorised treatment facilities to notify the Driver and Vehicle Computer Services Section of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport based in Shannon in County Clare of Certificates of Destruction issued. There is no payment recoverable by the operator of an authorised treatment facility from my Department or any agency operating under the aegis of my Department for issuing Certificates of Destruction. </p><p>  Under article 9 of the Regulations, producers are required to establish national collection systems for the appropriate treatment and recovery of end-of-life vehicles of their particular brands. As a minimum and in accordance with the proximity principle, each producer&rsquo;s national collection system is required to have at least one authorised treatment facility in each city and county council area that will provide free take-back for vehicles of that producer&rsquo;s brand. In order to fulfil their obligations under this article, producers have entered into contractual agreements with authorised treatment facilities operating in the functional area of each local authority. Subject to compliance with all relevant provisions of the Regulations, it is a matter for producers and authorised treatment facilities alike to determine the financial conditions of such contracts. It should be further noted that given the current high value of scrap metal, there are very few end-of-life vehicles with a negative value at present. </p><p>  An examination of all aspects of the end-of-life vehicle system is currently being conducted by my Department as part of a wide ranging review of the producer responsibility initiatives in operation in Ireland. This review will provide recommendations on how to improve the funding and reporting structures and environmental outputs of the end-of-life vehicle system in order to enable Ireland to operate successfully in meeting our domestic and EU environmental obligations in the medium to long term.</p></reply>

I understand that no court venue has been singled out for or indeed exempted from the review process.</p><p>  In this context a comprehensive review of venues has recently been completed, the purpose of which was to establish a general framework within which venues could be considered for closure taking into account a range of criteria such as caseload, proximity to an alternative venue, physical condition of the building, availability of cells etc.  The likely impact on other Justice agencies, such as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Irish Prison Service, is also taken into account.  The review identified a range of venues nationwide which, based on the criteria applied, could be considered for closure subject to a detailed assessment and the preparation of a business case in respect of each identified venue which has now commenced.</p><p>  The Service has advised that the identification of venues as part of the review process does not conclusively mean that the identified venues will close.  I am informed that no decision will be taken on an individual venue without prior consultation with local stakeholders and I understand that this consultation will be undertaken at an early stage in the assessment process so that all views can be fully reflected in the decision making process.  It should be noted that the final decision will be a matter for the Courts Service Board.  Under the statute I have no role or function in the matter.</p><p>  The Courts Service has informed me that the cost savings will be calculated as part of the detailed assessment of each individual venue.  It is anticipated that the annual cost savings per venue closed will be in the region of &euro;10,000.  It should be emphasised, however, that savings alone are not the objective and the intention of the proposed consolidation is to achieve operational efficiencies and a greater throughput of cases combined with providing an appropriate level of service to court users.  </p></reply>

The person entered the State on 27 July 2007 and registered with the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) on the 30 July, 2007. He had his permission to remain as a student renewed on an annual basis until 7 August 2012.</p><p>  As previously outlined to the Deputy, a student who first entered the State or commenced their studies after 31 December, 2004 is subject to the conditions of <i>the New Regime for full time non-EEA students , </i>which was published in September 2010 and has been in effect since 1 January, 2011.  It is available on the INIS website: <i>www.inis.gov.ie.  </i>  This policy stipulates that non-EEA nationals may reside in Ireland as students, subject to the provisions of the new regime, for a maximum aggregate period of seven years.  A student is responsible for managing their studies to ensure compliance with this time limit.</p><p>  This aggregate period may consist of periods of study on language or non-degree level courses as well as degree level courses.  However, it is a condition of the new regime that the maximum time a student may stay in Ireland for the purpose of attending courses at language or non language degree level is limited to 3 years.  In line with the new regime, it is permissible for students who come to Ireland on a language or non-degree programme to enroll on a course on the degree programme but subject to the overall limit of 7 years not being exceeded.  Courses under this programme must be listed on the Internationalisation Register.  The person in question has exceeded the maximum 3 year period that a non EEA national is permitted to remain in the State to pursue a course of studies at language and non degree level.  As the person referred to by the Deputy is not in a position to enroll on a degree level course that complies with the conditions of the<i> New Regime for full time non-EEA students, </i>  he has no basis to remain in the State as a student.</p><p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.  This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process.  The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in cases where the response from INIS is, in the Deputy's view, inadequate or too long awaited.</p></reply>

Work is ongoing to properly align the provisions of the Bill with the principles contained in the UN Convention on supporting people with impaired capacity in making decisions and exercising their basic rights. I envisage that the title of the Bill will reflect this approach.</p><p>  The Bill proposes replacement of the Wards of Court system with a modern statutory framework to support persons with impaired decision-making ability. The Wards of Court system is regarded as unsuited to modern conditions and incapable of coping with projected demographic growth and increased need for the management of the affairs of persons who lack capacity. The terminology and concepts used in the existing legislation of 1871 are regarded as inappropriate to the modern understanding of mental illness and legal capacity. The enactment of new legislation is one of the core elements of the remaining work to be completed to enable ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and work on the Bill in ongoing.</p></reply>

However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has informed me that there are 14 District Probate Registries located outside Dublin attached to Circuit Court Offices.  Staff in these offices also have responsibility for other aspects of circuit court work.  I am sure that the Deputy will appreciate that the Courts Service, in common with all other public sector organisations, is obliged to ensure that resources are deployed to best effect to ensure continuity of service with reduced budgets and resources.  Greater flexibility in the deployment of available resources will be critical in maintaining the delivery of front line court services.</p><p>The Courts Service has informed me that the impact of vacancies on the provision of services varies between court offices depending on the number of vacancies and the skill sets available in each office.  The Service has put in place contingency plans customised to meet the needs of individual offices.  These plans include technical skills training to address the skills and knowledge deficit resulting from vacancies.  In addition, the Courts Service has indicated to applicants that they may lodge probate applications with the Probate Registry in Dublin, if they wish to do so.  The Service has also put in place a series of work force planning measures over the last three years to ensure that available resources are deployed to best effect including the centralising of processes, creation of multi-jurisdictional combined court offices, rationalisation of court venues and offices, rationalisation and standardisation of processes and an ongoing review of resource allocation including redeployment to front line services.</p><p>The table below sets out the current position in each office:</p><p><table><tr><th><br /><div>Circuit Court Office/ Combined Office</div></th><th><br /><div>**Total staff <br />currently serving</div></th><th><br /><div>Number <br />of Vacancies</div></th></tr><tr><td><br />*Mayo</td><td><br /><div>10</div></td><td><br /><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td><br />*Cavan</td><td><br /><div>3</div></td><td><br /><div>2</div></td></tr><tr><td><br />Tipperary</td><td><br /><div>8</div></td><td><br /><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td><br />Cork</td><td><br /><div>28</div></td><td><br /><div>0</div></td></tr><tr><td><br />Louth</td><td><br /><div>8</div></td><td><br /><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td><br />*Galway</td><td><br /><div>11</div></td><td><br /><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td><br />*Kilkenny</td><td><br /><div>5</div></td><td><br /><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td><br />Donegal</td><td><br /><div>11</div></td><td><br /><div>0</div></td></tr><tr><td><br />Limerick</td><td><br /><div>13</div></td><td><br /><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td><br />*Westmeath</td><td><br /><div>7</div></td><td><br /><div>0</div></td></tr><tr><td><br />Sligo</td><td><br /><div>7</div></td><td><br /><div>0</div></td></tr><tr><td><br />Kerry</td><td><br /><div>7</div></td><td><br /><div>5</div></td></tr><tr><td><br />*Waterford</td><td><br /><div>15</div></td><td><br /><div>2</div></td></tr><tr><td><br />Wexford</td><td><br /><div>5</div></td><td><br /><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td><br />Total</td><td><br /><div>138</div></td><td><br /><div>23</div></td></tr></table></p><p>*These are now combined court offices.</p><p>** The number of staff in each court office responsible for all aspects of court work not exclusively probate.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-10-17a.599.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012101700068#WRU02300"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 223 to 227, inclusive, together.</p><p>  The Reception &amp; Integration Agency (RIA), an operational unit of the Irish Naturalisation &amp; Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department, is responsible for the accommodation of asylum seekers under the Direct Provision system.  As of 7 October, 2012, RIA is accommodating 4,955 persons in 36 accommodation centres located in 17 counties throughout the country. Details of all of these centres are available on its website - <i>www.ria.gov.ie</i>.  I am regularly briefed and kept informed on all matters relating to immigration and asylum including the Direct Provision System as well as, of course, the linked matters of finance and budgets.</p><p>  The matter raised by the Deputy centres around the Value for Money Report and Policy Review - Asylum Seeker Accommodation Programme, published in 2010, which was laid before the Oireachtas and is available on the Oireachtas website and RIA's website  <i>www.ria.gov.ie</i>  .   In this report, the VFM group accepted that it is not possible for RIA to achieve 100% occupancy of its accommodation - due to family configuration, sickness requiring isolation, and so on - and recommended that RIA strive for an occupancy rate of 90% or less of its available capacity.  This is a guideline and at any point in time spare capacities can be above or below this figure.  It is therefore an incorrect premise that capacity above 10% at a particular point in time is an 'excess' which can be quantified in monetary terms.</p><p>  There are three reasons for this. Firstly, the ebb and flow of asylum seekers requiring RIA accommodation is such that it is impossible to predict with 100% certainty that the numbers requiring accommodation will result in a spare capacity of exactly 10% or less at any one point.</p><p>  Secondly, contracts which RIA has with service providers are deliberately 'staggered' throughout the year to account for this ebb and flow.  Indeed, generally contracts are now for between 12 and 18 months in duration and this allows RIA to engage or disengage from contracts as required having regard to current accommodation needs.  Given the current downward trend in asylum seekers requiring accommodation, when a contract comes up for renewal a decision has to be made to seek to reduce its capacity, including adjusting capacity across a group of related centres, or to close it.  RIA makes every effort to keep family centres open, preferring instead to reduce contracted capacities. But a reduction of capacity by, say, 15% does not mean a commensurate reduction in cost and the closure of a centre may be the only economic option for the contractor.  It is simply not possible, taking into account the logistics involved in either reducing capacities or closing centres, to achieve a spare capacity of 10% at all times. This can only be achieved over a period of time taking into account projected fluctuations in demand.</p><p>    Thirdly, the recommendation in this respect was one of a number of inter-linked recommendations. Among the recommendations of the VFM report was the introduction of a mix of &#8216;contracts for capacity&#8217; and &#8216;contracts for availability and occupancy&#8217; as well as a 'more open' tendering system in respect of the commercially owned and operated centres in the RIA portfolio.  Preparatory work has begun on devising a more open tendering process for the commercially owned centres which could only have taken place following the recent completion of the tender competition for the management of RIA's seven State owned centres. This will be a difficult and complex exercise as the tender process will have to take account of &quot;non-money&quot; issues such as access to social, educational and health services as well as adherence to long standing Government policy on dispersal of asylum seekers throughout the country so that no one region is disproportionately burdened in relation to service provision, as well as a recognition that other State agencies may have already committed resources in a particular region or area.</p><p>  An illustration of the complexities involved in taking actions to achieve the recommendations of the VFM report is the recent decision by RIA to close down the Lisbrook centre in Galway city.  This operation was in progress when I received a number of representations, including from the Deputy&#8217;s own party on the matter.  I instructed that the operation be suspended until the decision had been reviewed. The review concluded that the closure was necessary, particularly in view of the need to reduce bed capacity in RIA centres thereby reducing expenditure. This decision, of course, is entirely in keeping with the recommendation of the Value for Money Report and will yield a cost reduction of approximately &#8364;2 million.</p><p>  In the period 2009 (when significant downsizing of the RIA portfolio began) to date, a total of 23 centres have been closed.  When Lisbrook House is closed in a few weeks, that will bring the number up to 24 and will have yielded an overall reduction in capacity of 2,671.  Arising from these closures and reductions in capacity, as well as other cost saving measures introduced by RIA, the cumulative savings overall on the Direct Provision system from the end of 2008 to the end of 2012 will amount to over &#8364;67 million.</p><p>  Since August 2012, RIA has closed one centre - Viking Lodge in Dublin 8 (55 bed spaces) and is currently in the process of closing Lisbrook House in Galway City (284 bed spaces). Taking the closures indicated above as well as reductions in capacities on other contracts into account, RIA expects to have a capacity of 5,460 at 31 December, 2012.  Taking current occupancies rates as a base, this would represent a spare capacity of 9.2%, well within the VFM recommendations.</p></reply>

The Authority does not seek this information generally for the purposes of the licence application as it has relevance only in very specific circumstances.

This requires that an applicant have either a minimum &ldquo;academic qualification&rdquo; or a &ldquo;minimum level of experience&rdquo;.  A &ldquo;minimum level of experience&rdquo; means, having been lawfully engaged in the provision of the property service, in respect of which the licence is sought, for three of the five years immediately preceding the making of the application.

On the 8th   of November last, I launched an Irish &ldquo;discard&rdquo; atlas, which is a detailed compendium of discards by the Irish Fleet on a stock by stock and area by area basis.  The Atlas, compiled and produced by the Marine Institute and Bord Iascaigh Mhara with the support of Irish Industry, outlines a range of potential measures to help reduce discarding.</p><p>  This was the first publication of its kind and places Ireland firmly to the fore in the debate on eliminating discards. The atlas will inform the process to achieve real change and a significant reduction in discarding within the new Common Fisheries Policy, identifies where action needs to be taken, and the potential measures that could be adopted. </p><p>  Finding practical and implementable solutions to the wasteful practice of discarding fish is a major priority issue for me. It is all the more poignant as it is a major principle of the new reform of the CFP. Since taking up office as Marine Minister, I have worked tirelessly to influence and drive a change in policy which will ultimately lead to an end to discarding. </p><p>  I am conscious that any solution must be practical for fishermen and with that in mind I have worked closely with Commissioner Damanaki, my fellow Fisheries Ministers and members of the European Parliament in addition to consulting with our industry at home to ensure that proposals in the Common Fishery Policy to tackle discards would be workable and take account of the practical realities that would face fishermen at sea.  </p><p>  At the Council of Fisheries Ministers in June this year, I helped broker a general agreement among fisheries Ministers on the way forward for the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy including innovate measures to tackle the discard problem. </p><p>  Discarding was the most contentious element of those discussions and threatened to block the Council&rsquo;s efforts to reach agreement. A compromise approach which I tabled for consideration setting down a definitive timetable for the elimination of discards on a phased basis, offered a practical and progressive solution on the issue which was accepted by fellow Ministers.  </p><p>  I will prioritise securing final agreement between the EU Fisheries Council and the Parliament on the CFP during the Irish Presidency during the first half of 2013.</p></reply>

My Department is represented on the Farm Safety Partnership Advisory Committee which is a Sub-Committee of the Health and Safety Authority.  The Committee advises the Board on the direction the HSA should take in relation to farm safety.  My Department is very strongly committed to promoting Farm Safety in collaboration with the HSA and has taken a number of steps over the past year in tandem with some of the other State and industry organisations to both raise awareness of the problem and educate farmers and their families on the dangers of working in this industry.   </p><p>The most recent measure taken by my Department was the inclusion of a Farm Safety message with the Single Payment application packs, which were distributed in March of this year to over 130,000 farmers.  This was a joint initiative between my Department, the Health and Safety Authority and the Farm Safety Partnership Committee and led to each of those farmers receiving an individual reminder of the importance of farming safely, and the potentially fatal consequences of not doing so.</p><p>  The HSA produced an excellent DVD earlier this year containing testimonials from 6 individual farmers who provide an emotional telling of their experiences on farm which led to either fatalities or serious injury.  This DVD has been widely circulated is included in all training courses undertaken by my Department. </p><p>  My colleague Minister of State McEntee made the opening address at the National Farm Safety Conference in June. The National Farm Safety Conference is one of the highlights of the Farm Safety calendar and my Department is fully committed to helping raise the profile of this Conference among farmers so that the farm safety message remains high on everyone&rsquo;s agenda. </p><p>  Other actions by my Department include: </p><p>  -	The provision to all farms of a Code of Practice aimed at reducing farm accidents.</p><p>  -	The inclusion of Health and Safety Guidelines in all Building Specifications drawn up by my Department.</p><p>  -	The inclusion of Farm Safety in all REPS Training Courses.</p><p>  -	A dedicated area on the DAFM website outlining the requirements on Farm Safety and practical advice on Safety on Farms.</p><p>  -	My Department has asked Teagasc to include a farm safety element in the Dairy Discussion Groups participating in the Dairy Efficiency Programme 2010-2012.</p><p>  -	Regular Press Statements drawing attention to Farm Safety agenda.</p><p>  There is no single action or organisation that can solve this difficult problem that impacts so horrendously, on so many lives, each year. Since taking office, I have continuously strived to increase awareness of safety issues among farmers which I believe is the key to changing the way we all think about farm safety on Irish farms.  We must all work together with the single goal of preventing farm accidents and therefore saving lives and minimising serious injuries.</p></reply>

Rather, the EU Commission has proposed putting a progressive cap on the amount of Single Farm Payment any one farmer or business could receive.  In that respect, I support the Commission&rsquo;s proposal, although I also understand the real difficulties of some Members States on this issue, and I believe some flexibility may be required. </p><p>  I would be somewhat reluctant excluding business enterprises per se from the Single Farm Payment.  Business enterprises come in all shapes and sizes and I would not wish to see family farms excluded from payment because they had organised themselves as a corporation or company. If there were to be limits applied, I would prefer to see a simple cap on the amount that a farmer of business could receive.</p></reply>

I am informed that no explicit need in terms of land committed to energy crops has been established.  The actual amount required will depend on a number of factors such as the market price for bioenergy, the availability of other sources, particularly forest biomass and also the availability of imports.</p><p>  Estimates made by SEAI in relation to renewable energy targets depend on a range of assumptions about the future, including demand projections, the impact of energy efficiency policy and the extent of co-firing in peat powered stations.  In this context the SEAI has stated that the outcome of their analysis is a scenario rather than a forecast.  For example, one such scenario developed in the SEAI publication of December 2011 <i>Energy Forecasts for Ireland to 2020</i>  suggests that in terms of biomass contribution to renewable electricity, meeting the requirement with domestic resources could need up to 30,000 hectares of land from energy crops.  This scenario is presented by SEAI merely to show the scale required in the event that the only available resource is domestically grown energy crops.  This figure assumes no imports and no contribution from forestry.  The reality is that the vast bulk of the biomass contribution to reaching 2020 targets will come from the forestry sector.</p><p>  The Deputy may be aware that the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, has announced his intention to publish a National Bioenergy Strategy in the coming months.  This strategy will examine all aspects of the bioenergy sector so as to inform the actions required to maximise its contribution to achieving the 2020 targets under the Renewable Energy Directive.  My Department is working closely with Minister Rabbitte&#8217;s Department in assessing the potential of bioenergy from the agriculture and forestry sectors to contribute to the 2020 targets.</p></reply>

However, I can assure the Deputy that both my Department and the agencies under its aegis make every effort to comply with the terms set out in the Prompt Payments of Accounts Act, 1997.</p><p>  My Department is committed to making every effort to pay its suppliers promptly.  In line with Government Decision No. S29296 of 19 May 2009, every effort, consistent with proper financial procedures, is being made to ensure that all suppliers are paid within 15 calendar days of receipt of a valid invoice.  My Department publishes quarterly reports on prompt payments on our website and the reports for 2011 can be viewed at www.doh.ie.  </p><p>  In relation to the HSE,  I can assure the Deputy that the Executive is committed to standard payment terms of 30 days. However, given the multitude of processing centres across the HSE, and indeed within its individual units, in order to meet a 15 day period, it would require the introduction of a single financial and procurement system. Whilst there are plans in this regard, it will be some time before this is in place. Taking into account that over 7,000 invoices are received daily by the Executive across a multiplicity of service delivery units, it has consistently been my Department's view that it is not logistically possible to apply the 15 day payment rule to the HSE at this time. </p><p>  Notwithstanding this, the introduction of Prompt Payments legislation and the refinancing arrangements introduced and overseen by this Department have seen the HSE comprehensively address the issue of late payment. It should be noted that as a result of the improvement in payments, the HSE only paid &euro;324,000 in prompt payment interest in 2011, which was just one third of 1% of its non-pay budget for that year.</p><p>  As regards the other agencies under the aegis of my Department, work is underway to redesign their IT systems to capture the appropriate data in order to publish this information on their websites in line with the Government Decision.  It should be acknowledged that many of these agencies receive either minimal or no funding from my Department, and in all cases, the vast majority of invoices are paid within the terms of the Prompt Payment of Accounts Act.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-10-17a.772.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/982" speakername="Kathleen Lynch" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012101700068#WRBB00500"><p>I understand that the Deputy is enquiring about placements for school leavers in 2013. </p><p>  Day services for adults with disabilities and mental health issues provide a network of support for over 25,000 people who have a wide spectrum of need, ranging from those with severe and profound disabilities who are likely to need long-term specialist service provision to people with lower support needs and greater potential for community participation and inclusion.  The HSE, through its Occupational Guidance Service, works with schools, service providers, service users and families to identify the needs of young people with disabilities who are due to complete their second level education.  The aim is to address the needs of individuals in the following ways:</p><p>- Health-funded rehabilitative (life skills) training;</p><p>- Health-funded day services;</p><p>- F&Aacute;S-funded vocational training;</p><p>- Approval to extend education placement for a specified time.</p><p>  The demand for services for school-leavers continues to grow. In 2012, the number of school-leavers who require services is almost 700, and the position in 2013 is expected to be similar. Budgetary constraints and the moratorium on staff recruitment give rise to challenges in service provision. In addition the physical capacity to provide further services may not be present in all agencies. However both the voluntary sector and the HSE are committed to the best use of available resources in a creative and flexible manner to be as responsive as possible to the needs that present. While the HSE makes every effort to provide day services to people over 18 on leaving school, this has always been dependant on the availability and location of appropriate places coupled with the needs of the individual school-leaver. The HSE is currently reviewing the outcomes for 2012 school leavers in terms of placements achieved and scoping out the likely requirements for  2013.</p><p>  There is evidence that an accelerated move towards a new model of individualised, person-centred service provision in the community can help to achieve efficiencies, particularly in relation to services for those with mild or moderate intellectual disability. The HSE has established an implementation project team to oversee the implementation of the recommendations in the report of the national working group for the review of HSE funded adult day services. The report, published in February 2012,  titled 'New Directions' proposes that day services in the future take the form of a menu of 12 individualised, outcome-focussed  supports which will provide adults with disabilities with the support necessary to live a life of their choosing in accordance with their own wishes, aspirations and needs. The guiding principle for the future is that supports will be tailored to individual need and will be flexible, responsive and person-centred.</p></reply>

We find no evidence that the condition was made worse by the vaccination.&quot;  All of the papers in relation to the Expert Group in this case were requested and provided to the family under the Freedom of Information Acts in January 1999.</p></reply>

The report from this Group was made in June 2009 and is available on my Department's website.   This report is under active consideration by my Department.

However, there are other sources of stem cells including bone marrow.  The benefit of stem cells in the  treatment of a range of medical conditions is being explored by scientists around the world.  In addition, many potential benefits of stem cells are at an early stage of investigation. </p><p>  When clinically indicated by a consultant overseeing care, collection of cord blood for donation to an identified family member in high risk families (known as &quot;directed&quot; harvesting of cord blood stem cells) is facilitated by HSE hospitals in collaboration with the Irish Blood Transfusion Service.  In addition, where an identified clinical need arises, Ireland has access to cord blood stem cells through international stem cell banks and registries and this is also arranged by the Irish Blood Transfusion Service.  </p><p>  &quot;Undirected&quot; harvesting of cord blood may also take place to provide an individual with a personal store of stem cells in case the need arises for these in the future.  &quot;Undirected&quot; harvesting of cord blood is not provided publicly in Ireland at present.  The HSE does not prohibit &quot;undirected&quot; harvesting of cord blood under contract with private companies.  It is open to hospitals wishing to accommodate staff who are directly employed by third party commercial companies to undertake the procurement of cord blood at hospitals operated or funded by the HSE, provided they ensure that a service level agreement is in place between the third party commercial entity and the hospital concerned.  </p><p>  However, staff employed at hospitals operated or funded by the HSE cannot undertake the collection of cord blood on behalf of third party commercial entities, as this activity would not be covered under the Clinical Indemnity Scheme.  A number of hospitals have advised their clinical staff about the indemnity issues arising in this regard. </p><p>  Hospitals and their maternity service teams face significant challenges in ensuring that a safe and high quality maternity care system is provided to mothers and their babies within available resources.  The HSE will continue to ensure that evidence-based, safe, effective and high quality care is provided to patients and their families.  To this end the HSE and my Department will keep the emergence of the clinical benefits of cord blood banking under review.</p></reply>

Following on from the Agreement and in the context of the re-establishment of the Northern Ireland Executive, an investment package including a roads element, was agreed.  The A5 project was part of that package. </p><p>  At the NSMC Plenary meeting, on 8th November 2011, Ministers noted that the provision of further funding by the Irish Government for the A5 road was being deferred but that the Irish Government will provide &pound;25m per annum in 2015 and 2016 towards the project.  At the subsequent June 2012 NSMC Plenary meeting, it was noted that the N.I. Executive had announced an investment package of major roads including two sections of the A5 project.  In addition, it was noted that the Irish Government remains committed to the completion of the co-funded A5 project which is of strategic importance to the North West Region and the island as a whole but that the Government is not in a position to make funding commitments for the period post-2016 in advance of its consideration of the next capital review framework.  The NSMC plenary approved a funding implementation plan for the A5 project to the end of 2016 which incorporated the &pound;50m committed by the Irish Government.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-10-17a.876.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/948" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012101700068#WREE01100"><p>The Irish ferry market is an extremely important element of the Irish tourism transport network.  There are currently six shipping lines providing passenger services, with approximately 500 sailings weekly between Ireland and Britain and continental Europe depending on the time of year.   The Irish passenger ferry market also played a vital role in keeping Ireland's foreign transport passenger networks open during the Volcanic Ash crisis in 2010, when it carried an additional 150,000 passengers over this period.</p><p>  While the vast majority of our overseas visitors arrive in Ireland by air,  836,000 visitors came to Ireland by sea in 2011. Research has shown that visitors coming to Ireland by car are very important to our tourism industry as they tend to stay longer, they tend to tour around more (with consequential benefits for regional tourism) and they tend to spend more than those arriving by air. Accordingly, the state tourism agencies have continually targeted this segment and undertake co-operative marketing activity with ferry providers.</p><p>  In terms of price differentials in northern European ferry routes, all ferry companies servicing routes to and from Ireland are independent commercial companies who operate in an open and competitive market.  Strong competition on a route is the most effective way to ensure consumers get the best value for money.  Therefore, my Department through its agency, the Irish Maritime Development Office, works closely with all existing operators as well as promoting Ireland as a location for new services.</p><p>  It should be noted that the fares charged by ferry companies are influenced by a number of factors. The length of journeys and fuel costs are the most significant factors contributing to the difference in cost between routes. For example, the distance between Dover to Calais is about 41kms while that between Liverpool to Dublin is nearly 220 km and Rosslare to Pembroke is about 123 kms. This means that, for example, three to four times more fuel is burned on routes on the Irish Sea than on the Dover to Calais route. The exact costs of fuel used by a vessel is also dependent upon a number of variables such as volatility of the fuel market, currency fluctuations, length of journey, speed, prevailing winds, weather, engines specification, type of vessel, age of vessel, the mix of HGV, car and foot passengers, etc. In 2011, oil prices rose sharply with Bunker prices increasing by 40% over the course of the year, adding significantly to costs borne by ferry operators. To remain competitive ferry companies also offer promotional fares at various times during the year, which might influence price comparisons.</p></reply>

Since then both Minister Ring and I have attended a number of events overseas to mobilise support for the initiative. The Gathering Ireland 2013 was the title sponsor of the Notre Dame Navy US football game in September which received widespread coverage in the United States. President Higgins also promoted The Gathering Ireland during his recent visit to South America and  further publicity events in our main overseas tourism markets are planned for the remainder of the year.</p><p>  In terms of domestic activity, local Gathering Coordinators have been appointed in each county and steering committees have been formed. Over 7000 people have attended 52 community meetings throughout Ireland since June.  Individuals and community groups can see what is already planned in their area by logging on to the Gathering website where planned events are shown by county. The website also provides online supports and ideas for those interested in setting up their own event. I am informed that there are now more than 600 individual events pledged on &quot;The Gathering Ireland 2013&quot; website and this is increasing daily. Amongst the most common are clan gatherings, twin town trips, school and work reunions, genealogical projects and family reunions.</p><p>  In terms of resources, this year my Department has allocated a budget of &euro;5 million for the initiative. While in general the Gathering is intended to be a voluntary effort by communities at home and abroad, with some targeted funding for major events, details of arrangements for local authorities to fund Gathering events at county/local level are also being worked out at present and will be announced shortly.</p></reply>

In addition, the Visa Waiver Scheme is encouraging visitors from emerging markets to add Ireland to a trip to the UK, and the halving of employers&rsquo; PRSI for those on modest wages will significantly reduce the cost of employing people.</p><p>  To date the CSO Quarterly National Household Survey has been showing a positive trend. It shows that 6,300 more people were employed in accommodation and food services in the second quarter of this year compared to the same period in 2011 (6,400 seasonally adjusted) and 10,600 more people compared to the first quarter in 2011 (10,500 seasonally adjusted).</p><p>  The focus is now moving to 2013 when we will host the Gathering Ireland 2013. We want to make this the biggest tourism event ever held in Ireland, and ensure that jobs are created right across Ireland to the benefit of local economies everywhere.</p><p>  With regard to the specific elements of developing cultural tourism, this is an operational matter for F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  Accordingly, I have referred the Deputy's question to F&aacute;ilte Ireland for direct reply.  Please contact my private office if a reply is not received within ten working days.</p></reply>
