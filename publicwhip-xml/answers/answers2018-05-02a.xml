The deterioration of these roads also has implications for the provision of services, including emergency services, who can struggle to get access to people and property.  </p>  <p>  Investing in the repair of these roads is therefore helping to improve the quality of life for people in rural areas.</p>  <p>  In 2017, I allocated total of &euro;17.4 million to participating County Councils under the LIS scheme.  This enabled over 700 roads to be upgraded in some of the most rural parts of the county.</p>  <p>  I launched the 2018 LIS scheme in February this year, with an indicative allocation of &euro;10.8 million to County Councils.  It is entirely a matter for the Councils themselves to determine which roads to prioritise, in line with the scheme criteria.  Details of more than 400 individual road projects selected by the Councils have now been published on my Department&rsquo;s website.  </p>  <p>  In total, I have allocated &euro;28 million in LIS funding since last September, and over 1,100 individual roads will benefit from this investment.</p></reply>

This will be similar to the amount approved in 2017, and a significant increase on the amounts approved in 2014 and 2016, which stood at &euro;26.3 million and &euro;28.5 million respectively.  It is important that the level of funding to schemes, programmes and projects is sustainable, so that the fund can continue to support measures in a stable manner over the coming years.</p>  <p>  Any measures put forward by Departments must, in the first instance, be provided for in the Vote of the Department or budget of the agency concerned.  The expenditure incurred in implementing an approved measure is then reimbursed from the Dormant Accounts Fund.  Each Department remains accountable for the administration of the programmes and schemes run under their remit using Dormant Accounts funding.</p>  <p>  The forthcoming Action Plan will, as in previous years, set out the details of all new measures which have been allocated Dormant Accounts funding.  However, as part of the ongoing review of the general administration of the Dormant Accounts Fund, the Action Plan will also include details of all measures previously approved for funding which are currently underway or which will commence shortly.  This will provide for greater certainty and transparency in relation to the outstanding liabilities on the Fund.  It will also potentially allow for increased use of the Fund in the future, including, for example, through the reallocation of decommitted funding to new measures.</p></reply>

This scheme is a lifeline for people living in rural areas because it directly improves their access to and from their homes and farms, and has made a huge difference for rural communities around the country. </p><p>In September 2017, I approved &euro;10 million in funding for the Local Improvement Scheme (LIS).  As there had been no dedicated funding for LIS for a number of years, there was a very significant level of pent-up demand for the scheme.  Based on the Local Authorities' capacity to deliver further road improvements before the end of the year, I allocated an additional &euro;7.4 million to the scheme from savings elsewhere in my Department's Vote at the end of November 2017.</p><p>I launched the 2018 Local Improvement Scheme in February of this year, with an indicative allocation of &euro;10.8 million.  This is higher than the initial allocation in 2017.  I have now published the details of over 400 roads selected by County Councils for improvement works this year on the basis of their 2018 allocations.  Details of the roads in question are available on my Department's website at<i>.</i></p><p>This brings to over 1,100 the number of roads which will have been supported by my Department under the LIS scheme since September 2017.</p><p>As part of the 2018 scheme, I also requested each County Council to compile a secondary list of suitable LIS road projects that they would have the capacity to complete should additional funding become available through my Department later in the year.  I will be monitoring the situation in the context of my Department's overall expenditure performance over the coming months.</p></reply>

The programme was originally launched in October 2001 but was closed for applications in 2010.  I re-opened the programme in 2016 and, since then, 900 projects have been approved for funding under CL&Aacute;R.</p><p>I launched the 2018 CL&Aacute;R programme on 15th March, with an indicative allocation of &euro;5 million for qualifying projects under the following measures:</p><p>Measure 1: Support for Schools/Community Safety Measures </p><p>Measure 2: Play Areas/ MUGAs </p><p>Measure 3: First Response Support Measure </p><p>The closing date for receipt of applications was 30<sup>th</sup>April. My officials will now assess all applications received against the criteria for the programme, and I hope to be in a position to announce the successful 2018 CL&Aacute;R projects in the coming weeks.</p><p>The CL&Aacute;R programme is an important part of the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Rural Development. It makes a significant contribution to the rural communities it serves.  A modest investment under the CL&Aacute;R programme, such as for the provision of a play area, can have a significant impact on a community, for example by providing a central location for children to play and for their parents to meet. </p><p>The CL&Aacute;R programme is also helping to make rural schools safer for our children by funding footpaths and traffic calming measures in their vicinity.

The areas originally selected for inclusion in the programme were those which suffered the greatest population decline from 1926 to 1996, with the exception of the Cooley Peninsula which was included on the basis of the serious difficulties caused in that area by Foot and Mouth disease.  The average population loss in the original CL&Aacute;R regions over the period 1926 to 1996 was 50%.</p>  <p>  In 2006, an analysis of the 2002 Census data was carried out by the National Institute for Regional and Spatial Analysis (NIRSA) at Maynooth University and the programme was extended to include areas with an average population loss of 35% between 1926 and 2002.  The areas included since the reopening of the CL&Aacute;R programme in 2016 are based on the work carried out by NIRSA in 2006. </p>  <p>  I intend to carry out a full review of CL&Aacute;R areas later this year on the basis of the 2016 Census of Population data.  The level of depopulation will continue to be a primary factor in the designation of any area as a CL&Aacute;R area.  The review will involve a detailed examination of all areas of the country, as well as stakeholder consultation.  I plan to begin the review process in the coming months with the aim of having a full and comprehensive review completed before the end of this year. </p>  <p>  The findings of the review will inform the future operation of the scheme, post-2018.</p></reply>

The Plan contains 277 actions aimed at supporting the economic and social progress of rural Ireland.  These actions are for delivery across Government, State agencies and other bodies, over the period 2017-2019.</p>  <p>  One of the objectives of the Action Plan is to support enterprise growth and job creation in rural areas.  The Government has set a target of supporting the creation of 135,000 extra jobs outside of Dublin by 2020.  Specific measures to achieve this target are set out in the Action Plan.</p>  <p>  The latest Labour Force Survey published by the Central Statistics Office shows that employment increased in almost all regions of the country year-on-year in Quarter 4 2017.  Employment outside of the Dublin region increased by 56,200, or 84% of the overall national increase in 2017.  The Labour Force Survey does not provide data at the level sought by the Deputy.  </p>  <p>  I can report that two-thirds of the 19,332 new jobs created by Enterprise Ireland companies in 2017 were outside of Dublin, while all regions saw an increase in employment in IDA client companies in 2017, with over 50% of the 19,851 new jobs created last year located outside of Dublin. </p>  <p>  These figures show that the Government&rsquo;s efforts to support job creation in the regions are working, but we must continue to build on the progress made to date and create more job opportunities for people who live in rural Ireland.</p>  <p>  My own Department contributes directly to job creation in rural areas through programmes such the Town and Village Renewal Scheme, the Rural Recreation Scheme and LEADER.  LEADER is a multi-annual programme which has a budget of &euro;250 million over the period to 2020 and has a job creation target of 3,100 over the lifetime of the programme. </p></reply>

The programme is administered by Local Action Groups (LAGs) who deliver funding in accordance with Local Development Strategies that have been produced for each LAG area.  Projects can continue to be approved under the programme up to the end of 2020. </p>  <p>  &euro;220 million of the available funding has already been allocated to the 28 LEADER sub-regional areas throughout the country.  This funding will be delivered in accordance with the Local Development Strategies for each area.  The amount of funding available for projects, as outlined in these Local Development Strategies, is &euro;164.5 million.  The remainder of the &euro;220 million covers the administration costs of the LAGs and their engagement with communities to generate projects.</p>  <p>  Of this &euro;164.5 million, almost &euro;27 million has already been allocated to over 900 projects, representing over 16% of the total project allocation outlined in the LAG strategies.  This funding will be drawn down as projects start to incur expenditure and submit payment claims.</p>  <p>  In addition, a further &euro;30 million is available to be allocated at a national level under a number of separate measures, including a food project initiative and support for co-operation projects where LAGs come together to jointly deliver a LEADER project.  These are at an initial stage of delivery and will include funding for both projects and the administration and animation costs of the LAGs.   </p>  <p>  While the pace of approvals varies between LAGs, I am confident that the progress made by the LAGs in 2018, along with the administrative improvements introduced over the last year, will result in a significant increase in project approvals and payments under the LEADER programme over the coming months.</p></reply>

The scheme involves landholders as key participants in the provision of high quality walking trails, by contracting them to undertake maintenance work on sections of National Way Marked Ways and other priority walks that traverse their lands. Participating landholders receive modest payments for maintenance work undertaken, in line with agreed work plans.</p><p>The scheme currently covers 39 trails, with payments made to approximately 1,900 landholders to maintain those trails.</p><p>The Programme for a Partnership Government and the Action Plan for Rural Development include a commitment to increase the number of trails covered by the Walks Scheme and my officials are working towards this objective.  I intend to initiate a comprehensive review of the scheme&rsquo;s operation this year in order to determine how best to expand the scheme and maximise the impact of the resources available to me.  I anticipate that this review will be completed before the end of the year and that it will help identify priority walks that can be included in the expansion of the scheme.</p></reply>

Under the scheme, and based on the TidyTowns categories, TidyTowns Committees in villages were eligible to receive &euro;1,000.

This will be similar to the amount approved in 2017, and a significant increase on the amounts approved in 2014 and 2016, which stood at &euro;26.3 million and &euro;28.5 million respectively.  It is important that the level of funding to schemes, programmes and projects is sustainable, so that the fund can continue to support measures in a stable manner over the coming years.</p>  <p>  Any measures put forward by Departments must, in the first instance, be provided for in the Vote of the Department or budget of the agency concerned.  The expenditure incurred in implementing an approved measure is then reimbursed from the Dormant Accounts Fund.  Each Department remains accountable for the administration of the programmes and schemes run under their remit using Dormant Accounts funding.</p>  <p>  The forthcoming Action Plan will, as in previous years, set out the details of all new measures which have been allocated Dormant Accounts funding.  However, as part of the ongoing review of the general administration of the Dormant Accounts Fund, the Action Plan will also include details of all measures previously approved for funding which are currently underway or which will commence shortly.  This will provide for greater certainty and transparency in relation to the outstanding liabilities on the Fund.  It will also potentially allow for increased use of the Fund in the future, including, for example, through the reallocation of decommitted funding to new measures.</p></reply>

The fund will provide the opportunity for co-funding of suitable investment projects in towns and villages with a population of less than 10,000, and outlying areas.  The objective of the new Fund is to drive collaborative, coordinated and complementary packages of investment between Departments, agencies, Local Authorities and other public bodies, to transform our rural towns and villages and their outlying areas. </p>  <p>  Proposals for funding will be made on a competitive bid-based approach, based on delivering on the objectives in the National Planning Framework to support rural Ireland.  The Plan provides that proposals submitted for funding will have to demonstrate a contribution from State, local authority, state agency or other funding. This is currently the case in relation to the schemes operated by my Department and helps to achieve additionality.</p>  <p>  Initial funding of &euro;315 million is being allocated to the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund over the period 2019 to 2022.  This initial phase will allow my Department to build on existing initiatives which it administers, as well as to support new collaborative initiatives as outlined above.  The initial period of funding will also provide an opportunity for an assessment of both specific projects and the method of allocation of this funding, and will inform further allocations.  Funding under the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund will continue beyond 2022, to 2027.</p>  <p>  As set out in the National Development Plan, my Department currently operates a number of schemes to support rural regeneration.  These include the Town and Village Renewal Scheme, CL&Aacute;R and the Rural Recreation Infrastructure Scheme.  While each of these schemes makes a valuable impact in its own right, I want to build on the synergies between the schemes to achieve better outcomes for people who live in rural areas.</p>  <p>  The National Development Plan also envisages that, over time, these schemes will be integrated into the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund.  This will provide an opportunity to align the schemes with complementary initiatives operated by other Departments to maximise the impact on rural communities of investment across national and local government, and achieve better value for money. </p>  <p>  My Department is currently developing proposals for the detailed operation of the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund, and I will announce the details following consultation with relevant Government colleagues.</p></reply>

A contract of employment stipulates the hours of work, hours of attendance or other related matters normally associated with the concept of gainful employment.  Furthermore, service with the Army Reserve and Naval Service Reserve is not pensionable under the Army Pension Schemes. </p><p>Ensuring an appropriate balance between voluntary activities and work and home life is a key challenge that is common to individuals involved in many voluntary organisations throughout the State.  I am aware that some members of the Reserve have expressed concerns that attendance requirements as Reservists would necessitate them having  to take excessive time off work and they see employment protection legislation as a way to facilitate such attendance. </p><p>As members of the Reserve undertake activities on a voluntary basis, there are currently no plans to introduce such legislation. </p><p>There is no provision in the Defence Acts to deploy members of the RDF on overseas peace support operations.  The White Paper on Defence (2015) commits to developing a Specialist Reserve and, in this context, where there are skills gaps there may be opportunities for such Reservists to serve overseas on a voluntary basis.  The Specialist Reserve will be progressed as part of the overall White Paper implementation process.</p></reply>

In the discussions at Stormont Castle on outstanding commitments that took place between March and June last year, my predecessor and I engaged extensively with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and all of the political parties to seek a way forward to implement the Stormont House legacy framework.  This built on the progress made on legacy issues during the talks in 2015 that led to the Fresh Start Agreement. </p>  <p>  I also emphasised in discussions with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the political parties, the need to ensure that legacy inquests are properly resourced and I continue to raise this issue with the Secretary of State.

They affirmed that all EU Member States stand in unqualified solidarity with the United Kingdom in the face of this grave challenge to our shared security. </p>  <p>  In light of these European Council Conclusions, I made the decision to terminate the accreditation of a diplomatic staff member of the Russian Embassy.  This decision was based on an assessment of all the relevant political and security factors, and in line with the provisions of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.  As indicated above, the role of the OPCW, while significant, was not decisive in that overall decision.  I am satisfied that the decision to expel a Russian diplomat was the most appropriate course of action in the circumstances.</p></reply>

While a number of the recommendations in the Motor Report are relevant to the area of business insurance &ndash; in particular, the recommendations regarding the Book of Quantum, the Personal Injuries Assessment Board and the establishment of the Personal Injuries Commission &ndash; it became clear in preparing the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurancethat there was also a pressing need to examine the drivers for the rising cost of business insurance.</p><p>The second phase work culminated in the publication on January 25th 2018 of the Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance  , following its approval by Government.  This new Report makes 15 recommendations with 29 associated actions to be carried out, detailed in an Action Plan contained in the Report with agreed timelines for implementation. </p><p>The recommendations, covering three main themes, include actions to:</p><p>Increase Transparency:enhance levels of transparency and improve data sharing and collection processes;</p><p>Review the level of damages in personal injury cases:request that the Law Reform Commission undertake a detailed analysis of the possibility of developing constitutionally sound legislation to delimit or cap the amounts of damages which a court may award in respect of some or all categories of personal injuries; and</p><p>Improve the personal injuries litigation framework:through a number of measures, including:</p><p>a. ensuring potential defendants are notified in sufficient time that an incident has occurred in relation to which a claim is going to be made against their policy;</p><p>b. tackling fraudulent or exaggerated claims; and</p><p>c. ensuring suitable training and information supports are available to the Judiciary to assist in the fair and consistent assessment and awarding of damages in personal injury cases.</p><p>All 29 actions are scheduled to be implemented before the end of 2019, with 26 due for completion this year.  The fifth Quarterly Progress Update is near completion and will focus on the implementation of both of the Reports.  However, I can now report that in respect of the eight actions from the Report on Employer and Public Liability Insurancedue for completion in Q1 2018, all eight deadlines have been met.</p><p>The Working Group will continue to focus on implementing the recommendations of the Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurancein parallel with implementing those from the 2017 Motor Report.  I am hopeful that the cumulative effects of the completion of the two reports&rsquo; recommendations will include increased stability in the pricing of insurance for businesses and improved availability of liability insurance for all types of bodies.</p></reply>

To achieve these priorities we are restructuring our business model, streamlining our organisation, and increasing our focus on customer facing roles.  </p><p>&ldquo;As part of this process, we have reviewed our operational support centres. These centres were established to manage temporary projects or to provide back office operational support for the bank. They are generally located in offices above branches. There are 28 operational support centres, distributed nationwide, employing 419 people.</p><p>&ldquo;Arising from this review the Bank has decided to wind these operational support centres down by the end of the year.  A number of temporary projects conducted at the centres are due to naturally conclude by the end of 2018, and other activity will be centralised to an alternative location. The migration of this work will be carried out on a phased basis, with all activity concluded by the end of 2018.  Alongside this decision, the Bank is increasing the number of personnel in our branches and Contact Centres with over 100 new roles. This will enhance our ability to better serve our customers, which is a core strategy for the development of the Bank.  </p><p>&ldquo;Supporting colleagues through change is a key priority. We have communicated with all support role colleagues in relation to these changes, and have set out a range of options at this time, including:</p><p>Seeking expressions of interest from our operational support centre colleagues for one of over 100 new branch and Contact Centre roles;</p><p>Supporting colleagues who wish to apply for other roles across the Group;</p><p>Supporting colleagues who express an interest in Voluntary Parting or Early Retirement. </p><p>&quot;The various options and timelines will be discussed again with colleagues in one-to-one meetings with line managers over the coming weeks, and a range of HR supports remain available to colleagues on an ongoing basis.

From 4 November 2014 this changed with a number of supervisory responsibilities and decision making powers moving to the European Central Bank (ECB) through the establishment of the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM). </p><p>The ECB is responsible for all core supervisory responsibilities as defined in the Council Regulation (EU) No. 1024/2013 (SSMR). For Significant Institutions, a Joint Supervisory Team (JST), led by the ECB and consisting of both ECB and Central Bank supervisors directly supervise these firms. The Central Bank remains responsible for the supervision of activities of institutions defined as Less Significant.  </p><p>Prudential risks arising from outsourcing was one of ECB Banking Supervision&rsquo;s supervisory priorities for 2017 and it carried out a themed review on this topic. The focus of the thematic review was to take stock of selected supervised entities&rsquo; outsourced activities and scrutinise how banks are managing the associated risks.</p><p>The Central Bank of Ireland has been clear with banks that the responsibility for the proper management of risks associated with outsourcing arrangements and the outsourced activities resides with boards and senior management of banks - not the outsource provider. Banks are required to grant the SSM/Central Bank the right to audit outsource providers. However, all risks remain with the bank and not the outsourced provider.  </p><p>While there are potential efficiencies or specialist expertise gained through outsourcing certain services, the approach can also potentially increase operational, governance, or conduct risks if not properly managed. When SSM/Central Bank assesses outsourcing arrangements it assesses the full outsourcing life-cycle from the initial risk assessment and due diligence, through the decision-making process and then the on-going monitoring and exit strategies.  </p><p>The Central Bank has commented on its expectations of banks, which include compliance with the European Banking Authority Guidelines on Outsourcing, and on the findings of its inspections in this area in public speeches. </p><p>In November 2016, then Director of Credit Institutions Supervision Ed Sibley said:</p><blockquote>Outsourcing is not new, although it continues to increase in prominence as banks seek to reduce costs, and focus more on their core business expertise and value generating activities. We expect strong governance frameworks over outsourcing arrangements, starting with adherence with the EBA guidelines on outsourcing at the very minimum. These guidelines effectively date back to 2006. Banks have had 10 years to ensure they comply with them. However, we continue to see examples of where they do not, resulting in serious risks being run, a lack of ability to manage and drive value from the outsourcing arrangements and ultimately requiring us to take enforcement action in a number of cases.</blockquote><p>In its consumer protection role, the Central Bank has been clear that firms cannot derogate from their obligations by contracting a third party to carry out activities on their behalf.</p><p>The Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code (the Code) provides that a regulated entity must ensure that in all its dealings with customers and within the context of its authorisation it ensures that any outsourced activity complies with the requirements of the Code.</p><p>The Central Bank expects that a firm&rsquo;s consumer protection framework must consider and address the consumer protection risks inherent in its approach to outsourcing and the arrangements in place with its outsourcees. Proper terms and conditions must be in place, along with a programme of checking to make sure that the outsourced activity meets the firm's own standards (including its ethical standards).</p></reply>

My Department&rsquo;s policy is to ensure that every child who is assessed as needing SNA support will receive access to such support. </p><p>In considering applications for SNA supports for individual pupils, the SENOs take account of the pupils' needs and consider the resources available to the school to identify whether additionality is needed or whether the school might reasonably be expected to meet the needs of the pupils from its current level of resources. SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource.</p><p>Schools who wish to make applications for SNA support should apply to the NCSE. The deadline for applying for SNA support for the 2018/19 school year was extended from 28 February to the 7th March 2018 due to the effects of adverse weather. The NCSE continues to accept applications after this date. SENOs continue to process applications for access to SNA support which were received after 7th March in the order in which the applications have been received.</p><p>The NCSE aims to respond later this month to valid applications for access to SNA support received by 7th March 2018. </p><p>The NCSE Appeals Process may be invoked by a parent or a school where it is considered that a child was not granted access to SNA support on the grounds that Department policy was not met in accordance with Circular 0030/2014. </p><p>Schools may also appeal a decision, where the school considers that the NCSE, in applying Department policy, has not allocated the appropriate level of SNA supports to the school to meet the special educational and/or care needs of the child/ren concerned.</p><p>If a parent considers that their child is not accessing a sufficient level of SNA support they should address their concerns to the school in the first instance. </p><p>All schools have the contact details of their local SENO and parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available at <i></i>.</p><p>As the question to which the Deputy refers relates to an individual child, the matter will be referred to the NCSE for direct reply.</p></reply>

Implementation commenced in September 2014 with the introduction of English, for first year students. Subjects are being introduced on a phased basis up to 2019 and are being supported by a comprehensive CPD programme for teachers.</p>  <p>  The new Junior Cycle gives schools greater flexibility to design programmes that are suited to the needs of their Junior Cycle students and to the particular context of the school. </p>  <p>  In the new Junior Cycle there will be two qualifications. One, a replacement for the current Junior Certificate, will be aligned to Level 3 of the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ). The other, designed for students with particular special educational needs who currently can't access the Junior Certificate, will be aligned to Level 2 of the NFQ.</p>  <p>  The Level 2 Learning Programmes (L2LPs) and qualification are targeted at a very specific group of students who have general learning disabilities in the higher functioning moderate and low functioning mild categories</p>  <p>  New subject specifications have already been introduced in English, Science, Business Studies, Irish, Modern Languages and Art, Craft and Design at Junior Cycle, with new specifications in Mathematics, Home Economics, History, Music and Geography to be introduced in September 2018.</p>  <p>   Senior Cycle:</p>  <p>  Mandarin, Polish, Lithuanian and Portuguese</p>  <p>  &lsquo;Languages Connect &ndash; Ireland&rsquo;s Strategy for Foreign Languages in Education 2017-2026&rsquo; was published late last year. A key part of this strategy is not only increasing the numbers of children taking up a foreign language, but also diversifying the range of languages available to schools. This will be achieved through the development and implementation of a curricular specification for new learners of Mandarin Chinese for Leaving Certificate and curricular specifications for heritage speakers for Polish, Lithuanian and Portuguese. The Strategy commits to the introduction of these specifications from September 2020. </p>  <p>  Leaving Certificate Computer Science</p>  <p>  The specification for the new Leaving Certificate Computer Science (LCCS) subject was approved by the Council of the NCCA and the Minister in December 2017. Following a public call to schools, the Steering Group established to oversee implementation of LCCS selected and approved 40 schools that will introduce the subject in September 2018 as part of the phase 1 roll-out. The first examination of the LCCS will take place in June 2020. Phase 2 will see the subject being available as an option to all schools from September 2020.</p>  <p>  Leaving Certificate Physical Education</p>  <p>  The specification for a new examinable Leaving Certificate Physical Education was approved by the Minister last year, following development by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA).  The introduction of Physical Education as a Leaving Certificate subject is a key action under the Department&rsquo;s Action Plan for Education and is part of the Government&rsquo;s overall emphasis on encouraging physical activity and healthy lifestyles among young people in Ireland. The Specification will be introduced on a phased basis to 64 schools from September 2018 with students sitting Leaving Certificate examinations for LCPE in June 2020.  It will then be made available to all schools who wish to introduce it from September 2020.</p>  <p>  Politics and Society</p>  <p>  A new specification for Leaving Certificate Politics and Society was introduced in September 2016 to a selected Phase 1 cohort of 41 schools who were selected from almost 120, following an open invitation to introduce this as an optional Leaving Certificate subject. The first examination in Leaving Certificate Politics and Society will take place in June 2018. The introduction of the specification was part of the Department of Education and Skills commemoration of 1916 and its commitment to education for sustainable development. Phase 2 (availability to all interested schools) has commenced with all schools having been asked to express their interest in providing Politics and Society as an option for their students from September 2018.</p></reply>

A number of working groups will convene in the coming weeks to progress issues under these heading and the use of targeted campaigns to promote the teaching profession, including campaigns targeted at teachers teaching abroad, will be considered in that context.</p>  <p>  The Steering Group will oversee a programme of actions according to strict timelines and clear deliverables to meet important needs.  In undertaking its task, the Group will be cognisant of the requirement that all persons wishing to teach in recognised schools must meet the professional registration standards and criteria set by the Teaching Council, which is the professional regulatory body for the teaching.</p>  <p>  There are strong career opportunities in teaching in Ireland due to the increasing number of permanent full-time positions, providing greater scope for graduates to obtain permanent employment.  Additional investment has allowed the successful recruitment of over 5,000 additional teachers in the last two years.  Since 2012/2013, there are 8,900 more teachers in our schools. No other part of the public service has seen growth on this scale, which is testament to the Government&rsquo;s commitment to, and the importance of education in, fulfilling our national ambitions.</p>  <p>  According to HEA graduate destination figures, the significant majority of graduates from post primary teaching programmes in 2016 were in employment and of these the large majority were employed in Ireland: 88% of graduates of undergraduate programmes were employed, of whom 85% were employed in Ireland and 90% of graduates from the PME were employed, of whom 90% were employed in Ireland.</p></reply>

Mathematics is a compulsory pathway whereas subjects like Business Studies and Home Economics are optional pathways.</p><p>Junior Cycle Mathematics</p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">The revised Junior Cycle syllabus exposes the students to a range of topics relating to financial literacy:</font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">- In Junior Certificate, students learn about: </font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">- Solving problems involving mobile phone tariffs, currency transactions, shopping (bills), Value Added Tax and meter readings</font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">- Making value judgements for money calculations (expenditure and savings)</font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">- Using ratio and proportion to conduct currency calculations. </font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">- More specifically students should be able to:</font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">- (At Ordinary Level and Higher Level) Solve problems involving profit and loss; %profit (on the cost price), Discount (%discount), selling price, compound interest (for no more than three compounding periods), income tax (standard rate only) and net pay</font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">- (At Higher Level only) Solve problems that involve cost price selling price, discount , mark up, (profit as a % of the selling price) compound interest, income tax and net pay (including other deductions)</font></p><p>Junior Cycle Business Studies - new Specification introduced in September 2016</p><p>In Junior Cycle Business Studies, there are three strands of study: Personal Finance, Enterprise and Our Economy. </p><p>Personal finance focuses on students developing a set of skills, knowledge and values that allows them to make informed decisions to effectively and responsibly manage their financial resources.</p><p>Enterprise encourages students to identify opportunities and turn them into practical and targeted activities within business and wider society through the development and application of their understanding, skills and values. It develops students&rsquo; basic understanding of the financial, marketing and operational functions of an organisation. </p><p>Our economy enables students to understand the dynamic relationship between the local, national and international economic situation. It develops students&rsquo; ability to identify and understand basic economic concepts as they relate to personal finance, enterprise and the Irish economy.</p><p>Financial literacy skills are developed throughout Strand 1 but also are integrated into Strand 2 and 3, where students apply financial literacy skills developed in Strand 1 to enterprises (businesses) and to the economy. </p><p>Junior Cycle Home Economics</p><p>Financial literacy is also covered in the subject of Home Economics at Junior Cycle and Senior Cycle. In Junior Cycle Home Economics, students are enabled to:</p><p>- apply consumer decision-making skills in the management of personal, family and household resources for everyday living </p><p>- debate consumers&rsquo; rights and responsibilities </p><p>- examine how consumers are protected in Ireland by legislation, statutory and non-statutory agencies apply financial literacy skills in the preparation and evaluation of a budget for independent living</p><p>Senior Cycle</p><p>Mathematics</p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">In the Leaving Certificate, students should be able to:</font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">- (At Ordinary Level and Higher Level) solve problems that involve calculating cost price, selling price, loss, discount, mark up (profit as a % of cost price), margin (profit as a % of selling price) compound interest, depreciation(reducing balance method), income tax and net pay (including other deductions)</font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">- (At Higher Level only) apply the mathematics of geometric progressions to calculating repayments for amortised loans and problems relating to savings (future and present values)</font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">- It is also worth noting that in the context and applications approach to the new syllabuses other sections of the course (strands 4 and 5 in particular)are brought to bear in solving problems involving finance and as a result students are given  a rich repository of approaches to solving the  everyday and very important problems.</font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">- The learning outcomes at Foundation Level are virtually identical to those at Ordinary Level in the Junior Cycle</font></p><p>Economics</p><p>- The current Economics syllabus students will have an understanding of money supply and banking in an economy---but not the products offered by individual financial institutions. The new draftspecification includes learning outcomes relating to the demand and supply of money, creation of credit, interest rates and regulation in the financial markets.</p><p>Business</p><p>- Household and business manager-learning outcomes - Aspects of finance include: basic cash flow, main sources of finance, cost of finance, current account, and applying for a loan.</p><p>- Business development-learning outcomes- main sources of finance available for business start-up.</p><p>- Using skills for business-learning outcomes-explanation of the relevance of economic indicators such as inflation, employment rates, and interest rates. Economic growth, national income and national debt for individuals and the economy.</p><p>Other resources</p><p>In Ireland there are many stakeholders, both public and private sector, involved in the development of materials and programmes designed to explore and develop aspects of business capability in second-level schools. Guidelines on teaching business studies have been produced by the Business Studies Teachers Association of Ireland (BSTAI), and the Professional Development Services for Teachers (PDST) support teachers through workshops, events and online materials.</p><p>In addition, opportunities for teachers and students to have a more practical exposure to business are afforded by an established programme of national and local student enterprise competitions. The flagship competition is the Student Enterprise Awards sponsored by the County and City Enterprise Boards. Over the last ten years it has become the biggest enterprise competition for students in Ireland with over 16,000 students involved each year. Students develop life skills associated with running a real enterprise including working as part of a team, managing production and finances, organising a sales and marketing campaign and liaising directly with customers, judges and the media. The competition complements business studies and while it is open to any post-primary student, it is generally undertaken in Transition Year (TY), where it is seen as supporting the overall aims of the TY programme.</p><p>Similarly the Young Entrepreneur Programme (YEP), based in the Kerry region, has been run in secondary schools and third level institutions since 2007 and has seen 3,400 students complete a course in entrepreneurship.</p><p>At junior cycle, schools and teachers have also been supported in building the development of financial skills into their practice and lesson plans. Examples of this include materials, programmes and activities developed by the Junior Achievement Programme, Money Matters and Shop Smart (National Consumer Agency), MoneySense for Schools (Ulster Bank), and Business 2000 (Sunday Business Post) among others.</p><p>Within the FET sector there are a broad range of programmes on offer to support adult education, including financial and business courses, details of which are available on www.fetchcourses.ie  .  Within the adult literacy programme provision is made each year for almost 60,000 beneficiaries with investment of almost &euro;33milllion which includes themed provision targeting financial literacy skills.</p><p>To support the ETB sector NALA the National Adult literacy Agency has produced a number of best practice guidelines with regard to financial teaching practices in Ireland, such publications include;</p><p>&lsquo;A Wealth of practice, case studies of financial numeracy practice in Ireland&rsquo;, In this report Kerry ETB, City of Dublin ETB, Galway Roscommon ETB, Mayo, Sligo, Leitrim ETB and Waterford Wexford ETB&rsquo;s, provide for use by all ETB&rsquo;s, case studies of financial numeracy teaching practice&rsquo;  .</p><p>&lsquo;Making it go further &ndash; a financial literacy action research project&rsquo;this report outlines a range of teaching and learning resources in use in various ETB&rsquo;s throughout the country.</p><p>NALA encourages organisations including financial institutions, such as banks, to use Plain English in their publications and information leaflets. They also advise organisations on the production of literature in plain English.</p></reply>

As I have previously conveyed, the Regulatory Authority, which is independent in the performance of its functions, has stated that it is making the necessary detailed preparations and developing the necessary staffing and other resources required both to establish the Roll and to apply it effectively on an ongoing basis. This is among those matters addressed by the Authority in its inaugural Strategic Plan for the years 2018-2020 that I have laid before the Houses earlier this week.</p>  <p>  Under section 133(1)(b) of the 2015 Act the Authority is given six months to enter on the roll the required information about every person who is, on the date when Part 9 of the Act is commenced, a practising barrister. As has been anticipated by this provision, therefore, the setting up of the new Roll requires substantial lead-in time in order to be completed in the manner specified under the 2015 Act.  The indicative timeline for the commencement and completion of this work by the Authority under its Strategic Plan is Quarter 2 and Quarter 4 of this year, respectively. I am confident, therefore, that the introduction of the Roll of Practising Barristers by the Regulatory Authority is indeed progressing as intended by way of a reform objective.</p>  <p>  The Roll of Practising Barristers will include barristers who are members of the Law Library and would generally come under the aegis of the Bar Council. It will also now include those barristers who choose to practice outside the Law Library structure and would otherwise be unregulated. Such non Law Library barristers will need to be entered on the Roll in the same way as their Law Library counterparts if they wish to practise under the terms of the 2015 Act. It will be appreciated, therefore, that both the managed setting up of the statutory Roll that is taking place at this time, and its effective application in the future, remain key to ensuring that those who may wish to provide legal services to the public as practising barristers will do so with public confidence in a regulated setting.   </p></reply>

In addition to enhancing the ongoing co-operation being provided to certain Coroner's Inquests in Northern Ireland, these proposals will further underpin the Government's commitment to full cooperation with the framework of measures set out in the Stormont House Agreement.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-05-02a.239.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018050200075#WRG01500"><p>On 31 December 2016, the International Protection Act 2015 was commenced, providing for the introduction of a single application procedure for people seeking international protection in the State. The 2015 Act replaces the previous sequential application system with a single application process, for asylum, subsidiary protection and permission to remain in the State, bringing Ireland into line with the processing arrangements applicable in other EU Member States. The structural causes of delays have been removed with the commencement of the International Protection Act 2015.  The main challenge now faced is the need to quickly process the substantial cases on hand many of which were carried over from the previous system. </p><p>Considerable administrative resources were required by the International Protection Office (IPO) to get the new single procedure process up and running in the first part of 2017 and this transition process led to a shorter processing year. Nevertheless, the IPO succeeded in scheduling over 2,400 single procedure interviews (including in respect of EU relocation cases) once the process was up and running in 2017. Some 1,780 recommendations/decisions in respect of international protection and permission to remain were made by the IPO in 2017. This included some 750 recommendations in respect of the grant of international protection.</p><p>As of 27 April 2018, there are a total of 5,300 applications for international protection pending in the IPO. Some 2,200 of these applications were made before the commencement of the 2015 Act but were not finalised by the former Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner (ORAC) and the former Refugee Appeals Tribunal (RAT) by that date. These applications reverted to be processed by the IPO under the transitional provisions of the 2015 Act. This has added significantly to the IPO&rsquo;s caseload.  Furthermore, there was a 30% increase in applications for international protection during 2017 (including EU relocation cases) which has put additional pressure on the system.</p><p>Significant additional resources have and are being allocated to the IPO to assist it in undertaking its statutory functions with a view to processing the volume of cases on hands as soon as possible. The current staffing complement in the IPO is 130. In addition, there are some 55 serving members of the IPO&rsquo;s Legal Processing Panel.In the first 4 months of 2018, 1,100 single procedure interviews have been scheduled by the IPO.  Thus far, some 1,170 recommendations/decisions in respect of international protection have been made by the IPO in 2018 (to 27 April 2018).  This includes EU relocation cases, permission to remain and permission to remain reviews. There were also some 27 subsidiary protection cases dealt with under the European Union (Subsidiary Protection) Regulations 2013.  Based on current predictions, the IPO is in line to make over 3,500 recommendations/decisions in 2018 which is a substantial increase on the 1,780 recommendations/decisions made last year.</p><p>Notwithstanding the increase in the volume of cases being processed by the IPO, it is recognised that currently many applicants for international protection are still waiting too long for their first instance interviews in the IPO and to have their cases decided.  These challenges are being addressed by deploying increased resources and a continued review of efficiency and effective use of those resources, having due regard to the requirements of the 2015 Act, in order to maximise quality output and value for money for the taxpayer. In this regard, it is planned to increase the strength of the IPO Processing Panel over the coming months following public advertisement and interview.</p><p>Prioritisation of international protection applications is provided for in the International Protection Act 2015 subject to the need for fairness and efficiency. When the &lsquo;Application for International Protection Questionnaire (IPO 2)&rsquo; and other supporting documentation is returned by applicants, the IPO is scheduling applications for interview primarily on the basis of date of application (oldest cases first). However, certain categories of applicant are also being prioritised such as those who arrive under the Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP), from refugee generating countries (such as Syria) and unaccompanied minors. The IPO&rsquo;s approach to prioritisation has been agreed with the UNHCR. It has been brought to the attention of the relevant NGOs at the IPO Customer Service Liaison Panel and is also available on its website:<i></i></p></reply>

The Report showed that 133 of the recommendations contained in the McMahon Report were fully implemented with a further 36 recommendations in progress or partially implemented. The combined fully implemented or in progress/partially implemented recommendations make up 98% of the total recommendations contained in the McMahon Report. Both Recommendations 4.75 and 4.87 were deemed to be in progress in the Third and Final Report on the implementation of the McMahon Report.</p>  <p>  Recommendation 4.75 was for the provision of access for families of cooking facilities (whether in a self contained unit or through use of a communal kitchen) as well as their own private living space. Currently a full independent living model (with food hall and points system) is operational in Mosney, Ballyhaunis, Clonakilty, Athlone and Millstreet which sees 1,539 residents with full autonomy in relation to the preparation of meals. A further 90 residents are accommodated in self catering units and another 1,103 residents are accommodated in centres that offer catering facilities to residents. This means a total of 2,732 residents out of a total current occupancy number of 5,327 have access to cooking facilities.</p>  <p>  Designated family living space is provided at Mosney, Ballyhaunis, Millstreet, Watergate House and Carroll Village. There are a total of 1,211 residents at these centres. While it is not currently possible to provide statistics in relation to the number of families in these centres, it should be noted that these centres are primarily populated by families rather than single people. My Department, in conjunction with the Office of Government Procurement is in the process of holding a full open public procurement process for accommodation services to those people seeking international protection and the specifications for the relevant tenders will seek access to cooking facilities for all and the provision of designated family living space.</p>  <p>  Recommendation 4.87 dealt with the provision of communal kitchens, in parallel with a catering option to single people as well as the provision of a mechanism to allow single people to apply for a room on their own after nine months with an offer to be made within 15 months. As outlined above, access to cooking facilities has been rolled out at a number of accommodation centres. Access to communal catering facilities is currently available in Galway City, Foynes and Tramore which are currently designated for the accommodation needs of single people. As I have stated, the roll-out of the public procurement process will require all providers of accommodation centres to provide cooking facilities to all residents.</p>  <p>  Given the exceptional demand for accommodation places, it has not been possible to provide single rooms for single people. Currently, approximately 2.4% of bedspaces in the current accommodation portfolio are available to my Department for allocation to meet the needs of new persons in the protection process seeking accommodation.</p>  <p>  In relation to the statistical information the Deputy is seeking, my Department does not currently collate statistics in this manner and is therefore unable to provide the information as requested.</p></reply>

The LEOs can offer direct grant aid to microenterprises (10 employees or fewer) in the manufacturing and internationally traded services sectors which, over time, have the potential to develop into strong export entities. Subject to certain eligibility criteria, the LEOs can provide financial assistance within three main categories: feasibility grants (investigating the potential of a business idea); priming grants (to part-fund a start-up); and business development grants for existing businesses that want to expand. </p><p>I understand that the company in question has received support on a number of occasions over the past 10 years. </p><p>Most recently the business in question has been approved for a business expansion grant in respect of 5 new jobs.</p><p>I should also add, anyone with a viable business proposal can also use the LEO to make an application to Microfinance Ireland (MFI) or directly contact MFI themselves.

In accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is determined by the HSE. The Act obliges the HSE to assess whether a person is unable, without due hardship, to arrange general practitioner services for himself or herself and his or her family, having regard to his or her overall financial position and reasonable expenditure and every application must be assessed on that basis. Under the legislation, having a particular illness, in itself, does not establish eligibility for a medical card. Where the applicant's income is within the income guidelines, a medical card or GP visit card will be awarded.</p>  <p>  Every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to support applicants in applying for a medical card and, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines. The HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds his or her income threshold, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness. Social and medical issues are considered when determining whether undue hardship exists for an individual accessing general practitioner or other medical services. The HSE affords applicants the opportunity to furnish supporting information documentation to fully take account of all the relevant circumstances that may benefit them in the assessment, including medical evidence of cost and necessary expenses. </p>  <p>  In relation to the cost of medical card provision to all persons with a recognised disability that do not currently qualify on the basis of means, it is noted that the data required to model this is not available and it is therefore not possible to produce an estimate of the cost of such a proposal.</p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their income and assets while the State pays the balance of the cost. The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings. </p><p>Participants in the Scheme contribute up to 80% of their assessable income and a maximum of 7.5% per annum of the value of assets held. In the case of a couple, the applicant&rsquo;s means are assessed as 50% of the couple&rsquo;s combined income and assets.  The first &euro;36,000 of an individual&rsquo;s assets, or &euro;72,000 in the case of a couple, is not counted at all in the financial assessment. The capital value of an individual&rsquo;s principal private residence is only included in the financial assessment for the first three years of their time in care.  This is known as the three year cap.</p><p>Where an applicant&rsquo;s assets include land and property held in the State, the contribution based on such assets may be deferred and collected from their estate. This is known as the Nursing Home Loan (Ancillary State Support), the purpose of which is to ensure that a person does not have to sell their home during their lifetime to pay for long-term nursing home care. A nursing home resident can apply for this deferral at any stage.</p><p>Under the primary legislation an NHSS applicant may apply for certain items of expenditure to be taken into account and netted off against their means prior to the calculation of their contribution.

As a legally binding process, with a mechanism for the prosecution of offences, it ensures a robust system that serves the dual function of protecting the public while ensuring that the good reputation of a profession is not called into question by the poor practices of an individual member. </p><p>CORU is the umbrella term used to describe the Health and Social Care Professionals Council, its committees and the registration boards established under the Act to regulate each individual designated profession. Its function is to protect the public by promoting high standards of professional conduct, education, training and competence through the statutory registration of the designated health and social care professions. The recent decision to designate the professions of counsellors and psychotherapists under the Act will increase the number of regulated professions to 16 in total. CORU&rsquo;s  register of speech and language therapists opened on 31 October 2014.</p><p>Professionals who apply for registration must demonstrate that they are fit and proper to practise in the profession, complete National Vetting Bureau e-vetting and international police clearance, verify that they agree to abide by their profession specific Code of Professional Conduct and Ethics, pay the application fee and hold an 'approved' qualification. To apply for registration, a professional must complete an online application form and provide all of the required supporting documentation.</p><p>An &ldquo;approved qualification&rdquo; is one that has been awarded on satisfactory completion of an education and training programme in the State approved by the relevant registration board; or a non-Irish qualification which has been deemed equivalent to the Irish qualification standard. </p><p>Such non-Irish qualifications are assessed under the mechanisms set out in Directive 2005/36/EC on the recognition of professional qualifications which provide for the assessment of an applicant&rsquo;s formal training and post-qualification professional experience to determine if they meet the standard required to practise in the home member state (i.e. Ireland). The Speech and Language Therapists Registration Board is designated as competent authority under Directive 2005/36/EC in Ireland for professional speech and language therapy qualifications.This Directive applies to all EEA nationals who wish to practise any regulated profession in an EEA Member State other than that in which they obtained their professional qualifications.  This includes Irish citizens with professional qualifications obtained in any of the other EEA Member States, including the United Kingdom, who seek to return to Ireland to practise their profession.  </p><p>There is no specific recognition of the profession of speech and language therapy at a European level; rather the Directive provides for the assessment of the qualifications/professional training/post-qualification professional experience of an applicant against the qualifications required to practise in the host Member State (Ireland).  The General System of the Directive, which applies in the case of speech and language therapy qualifications, provides for an assessment on a case-by-case basis of the qualifications of an applicant against those required to practise in the host member state if the professional activities covered are comparable.If the professional activities are not comparable then the qualifications cannot be recognised.  If the professional activities are comparable but deficits in the qualification are identified, subsequent post-qualification professional experience of the applicant must be considered.  If deficits in qualifications remain, the Directive provides for the competent authority to offer an applicant a compensation measure i.e. the choice between a period of adaptation (a placement) and an aptitude test. </p><p>I am advised by CORU that compensation measures have been applied to some applicants with non-Irish speech and language therapy qualifications which did not meet the applicable Irish standards - the Standards of Proficiency.  Where compensation measures are applied and have been successfully completed, the applicant's qualification is recognised and they are eligible to apply for statutory registration.</p><p>Under the Directive, Member States must ensure that an applicant has the possibility of taking the aptitude test not later than six months after the initial decision in which it is imposed.  There is no obligation however on the host Member State to provide the period of adaptation which is a period of professional practice in the host Member State under the supervision of a qualified member of that profession, possibly being accompanied by further training.  </p><p>I am satisfied that these processes of registration and qualification recognition provide a strong and proportionate mechanism to protect the public by ensuring that only appropriately qualified professionals are registered and accordingly it is fit for purpose. The numbers of applications received and completed for registration in the speech and language therapists register from 2014 to 2018 are as follows:</p><p><table><tr><th>Year </th><th>Applications received - Total 1,896 </th><th>Registrations completed - Total 1,823  </th></tr><tr><td>2014 </td><td>27 </td><td>3 </td></tr><tr><td>2015 </td><td>258 </td><td>149 </td></tr><tr><td>2016 </td><td>1,375 </td><td>737 </td></tr><tr><td>2017 </td><td>199 </td><td>881 </td></tr><tr><td>2018 </td><td>37 </td><td>53 </td></tr></table></p></reply>

Progress in this area is reflected in the additional funding made available for winter 2017/2018, the increased funding and level of activity in 2018 and in the work being progressed on the development of a statutory home support scheme.</p><p>An additional &euro;18.25m was allocated for home supports in Budget 2018. This brought the budget for the direct provision of home support services to &euro;408m.  The HSE&rsquo;s 2018 National Service Plan provides for a target of some </p><p>-  <b>17.094m</b>home support hours to be provided to 50,500 people, which compares with last year&rsquo;s 16.34m hours delivered to 50,000 people (home help and home hours combined). This is an increase of 754,000 hours to 500 more people.</p><p>-  <b>235</b>intensive home care packages will provide <i>360,000</i>home support hours for people with complex needs. </p><p>Following the recent adverse weather the HSE provided about 350 extra Home Support Packages across 13 specific hospitals over a five week period.</p><p>Despite this significant level of service provision, the demand for home support continues to grow. It is important to note that the allocation of funding for home supports across the system, though significant, is finite and services must therefore be delivered within the funding available.  In addition, some Community  Health Organisations are experiencing capacity issues due to lack of availability of home support staff. This is a particular problem in the Dublin region and other urban areas.</p><p>The HSE has begun work on streamlining home support services in 2018 by brining together the funding for home help and standard home care packages which now operate as a single home support service.  This new approach will provide significant benefits including making the services easier to understand, streamlining the application and decision making processes, and facilitating service users to move to changed levels of services as their assessed needs change, without the need for an additional application.</p><p>Currently there is no statutory scheme for the regulation and financing of home supports, and HIQA has no role in relation to assigning these services. Services are provided on the basis of health-care needs as assessed by a health-care professional, and subject to the availability of resources. </p><p>As you are aware the Department of Health is currently engaged in a detailed process to develop plans for a new statutory scheme and system of regulation for home support services. </p><p>The statutory scheme for home supports will introduce clear rules in relation to the services for which individuals are eligible and in relation to service-allocation. For that reason, developing a new statutory scheme will be an important step in ensuring that the system operates in a consistent and fair manner for all those who need these services. It will also help to improve access to the services that people need in an affordable and sustainable way. The system of regulation for home supports will help to ensure that the public can be confident that the services provided are of a high standard.</p></reply>

The Council&rsquo;s 2016 Guide to Professional Conduct for Registered Medical Practitioners emphasises the importance of continuity of care for patients.  </p>  <p>  Doctors are responsible for their patients until care has been taken over by another doctor or service.  The Guide also notes that referral to another doctor or health professional for an opinion or treatment usually involves the transfer (in part) of responsibility for a patient&rsquo;s care, usually for a set time and a particular purpose, such as care that is outside a practitioner&rsquo;s area of expertise.  The Guide to Professional Conduct also contains clear guidance for doctors on the provision of information to patients, with an emphasis on enabling them to exercise their right to make informed decisions about their care.  These principles should inform the provision of care to patients whether this takes place entirely in this country or whether elements are provided outside the jurisdiction under the EU Treatment Abroad Scheme. </p>  <p>  I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy in relation to the specific arrangements which operate within the services for which the Executive is responsible.</p></reply>

There is no provision under the GMS GP contract for persons who hold a medical card or GP visit card to be charged for routine phlebotomy services provided by their GP which are required to either assist in the diagnosis of illness or the treatment of a condition. The HSE has advised GPs that where a blood test forms part of the investigation or necessary treatment of a patient&rsquo;s symptoms or conditions, this should be free of charge for patients who hold a medical card or GP visit card. Notwithstanding this, I am aware that some GPs are charging GMS patients for phlebotomy services in some circumstances. </p>  <p>  This is a matter of concern for me as it has long been the position, under successive Governments, that no user charges should apply to GP services provided to GMS and GP visit card patients.  If a patient who holds a medical card or GP visit card believes he or she has been incorrectly charged for routine phlebotomy services by his or her GP, then that patient may take the matter up with their HSE Local Health Office, who will investigate the complaint.</p>  <p>  If the local office determines that the charge was inappropriate, it will inform the HSE Primary Care Reimbursement Service who will arrange to refund the cost of the blood test to patient and recoup this amount from the GP. The local office will inform the GP of the decision to deduct the payment.</p></reply>

The Bill was passed in the House of Lords on 24 April 2018 and has been sent to the House of Commons. My Department continues to monitor developments in relation to the Bill as it progresses through the legislative process. </p>  <p>  The Bill also provides for the establishment of a trailer registration scheme in line with the 1968 Vienna Convention, to ensure that UK operators driving on the continent can comply with the requirements of those EU countries which require the registration of all trailers travelling on their roads.  As Ireland already registers trailers this is not an issue for us. </p>  <p>  I welcome the Bill as a constructive contingency measure in preparation for Brexit.  The ongoing focus of the Government in Brexit negotiations is to protect Ireland&rsquo;s interests and to advance our priorities.  In the context of the haulage sector it is vital to minimise the impact of Brexit by avoiding any new regulatory burden for hauliers travelling to or transiting the UK.  I can assure you that I and other Government Ministers will continue to work with our EU counterparts, both in EU capitals and within the EU institutions, to protect the interests of the Irish haulage sector.</p></reply>

If anyone has concerns that a charitable organisation is in breach of the Charities Act 2009, they may forward details of their concerns directly to the Charities Regulator. I am advised that all concerns received are actively reviewed and processed by the Regulator&rsquo;s compliance staff. At the end of March, the Charities Regulator had 324 open concerns regarding 184 charities. </p>  <p>  In the past year the Charities Regulator has published five guidance documents to assist charity trustees manage and control their organisations. The report of the Consultative Panel on the Governance of Charitable Organisations is due to be published on 10 May, following which I understand that the Charities Regulator plans to publish the first code of governance for charities by the end of the year. This document will provide key guidance for charity trustees in the management and control of their organisations.</p></reply>

These include road, rail and ferry services provided by companies such as Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, as well as Luas and services provided by over 80 private transport operators.  There are currently approx. 908,000 customers with direct eligibility with an annual allocation of &euro;90 million.  </p>  <p>  There is no means test for the Free Travel Pass.  Rather, there are a number of schemes, such as State pensions, Invalidity Pension and Disability Allowance, which entitle the beneficiaries to the card as a secondary benefit.  Some of these schemes have a means-test, and others do not.  There is no way for my Department to know how many additional people would qualify, for example, for a Disability Allowance if there was no means test, and so the numbers of people who would benefit from such a move is impossible to state.</p>  <p>  Even if it was possible to know how many people would be in that category, the estimated full year cost of providing free travel passes to people in those circumstances would be impossible to estimate with accuracy.  Any such cost would manifest itself in the form of requests for increased funding by transport providers, based on increased numbers using the scheme on their service, and so would depend on a number of factors including the type of travel pass issued (e.g., single or companion pass), the number of journeys made using the free travel pass, the prevailing fares, and the type of journeys undertaken, i.e., rail, bus or Luas.  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The cost includes payments to just over 650,000 pensioners and qualified adults who are aged 66 and over as well as pensions paid to those who are under 66 years of age (such as widows and qualified adults under the age of 66).  The cost of increasing payments for all existing pensioners and qualified adults aged 66 and over to &euro;243.30 per week would be &euro;540 million in a full year.</p><p>According to the CSO&rsquo;s Population and Labour Force Projections for 2018, and taking account of various assumptions, the number of people aged 66 and over resident in Ireland is estimated to range between 618,816 and 620,711.  The cost of providing a pension payment of &euro;243.30 for all residents aged 66 and over would then range between &euro;7.83 billion and &euro;7.85 billion.  It should be noted that this does not include the cost of increasing pension payments to pensioners living abroad who are entitled to a contributory pension.</p><p>According to the CSO&rsquo;s Population and Labour Force Projections for 2018, and taking account of various assumptions, the number of people aged 65 and over resident in Ireland is estimated to range between 664,634 and 666,680.  The cost of providing a pension payment of &euro;243.30 for all people aged 65 and over would then range between &euro;8.40 billion and &euro;8.43 billion.<font color="#FF0000"> </font>Again, it should be noted that this does not include the cost of increasing pension payments to pensioners living abroad who are entitled to a contributory pension.</p><p>The average weekly earnings for 2017 (based on an average for each of the quarters of 2017) are &euro;724.05 per week.  The cost of increasing the State Pension (Contributory) to 35% of &euro;724.05 per week is estimated to be &euro;206.05 million in 2019.  The additional cost of increasing the Widow&rsquo;s, Widower&rsquo;s or Surviving Civil Partner&rsquo;s Contributory Pension by the same amount is estimated to be &euro;43.7 million in 2019. </p><p>The cost of increasing the State Pension (Contributory) to 40% of &euro;724.05 per week is estimated to be &euro;943.3 million in 2019.  The additional cost of increasing the Widow&rsquo;s, Widower&rsquo;s or Surviving Civil Partner&rsquo;s Contributory Pension by the same amount is estimated to be &euro;200.1 million in 2019.</p><p>The additional cost of providing a payment of &euro;216.38 to each recipient of a State pension payment, including those in receipt of a reduced rate of payment as well as those in receipt of a qualified adult payment, is estimated to be &euro;230.7 million in 2019.  This costing includes increases in the reduced rates of State Pension Contributory and Widows, Widower&rsquo;s or Surviving Civil Partner&rsquo;s Contributory Pension. </p><p>It is not possible to calculate the cost of providing a payment of &euro;216.38 to all persons in receipt of reduced rates of State Pension Non-Contributory.  However, the cost of increasing the rate payable to qualified adults of the payment is estimated to be &euro;9.6 million in 2019. </p><p>The costs shown above are on a full year basis and are based on the estimated number of recipients in 2018.  It should be noted that these costings are subject to change in the context of emerging trends and associated revision of the estimated numbers of recipients for 2019.  It should also be noted that all of these costings include proportionate increases for qualified adults and for those on reduced rates of payment, where relevant.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-05-02a.443.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018050200078#WRK04500"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 181 and 182 together.</p>  <p>  My Department operates a range of means tested social assistance payments.  Social welfare legislation provides that the means test for these schemes takes account of the income and assets of the person and a spouse/partner, if applicable.  Income and assets include income from employment, self-employment, occupational pensions, maintenance payments as well as property owned (other than the family home) and capital such as savings, shares and other investments. </p>  <p>  The means-tested social assistance payments for which maintenance payments are assessed as means are jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance; disability allowance; farm assist; state pension non-contributory; supplementary welfare allowance; blind pension; one-parent family payment; pre-retirement allowance; and widow&rsquo;s, widower&rsquo;s or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s non-contributory pension.</p>  <p>  For these schemes, maintenance payments (including maintenance payments made to or in respect of a qualified child) are assessed by first disregarding any housing costs incurred up to &euro;4,952 per annum (or &euro;95.23 per week), and then assessing the remainder at 50%. </p>  <p>  Accordingly, the total value of any maintenance payments is never assessed as means for these weekly income support payments and the total income received by the family (social welfare payment and maintenance payment combined) will be higher than someone not receiving maintenance payments. </p>  <p>  Maintenance payments made to qualified adults of social insurance payments, as well as working family payment recipients, are also assessed as means. </p>  <p>  Unlike schemes such as jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and one parent family payment, the working family payment (formerly FIS) is an income supplement for employees who work 19 hours or more per week.  It is an income tested scheme and account is taken, in determining entitlement, of all net income from employment, weekly welfare payments (if payable), income from any self-employment, maintenance payments and income from any other source.  A family in receipt of maintenance will always be better off than a family where maintenance is not a factor as the working family payment replaces 60% of the difference between total family income and the relevant income threshold.</p>  <p>  A small proportion of lone parents are also in receipt of rent supplement, in addition to a one-parent family payment and the working family payment.  The rent supplement assessment provides for a gradual withdrawal of payment as income increases.  Income from employment and working family payment (formerly FIS) in excess of the standard Supplementary Welfare Allowance weekly rate of payment attract an additional income disregard and are assessed as follows: the first &euro;75 of such additional income together with 25% of any additional income above &euro;75 can be disregarded for means assessment purposes. </p>  <p>  For rent supplement, maintenance payments of up to &euro;95.23 per week are assessed in determining the appropriate rate payable (vouched weekly rent or mortgage costs of up to this amount are disregarded in establishing the rate of one-parent family payment payable). Where a person has weekly maintenance payments of more than &euro;95.23, it is assessed under rent supplement using the formula as outlined.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that multiple means assessments can only occur in a situation where the claimant is in receipt of multiple sources of income from the State.  The purpose of means testing is to ensure that resources are targeted to those with the most financial need.  The current method of means assessment ensures that appropriate levels of support are available to those who need them, across the wide range of income supports available from my Department.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The duties of a pension scheme trustee include administering a scheme in trust in accordance with the law and the terms of the trust deed and rules.  Consequently, any decision made by corporate or individual trustees of an occupational pension scheme are governed by the relevant legislation and rules set out in the trust deed and the rules of the particular scheme.  Trustees of pension schemes must act in the best financial interests of the scheme members and must serve all beneficiaries of the scheme impartially.  If there is a conflict of interest then a person&rsquo;s duty as a trustee must take precedence over other interests. </p>  <p>  While current legislation does not specifically provide that member trustees must include at least one or more pensioner members (nor does it provide that member trustees must include one or more active members) it does provide an opportunity for such membership and pensioner members may avail of that opportunity to become scheme trustees or nominate others to act on their behalf.</p>  <p>  The rules governing the role of trustees are regularly reviewed and enhanced.  The Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2013 amended section 50 of the Act to broaden the options available to the trustees of a pension scheme when considering a restructure of scheme benefits.  The restructuring of scheme benefits under section 50 of the Pensions Act must comply with the requirements of the Pensions Act and the criteria set out in statutory guidance.  Before the trustees make an application to the Pensions Authority, they must consult with the employer, the scheme member, with pensioners and with the authorised trade union representing members.  Trustees must undertake a comprehensive review of the scheme with a view to the long term stability and sustainability of the scheme.  In advance of any application the trustees must notify all members of the scheme, including pensioners, in writing of :</p>  <p>  - The circumstances giving rise to the proposed application and the reasons why the trustees believe an application is in compliance with their fiduciary duties,</p>  <p>  - The proposed benefit reductions which are to apply to each category of member or other person and the reasons for treating one or more categories of member or other person differently to others,</p>  <p>  - The fact that the trustees have requested additional contributions from the employers to avoid the necessity for a reduction in benefits and the response of the employers, and</p>  <p>  - General examples of the projected impact of the reduction(s) on members using such assumptions as the actuary deems appropriate. </p>  <p>  Members have 30 days to respond to the notification and their interests will be considered. </p>  <p>  Measures were also introduced in 2015 to facilitate engagement between the trustees of a pension scheme and groups representing the interests of pensioner and deferred scheme members.  Changes to guidance issued by the Pensions Authority require the trustees of a pension scheme to notify groups representing the interest of scheme members of proposals by the trustees of a defined benefit pension scheme to issue a direction under section 50 of the Pensions Act to restructure scheme benefits.  This affords the representative group an opportunity to make a submission to the trustees of a pension scheme in relation to proposals to restructure scheme benefits.  These changes facilitate engagement between groups representing the interests of pensioner and deferred scheme members and the Pension Authority and the trustees of a pension scheme.  Consequently, I would expect that any group that is recognised for the purposes of collective representation with the trustees of a pension scheme could seek to engage voluntarily with the enterprise involved in talks or trade disputes with employees. </p>  <p>  Last year the Pensions Authority carried out a public consultation process on proposals to impose higher standards for trustees.  The transposition of the new EU Directive IORP II by January 2019 will also further advance the duties and supervision of trustees.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Under such an order accrued benefits relating to members&rsquo; past service can be reduced.   Prior to making an application to the Pensions Authority, trustees must have undertaken a comprehensive review of the scheme with a view to the long term stability and sustainability of the scheme.  Before making an application for a section 50 direction, the trustees must notify in writing, all members of the scheme and any other person in receipt of benefits under the scheme, and also notify any authorised trade union representing members, or any representative group that meets certain requirements.</p>  <p>  Scheme members subject to a Section 50 amendment must be notified in advance of the proposed reductions.

The Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2013 amended section 50 of the Act to broaden the options available to the trustees of a pension scheme when considering a restructure of scheme benefits.  These changes were designed to spread the risk of scheme underfunding across all scheme members and beneficiaries in any consideration of an application by the trustees of the scheme to restructure scheme benefits.

The time limit provisions contained in Section 81E relating to equal pension treatment and redress are derived from overarching legislative provisions pertaining to access to industrial relations machinery in Ireland.  Under that legislation access to industrial relations machinery, such as the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court, is limited to six months from the date of termination of the relevant employment, however, this may be extended to a further six months where reasonable cause is shown.    Where a pension scheme has an internal disputes resolution (IDR) procedure, this provides for a formal structure through which beneficiaries or potential beneficiaries can raise complaints or disputes and engage directly with the pension provider concerned.</p>  <p>  If an individual is dissatisfied with the outcome of an IDR process he/she may advance a complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman, who is an independent and impartial statutory officer responsible for investigating and ruling on complaints from active members, deferred members and beneficiaries of occupational pension schemes, trust Retirement Annuity Contracts (RACs) or Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs).  The time limits for making a complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman are set out under section 51 of the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman Act 2017 which comes within the remit of the Minister for Finance.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, I do not intend to bring forward any changes in this area to the Pensions Act 1990 at this time. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The aim of the scheme is to move people away from the use of high cost moneylenders as a mechanism to provide for their planned financial needs and to provide an alternative, legitimate, and low cost personal loan scheme.The loans under the scheme range from &euro;100 to a maximum of &euro;2,000 and have a maximum interest rate of 12% per annum.  </p><p>An Implementation Group chaired by my Department and comprising all relevant stakeholders is working towards achieving a national roll-out of the scheme.</p><p>Currently, 109 credit unions at over 255 locations are in a position to offer the &lsquo;It Makes Sense Loan&rsquo;.  This represents almost 50%of the credit unions (excluding industrial), which could potentially participate in the scheme. </p><p>Of the 109 credit unions which have signed up to participate, 101 (93%) have issued loans under the scheme with 8 (7%) yet to write a loan. 3 credit unions (2.75%) have some restriction in place in relation to the loans available.</p><p>The aggregate value of loans drawn down under the scheme in 2016, 2017 and 2018, to dateis not readily available.  However during the pilot period from November 2015 to April 2016, 1,202 loans were issued with an aggregate value of &euro;720,000. </p><p>Since the inception of the scheme in November 2015, almost 7,500 loans have been drawn down.  Currently over 6,000 people are making PMC loan repayments by way of weekly deductions from their Social Welfare payment through the Household Budgeting Facility, with an unknown additional number using direct debit or standing orders.</p><p>Information on the scheme and regular updates, including the list of participating credit unions is available at <i>www.itmakessenseloan.ie</i>, a face book page <i>www.facebook.com/itmakessenseloan</i>and on <i>www.citizensinformation.ie</i></p><p>The availability of  the scheme has been promoted at local level, in the areas where credit unions are participating in the scheme.  The credit union representative groups support local credit unions in marketing the scheme through the provision of posters, leaflets and raising awareness in local media.  A number of other promotional methods have been used such as posters/flyers delivered to all Intreo Offices in the areas served by participating credit unions.  Additionally, the scheme is promoted at local level by the Money Advice and Budgeting Service and St Vincent de Paul.  </p><p>Incremental progress is being made towards extending the geographical coverage of the loan scheme through efforts to recruit credit unions to participate in the scheme.  In efforts to increase credit union participation in the scheme, feature articles have been placed in credit union publications such as CU Focus.  Promotion also takes place at appropriate events such as the Irish League of Credit Unions (ILCU) Annual General Meeting, the Credit Union Managers Association conference and events such as the National Ploughing Championships.</p><p>Engagement is continuing with the credit union representative bodies and individual credit unions to encourage wider participation; in this context.  I recently met with the Irish League of Credit Unions to discuss same.  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

The Scheme is open to eligible tenants, including joint tenants, of local authority houses that are available for sale under the Scheme.  To be eligible, tenants must meet certain criteria, including having a minimum reckonable income of &euro;15,000 per annum and having been in receipt of social housing support for at least one year.</p>  <p>  In line with the commitment given in Rebuilding Ireland, a review of the first 12 months of the Tenant Purchase Scheme&rsquo;s operation has been undertaken.  The review has incorporated analysis of comprehensive data received from local authorities regarding the operation of the scheme during 2016 and a wide-ranging public consultation process which took place in 2017 and saw submissions received from individuals, elected representatives and organisations.</p>  <p>  The review is now complete and a full report has been prepared setting out findings and recommendations.  In finalising the report some further consultation was necessary and due consideration had to be given to possible implementation arrangements.  These matters are now almost completed and I expect to be in a position to publish the outcome of the review shortly.</p></reply>

The current number of MEPs in the European Parliament is 750 plus the President with each Member State having between 6 and 96 Members.</p>  <p>  Council Decision 2013/312/EU provided that it would be revised again in advance of the 2019-2024 parliamentary term upon an initiative of the European Parliament to be presented before the end of 2016.  The launch of this process was, however, postponed by the European Parliament&rsquo;s Committee on Constitutional Affairs (i.e. the AFCO Committee) until after the referendum in the United Kingdom on its withdrawal from the European Union.</p>  <p>  On 7 September 2017, a draft report on the composition of the European Parliament for 2019-2024 was published by the AFCO Committee.  This draft report was adopted, with some amendments, at a plenary meeting of the AFCO Committee on 23 January 2018.  In broad terms, the revised report proposes, among other things, that:</p>  <p>  ­ when the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union becomes legally effective, 27 of the United Kingdom&rsquo;s 73 seats would be re-distributed among 14 Member States, of which 2 would go to Ireland, increasing Ireland&rsquo;s MEPs from 11 to 13 in number.  This would mean a reduction in the overall size of the European Parliament from 751 to 705 members;</p>  <p>  - however, as set out in the Parliament's resolution, if the date on which the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union becomes legally effective takes place after the European Parliament elections are held in mid-2019, the number of MEPs to be elected from each Member State for the 2019-2024 parliamentary term would remain the same as that of the current parliament.  The additional seats would only be filled on the date after which the United Kingdom's withdrawal becomes legally effective.</p>  <p>These proposals were approved and a resolution was subsequently adopted at a plenary of the European Parliament on 7 February 2018.  The European Parliament resolution which contains a Proposal for Decision of the European Council establishing the composition of the European Parliament   will now be considered by the European Council at its next formal meeting in June of this year.  Subject to the approval of the European Council, which will require a unanimous decision, the proposal will be returned to Parliament for a final vote.</p>  <p>  In the event that Ireland&rsquo;s total number of seats in the European Parliament is changed in respect of the 2019-2024 parliamentary term, it will be necessary to review our European constituency arrangements.  Section 5(1A) of the Electoral Act 1997 makes provision for the establishment of a committee to make a report in relation to European Parliament constituencies.  This was done in 2013 prior to the last elections to the European Parliament.</p></reply>
