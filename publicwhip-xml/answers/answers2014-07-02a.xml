    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-07-02a.7.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/951" speakername="Eamon Gilmore" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014070200068#WRA00600"><p>At the outset, I would like to take this opportunity to welcome the signature of the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement and Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area on the margins of the European Council last Friday. I am convinced that the Agreement will give an impetus for political and economic reforms, bringing about modernisation, strengthening of the rule of law and economic growth.</p><p>Against the backdrop of an extremely serious security situation in eastern Ukraine where government forces have been clashing with pro-Russian separatists, President Poroshenko declared a unilateral seven-day ceasefire on 20 June, subsequently extended to 30 June. The ceasefire was announced alongside a 15-point peace plan which envisages action in a number of areas, including de-escalating the security situation, addressing the humanitarian situation and pursuing political reform. The plan offers an amnesty to separatists who disarm voluntarily as well as corridors to allow Russian and Ukrainian &lsquo;mercenaries&rsquo; to return to Russia. It also envisages changes to the Ukrainian constitution to enable the devolution of more power to the regions, as well as greater protection for Russian-language rights.</p><p>On 23 June, following talks facilitated by the OSCE, pro-separatist leaders in eastern Ukraine announced that they would adhere to a ceasefire. Although the OSCE reported that the security situation in eastern Ukraine improved following the announcement of the ceasefire, we remain very concerned about continued activity by armed separatists in the region which, tragically, has led to further casualties. The Ukrainian authorities have reported that the ceasefire had been violated 108 times and led to the deaths of 28 Ukrainian soldiers with 70 injured.</p><p>Ireland regrets all loss of life in the conflict and calls for urgent progress towards a peaceful solution to the crisis.  It is also of the utmost importance that   trilateral talks between Russia, Ukraine and the OSCE achieve tangible results soon, to prevent further loss of life. </p><p>Ukraine was discussed at the EU Foreign Affairs Council last week, which the T&aacute;naiste attended. Ministers were briefed on the current situation by the new Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, Pavel Klimkin, who presented the peace plan and called for our support. In its conclusions, the Council welcomed the peace plan as a major chance for de-escalation and commended President Poroshenko&rsquo;s determined actions towards peace and stability in Ukraine since his inauguration. Ministers also called on the Russian Federation to support the peace plan and adopt effective measures to stop the continued flow of illegal fighters, arms and equipment over the border into Ukraine. The Council conclusions also reaffirmed the EU&rsquo;s strong condemnation of the illegal annexation of Crimea and Sevastopol.  <i></i></p><p>Ukraine was also discussed at the European Council last Friday when President Poroshenko met with EU leaders. The HOSG subsequently called for several steps to be taken by Monday of this week, including agreement on a verification mechanism, monitored by the OSCE, for the ceasefire and for effective control of the border. After that, the European Council will assess the situation and reconvene if required to take what decisions may be necessary. For his part, President Poroshenko indicated that he would be prepared to further extend the ceasefire if there was compliance with the conditions set by the European Council. Regrettably, in the absence of such compliance over the weekend, President Poroshenko announced the resumption of military operations against the separatists yesterday. He made clear that he was willing to reinstate the ceasefire if it became clear that all sides were ready to carry out all aspects of the peace plan.</p></reply>

Their key elements include devolution based on power-sharing; agreement on sovereignty; human rights; parity of esteem; and support for the rule of law. These principles have rightly been at the centre of the Government&rsquo;s approach to politics in Northern Ireland.</p><p>  The continued shared responsibility of the two governments is to guarantee these principles and to support the implementation of both Agreements.  The Irish Government is determined to realise their full potential.  This is a vital and challenging responsibility which concerns us all. I continue to underline the urgent importance of fully realising the agreements with our partners in the British Government and with colleagues in the Northern Ireland Executive.</p><p>  Progress in implementing the Agreements has benefited all of the people of this island. However, there is still work to be done regarding some outstanding elements of the Agreements. These include the introduction of an Irish Language Act for Northern Ireland, the establishment of a North/South Consultative Forum and the implementation of a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland. These measures have the potential to significantly enrich the cultural and political life of citizens across this island.</p><p>  The Government will continue to take every opportunity to advance progress on the outstanding elements of the Agreements.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-07-02a.13.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/951" speakername="Eamon Gilmore" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014070200068#WRA01200"><p>Large sporting events such as the World Cup have enormous potential to benefit widely the societies in which they take place and this has increasingly become a consideration for host countries, as the positive experience of the 2012 London Olympics has shown.  The Brazilian Government&rsquo;s projections are that the 2014 World Cup will increase the country&rsquo;s GDP by almost 10 billion Euro and that, as well as investments in the match stadiums, the World Cup has led to an acceleration of investment in roads, airports and public transportation.</p><p>While staging international sporting events may provide enormous benefits, it is important that host countries respect human rights and ensure that fundamental freedoms are upheld in preparing for and hosting the events.</p><p>Staging large sporting events also brings with it worldwide scrutiny.   Audiences will tune in from around the world in their millions and the interest generated will go beyond just the games.   All aspects of the country will be scrutinised including the host nation&rsquo;s human rights record. </p><p>In this regard, I am currently very concerned about the reports of abuse of workers&rsquo; rights in Qatar, a country with the highest ratio of migrants to citizens in the world.  Nearly 88 per cent of the total population are foreign workers, employed largely in construction, services and domestic work. The presence of large numbers of migrant workers in the Gulf area, especially in construction, is of course a long-standing phenomenon and does not relate solely to the World Cup.</p><p>In November 2013, the UN Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants, Fran&ccedil;ois Cr&eacute;peau, urged the Qatari authorities to ensure that its labour laws are reformed to ensure that they adhere to international standards.  I fully support Mr. Cr&eacute;peau&rsquo;s findings and call on the Qatari Government to continue to cooperate with his office and the UN International Labour Organisation and to implement their recommendations in order to improve the situation of migrant workers and their families in the country.   </p><p>I believe it is critical that Qatar proves it is making real efforts to improve the protection of the rights of all workers, including construction workers, ahead of the FIFA World Cup scheduled for 2022.  In this regard, I welcome FIFA&rsquo;s promises to demand high standards in the area of workers&rsquo; rights, as well as FIFA&rsquo;s request that the Qatari authorities provide a report detailing improvements that have been made in terms of labour standards since the visit of its President, Mr. Sepp Blatter, to the Emirate in November 2013.  </p><p>I also would like to take this opportunity to reiterate the message delivered by Ireland during Qatar&rsquo;s Universal Periodic Review at the United Nations Human Rights Council on May 7 2014, in which we urged the Qatari authorities to undertake a thorough review of the regulatory regime for migrant workers in order to ensure that it adheres to international human rights and labour standards.</p><p>I led a trade mission to Qatar at the beginning of June and took the opportunity to privately raise with Qatari Government Ministers concerns regarding Human Rights particularly in relation to reports of violations of the rights of migrant workers and the denial of the right to the freedom of movement.  While the conversations were confidential, Qatari Ministers confirmed that they were aware of the issues related to the <i>Kafala</i>system of sponsorship and noted that they are working on legislation which would, among other things, address the &ldquo;exit visa&rdquo; system.  The <i>Kafala</i>system requires all unskilled labourers to have an in-country sponsor, usually their employer, who is responsible for their visa and legal status.  It has been criticised as many employers take away passports and abuse their workers with little risk of legal repercussions.</p><p>The human rights situation in the Russian Federation came under the spotlight in the lead-up to the Winter Olympic Games in Sochi in February 2014. The rights of migrant workers, as well as LGBTI rights and freedom of the press, were a particular focus of attention, and this is to be welcomed.</p><p>The EU was aware of reports that migrant workers were employed during preparations for the Games and I can confirm that the rights of such workers and ethnic minorities in the Russian Federation were discussed at the EU&rsquo;s structured human rights consultations with Russia which took place on 28 November 2013.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the decisions to award games to countries are not made by national governments but by Sports governing bodies &ndash; FIFA as the governing association of soccer in the case of the World Cup and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in the case of the Olympic games. </p><p>It has recently been reported that in apparent response to recent controversy over the rights of workers in Qatar, senior officials at FIFA, are for choosing future host countries.   I would very much welcome this in the awarding of such events. </p></reply>

However, there is still work to be done regarding some outstanding elements of the Agreements.Since the restoration of the devolved Institutions on 8 May 2007, the question of an Irish Language Act for Northern Ireland  is the responsibility of the Northern Ireland Executive and, in particular, the Minister for Culture, Arts and Leisure, Ms. Car&aacute;l N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n MLA.   I will continue to press in my discussions with the Northern Ireland Executive and with the British Government the urgent need to address this issue and to legislate for an Irish Language Act.</p><p>  I remain convinced that the establishment of a North/South Consultative Forum, comprising representatives of civil society on the island, would contribute to the constructive discussion of key societal challenges.  The Government has continued to express support for such a body, including at the November 2013 plenary meeting of the North South Ministerial Council.  The Government will do so again in the context of the North South Ministerial Council Plenary meeting taking place in Dublin this Friday.  On my regular visits to Northern Ireland, I continue the practice of engaging with civil society representatives.  </p><p>  A Bill of Rights drawn up by agreement between the main parties of the Assembly could formally specify the rights underpinning a reconciled society in Northern Ireland. I continue to urge all the parties in the Northern Ireland Assembly to engage in constructive discussion with a view to reaching agreement on the substance of a Bill of Rights.  I, and my officials, will continue to engage with our counterparts in the British Government and in the Northern Ireland Executive on this matter. </p><p>  As I said in reply to an earlier question today, the principles and values of the Good Friday Agreement and the subsequent St. Andrew&rsquo;s Agreement are essential to peace and reconciliation in Ireland and across these islands.  The continued shared responsibility of the two governments is to guarantee these principles and to support the implementation of both Agreements.

These conditions continue to apply.</p><p>  Furthermore, under the Air Navigation (Carriage of Munitions of War, Weapons and Dangerous Goods) Order 1973, the carriage of weapons through Shannon Airport on commercial aircraft is prohibited unless an exemption has been obtained in advance from my colleague, the Minister for Transport. The carriage of the personal weapons of US military personnel on board chartered aircraft in transit through Shannon Airport is subject to the issuance of such an exemption in respect to each individual flight. </p><p>  I have therefore not sought specific assurances from the US that military advisers travelling to Iraq will not be landing at Shannon Airport. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-07-02a.22.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/951" speakername="Eamon Gilmore" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014070200068#WRA02100"><p>In my address to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade last week I condemned the severe sentences imposed by a court in Cairo on 23 June on a number of Al Jazeera journalists for essentially doing no more than their job. </p><p>  I share the widespread international concern over this verdict, which amounts to the criminalisation of the legitimate activities of a free press.  This verdict represents an unacceptable restriction on freedom of expression and fundamentally undermines the credibility of the Egyptian judicial system.</p><p>  There has been widespread international criticism of the verdict in this latest case, including by UNSG Ban, who warned that they could undermine Egypt&rsquo;s stability. The UN Human Right Commissioner, Navi Pillay, expressed her shock and alarm at the verdicts which she pointed out were rife with procedural irregularities and in breach of international human rights law. </p><p>  The issue was also discussed briefly at the Foreign Affairs Council meeting in Luxembourg which I attended on 23 June. High Representative Ashton issued a statement after the meeting on behalf of the EU expressing the concern of the Council about the verdicts as well as about the death sentences imposed against more than 180 people following the recent well-publicised trial in Minya, Upper Egypt.  </p><p>  The Government has been active in conveying its concerns generally over the current trends in relation to observance of human rights in Egypt. I have made clear in reply to earlier questions in this House my strong concerns over the recent mass sentencing of individuals to the death penalty in two trials in Minya, Upper Egypt. These concerns have been conveyed directly to the Egyptian authorities, most recently by senior officials in my Department at a meeting with the Egyptian Embassy earlier this week which also relayed my concerns over the recent Al Jazeera verdicts as well as the continued detention of Ibrahim Halawa. Our Embassy in Cairo has also regularly raised these and other human rights issues with the Egyptian authorities . High Representative Ashton also met with the then Egyptian Foreign Minister, Nabil Fahmy, last March to convey the EU&rsquo;s strong concerns about the conduct of the Minya trials. </p><p>  Ireland also co-sponsored a cross-regional statement on the human rights situation in Egypt at the UN Human Rights Council in March. The need for the Egyptian authorities to start vindicating the human rights provisions contained in Egypt&rsquo;s new constitution will continue to be clearly communicated in our ongoing contacts with the Egyptian authorities, both here and through our Embassy in Cairo.</p><p>  In relation to the case of Ibrahim Halawa, I answered a parliamentary question last week setting out in detail each of the interventions which Ireland has made, at both Ministerial and diplomatic level, to represent our deep concerns over his detention and continued imprisonment, as well as the lack of clarity surrounding the charges he is facing.  We have repeatedly stressed to the Egyptian authorities that due process must be afforded to Mr. Halawa, and that they must ensure that his basic human right to a fair trial is upheld.   As I indicate above, further representations have been made since then. We regard his well-being and the upholding of his rights as a matter of extreme gravity and will continue to make clear our position to the Egyptian authorities at every opportunity.</p></reply>

My programme included separate discussions with Congressman Luis Gutierrez, Congressman Paul Ryan, Senator Pat Leahy, members of the Congressional Friends of Ireland Group, House Judiciary Committee Member Congressman Mark Amodei, Congressman Mario Diaz-Balart, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, House Democratic Caucus Chairman Congressman Xavier Becerra and White House Domestic Policy Council Director Ms. Cecilia Munoz. I also met with Irish-American community leaders, including from the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform, the Chicago Celts for Immigration Reform, Irish Apostolate USA and the Ancient Order of Hibernians, with whom the Government has worked closely on our shared U.S. immigration reform agenda.</p><p>  Each of my meetings proved very useful, offering different insights and analyses into the prospects for when progress towards legislation that would provide relief for currently undocumented Irish migrants and also a facility for additional future legal migration between Ireland and the U.S. There was widespread consensus that an already complex political landscape had become even more complicated by the electoral defeat earlier in the month of the Republican House Majority Leader. The general sense which I received from interlocutors was that further time would be needed to assess the full implications of this development for ongoing immigration reform efforts, particularly from the perspective of the upcoming Congressional mid-term elections.

The Al- Qaeda linked islamist militia known as ISIS, with allied Sunni groupings, have captured large parts of northern and western Iraq, including the major city of Mosul. It is also targeting key installations such as the country&rsquo;s largest oil refinery. </p><p>  The Government has previously warned of failings and inattention on the part of the current Iraqi Government in actively promoting reconciliation with the minority Sunni community. These concerns have now been shown to be wholly justified. The ISIS advance has been concentrated in Sunni-dominated areas and has only been possible because disaffected local Sunni forces, many of whom had earlier fought Al-Qaeda during the US-led surge in 2006, decided to joined forces with them. </p><p>  The T&aacute;naiste discussed the crisis in Iraq with EU colleagues at the Foreign Affairs Council on 23 June. The Council agreed Conclusions condemning the recent attacks by ISIS, and reports of horrific atrocities. The Council emphasised that a security solution alone cannot resolve the current crisis, but must be combined with a sustainable political solution through outreach by the Iraqi Government to local communities and Iraqi society as a whole. Following the elections on 30 April, the Council also called on Iraq&rsquo;s political leaders to negotiate as soon as possible the formation of a government representative of all Iraqi society. Similar messages were also set out in the Joint Declaration of EU and Arab League Foreign Ministers meeting in Athens on 11 June, which I attended.</p><p>  The Foreign Affairs Council on 23 June also expressed its serious concern at the humanitarian situation amid a further massive civilian displacement of some 500,000 people arising from the current emergency. The EU has increased its humanitarian assistance to Iraq to a total of &euro;12 million this year. Ireland, for its part, is sending an airlift, worth &euro;220,000, to be distributed by GOAL, which recently also received &euro;200,000 to support their emergency response in northern Iraq. A further allocation of &euro;75,000 to another Irish Aid NGO partner, Christian Aid Ireland, brings the Government&rsquo;s total humanitarian assistance to Iraq in 2014 to &euro;655,000.&rdquo; </p></reply>

My programme included separate discussions with Congressman Luis Gutierrez, Congressman Paul Ryan, Senator Pat Leahy, members of the Congressional Friends of Ireland Group, House Judiciary Committee Member Congressman Mark Amodei, Congressman Mario Diaz-Balart, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, House Democratic Caucus Chairman Congressman Xavier Becerra and White House Domestic Policy Council Director Ms. Cecilia Munoz. I also met with Irish-American community leaders, including from the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform, the Chicago Celts for Immigration Reform, Irish Apostolate USA and the Ancient Order of Hibernians, with whom the Government has worked closely on our shared U.S. immigration reform agenda.</p><p>  Each of my meetings proved very useful, offering different insights and analyses into the prospects for when progress towards legislation that would provide relief for currently undocumented Irish migrants and also a facility for additional future legal migration between Ireland and the U.S. There was widespread consensus that an already complex political landscape had become even more complicated by the electoral defeat earlier in the month of the Republican House Majority Leader. The general sense which I received from interlocutors was that further time would be needed to assess the full implications of this development for ongoing immigration reform efforts, particularly from the perspective of the upcoming Congressional mid-term elections.

This verdict represents an unacceptable restriction on freedom of expression and fundamentally undermines the credibility of the Egyptian judicial system.</p><p>There has been widespread international criticism of the verdict in this latest case, including by UNSG Ban, who warned that they could undermine Egypt&rsquo;s stability. The UN Human Right Commissioner, Navi Pillay, expressed her shock and alarm at the verdicts which she pointed out were rife with procedural irregularities and in breach of international human rights law. </p><p>The issue was also discussed briefly at the Foreign Affairs Council meeting in Luxembourg which I attended on 23 June. High Representative Ashton issued a statement after the meeting on behalf of all EU member states expressing the concern of the Council about the verdicts as well as about the death sentences imposed against more than 180 people following the recent well-publicised trial in Minya, Upper Egypt.  </p><p>Egypt&rsquo;s new constitution provides guarantees for the fundamental rights of its people which the Egyptian courts, regrettably, do not appear to have fully recognized in a number of recent verdicts. This is deeply worrying to those of us who wish to support Egypt and the Egyptian people in their ongoing difficult transition to democracy. It is a message which continues to be clearly communicated in our ongoing contacts with the Egyptian authorities, both here and through our Embassy in Cairo, most recently by senior officials in my Department at a meeting with the Egyptian Embassy earlier this week which also relayed my concerns over the recent Al Jazeera verdicts as well as the continued detention of Ibrahim Halawa.  <font color="#004080"> </font></p></reply>

The conflict has been characterised by ongoing and persistent violations, by all parties to the conflict, of international humanitarian and human rights law, including the denial of humanitarian access to those in need. UN Security Council Resolution 2139, adopted in February 2014, expressly demands that all parties &ndash; and, in particular, the Syrian authorities -  promptly allow rapid, safe and unhindered humanitarian access, including across conflict lines and across border, to ensure humanitarian assistance reaches people in need.</p><p>  In his fourth report on the implementation of this Resolution, presented to the Security Council on 20 June, the UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon highlighted the lack of progress and ongoing deterioration in the humanitarian situation, particularly around the issue of sustained humanitarian access to those in hard-to-reach areas. The current estimated population in areas that are difficult or impossible for humanitarian organisations to reach has risen to 4.7 million people. This includes at least 241,000 people who live in areas that are besieged by either Government or opposition forces. Only 33 of the 262 locations identified as being hard to reach or besieged were reached with food and nutrition assistance, and non-food items were provided for just 269,000 people in these areas. </p><p>  I am aware of the views expressed by the Executive Director of Human Rights Watch. I believe that negotiated access remains the most effective approach. Despite the challenging and dangerous operational environment on the ground, humanitarian agencies including the UN remain committed and prepared to scale up operations and provide life-saving assistance to men, women and children in need throughout the country. </p><p>  Emergency Relief Coordinator Valerie Amos has confirmed that nearly 3.3 million people received food assistance from the World Food Programme and partners in May; more than 16 million people were assisted with clean drinking water through the provision of chlorination tablets by UNICEF and partners; around 2.9 million children were vaccinated against polio in the latest round; 2.3 million people received critically needed non-food items from UNHCR and its partners; and 4 million people received medical assistance by WHO and partners in the first five months of 2014.  Regardless of these very considerable achievements, the fact remains that humanitarian access across Syria is exceptionally difficult as a result of increasing disregard by armed groups on both sides of the conflict of their obligations under International Humanitarian Law.</p><p>  Ireland has been to the fore in the international efforts to help alleviate the suffering of the Syrian people and is one of the most generous contributors to the humanitarian response on a per capita basis. Ireland has already exceeded our pledge of &euro;12 million in support throughout 2014 by &euro;2 million, bringing our overall funding commitment since the crisis began to &euro;28.011 million. Irish humanitarian assistance is provided not just through UN agencies but also through the Red Cross/Red Crescent movement as well as trusted NGO partners operating in different parts of the country, including in opposition-held areas. Ireland has consistently matched our material humanitarian contribution with concrete support to international efforts to find a sustainable political solution to the crisis, and to advocate for safe and unimpeded humanitarian access,   as well as for respect by all parties of International Humanitarian Law. We are saving lives through our support to those most affected by the conflict.  Ireland will continue to use every opportunity to advocate for the full and immediate implementation by all parties to the conflict of UN Security Council Resolution 2139 on humanitarian assistance in Syria. </p></reply>

This verdict represents an unacceptable restriction on freedom of expression and fundamentally undermines the credibility of the Egyptian judicial system.</p><p>  There has been widespread international criticism of the verdict in this latest case, including by UNSG Ban, who warned that they could undermine Egypt&rsquo;s stability. The UN Human Right Commissioner, Navi Pillay, expressed her shock and alarm at the verdicts which she pointed out were rife with procedural irregularities and in breach of international human rights law. </p><p>  The issue was also discussed briefly at the Foreign Affairs Council meeting in Luxembourg which I attended on 23 June. High Representative Ashton issued a statement after the meeting on behalf of the EU expressing the concern of the Council about the verdicts as well as about the death sentences imposed against more than 180 people following the recent well-publicised trial in Minya, Upper Egypt.  </p><p>  Egypt&rsquo;s new constitution provides guarantees for the fundamental rights of its people which the Egyptian courts, regrettably, do not appear to have fully recognized in a number of recent verdicts. This is deeply worrying to those of us who wish to support Egypt and the Egyptian people in their ongoing difficult transition to democracy. It is a message which continues to be clearly communicated in our ongoing contacts with the Egyptian authorities, both here and through our Embassy in Cairo, most recently by senior officials in my Department at a meeting with the Egyptian Embassy earlier this week which also relayed my concerns over the recent Al Jazeera verdicts as well as the continued detention of Ibrahim Halawa. </p></reply>

The Al- Qaeda linked islamist militia known as ISIS, with allied Sunni groupings, have captured large parts of northern and western Iraq, including the major city of Mosul. It is also targeting key installations such as the country&rsquo;s largest oil refinery.</p><p>  The Government has previously warned of failings and inattention on the part of the current Iraqi Government in actively promoting reconciliation with the minority Sunni community. These concerns have now been shown to be wholly justified. The ISIS advance has been concentrated in Sunni-dominated areas and has only been possible because disaffected local Sunni forces, many of whom had earlier fought Al-Qaeda during the US-led surge in 2006, decided to joined forces with them. </p><p>  The T&aacute;naiste discussed the crisis in Iraq with EU colleagues at the Foreign Affairs Council on 23 June. The Council agreed Conclusions condemning the recent attacks by ISIS, and reports of horrific atrocities. The Council emphasised that a security solution alone cannot resolve the current crisis, but must be combined with a sustainable political solution through outreach by the Iraqi Government to local communities and Iraqi society as a whole. Following the elections on 30 April, the Council also called on Iraq&rsquo;s political leaders to negotiate as soon as possible the formation of a government representative of all Iraqi society. Similar messages were also set out in the Joint Declaration of EU and Arab League Foreign Ministers meeting in Athens on 11 June, which I attended.</p><p>  The Foreign Affairs Council on 23 June also expressed its serious concern at the humanitarian situation amid a further massive civilian displacement of some 500,000 people arising from the current emergency. The EU has increased its humanitarian assistance to Iraq to a total of &euro;12 million this year. Ireland, for its part, is sending an airlift, worth &euro;220,000, to be distributed by GOAL, which recently also received &euro;200,000 to support their emergency response in northern Iraq. A further allocation of &euro;75,000 to another Irish Aid NGO partner, Christian Aid Ireland, brings the Government&rsquo;s total humanitarian assistance to Iraq in 2014 to &euro;655,000. &ldquo;</p></reply>

I also met with Irish-American community leaders, including from the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform, the Chicago Celts for Immigration Reform, Irish Apostolate USA and the Ancient Order of Hibernians, with whom the Government has worked closely on our shared U.S. immigration reform agenda.</p><p>  Each of my meetings proved very useful, offering different insights and analyses into the prospects for when progress towards legislation that would provide relief for currently undocumented Irish migrants and also a facility for additional future legal migration between Ireland and the U.S. There was widespread consensus that an already complex political landscape had become even more complicated by the electoral defeat earlier in the month of the Republican House Majority Leader. The general sense which I received from interlocutors was that further time would be needed to assess the full implications of this development for ongoing immigration reform efforts, particularly from the perspective of the upcoming Congressional mid-term elections. I found it encouraging that proponents of immigration reform in Congress appear determined to persist with their efforts and they hope that further progress may yet prove possible this year.</p><p>  As my visit took place, Mr. Kevin McCarthy was elected as the new Republican House Majority Leader. Through our Embassy in Washington and also directly, the Government looks forward to working further with Mr. McCarthy, House Speaker John Boehner and other key Congressional figures on both sides of the political aisle, and with the U.S. Administration, with a view  to advancing Ireland&rsquo;s immigration reform-related objectives.</p><p>  Since my return from Washington, I understand that there has been a further sharpening of the political engagement in the U.S. Congress in relation to the situation of unaccompanied migrant children who are seeking to enter the United States via its southern border. This may now impact negatively on the prospects for wider immigration reform progress being achieved over the immediate period ahead.  It would clearly be disappointing if this proves to be the case. Nevertheless, as I noted earlier, we will continue our intensive efforts to persuade members of Congress to seize every opportunity to make immigration reform a reality. </p></reply>

It brought together members of the Diaspora and the Government who were tasked to come up with new and innovative ways to help lift the country out of recession.  This first Forum recommended the establishment of the Global Irish Network, which was set up in 2010.</p><p>   Subsequent Forums took place in 2011 and 2013 and built on the work of the first.   The focus of these was on generating ideas for economic renewal, restoring our reputation overseas and creating jobs across a range of sectors.  The themes for the 2013 Forum were based on the Action Plan for Jobs agenda and the outcomes, where possible, have been included in the 2014 Action Plan.  Recommendations such as the Year of Irish Design in 2015, the placement of Origin Green ambassadors, the development of an agency to market Irish agri-business expertise globally, increased on-line trading for SME&rsquo;s and initiatives around Smart Ageing, among others, will all be taken forward in this context.</p><p>  Other ideas arising from the Forum have been taken forward independently by members of the Global Irish Network.  An idea for a new third level institution for the arts came out of the first Forum in 2009, and earlier this year, Uversity, a recognised college of the National College of Ireland, launched an MA programme in Creative Process with a choice of modules from 24 partner institutions.  The various Forums have also provided launch pads for other initiatives such as the Gathering, Connect Ireland and Limerick City of Culture.   </p><p>  To date, over 100 Global Irish Network members have signed up to provide mentoring and advice to Irish SME&rsquo;s through the Global Irish Contacts Programme run by Enterprise Ireland.  On a day to day basis Global Irish Network members provide the network of Embassies and State Agency offices with advice on sectoral and regional issues, they facilitate high level access to decision makers, encourage Foreign Direct Investment and help promote Ireland as a destination for both tourism and education. </p><p>  It is not possible to quantify how many jobs have been created as a direct result of the Global Irish Economic Forum.  However, I am confident that the impact of these events, together with the ongoing work of the members of the Global Irish Network, has been a significant factor in the restoration of our reputation abroad and the consequent economic benefits to Ireland.</p></reply>

I condemned this abduction and called for the urgent release of the three teenagers and their safe return to their families.</p><p>  The finding on Monday of the bodies of the three missing youths has sadly ended all such hopes. I have issued a statement on behalf of the Government condemning the killings and extending our sympathies to the bereaved families. There is no excuse for such actions. I know Deputies will share those sentiments.</p><p>  Israeli security forces launched extensive actions in Palestinian areas, seeking to locate the missing teenagers, but also striking at individuals or structures linked with Hamas, who they have claimed were responsible. In these operations, some hundreds of Palestinians have been detained, and perhaps as many as six have been killed. Some of those killed may have been engaged in protests, but none were alleged to be involved in the abductions. </p><p>  Such heavy handed measures, whatever the reasoning behind them, run the risk of proving counterproductive. It should be noted that President Abbas and the Palestinian authorities clearly condemned the abductions, and have expressed their regret over the deaths of the youths. Palestinian security forces actively assisted in searching for them, and indeed it was Palestinian police who first raised the alarm over their disappearance. Such cooperation is difficult to sustain alongside widespread and excessive use of force against Palestinian civilians by Israeli forces.</p><p>  It is deeply saddening that this episode has ended in this way. I call on all authorities to act in a responsible way so that there is no further loss of life.</p></reply>

We also urged UN member states to consider similar measures, in line with UN General Assembly Resolution 68/262 of 27 March 2014 concerning the territorial integrity of .</p><p>Ireland is also co-sponsoring a Ukrainian draft Resolution on assistance and cooperation with Kiev in the human rights field at the twenty-sixth session of the UN Human Rights Council currently underway in Geneva.  The draft Resolution reaffirms our   commitment to the sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity of Ukraine within its internationally recognised borders.</p><p>There have been several positive developments in recent weeks &ndash; not least the Presidential elections and the peace plan presented by President Poroshenko. As the Deputy will be aware from our meeting at last week&rsquo;s Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, Ireland fully supports the President&rsquo;s initiative which we hope will lead to the negotiated peaceful solution to the crisis in Ukraine that we all wish to see. However, the situation in Eastern Ukraine remains volatile and violence has continued despite the ceasefire announced by President Poroshenko on 20 June.  It is now all the more important that direct contacts between Ukraine and Russia bring rapid and tangible results, that the opportunity offered by the ceasefire is seized by all  and that the EU continues to support efforts towards de-escalation and stability.</p><p>The signature of the Association Agreement with Ukraine on 27 June on the margins of the European Council is an important symbol of the EU&rsquo;s continued commitment and support, and will provide further impetus to political and economic reform efforts.  President Poroshenko signed on behalf of Ukraine and shared his assessment of the prospects for a lasting settlement with the Taoiseach and other EU leaders. </p></reply>

Promoting and enhancing respect for human rights, together with core related principles such as freedom, equality, and the rule of law, form a very important part of the EU&rsquo;s dialogue and engagement with countries in the region. The right to religious freedom is an area of particular concern. Freedom of religion or belief is a fundamental human right and a prerequisite of any democratic state and I am greatly disturbed by the continuing, and indeed increasing, prevalence of persecution and attacks on people based on their religious beliefs, including in the Middle East region.</p><p>  Both Ireland and the EU attach great importance to combating such forms of discrimination or persecution based on religion or belief. In June 2013, under the Irish Presidency, the EU adopted Guidelines on the promotion and protection of freedom of religion or belief, which reaffirmed the EU&rsquo;s determination to promote, in its external human rights policy, freedom of religion or belief as a right to be exercised by everyone, everywhere. These Guidelines were a priority for the Irish Presidency and we engaged extensively in the drafting process. The EU has also taken a number of steps in recent years in support of freedom of religion or belief, including issuing Foreign Affairs Council Conclusions on the matter, for example in February 2011.</p><p>  Ireland raises regularly the issue of the safety of religious minorities through its official bilateral contacts with many countries in the region, stressing in particular the responsibility of any state or government to protect all its citizens and minorities. Of course, in situations of general instability and insecurity, such as in Iraq or Syria, this is especially difficult.  Ireland also works with our partners in the EU to raise the issue in multilateral fora such as the UN Human Rights Council, as part of the EU&rsquo;s human rights policy.  </p><p>  The issue of freedom of religion or belief is one of our priorities as a member of the UN Human Rights Council, and we have played a central role in the negotiation of two important resolutions on this issue in the past year. </p><p>  Officials from my Department also meet frequently with members of religious minorities from the Middle East region, to hear first hand their concerns and to discuss issues affecting their communities. They will continue to do so, and the protection and promotion of the right to freedom of religion or belief will remain a key element of our engagement with countries in the Middle East region. </p></reply>

The report referred to provides graphic details of further allegations of practices which are clearly unacceptable. My view is simple: Palestinian children in Israeli custody should be afforded the same rights, protection, and treatment under the law which Israel rightly considers appropriate for Israeli children, and in conformity with international standards.</p><p>Ireland has repeatedly drawn attention to concerns regarding the treatment of Palestinian prisoners, including minors.  We have also pursued these issues in cooperation with our EU partners, in particular in local coordination of EU Missions on human rights issues.  At the Universal Periodic Review of Israel at the UN Human Rights Council in October 2013, Ireland recommended, <i>inter alia</i>, that Israel end the practise of night arrests of children, the admissibility in evidence in military courts of written confessions in Hebrew signed by Palestinian children, the use of solitary confinement against minors, and the denial of access to family members or to legal representation.</p><p>These serious concerns were among those raised by Ireland in its statement under item 7 on &ldquo;the human rights situation in Palestine&rdquo; at the 25th  session of the Human Rights Council in March. In addition, Ireland raises its concerns bilaterally, both with the Israeli Embassy in Dublin and with the relevant authorities in Israel, at every appropriate opportunity. We will continue to do so. Ireland also provides financial support to Israeli and Palestinian NGOs who are active in bringing these issues to light. We have seen some improvements in the treatment of minors in detention. Reports, such as the one highlighted by the Deputy in this question, clearly demonstrate that much more remains to be done.</p></reply>

I condemned this abduction and called for the urgent release of the three teenagers and their safe return to their families.   The finding on Monday of the bodies of the three missing youths has sadly ended all such hopes. I have issued a statement on behalf of the Government condemning the killings and extending our sympathies to the bereaved families. There is no excuse for such actions. I know Deputies will share those sentiments.<br /><br />Israeli security forces launched extensive actions in Palestinian areas, seeking to locate the missing teenagers, but also striking at individuals or structures linked with Hamas, who they have claimed were responsible. In these operations, some hundreds of Palestinians have been detained, and perhaps as many as six have been killed. Some of those killed may have been engaged in protests, but none were alleged to be involved in the abductions. <br /><br />Such heavy handed measures, whatever the reasoning behind them, run the risk of proving counterproductive. It should be noted that President Abbas and the Palestinian authorities clearly condemned the abductions, and have expressed their regret over the deaths of the youths. Palestinian security forces actively assisted in searching for them, and indeed it was Palestinian police who first raised the alarm over their disappearance. Such cooperation is difficult to sustain alongside widespread and excessive use of force against Palestinian civilians by Israeli forces.<br /><br />It is deeply saddening that this episode has ended in this way. I call on all authorities to act in a responsible way so that there is no further loss of life.&rdquo;</blockquote>As I have stated in that reply, I consider the reaction of the Israeli security forces in response to have been, in some respects, counterproductive. I hope the Israeli authorities will take note of that.</p><p>But to seek to admonish them directly on this basis, at a time when they were still searching for three abducted teenagers, amid great public anxiety, or now when they are mourning a tragic loss, would itself be counterproductive in another sense, and I have not done so.</p></reply>

While increased support for eurosceptic parties and, more worryingly, parties with extreme views on some issues, is a cause of considerable concern, that support varies greatly across Member States and should not be overstated. A sizeable majority of voters registered their support for pro-EU parties, thus ensuring that they will continue to represent the largest political groups in the new European Parliament.</p><p>  I have discussed the outcome of the elections and its implications with EU counterparts on a number of occasions. On 27 May, the Taoiseach joined other EU Heads of State and Government in Brussels to discuss the significance of the results for the way the EU functions and how it is perceived. He stressed there, as I have stressed in my own meetings with EU colleagues, that our immediate focus must be on addressing the concerns raised by Europe&rsquo;s citizens and that this will best be achieved by prioritising measures to speed up economic recovery and spur job creation across the EU, including through the completion of Banking Union, deepening of the single market, and the negotiation of free trade agreements with external partners.</p><p>  I am pleased that these priorities were at the centre of the strategic agenda agreed at last week&rsquo;s European Council meeting. This sets out what the EU should focus on and how it should function, identifying five overarching priorities which will guide the work of the European Union over the next five years: stronger economies with more jobs; societies enabled to empower and protect; a secure energy and climate future; a trusted area of fundamental freedoms; and effective joint action in the world.</p><p>  In delivering on this agenda, above all in working to support employment growth, I believe the European Union will reaffirm its value and importance to our citizens. This, more than anything else, represents the best counterargument to populist euroscepticism. </p></reply>

The essential issues behind the breakdown were the profound lack of trust between the two sides, insufficient political commitment, particularly by the Israeli government, to reaching an agreement, and the continued and indeed accelerated expansion of Israeli settlements on Palestinian territory throughout the period of the negotiations.</p><p>  These are of course not new problems, and we have discussed them many times here in the Oireachtas, and indeed in the EU at the Foreign Affairs Council.</p><p>  I have called for a substantial review by the EU of its policies and levers on the Middle East issue, and I hope this will begin at the July Foreign Affairs Council. Such a review is clearly critical if we are to maintain the prospect of a viable, two-State solution.</p><p>  The EU should of course continue to give what support and encouragement it can to a resumption of negotiations, which are the only way to reach a solution. But negotiations for their own sake are of no use, there must be a real commitment to find agreement on the core issues and to make the difficult compromises that inevitably will be involved. </p><p>  The two state solution remains the only outcome which could satisfy the aspirations of both parties, but the possibility of achieving it is increasingly threatened by various destructive Israeli policies on the ground.  In my view, the EU should therefore use the influence and leverage at its disposal to give effect to its disapproval of these policies, and above all the relentless expansion of settlements. </p><p>  Possible release of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel is a matter between the Palestinian and Israeli leaders. The non-release by Israel of the final group of prisoners previously agreed to be released was a significant element in the breakdown of the talks, and I stated at the time that I believed the release should have gone ahead. We are all aware, however, of the sensitivity of this issue in any society.</p></reply>

I have strongly condemned the abduction of more than 200 schoolgirls from the northern Nigerian town of Chibok by the terrorist organisation, Boko Haram, on 14 April. I am also appalled by continuing reports of violent attacks, including further abductions, throughout Nigeria.</p><p>I have given my full support to the clear demands of the United Nations Secretary General, Ban Ki-Moon, and the High Representative of the European Union, Catherine Ashton, that the girls abducted in Chibok be released and that those responsible be brought to justice.  I welcome the support now being provided to the Nigerian authorities from a number of our EU partners and from the USA, to help find the missing schoolgirls.</p><p>  At its meeting in Brussels on 12 May, the EU Foreign Affairs Council underlined the EU&rsquo;s concern at the terrorist attacks in northern Nigeria, strongly condemned the abduction of the schoolgirls and called for their immediate and unconditional release.  The Council emphasised the EU&rsquo;s readiness to support the Nigerian authorities in the resolution of this crime and their ongoing efforts to defeat terrorism in all its forms, in full respect of human rights. </p><p>  On 26 May, the EU agreed to fund a further series of measures, including the provision of technical assistance to the Office of the National Security Advisor to implement and coordinate counter terrorism legislation and crisis management structures, and to develop capacity to address the issue of increasing radicalisation and recruitment. </p><p>  	On 22 May, the UN Security Council Al Qaida Sanctions Committee approved the addition of Boko Haram to its list of individuals and entities subject to targeted financial sanctions and an arms embargo. With effect from the 29 May, the EU added Boko Haram to the lists of groups covered by the freezing of funds and economic resources.   </p><p>  The Boko Haram group has been condemned by the African Union and the Economic Community of West African States. In May 2013, the International Criminal Court determined that allegations of crimes by Boko Haram and the Nigerian security forces could be considered within the scope of the Statute dealing with war crimes in internal armed conflict.  The United Nations Office for West Africa is also working to integrate UN supports in the region to assist Nigeria&rsquo;s efforts.   </p><p>  Our Embassy in Abuja, working in cooperation with EU and other key partners, is in close contact with the Nigerian authorities, who have the primary responsibility for the resolution of the case of the missing school girls and of the broader security situation.

This is true of prisoners held by Israel, by the Palestinian authority, and indeed much more widely throughout the region. In some cases this reflects the general need in the broader region to improve standards of human rights protections, in some cases it relates to the specific circumstances of the conflict in the area.

The EU has supported mediation efforts by the African Union and the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD).</p><p>The conflict and ongoing humanitarian crisis in South Sudan has been discussed by the European Union Foreign Affairs Council on a number of occasions since the outbreak of violence there in December 2013, with an in-depth discussion held most recently on 17 March 2014.</p><p>On 15 May 2014 the African Union and the EU jointly welcomed an agreement to resolve the crisis in South Sudan signed by President Salva Kiir and former Vice President Riek Machar on 9 May 2014.  The EU and the African Union also urged the two sides to fully implement all agreements that have been signed to date, including the 23 January Cessation of Hostilities Agreement<font color="#2F2F2F">. </font>EU Development Ministers further discussed the crisis with High Representative Catherine Ashton on 19 May. </p><p>Moreover, we have been working with the United Nations to protect civilians and provide humanitarian relief wherever possible. The UN Security Council unanimously agreed on 27 May 2014 to reorient the UN Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) to focus on the protection of civilians.  The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs<b></b>(OCHA)<b></b>co-hosted the Humanitarian Pledging Conference for South Sudan in Oslo from 19 to 20 May, at which donors pledged more than $600 million. Ireland pledged &euro;2 million at the Oslo conference,   to support life saving work of UN and NGO partners in the country, and this pledge has been fulfilled. In total, Irish Aid funding for the humanitarian crisis in South Sudan amounts to almost &euro;5 million to date in 2014. Our support has saved and continues to save many lives.</p><p>Five members of the Irish Permanent Defence Force are currently deployed for service with the United Nations Mine Action Service (UNMAS) at UNMISS and my Department has also deployed a number of civilian experts to the UNMAS mission through the Rapid Response Initiative.</p><p>Ireland will continue to advocate at all relevant international fora for increased support to the humanitarian relief effort both within South Sudan and for South Sudanese refugees and host communities in neighbouring countries. We will continue to monitor the situation closely and provide assistance, within our means and as the situation evolves.</p></reply>

Member States are resolved to do all they can to help facilitate an inclusive and negotiated settlement and have actively engaged in efforts to promote dialogue between all sides, including the Russian Federation, since the outset of the crisis.  Now that the EU&rsquo;s relationship with Ukraine has been strengthened by the signature of the Association Agreement and Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area at the European Council on Friday, it is important that we continue to actively encourage progress towards peace and stability.</p><p>  Ukraine was a major focus of discussions both at the EU Foreign Affairs Council on 23 June and at the European Council on Friday of last week. The Foreign Affairs Council, which I attended, was briefed on recent developments in Ukraine by its newly-appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs, Pavlo Klimkin, while President Poroshenko met with EU Heads of State and Government during the European Council on Friday.   The EU used these occasions to voice its strong support for President Poroshenko&rsquo;s 15-point peace plan, which was announced on 20 June, and to encourage all sides to adhere to the ceasefire that was unilaterally declared by the Ukrainian Government. </p><p>  I welcome the positive role played by EU leaders in promoting dialogue between the Government of Ukraine and the Russian Federation. On Sunday, Chancellor Merkel and President Hollande engaged in a two-hour telephone conversation with President Poroshenko and President Putin in order to promote progress towards the full implementation of the peace plan. The EU institutions have also played a constructive role in facilitating dialogue. In particular, the Commission chaired talks between Russia and Ukraine on the issue of gas supplies last month.  Although the parties have yet failed to reach an agreement, the EU Commissioner for Energy, G&uuml;nther Oettinger, has contacted both sides in recent days to encourage them to return to the negotiating table.</p><p>  The European Council last Friday also expressed its support for the OSCE monitoring of the implementation of the peace plan in Ukraine as well as for its role in supporting the ceasefire and the establishment of effective border controls. Nationally, Ireland is providing &euro;100,000 to OSCE activities in Ukraine and has contributed significant numbers of personnel to OSCE projects, including five members of the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine and 16 observers of the OSCE/ODIHR election observation mission which oversaw the Presidential elections on 25 May.</p></reply>

Although reaching a political resolution is a difficult challenge, it remains the best option and the only alternative to the further intensification of the military conflict. UN Secretary General Ban is likely in the near future to announce a new Special Representative to replace former Joint Special Representative Brahimi who stood down at the end of May. The UN will continue to play a central role in efforts to chart a political resolution to the conflict in Syria, in conjunction with the members of the UN Security Council and all relevant international and regional stake-holders, including the EU.</p><p>   We support Resolution 2139 on the humanitarian situation in Syria which was approved by the UN Security Council in February, for which we had been calling for since last autumn. The latest report on the implementation of Resolution 2139 sets out very clearly that the fundamental obstacles to the provision of humanitarian assistance remain in place across Syria, and that the parties to the conflict remain in breach of international law. This resolution makes absolutely clear the obligations and duties on all parties, especially the Assad regime, to uphold humanitarian principles and international law. Full compliance without any further delay by all parties is the only acceptable response to the resolution.</p><p>  Ireland has so far disbursed over &euro;28 million in humanitarian relief since the beginning of the Syrian conflict.  The denial of access for humanitarian relief to the civilian population by the parties to the conflict is unacceptable and must end. So must such barbaric practices as besieging communities and attempting to starve them into submission.</p><p>  There must be full accountability for the very many horrific violations of human rights perpetrated against the Syrian people throughout this long conflict. We have consistently called on the UN Security Council to refer the many allegations of war crimes to the International Criminal Court and very much deplore the use of the veto by two Security Council members last May on a resolution calling for referral to the International Criminal Court. </p></reply>

These concerns are widely shared by our EU partners, as should be clear from the firmly worded Conclusions on Egypt adopted by the Foreign Affairs Council on 10 February. While welcoming the adoption of the new Egyptian constitution in January, the Council deplored the absence of a fully inclusive process leading up to the referendum as well as expressing concern over the deteriorating human rights situation and the continuing use of selective justice against the political opposition.</p><p>  Concern over human rights within Egypt has only intensified in the light of a series of extremely harsh sentences passed recently by the Egyptian courts. Ireland shares the widespread deep concern which has been expressed by many in the international community, including High Representative Ashton on behalf of the EU, regarding these verdicts and the clear failure to observe basic international standards governing the right to a fair trial.</p><p>  The human rights situation in Egypt was also considered at the March session of the UN Human Rights Council. Ireland was one of eighteen EU MSs who associated with a strong cross-regional statement delivered during the session outlining concerns about the human rights situation and urging the Egyptian government to fully comply with its international obligations as well as fully implement the human rights provisions contained in the new Constitution. The EU Special Representative for Human Rights has also visited Egypt on a number of occasions in recent months in order to discuss and encourage stronger efforts on the part of the Egyptian authorities in upholding and safeguarding human rights.</p></reply>

Ireland&rsquo;s Policy for International Development, <i>One World, One Future</i>, which was launched just over a year ago, reaffirms our commitment to maximizing the impact and accountability of the aid programme.</p><p>To ensure that our assistance is effectively delivered to those most in need in developing countries, Irish Aid works in partnership with national and local Governments, local communities, NGOs, and key multilateral partners such as the United Nations, the European Union, and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.</p><p>Accountability and transparency is at the core of all we do.  All programmes considered for funding assistance are rigorously appraised by Irish Aid staff using clear criteria, including efficiency in the use of resources, cost effectiveness and sustainability of intended impact.  Programmes in receipt of funding are subject to regular internal and external monitoring to ensure that the intended objectives and goals are being achieved.  They are regularly monitored by Embassy-based internal auditors, independent experts, and the Evaluation and Audit Unit of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.   The Unit&rsquo;s work is regularly reviewed by the independent Audit Committee of my Department.  In addition, the Comptroller and Auditor General provides independent assurance that Overseas Development Assistance is provided in accordance with the law, is managed to good effect, and is properly accounted for.  Moreover, peer reviews by the OECD have clearly stated that Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme is of the highest quality, characterised by its focus on poverty reduction and building the capacities of poor communities and national institutions in some of the poorest countries in the world.</p><p>Strengthening institutions is a key element in maximising the impact of the aid programme.  Accordingly, in Key Partner Countries benefiting from our support, we provide assistance to national Government oversight institutions, such as the Auditor General&rsquo;s Offices and the Public Accounts Committees of National Parliaments, to ensure governments are held to account for the effective expenditure of public funds.</p><p>The Irish Aid programme, managed by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, proactively manages risks and has a strong focus on value for money, transparency, accountability and sustainable results.  In the event of any fraud such as happened in Uganda in 2012, it is policy to demand a full refund of monies misappropriated.  As the Deputy will be aware, the Government of Uganda has fully refunded the &euro;4 million in aid funds which were misappropriated.   </p></reply>

On 24 February 2014 I launched a review of that strategy which was coordinated by my Department. A copy of the document was circulated to all members of the Oireachtas and the document is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p><p>  The review provides an update to our numerical targets and re-aligns our list of priority sectors so that they are aligned with the Action Plan for Jobs. It also introduces a &lsquo;new market approach&rsquo;, which disaggregates the list of our priority markets and includes additional high potential and exploratory markets to ensure that Ireland also engages with high growth markets in Asia, South America and Africa. In order to achieve our targets, the review provides a revised &lsquo;action plan model&rsquo;, which recognises the responsibility of Government to provide the best possible platform for companies and State agencies to win business overseas. These changes emphasise the positive benefits that accrue through maximising the coordination between Embassies and State agencies in the field and our coordination at home.</p><p>  Alongside its foreign policy, diplomatic and consular functions, the Embassy network is a key platform for the promotion of Ireland&rsquo;s trade, investment and tourism objectives. Recognising this role, the Government decided in January 2014 to open eight new Embassies and Consulates on five continents. Embassies will be opened in Bangkok (Thailand), Jakarta (Malaysia), Nairobi (Kenya) and Zagreb (Croatia), along with the reopening of Ireland&rsquo;s Embassy to the Holy See. Consulates-General will be opened in Hong Kong (China), Austin (Texas, US) and Sao Paolo (Brazil). These new Embassies and Consulates will equip Ireland to take advantage of emerging opportunities in these important markets.</p><p>  A detailed report of the work of the Embassy network in this area was published earlier this year and I have arranged for a copy to be forwarded to the Deputy&rsquo;s office.</p></reply>

Ireland and our EU partners would strongly encourage any such moves in Iran, and indeed I have myself discussed with Foreign Minister Zarif the possibility of resuming the EU-Iran Human Rights Dialogue, which was suspended in 2004. My Department has also provided the Iranian Foreign Ministry with information on human rights protection and mechanisms in this country.</p><p>  We have yet to see significant improvement on the ground in human rights. It may be that the new leadership&rsquo;s focus on trying to resolve the nuclear issue, and avoid negative domestic backlash, is limiting their ability to act concurrently in this sphere. But human rights is very much an area where positive words must be followed up with actions and changes on the ground, and this is an area we will continue to monitor closely, along with our EU partners.</p><p>  I would hope also that if agreement can be reached on the nuclear issue, as now seems at least possible, this may help to act as a confidence building measure for better relations in other areas as well.</p></reply>

For a PAYE only donor, the relief was paid directly to the eligible charity or approved body on a 'grossed up' basis, based on a claim submitted by the body in question rather than by the individual PAYE donor. In the case of a self-assessed donor, the individual personally claimed the relief at the applicable rate as there was no 'grossing up' arrangement in place for the self-employed sector. In the case of a company, it claimed a deduction for the donation as if it were a trading expense. </p><p>The scheme was amended in the 2013 Finance Act and under the new arrangements, which operate in respect of contributions made from 2013 onwards donations by both PAYE and self-assessed donors will be treated similarly. The donations will be 'grossed' at a blended tax rate of 31% and the tax will be repaid directly to the charity or approved body in the same manner as previously operated in respect of PAYE only donors. The arrangements for corporate donations did not change in the 2013 Finance Act and the tax relief will continue to be available to the company. </p><p>Details of refunds made to schools by PAYE donors in 2013 are included in the table below.

The applications of almost 33,000 other applicants were either refused or cancelled.  </p><p>  1,484 students were initially awarded a grant but were subsequently refused. No payment was issued to students in the majority of these cases.  However, 50 students received a payment and have been advised of the requirement to repay some or all of their grant. </p><p>  The withdrawal of a previously awarded grant may occur for a number of reasons such as a student commencing a course other than the one in respect of which a grant was awarded, where the latter course is not an approved course. This can occur after the award of a grant has been notified to a student when SUSI seeks to confirm a student's course acceptance with the approved college.  In such circumstances, no payment is issued.</p><p>  Grant applications are also reviewed by SUSI on a continuous basis, including, in particular, when a student is being renewed from year to year. In these cases it can come to attention that an application was incorrectly assessed or that the circumstances that determine a student's eligibility are different, or have changed, from those on the basis of which a grant was initially awarded.   This is particularly the case where a student's eligibility may have been marginal in one year and is selected for specific review prior to renewal in the following year. </p><p>  Any overpayment of a grant is required to be repaid by the student in accordance with the Student Support Act 2011 and the Student Grant Scheme.  SUSI implements a repayment policy under which students are asked to agree a repayment plan that is appropriate to their circumstances. SUSI deals with such repayments carefully and sensitively having regard to the ability of students to make repayments.</p></reply>

The NCSE operates within my Department's established criteria for the allocation of Special Education supports and the staffing resources available to my Department. Details of the NCSE application criteria are available at www.ncse.ie.</p><p>  It is a matter for schools to monitor and utilise their allocation of additional teaching support, including support allocated under the GAM, to best support the needs of identified pupils, in accordance with my Department's guidance.</p><p>  Should a parent be dissatisfied with the manner in which the resources or facilities which have been provided to support their child's education are being applied in school, they should raise this matter directly with their school Principal or the Board of Management of the school. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.</p></reply>

It will   provide a general overview of available supports and services rather than the detail mentioned in his question.</p><p>  My Department's position is that, as each child with autism is unique, they should have access to a range of different approaches to meet their individual needs.

There is not an exhaustive list of approaches or interventions which can be accessed to support the education of children with autism as new approaches continue to emerge.</p><p>  As the Deputy is aware the NCSE is currently preparing policy advice on the education of children with autism. Their report which is due in 2015 will identify the nature and extent of educational intervention/s, teaching practices and other supports which should be provided to enable children with autism to achieve educational outcomes appropriate to their needs and abilities and will inform future policy development.</p></reply>

At that point, a decision is made in relation to eligibility. Again, the general approach is that transport is provided to the child's nearest school subject to compliance with the distance criteria.</p><p>  In the case of children with special educational needs eligibility for school transport is to the nearest school that is, or is capable of being resourced, to meet the educational needs of that child. It is important to stress that once eligibility is correctly determined, that eligibility remains for the duration of the child's education in that school. In practice this means that there is not an annual application process but that the initial decision to grant eligibility remains in place.</p><p>  In the case in question, the child was eligible for school transport to the nearest school resourced to meet the educational needs of the child. The parents, as was their prerogative, opted to send the child to a more distant school. At the time of this decision there was a place available for the child at the nearest school and the parents chose not to avail of it. The consequence of this was that school transport eligibility was not available under the scheme to the more distant school.</p><p>  The fact that the enrolment position of the nearer school has subsequently changed is not relevant, as eligibility under the scheme is determined at the point the child commences school. Indeed to adopt a different approach would logically require an annual review of all cases where parents opt to send the child to a school other than their nearest with a view to granting school transport in circumstances where the nearer school has subsequently become full.</p></reply>

This round covered extensive technical discussion on a broad range of issues including regulatory issues, sanitary and phytosanitary measures, government procurement, intellectual property rights, electronic commerce and telecommunications, environment, labour, small and medium-sized enterprises, and energy and raw materials. Some discussion has already started on the text of an agreement in relation to helping SMEs, technical barriers to trade and on competition.  </p><p>The sixth round is due to take place during the week beginning 14 July, 2014.  The EU Commission has indicated that the topics expected to be discussed during the next round include trade in goods and services, regulatory issues, government procurement, environmental protection and labour rights, energy and raw materials, and opportunities for small- and medium-sized enterprises.  The latter topic is important for Ireland because it will enable our SMEs to win more export business in the U.S., where Enterprise Ireland has invested considerable resources to support its clients in that market. The EU Commission has indicated that, as in previous rounds, EU and US negotiators will spend a day with representatives of industry, non-governmental organisations, consumer groups, trade unions, professional bodies, and other civil society groups.</p><p>Negotiations on TTIP can be summarised as covering three broad areas:</p><p>The first is market access, for goods, services, and public procurement. The first tariff offers, that is, the immediate or phased elimination of import tariffs on an extensive list of goods, were exchanged earlier this year, and I expect that, over the next few weeks there will be further work and negotiations to extend the range of tariff free trade that can take place once TTIP comes into effect. On services, I understand that the US tabled its first offer last week, and Member States will meet shortly to discuss what has been proposed by the U.S. The Commission expects that the EU&rsquo;s first offer on services will be ready soon. Naturally there is an important level of confidentiality about the detail of both sides&rsquo; negotiating position, but I am hopeful that the greatest level of market access can be achieved for our goods and services exporters and for those looking to extend access to the very large U.S. public procurement market.</p><p>The second area covered by the talks is &ldquo;rules&quot; , on trade facilitation (EU and US customs systems), state-owned enterprises (these should operate on commercial lines), on raw materials and energy (EU is looking for access to US oil/gas exports that are currently restricted), and on labour and the environment issues (no weakening of the high standards/protection applied by both parties). Coming to agreement on these will also serve to set the standards for other Free Trade Agreements with trading partners, reduce the complexity for small companies to comply with many different standards and market regulations, and to regulate markets in an open and transparent manner.</p><p>The third most difficult and complex, but most important aspect of the negotiations, is reducing regulatory burdens,<b></b>which will involve a multiplicity of sectoral regulations.  In areas of regulation covering important sectors such as financial services, environment, and health and public safety, there are legitimate but in many cases unfounded concerns about a possible lowering of regulatory standards.  In fact, both the EU and the US are equally committed to retaining existing high standards that protect consumers. The objective of TTIP is to address differences in standards between our two economies, that can give rise to heavy compliance costs, while at all times maintaining the high levels of health, safety, environmental and other protection that is reflected in EU legislation.   </p><p>Studies show that addressing regulatory burdens will yield the most net gains from the agreement. The Commission&rsquo;s impact assessment suggests that between two thirds and four fifths of the gains from TTIP would come from cutting red tape and having more coordination between regulators. Consequently, progress in respect of regulation, through harmonisation, mutual recognition or convergence, is the most important means of capturing the largest benefits from TTIP. </p><p>It is important to see this as a two part issue:  the process of how regulation is enacted, and the sector specific solutions being negotiated. How regulations are made needs to be more transparent, efficient and objective, with regulators deepening relationships in order to address emerging issues together, for example in setting standards for new technologies. Regulators are also discussing how to reduce the cost of meeting existing standards without affecting the levels of protection afforded by them. </p><p>Real progress on issues like car safety standards, ending double inspections at pharmaceutical and medical device plants, should, over time, reduce costs for business, regulators and consumers. It is important to note that while regulatory aspects are one of the main elements of the TTIP negotiations, there is nothing in the negotiations that should prevent or undermine the rights of both sides to regulate, and the level of regulatory protection on both sides, be it environment, food, consumer safety, will not be lessened. </p><p>As regards investment protection, the public consultation launched by the European Commission last March on the investment protection provisions of a future Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, is still underway and will run until 6 July.  All stakeholders have the opportunity to respond to this consultation, so that specific interests and concerns on investor protection and settlement of related disputes are well understood by the European Commission, and can be used to better define the EU&rsquo;s approach to investor protection in the TTIP negotiations.  The public consultation can be accessed at .</p><p>Further information on the negotiations, including background documents, are available on the European Commission&rsquo;s TTIP website. ]  </p><p>My Department recently engaged international expertise to examine the economic and other impacts TTIP and related potential opportunities. The focus of this study will be to identify key areas and sectors of the economy that will be impacted by TTIP. This work will help to inform our input to the European Union&rsquo;s negotiating position and to identify appropriate policy responses to be deployed, to maximise the potential of this historic agreement and provide an assessment of the longer term implications for enterprise policy. </p><p>I hosted a Conference in Dublin Castle on 20 June to look at the opportunities for Ireland from TTIP. This conference aimed at bringing together at political and senior executive level, Oireachtas members, representatives of various economic interests (including farmers and trade unions), Government Departments, Agencies and Regulators, in order to tease out the issues that lie ahead for Ireland. </p><p>At this stage it is too early to draw definitive conclusions about the impact of TTIP on our economy. However, initial assessments suggest that Ireland will benefit to a greater extent than the EU. Preliminary estimates point to a possible increase of 1.1% in GDP compared with a .5% GDP increase for the EU as a whole. This could give rise to an increase of 8,000 jobs over the implementation period of the Partnership. </p><p>As the negotiations advance, I will continue to look for an agreement that is comprehensive and balanced and one that delivers real trade and economic potential for our economy. In this context I recognise the need to minimise the impact of trade liberalisation and market opening on sensitive areas of the economy and will continue to express our position that any agreement would respect our broad trade interests and especially our interests in the agriculture sector. </p></reply>

Staff assignments are made by reference to the priority needs of the Department and its offices as a whole.</p><p>  The ODCE's revised workforce plan has specifically highlighted the centrality of accountancy skills as being fundamental to that Office's ability to deal with the more complex issues and investigations which it has been facing since the economic downturn.  Despite the severe limitations referred to above, I am strongly supportive of the case made by the ODCE to rebalance its staff complement to increase the accountancy expertise available to the Office.

Over time this allocation and the allocation methodology will be reviewed by my Department and Enterprise Ireland (EI) to ensure that opportunities for business development are maximised and that value for money is being secured across the LEOs. Such reviews will in the future be primarily informed by achievement of targets and performance metrics rather than a purely population based assessment. It is envisaged that a competitive element to budgetary allocation will be developed and introduced over time. </p><p>In addition to grant aid, LEOs can provide valuable advice, mentoring, training

JobsPlus is biased in favour of those who are longer term unemployed. It provides employers with two levels of payment: &euro;7,500 over two years where a jobseeker who is 12-24 months on the live register is recruited and &euro;10,000 for each person recruited who has been unemployed for more than 24 months.

A person on a one parent family payment is not considered eligible given the focus of JobsPlus on recruitment from those longer term unemployed and receiving a jobseekers payment.

This initiative is being delivered through the network of local development companies and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta. T&uacute;s is designed to break the cycle of unemployment and maintain work readiness, thereby improving a person&rsquo;s opportunities of returning to the labour market. </p><p>  The duration of the T&uacute;s contract was set to reflect a number of inter-related elements. These include (i) the need to ensure that the limited numbers of placements available are opened to those on the Live Register, (ii) that weaknesses identified in other work programmes resulting from longer duration placements are not replicated with T&uacute;s, (iii) optimisation of the resources available and (iv) how T&uacute;s fits with the objectives set out in the Government&rsquo;s activation policies in Pathways to Work. </p><p>  I consider the existing 12-month period on T&uacute;s to be adequate to meet the programme&rsquo;s objectives. It also ensures that as many unemployed people as possible are able to benefit from the initiative. There are no circumstances under which a person&rsquo;s term on T&uacute;s will be extended beyond 12 months. Opportunities are available on community employment (CE) where a person is interested in pursuing a work placement that may have a longer duration in order to complete certified training. Time spent on T&uacute;s is considered eligible for accessing CE. </p><p>  As of the week ending 27th June 2014, 18,243 participants and 418 full-time supervisory/ team leader personnel have been engaged on T&uacute;s since its inception in July 2011. </p></reply>

The number of OFP recipients stood at 77,209 in May, 2014, and an estimated &euro;863 million is expected to be spent on the scheme during 2013.</p><p>  The Social Welfare and Pensions Act, 2012, contains provisions to reduce, on a phased basis, the maximum age limit of the youngest child at which an OFP recipient&rsquo;s payment ceases to 7 years from 2014 for new entrants and from 2015 for existing recipients.</p><p>  The next phase of the OFP scheme reform process will commence on 3 July, 2014, when approximately 5,140 customers will see their entitlement to the OFP payment cease as a result of their youngest child reaching the maximum age threshold. </p><p>  Approximately 850 of these affected OFP customers are also claiming the family income supplement (FIS) by virtue of being in employment for 19 or more hours per week.  These customers will have their FIS payment automatically adjusted to compensate for some 60% of the loss of their OFP payment.</p><p>  It is expected that approximately 3,600 affected OFP customers may apply for the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance (JA) payment. Of these customers, approximately 70% are not working and, as such, will not suffer any reduction in their new income support payment as the JA payment pays the same personal and qualified child rates as OFP. </p><p>  Of those affected OFP customers who are working, they will be advised by the Department if they a working a minimum of 19 hours per week, or if they could increase their hours to that level, to apply for the FIS payment as this is the most financially beneficial income support for former OFP recipients.   </p></reply>

There are currently approximately 76,000 customers in receipt of rent supplement. To qualify for rent supplement a claimant must:</p><p>  -  have been residing in private rented accommodation (where at the commencement of the tenancy the person could have reasonably afforded the rent and has experienced a substantial change in his or her circumstances where they are now unable to pay the rent) or accommodation for homeless persons or in an institution (or any combination of these) for a period of 183 days within the preceding 12 months of the date of claim for rent supplement, </p><p>  or</p><p>  -  have been assessed by a housing authority pursuant to section 9 of the Housing Act 1988 (as amended by section 75 of the Health Act 2004) as having a housing need.</p><p>  It is the Department&rsquo;s policy that an assessment of eligibility for social housing support should be carried out by the relevant local housing authority in the area where a claim to rent supplement is made and the person intends to reside. This ensures that the relevant local authorities are made aware of and can take responsibility for the long-term housing needs of rent supplement tenants living within their administrative area. This reflects both the responsibility of local authorities in providing long-term housing supports and the temporary income support nature of rent supplement. Without this measure rent supplement recipients would be unknown to their respective local authority, where they currently reside, with the potential that they may lose out on an offer for social housing including support under the new Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) which is currently being piloted in the Limerick area. </p><p>  Department officials have considerable experience in dealing with customers of the rent supplement scheme and continue to make every effort to ensure that their accommodation needs are met. </p></reply>

Specifically, the Act requires RT&Eacute; to provide digital coverage to the same extent as provided over the previous analogue network, i.e. 98% population coverage, and I am advised by RT&Eacute; that this level of coverage is being provided by the SAORVIEW TV network. For the remaining 2% of the population, RT&Eacute; launched SAORSAT in March 2012. The development and provision of SAORSAT, which is a &ldquo;free to air&rdquo; satellite system providing access to the RT&Eacute; channels and TG4, was undertaken by RT&Eacute; on its own initiative and, as in the case of the SAORVIEW DTT network, is not a matter in which I have a function.</p><p>  Ireland is not the only country to have introduced a national TV network on both a terrestrial and satellite platform. Many countries, including the UK, have developed their digital networks on both the traditional terrestrial platform and also over satellite. The reason for this is simple. It is technically and financially impossible to provide 100% coverage using a terrestrial TV platform. However, through SAORVIEW and SAORSAT, Ireland now has 100% &ldquo;free to air&rdquo; coverage of the RT&Eacute; channels and TG4 for the first time in the history of the State.</p><p>  I would advise the Deputy that any signal reception issues should be directed to 2rn in the first place.

This will be achieved by providing:-</p><p>- a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment; and </p><p>- a State-led intervention for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.</p><p>Since publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway and in some instances have been accelerated in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services. Commercial operators combined have either invested, or committed to invest, over &euro;2 billion in their Irish networks, delivering high speed broadband to homes and businesses. </p><p>As a result of this accelerated investment the addressable area required by the State-led intervention has been reduced by 30% since the National Broadband Plan was launched. While the commercial developments are welcome the acceleration of investment is largely contained to cities and towns. Consequently, the speeds that are available in these areas are demonstrably better than those that are available in more rural areas. </p><p>On 25 April last, I signalled the Government's commitment to a major telecommunications network build-out to rural Ireland, with fibre as the foundation of its investment, as part of the State-led intervention under the National Broadband Plan. This commitment is a clear expression of Government&rsquo;s determination to address the connectivity challenge in rural Ireland in a meaningful and sustainable way. </p><p>Central to the strategy will be a fibre build-out to locations in every county in the State identified as having no existing or planned enabling fibre network. It is intended that the fibre will be delivered directly to access points for homes and businesses, where service providers can utilise the fibre to provide high speed services to end users. The fibre build out will be part of an end-to-end strategy that will address all parts of Ireland that cannot access commercial high speed broadband services.</p><p>A comprehensive mapping exercise is underway in my Department which will identify those areas that will require a State intervention. I have published a county-by-county list of towns and villages which have already been identified for a fibre build-out. This list is available on my Department's website, . Currently, a total of 38 areas in County Cavan including the area of Milltown have been identified as requiring an intervention. This is an indicative list and is subject to the completion of the mapping exercise. Further locations may be identified as this process continues. Similarly, it may be determined that some locations on the list will be addressed by the commercial sector and will therefore not require State intervention. I expect that this mapping exercise will be concluded in the autumn. </p><p>I would point out that the EU Commission&rsquo;s guidelines on State aid for high speed broadband infrastructure preclude Member States from intervening in regions in which private investors have demonstrated plans to roll out their own infrastructure within the following three years. In this regard, I understand that at least one network operator has published a programme to roll out 20 fibre-based broadband networks in County Cavan, including the area of Belturbet by July 2016.</p><p>In tandem with the completion of the mapping exercise, intensive design and planning work is ongoing in my Department with a view to producing a detailed end to end strategy for the State led intervention. It is my intention to conduct a full public consultation on the outcome of the mapping process and the proposed strategy. EU State aid clearance will also be required for the intervention once finalised. This will be followed by a detailed procurement process with a view to commencing construction of the fibre network and provision of services in identified areas as quickly as possible.</p></reply>

The Non- Principal Private Residence (NPPR) Charge is set at &euro;200 and liability for it falls, in the main, on owners of rental, holiday and vacant or additional properties that are not an individual&rsquo;s principal private residence. The NPPR Charge, which has since been discontinued, applied in the years 2009 to 2013 to any residential property in which the owner did not reside as their normal place of residence. It is a matter for an owner to determine if he or she has a liability and, if so, to declare that liability and pay the Charge and any late payment fees applicable.</p><p>  Under the 2009 Act &ldquo;residential property&rdquo; is defined as a &ldquo;&hellip;building that is situated in the State and that is occupied, or suitable for occupation, as a separate dwelling.&rdquo; There are a number of indicators as to what makes a property suitable for occupation for the purposes of determining liability to the Charge. The indicators include the structure of the property, whether or not it has a roof, whether or not it is so affected by dampness as to render it unsuitable for habitation, and whether or not it has sanitary facilities, including a water closet and water supply. Under the 2009 Act, there is no specific exemption for residential properties affected by pyrite. A property that is not suitable for occupation should not be regarded as a residential property within the meaning of the 2009 Act and would not therefore be liable for the Charge. </p><p>  It is a function of a local authority to collect non-principal private residence charges and late payment fees due to it, and all charges and late payment fees imposed and payable to a local authority are under the care and management of the local authority concerned. In this regard, application of the legislation in particular circumstances is a matter for the relevant local authority.</p></reply>

Applications to the value of some &euro;164 million in loans were accepted into the Land Aggregation Scheme. The figure of &euro;164m includes &euro;111m in respect of loans which were fully redeemed by local authorities with funding recouped from my Department, under the original terms of the scheme. The remaining &euro;53m is in the form of annuity loans with the Housing Finance Agency for which local authorities are making repayments to the Housing Finance Agency, with these payments being recouped   from my Department. </p><p>  In 2013, as a consequence of continuing pressure on Exchequer resources, and following a review of the scheme carried out in consultation with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, it became evident that further expenditure on the Land Aggregation Scheme, in terms of accepting new applications into the scheme, was no longer a sustainable option. Local authorities were advised of the discontinuance of the Scheme in respect of new applications in December 2013. The focus of the Land Aggregation Scheme has now shifted to the management of the land accepted into the s cheme.   </p><p>  Five sites from Kildare County Council were approved for inclusion under the first iteration of the Land Aggregation Scheme. A condition of the scheme requires the transfer of the land to the Housing Agency. Contracts for four of the sites have been received from Kildare County Council by the Housing Agency. However, some outstanding queries have yet to be resolved before the transfer of the lands can be finalised. Discussions are on-going between the Housing Agency and Kildare County Council regarding the transfer of the remaining site. </p></reply>

In addition, the general requirement in EU legislation is that two clear tests must be completed before the holding can be de restricted, the second test taking place not earlier than 60 days after the first re-test.</p><p>  My Department makes every effort to facilitate removal of reactors as quickly as possible following the completion of the valuation process. However, ultimately, the speed of removal is heavily influenced by a number of factors such as the numbers of factories accepting reactor animals at any given time, the overall supply/demand situation for cattle and the procedures surrounding on-farm market valuation process.  Data for 2013 shows that, on average, bovine animals are removed for slaughter within 19 days of the date of the relevant test.  </p></reply>

Approximately 38 % of these residents are children under the age of 18.</p><p>I am assured by RIA that centres are not overcrowded.  All accommodation in use by RIA is subject to compliance with the various statutory provisions, including the Housing Acts governing accommodation of the type provided to asylum seekers. All accommodation providers and other companies engaged by the State are required under contract to ensure that all accommodation centres comply and operate in accordance with all of the statutory requirements of local authorities and State agencies in relation to bedroom capacity, food, food hygiene, water supply, fire safety, general safety and so forth. So far as the needs of babies, children and expectant mothers are concerned, rigorous contractual requirements are imposed on accommodation providers.</p><p>Temporary overcrowding can occur when the family profile has changed on the basis of age or newly arrived family member.  For example,  under RIA policy, children aged 10 years or more should not share a bedroom with a family member of the opposite gender. In those circumstances, where it is not possible to provide additional accommodation within the centre, RIA offers alternative accommodation at another centre.  However, a family may choose to refuse the offer of a transfer to another centre because either (a) it prefers the current arrangement or (b) it wants to await a better offer. Where a family refuses an offer of alternative accommodation in such circumstances, RIA keeps the family details under review and further offers are made as deemed suitable.</p><p>Generally, the safety of all residents &ndash; especially children &ndash; is at the forefront of RIA&rsquo;s objectives. RIA affords the highest priority to the safeguarding and protection of children.  RIA is, and will always be, compliant with all legislative requirements in this area. RIA has a fully staffed child and family service unit, the head of which is seconded from the HSE and whose role is to manage, deliver, coordinate, monitor and plan all matters relating to child and family services for all residents in the direct provision system.  The unit also acts as a conduit between RIA and Child and Family Agency (Tusla), the latter having statutory functions in this area.</p><p>RIA's Child Protection and Welfare Policy is based on the the Department of Children and Youth Affairs' &ldquo;Children First- National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children&rdquo;.  This guidance document was developed to assist people in identifying and reporting child abuse and welfare concerns.  The protection and welfare policy emphasises that the needs of children and families must be central to child care and child protection and welfare.  RIA's policy has been reviewed and updated and now contains a practice document to make it more user friendly. That draft document is now with Tusla for final feedback and it is anticipated that it will be published by the end of August, 2014 on RIA&rsquo;s website .</p></reply>

Direct provision provides for full board accommodation supports while a final decision is awaited by a person on their protection or any related leave to remain application. As at 8 June 2014 there were 4,353 persons availing of direct provision accommodation and supports in 34 accommodation centres in the State.</p><p>  The sixth report of the Special Rapporteur on Children relating to 2012 was published on the website of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in July 2013.  There is no specific reference to children in Direct Provision in that report.  Nonetheless,  I have recounted in detail in replies to previous D&aacute;il Questions how the Government affords the highest priority to the safeguarding and protection of children in that system.  In particular, I have pointed out that RIA operates a Child Protection Policy is based on the HSE's &quot;Children First - National Guidelines for the protection and welfare of children&quot; and that there is a specific unit in RIA called the Child and Family Services Unit, which is fully staffed and whose role is to manage, deliver, coordinate, monitor and plan all matters relating to child and family services for all asylum seekers residing in the direct provision system. </p><p>  More generally, I acknowledge that the length of time that residents spend in Direct Provision is an issue to be addressed.  My immediate priority is that the factors which lead to delays in the processing of cases are dealt with.  In this regard, legislative reform aimed at establishing a single application procedure for the investigation of all grounds for protection is a key priority for this Government. Such reform would substantially simplify and streamline the existing arrangements by removing the current multi-layered and sequential processes and provide applicants with a final decision on their application in a more straightforward and timely fashion.  In consultation with my officials, I am reviewing the work done to date in respect of the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill and will then decide on how best to progress the implementation of the Government's priorities, in particular to expedite those relating to the establishment of a single application procedure.</p></reply>

Such rights must be created by express Deed of Grant or where the law allows, acquired by prescription. In the case of the right to harvest seaweed, only rights vested by Land Commission as appurtenant to lands purchased under the Land Purchase Acts have been registered in the Land Registry.</p><p>  A right to take something from the land of another, which is created by Deed of Grant or acquired by prescription, is a profit &agrave; prendre. The holder of a profit &agrave; prendre has a legal right in land that is capable of registration as an appurtenant right by including such right as part of the description of the lands to which it is appurtenant. It can also be held in gross, that is existing in its own right and not as an appurtenance to other land. In that case, it may be registered on the subsidiary register maintained by the Property Registration Authority.</p><p>  A licence is generally defined as permission to enter land and do something that would otherwise be a trespass. A licence to harvest seaweed, issued pursuant to Section 3 of the Foreshore Act 1933 (as amended) is not a profit &agrave; prendre, as it is not created by a Deed of Grant. It is not, therefore, a legal right in property that is registerable under the Registration of Title Act 1964 as amended.</p><p>  As set out in Section 20(1) of the Registration of Deeds and Title Act 2006, I can issue general  policy directives concerning registration of deeds or ownership or any other function of the Authority. However, registrations are made on application and it would not be a matter for the Authority to make any registration for which no application is made. The rights that are capable of registration are set out in the Registration of Deeds and Title Acts 1964 to 2006. </p><p>  In any event, a licence to harvest seaweed, issued pursuant to Section 3 of the Foreshore Act 1933 (as amended) is not a legal right in property that is registerable under the Registration of Title Act 1964 as amended. Therefore, any such registration is beyond the remit of the Property Registration Authority. Accordingly, I cannot avail of the policy provisions of Section 20(1) to instruct the Property Registration Authority to act in a manner that is outside of its legislative functions and powers.</p></reply>

As part of that function, particularly under Part IV of the Solicitors (Amendment) Act 1994 dealing with the 'Protection of Clients', the Law Society is obliged to continue to maintain and administer the Solicitors Compensation Fund. Where it is proved to the satisfaction of the Law Society that any client of a solicitor has sustained loss in consequence of fraud or dishonesty on the part of that solicitor or any clerk or servant of that solicitor arising from that solicitor's practice as a solicitor within the jurisdiction of the State, then, subject to the relevant provisions, the Society is required to make a grant to that client out of the Compensation Fund. It is also provided that before a practising certificate can be issued to a solicitor, the solicitor in question must have paid the annual contribution to the Fund and the issuing of a practising certificate can be withheld until the payment has been made.</p><p>  As such, the Compensation Fund and its attendant inspection procedures provide an important protection against acts of fraud and dishonesty that may be perpetrated by solicitors in the handling of clients&rsquo; monies. As Deputies will be aware, the Fund has been relied upon in a number of high profile cases in recent times. In the five years of 2008 to 2012, I am advised  the Fund paid out a total of &euro;17.7 million in claims. The total in claims actually made for that same period was nearly &euro;48 million. There was a 9% increase in the 266 claims made against the Compensation Fund in 2012 over the previous year's 244 claims though this remains much less than the peak of 672 claims received in 2008. The net assets of the Solicitors Compensation Fund were valued at &euro;18 million as at 30th   June 2013. In the six months up to that date 165 claims on the Fund were received which, excluding invalid claims refused, amounted to &euro;1.16 million. The annual contribution to the Fund for 2013 is &euro;760 per solicitor. Annual insurance cover for &euro;50 million with an excess of &euro;5 million is also in place.</p><p>  Under the Compensation Fund structures provided for under the Solicitors Acts, the Law Society is, therefore, able to respond immediately to serious financial complaints and has the right to carry out investigations, without notification, where justified by the circumstances. The Society can also apply to the High Court for orders to protect clients' funds when serious irregularities arise. Pay-outs by the Compensation Fund have a serious impact, including in terms of ongoing costs, across its entire solicitor membership. To that extent, the Fund has a capacity to strongly incentivise financial compliance by solicitors in the public interest. It should also be borne in mind that, following the enactment of the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010, the Law Society is  required to investigate compliance with anti-laundering regulations.</p><p>  It should also be noted that under the new Legal Services Regulation Bill which is to commence Report Stage in the D&aacute;il on 17 July, matters of misconduct or discipline relating to solicitors or barristers will be dealt with under the aegis of the new and independent Legal Services Regulatory Authority and the Legal Practitioners' Disciplinary Tribunal and that members of the public will no longer make such complaints through the legal professional bodies.</p></reply>

Every effort is made by prison staff and management to limit the scope of acts of violence.  However, no regime can completely eliminate the possibility of violent incidents happening in a prison setting where a large number of dangerous and violent offenders are being held. As the Deputy can see from the figures there were 758 incidents of violence recorded in prisons during 2013 and this includes very minor incidents. This amounts to an average of 2.1 incidents per day among a population of approximately 4,000.</p><p>The Irish Prison Service has successfully introduced a number of measures across the prison estate such as, hand-held metal detectors, netting over prison yards, boss chairs and security screening machines to detect and prevent weapons from entering the prison to limit the scope of acts of violence.</p><p>In addition, new prisoner programmes have been introduced such as the Incentivised Regimes policy which provides for a differentiation of privileges between prisoners according to their level of engagement with services and quality of behaviour. The objective is to provide tangible incentives to prisoners to participate in structured activities and to reinforce good behaviour, leading to a safer and more secure environment. As a result, I am pleased to advise the Deputy that the figures for 2013 represent an 8% decrease on the 2012 total of 822 (715 prisoner on prisoner and 107 prisoner on staff).</p><p>I can advise the deputy that the number of prisoner on prisoner assaults and the number of prisoners on staff assaults in each prison for January to June 2014 is not readily available and requires a manual examination of records. The Information is being collated by the Irish Prison Service and I will forward a reply to the Deputy as soon possible.</p></reply>

The Deputy will be aware that the primary role of the Irish Prison Service is the provision of safe and secure custody for prisoners.  The Deputy will also be aware that the Prison Service must accept all persons committed by the courts into custody and does not have the option of refusing committals. A business case for the modernisation of prison facilities in Limerick Prison is currently being drafted by the Irish Prison Service. Part of the proposed redevelopment includes the provision of high quality prison accommodation for female prisoners with capacity for approximately 50 individual cells and 8 custodial apartments.</p><p>  The Irish Prison Service provides to those in custody a wide range of rehabilitative programmes, which have the dual purpose of providing prisoners with purposeful activity while serving their sentences and encouraging them to lead non-offending lives on release.</p><p>  The development of prisoner programmes forms a central part of the Irish Prison Service three year strategic plan 2012 - 2015. There is a clear commitment in the strategy to enhance sentence planning through  Integrated Sentence Management and the delivery of prison based rehabilitative programmes such as education, work training and resettlement programmes.</p><p>  On 6 March 2014 the IPS published a Women&rsquo;s Strategy entitled &quot;An Effective Response to Women Who Offend&quot;. The Women&rsquo;s Strategy  sets out how the Irish Prison Service and the Probation Service will work together, as well as with other statutory, community and voluntary sector partners, to provide women-focused interventions to help reduce offending, improve opportunities for reintegration and to improve outcomes more generally. This co-operative approach is a direct result of the Joint Strategy published last year which aims to deliver more effective offender management.</p></reply>

This Plan sets out the practical measures that will be taken to advance the National Disability Strategy over the period 2013 to 2015.</p><p>  In addition to the ongoing implementation of the actions being undertaken by the relevant Government Departments, two new initiatives are currently being progressed. These are the drafting of a comprehensive employment strategy for people with disabilities and a review of the Implementation Plan with respect to how it addresses the needs of people with autism.</p><p>  A draft framework for the Employment Strategy was issued for consultation with all relevant stakeholders in August.  Work is ongoing to finalise this Strategy.</p><p>  I have also requested the NDA to examine how the Implementation Plan reflects the needs of people with autism.  The NDA, as part of that examination, engaged in a consultation exercise with autism stakeholders and examined existing service provision across relevant departments for people with disabilities.  The outcome of this process is being examined at present.</p><p>  The Government intends to proceed to ratification of the UN Convention on the rights of Persons with Disabilities as quickly as possible, taking into account the need to ensure all necessary legislative and administrative requirements under the Convention are met.  As the Deputy may be aware, Ireland does not become party to treaties until it is first in a position to comply with the obligations imposed by them, including the amendment of domestic law as necessary.</p><p>  An interdepartmental committee on the Convention is reviewing the remaining legislative and administrative actions required to enable ratification.  As part of its work programme, the committee has identified issues to be considered by various Departments and examination of these issues is ongoing.  At the request of the committee, the National Disability Authority, the lead statutory agency for the sector, has also assisted in assessing remaining requirements for ratification to ensure that all outstanding issues will be comprehensively addressed.</p><p>  For my Department, one of the key requirements is the enactment of capacity legislation. The Programme for Government contains a commitment to introduce a Bill in line with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill, published on 17 July 2013, provides a series of options to support people with impaired capacity to make decisions and exercise their basic rights in line with the principles of the UN Convention. It undertakes a comprehensive reform of existing legislation governing capacity. The Bill will go to Committee Stage shortly. The enactment of this legislation is one of the core elements of the remaining work to be completed to enable ratification by the State of the UN Convention.</p></reply>

Therefore, the Government has decided to develop a policy framework for providing eligibility for health services to take account of medical conditions, including new legislation as appropriate and a HSE clinical expert group is to examine the range of conditions that should be considered as part of this process. The group has been asked to make an early report to the Minister for Health in the autumn.</p><p>The Government was very concerned about the potential impacts on the health of persons with serious illnesses whose discretionary medical cards and GP visit cards were refused renewals since the centralisation of medical card assessment in 2011. Therefore, in the context of the above eligibility policy development, the Government decided that medical cards and GP visit cards are to be issued to persons with a serious medical condition (or disability) who had the renewal of their discretionary card refused by the HSE, having completed an eligibility review during the period from 1 July 2011 to 31 May 2014.</p><p>Under the Health Service Executive&rsquo;s (HSE) 2009 National Service Plan, it was agreed that the processing of medical card/GP visit card applications &amp;amp; reviews would be centralised and would transfer to the Executive&rsquo;s Primary Care Reimbursement Service (PCRS) in Dublin.</p><p>The process commenced in January 2009 when the PCRS took over the processing of all medical card applications for persons aged 70 or over.  The second phase commenced in September 2009 with the transfer of the case load from two local health offices (LHOs) in Dublin.  In 2010, as part of the centralisation project, the HSE introduced a new website, , which enables people anywhere in the country to apply for or renew a medical card through a simple and efficient application process. </p><p>The final phase extended PCRS responsibility for processing all medical cards to the remainder of the country.  This meant that all new medical card applications and reviews made from 1 July 2011 were processed centrally by the PCRS Office in Finglas, Dublin. </p><p>Centralisation delivered a consistent and equitable application of eligibility and service provision and has provided clearer governance and accountability, as well as improved management information. It is in the context of the  finalisation of the centralisation project  - 1 July 2011 - that the Government decided that the HSE would issue cards to persons, with a serious illness, whose discretionary card was refused renewal in the period from 1 July 2011 to 31 May 2014.</p></reply>

The application was considered in line with the procedures and timescales agreed by the Department of Health and the HSE with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association for the assessment of new medicines. </p><p>In accordance with these procedures, the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE) conducted a pharmacoeconomic evaluation of Fampridine and concluded that, as the manufacturer was unable to demonstrate the cost effectiveness of fampridine in the Irish healthcare setting, it was unable to recommend the reimbursement of the product. The report is available on the NCPE's website (). The NCPE report is an important input to assist the HSE in its decision making process and informs further discussions between the HSE and the manufacturer of the drug.</p><p>The HSE assessment process is intended to arrive at a decision on the funding of new medicines that is clinically appropriate, fair, consistent and sustainable. In these circumstances, the HSE has not approved the reimbursement of Fampridine under the GMS or other community drug schemes. </p><p>However, I am aware that studies are ongoing to assess the wider impact of Fampridine on both walking and quality of life for persons diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis. The results of these studies will contribute to the evidence base demonstrating the clinical effectiveness of the product which can be used to support future applications for its inclusion on the lists of reimbursable items supplied under the GMS and other community drugs scheme.</p><p>The HSE met with Biogen Idec recently to discuss a potential revised application. The HSE expects that Biogen Idec will submit a revised application. The HSE will then re-consider the application in as timely a fashion as possible in line with the agreed procedures and timescales for the assessment of new medicines. </p></reply>

Under the legislation, determination of an individual&rsquo;s eligibility for a medical card is the responsibility of the HSE. The Act provides that persons who are unable, without undue hardship, having regard to their overall financial situation, to arrange GP services for themselves and family qualify for a medical card. The HSE awards medical cards in accordance with the Act.  The HSE gives effect to this legislation through its Medical Card National Assessment Guidelines.</p><p>  Once an application for a medical card incorporates certification from a medical consultant or a general practitioner that the applicant has a medical condition, which is categorised as terminal, and the applicant is nearing the end stage of life, the applicant will be granted eligibility to a medical card, without being subjected to a means assessment.  </p><p>  Medical cards issued, in such circumstances, will have a default eligibility period of 6 months, from the month of issue.  Mindful that no definitive prognosis can be provided on the life expectancy of a terminally ill person, the HSE takes a sensitive approach on the review of medical card eligibility, beyond the initial 6 months period.  A Medical Card Review notification is not issued and eligibility is extended to take account of the cardholder&rsquo;s on-going circumstances. </p><p>  With the exception of terminally ill patients in palliative care, the HSE issues all emergency cards on the basis that the patient is eligible for a medical card on the basis of means or undue hardship, and that the applicant will follow up with a full application within a number of weeks of receiving the emergency card. As a result, emergency medical cards are issued to a named individual, with a limited eligibility period of six months and the HSE reserves the right to review eligibility at any point in time to confirm that a person continues to meet the qualifying criteria required to continue holding eligibility. </p></reply>

The scheme provides a range of tax reliefs linked to the purchase and use of vehicles by disabled drivers and disabled passengers in Ireland.</p><p>  There is no scheme which would provide finance to a person with a disability to purchase a car/vehicle where the individual cannot afford to purchase a car/vehicle as outlined by the Deputy.</p><p>  There have been major developments in recent years in both Government policy and services for people with disabilities. The thrust of Government policy has been to improve accessibility to mainstream services for people with a disability through the removal of barriers and the provision of equal opportunities rather than to provide specialised, segregated services.  The Department of Transport&rsquo;s Sectoral Plan published under the Disability Act promotes the principle of mainstreaming by requiring accessibility to be an integral element of the public transport services. There are a number of Government Departments, State agencies, voluntary and community groups and transport operators (both public and private) involved in a range of aspects of transport policy, provision and funding. Significant improvements have already taken place in the accessibility of public transport and the Department of Social Protection provides for free public transport for people with disabilities and a companion. </p><p>  In November 2013, the Government decided that the detailed preparatory work required for a new travel support payment and associated statutory provisions should be progressed by the Minister for Health. The Department of Health is working to progress this matter and will draw on the work, last year, of the Review Group on Transport Supports for People with Disabilities and the Inter-Departmental Group tasked by Government to consider this matter.  Work is under way on the policy proposals to be brought to Government for the drafting of primary legislation for a new scheme.</p><p>  The Mobility Allowance payment continues to be made to recipients of the allowance prior to it being closed last year.

This process identified a requirement for savings of 6.5% per annum across the programme over the period 2012 to 2014.</p><p>  Since its establishment the Child and Family Agency has operational responsibility for the School Completion Programme  , including the allocation of funds to projects within the programme. I am advised that proposals have yet to be formulated by the Agency in relation to the funding for School Completion Programme projects in the coming 2014/2015 academic year. As an initial step the Agency invited all School Completion Programme Projects to commence planning for the next cycle of the programme within the available funding parameters. The Agency has commenced the detailed process of evaluating and approving the 2014/2015 school retention plans for individual projects. It is anticipated that the Agency will advise projects of the outcome of the process and of their allocations in time for the start of the new school year. The Agency will continue to work closely with Local Management Committees, schools and local School Completion Programme co-ordinators to assist projects through the process. </p><p>  The potential for any changes in the funding allocated to this programme in future years is a matter to be considered in the estimates and budgetary process having regard to the resources available to Government. </p></reply>
