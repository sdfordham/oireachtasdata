    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-10-24a.8.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012102400071#WRB00400"><p>The Deputy will be aware that I published the Inspector's Report last week. I also published the Irish Prison Service's Action Plan for implementing the Inspector's recommendations.  The report raises serious issues and major concerns including weak management, behaviour of some prison staff, the culture in the prison, the inattention to human rights norms, prisoners on protection and prevalence of drugs.  The Inspector concluded that there has been a culture in St. Patrick&rsquo;s which resulted in the human rights of some prisoners (children and young adults) being either ignored or violated.</p><p>  As I informed the House on Wednesday 17 October, neither I nor the Government will tolerate the type of abuse outlined by the Inspector in his report on St. Patrick's Institution. Simply put, it is unacceptable and will not be tolerated.  It is also important not to lose sight of the fact that the Inspector acknowledges in his report that the vast majority of staff in St. Patrick's carry out their duties in a professional manner and the problem lies with a very small minority of staff.</p><p>  For many years, I had concerns about St. Patrick's and believed that it was an inappropriate facility for children. I was instrumental in ensuring that the Programme for Government included a specific commitment to end the practice of sending children there. I visited St. Patrick's within two weeks of my appointment and I met with the Inspector at his request in early May last to discuss the situation with him.</p><p>  An Action Plan addressing all of the Inspector's recommendations was put into place without delay. This included the appointment of a new senior management team which has been tasked with providing clear and decisive leadership to the staff in order that the problems outlined by the Inspector are dealt with quickly and effectively. This team, lead by the new Governor, is liaising closely with the Director General of the Irish Prison Service and the Inspector of Prisons to ensure that each and every one of the Inspector's recommendations are implemented. Concrete measures have already been taken with over 80% of the recommendations being implemented to date.</p><p>  Indeed in this context, the Irish Prison Service has also undertaken to ensure enhanced  prison healthcare procedures are put in place, and records are maintained on the removal and relocation of prisoners. A new dedicated committal unit is in operation, and a new vulnerable persons unit is also being established. Additional security arrangements have been introduced to minimise drugs and contraband entering the prison. Educational facilities will be improved along with the provision of an incentivised regimes programme and an improvement in physical conditions and  facilities generally.</p><p>  The practice of sending 16 year old boys to St. Patrick's has already ceased with effect from the 1st May and my colleague, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, has agreed to examine the feasibility of accommodating some categories of 17 year old boys in Oberstown on a phased basis. The remit of the Ombudsman for Children was extended in July of this year to include St. Patrick's Institution. The Government has also sanctioned the provision of necessary funding for a new detention facility at Oberstown, which is due for completion in mid 2014. In the meantime, arrangements are currently being made for a number of care staff from the Children Detention Schools to work on placement in St. Patrick's Institution alongside Prison Staff. It is intended that this will take place within the next two months.</p><p>  In the interim, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs has agreed to examine the feasibility of accommodating some categories of 17 year old boys in Oberstown on a phased basis earlier than mid 2014, if possible. Arrangements are also being made for a number of care staff from the Children Detention Schools to work on placement in St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution alongside Prison Staff. It is intended that this will take place within the next two months. In addition, as I have already mentioned the remit of the Ombudsman for Children was extended in July of this year to include St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution - something which she has been seeking for a number of years and a request with which previous Governments failed to agree.</p><p>  A new complaints procedure is also being introduced. This process has recently been completed with the appointment of a panel of 22 external investigators and the new complaints system will be introduced on the 1st of November. I have instructed the Director General of the IPS to direct the new investigators to commence an examination of previous complaints in St. Patrick's Institution, such as those referred to by the Inspector in his report.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-10-24a.11.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012102400071#WRB00700"><p>The Deputy will be aware that the Government recently approved in principle my proposals for reforms to our courts structures which will, in due course, require the holding of a Constitutional referendum.  The proposed reforms are intended, if approved in a referendum, to facilitate the establishment of a new separate Family Courts structure which will streamline family law court processes and make them more efficient and less costly.  Considerable work will be necessary to develop these proposals and this has already commenced in my Department.  A decision on the timing of the necessary referendum will be made at a later date.</p><p>  In the shorter term, I am assured that the Courts Service works closely with the judiciary to ensure that all cases are dealt with as quickly as possible.  The usual practice is that additional judges are assigned by Court Presidents to assist in areas where backlogs have arisen.  As the Deputy may be aware, there were a large number of retirements from the Bench in late 2011 and early 2012 which resulted in eight vacancies on the District Court and seven on the Circuit Court.  In those circumstances I am informed that it was necessary to give priority to criminal cases and this had an impact on waiting times for family law and other cases.  However, the Government moved quickly to fill those posts and there is now a full complement of judges on both courts.  The President of the Circuit Court is assigning additional judges to venues where the most serious family law delays exist and special sittings are regularly arranged in the District Court to deal with family law backlogs.  I am also advised that the President of the District Court has recently issued a practice direction in child care cases to practitioners in Dublin with a view to improved case management and prompt disposal of cases.</p><p>  There are, however, alternatives to court available in the area of family law.  I intend to bring forward, in the coming months, a Bill to promote mediation as a viable and cost effective alternative to court proceedings.  The main objective of the Bill is the reduction of legal costs, the speeding up of dispute resolution and the lessening of the stress involved in court proceedings.  These provisions are designed to ensure that the legal framework supports the parties in reaching an agreed and enduring resolution to their disputes where possible.</p><p>  This measure will further enhance a successful tripartite initiative between the Courts Service, the Legal Aid Board and the Family Mediation Service which has been operating in the Dublin District Family Law Courts in Dolphin House since March 2011.  The objective is to offer an alternative to a court determined outcome and a more appropriate means of resolving certain family disputes through mediation.  This project has resulted in a total of 224 agreements finalised between January and August of this year without recourse to the courts and I understand it is being extended further to Naas and Cork at present.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-10-24a.14.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012102400071#WRB01000"><p>The Privacy Bill 2006 was restored to the Order Paper of the Seanad in June 2006 at my request. In restoring the Bill to the Order Paper, my intention was to examine its provisions and to make any necessary changes and updating to the text.  The previous Government had left the Bill on the Order Paper to give adequate time, first, to assess the effectiveness of the Press Council in dealing voluntarily with issues addressed in the Bill, and, second, to assess the impact of the new Defamation Act.  I did not want to frustrate those processes in any way. For this reason I judged it sensible merely to restore the Bill in its original form.</p><p>  However, as I indicated earlier this year during a debate on a Private Members Bill in the Seanad on privacy, I intend to review the adequacy of the 2006 Bill&rsquo;s provisions in light of developing case law in this area since its publication. There is a broad spectrum of issues which need to be addressed in this debate, ranging, as I said from the role of emerging technologies and social media, the role of the State, the abilities of corporations to protect their legitimate interests and the rights of private citizens to go about their affairs without unlawful violation of their privacy. In this context it should not be forgotten that an individuals right to privacy is not a constitutionally recognised right and also a right protected under the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.</p><p>  If the government decides that we need substantive legislation in this area, then the 2006 Bill will need some repair to ensure it achieves the objectives of preventing unwarranted intrusions into individuals&rsquo; personal privacy and striking a proper balance between the rights of individuals and the public interest.  I should, of course, emphasise that violations of privacy may arise in a number of different contexts and are not, as is commonly assumed, the sole preserve of the traditional print or broadcasting media. Increasingly, we are seeing publication of citizens, via social media, of material which infringes the privacy of others. Unfortunately, there appears to be an insufficient understanding by users of social media of potential impacts on their privacy in that new sphere.</p><p>  I remain a firm believer in the right of the media to fearless investigate and express views on matters of public interest. However, this cannot be at the expense of the rights of citizens to go about their business and to retain, as they choose, their anonymity.  Most of the Irish media have been generally respectful of privacy. In this context, they are mindful of the principles contained in the Press Council Code of Conduct and the protection offered by the Constitution and as enunciated in a number of court decisions over the years relating to an individual's Constitutional right to privacy. Unfortunately, however, this is not always so and on occasion principle is overcome by sensationalism and false outrage in the pursuit of perceived commercial benefit in the heat of the competitive media environment and the pressures created by the speed of web based journalism and 24/7 continuous broadcast news. With regard to some reporting it is not so much about revelations in the public interest but stories to stimulate or satiate prurient interest.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-10-24a.17.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012102400071#WRB01300"><p>I am informed by the Garda authorities that Operation Fiacla is running for 12 months initially, with effect from February 2012.  The Operation is the subject of regular monitoring and review by senior Garda management and is focused on identifying and targeting gangs involved in burglaries around the country so as to disrupt their activities and bring them before the Courts.  Operation Fiacla is intelligence driven, and specific burglary initiatives have been implemented in each Garda Region to target suspect offenders. These initiatives optimise the use of existing structures and local Garda management ensure that all personnel are fully briefed on the initiative, with Divisional Crime Management Teams playing a key coordination and implementation role.  I am further informed that, as of 19 October 2012, 2,493 persons have been arrested and 1,404 persons have been charged as part of the Operation, reflecting the very substantial efforts being made to tackle this problem by the Garda&iacute;.</p><p>  In relation to the cost of the Operation, it is understood that a separate dedicated budget has not been established for this initiative and it would necessitate a disproportionate amount of Garda time and resources to calculate this. However, every effort is being made by Garda management, under the remit of the respective regional policing plans prepared under Operation Fiacla, for duty associated with these initiatives to be conducted as part of routine, rostered, policing activities.</p><p>  I am, of course, conscious of the deep distress which burglary can cause to householders and of the broader impact it can have in terms of fear of crime in our communities. I very much welcome the fact that the Garda Commissioner is deploying the substantial resources available to him in a targeted approach to confront those engaged in this form of criminality. I am hopeful that the successes of Operation Fiacla will be reflected in future crime statistics published by the Central Statistics Office in relation to burglaries.</p></reply>

The Commissioner has assured me that each and every line of inquiry is being or will be pursued.  Upon receipt of a final report from the Commissioner I will review the situation.  I understand that the officers carrying out the examination are continuing to keep the family members of the deceased updated on progress.  While I fully appreciate the concerns of the family, in any case where criminal behaviour is suspected it is only through a Garda investigation, and where evidence of criminal wrongdoing is available through the submission of a file by the Garda&iacute; to the Director of Public Prosecutions, that persons can be brought fully to account.  I therefore hope the Deputy will agree that, in the first instance, we need to allow the present Garda examination to proceed to its conclusion.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-10-24a.23.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012102400071#WRB01900"><p>I take it that the Deputy is referring to regulation in regard to the law on defamation which falls within my area of responsibility. Regulation of the broadcast media or issues in regard to ownership of media do not fall within my Department's area of responsibility.  I have no particular plans at this time in regard to regulation of the print media. A review of the operations of the Defamation Act 2009 is required within five years of its coming into operation.The print media is regulated by an independent press Council. Section 44 of the Defamation Act 2009 provides for the Minister for Justice and Equality to make an Order, subject to the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas granting statutory recognition as a Press Council to a body that seeks recognition as such. It requires that the Minister be satisfied that the applicant body complies with the provisions set out in Schedule 2. No more than one such body can be recognised and the order may be revoked.</p><p>  On 21 April, 2010, the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform signed the Defamation Act 2009 (Press Council) Order 2010  (S.I. No. 163 of 2010) granting recognition to the Press Council of Ireland. The Order took immediate effect.  Formal recognition of the Press Council grants qualified privilege to the decisions and reports of the Press Council and the Press Ombudsman. This strengthens and underpins the system of press regulation in Ireland which can only serve to improve the service to the general public.</p><p>  It is appropriate that strong emphasis is being placed by the Press Council and Ombudsman on resolving complaints through conciliation or mediation. Moreover, the print industry is, in general,  committed to the press complaints initiative and has provided the necessary financial backing to support its operation. This co-operation is vital to the long term success of the new Irish press complaints system. The new complaints system is, I believe, providing a useful, efficient and cost free remedy for members of the public who are affected by breaches of the Code of Practice.  A most important requirement is that publications that are members of the Press Council have to publish in full, decisions of either the Press Ombudsman or the Press Council, which uphold complaints made under the Code of Practice for Newspapers and Periodicals.</p></reply>

On top of that personal tragedy, his murder was also an event that can only be described as a heinous crime carried out by ruthless individuals.  As the Deputy will be aware, this case is currently being examined by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s Serious Crime Review Team.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that that assessment will be completed in November.  I am conscious that this is a matter of great concern to the Fallon family but I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that it would be best to await the outcome of the Garda assessment.</p></reply>

I envisage that the title of the Bill will reflect this approach.</p><p>  The Bill proposes replacement of the Wards of Court system with a modern statutory framework to support persons with impaired decision-making ability. The Wards of Court system is regarded as unsuited to modern conditions and incapable of coping with projected demographic growth and increased need for the management of the affairs of persons who lack capacity. The terminology and concepts used in the existing legislation of 1871 are regarded as inappropriate to the modern understanding of mental illness and legal capacity.</p><p>  The enactment of new legislation is one of the core elements of the remaining work to be completed to enable ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and work on the Bill is ongoing.&quot;</p><p>  The main proposals under development in the Bill are to:</p><p>  - provide a legal framework to support persons with impaired decision-making capacity to manage their personal welfare and property and financial affairs</p><p>  - change existing law from the current all or nothing status approach to a functional one, whereby decision-making capacity is assessed on an issue- and time-specific basis</p><p>  - provide that the Circuit Court will have jurisdiction to deal with determinations of capacity and to make orders consequent on such declarations, including the appointment of suitable persons authorised to take decisions on specified matters in support of the person lacking capacity</p><p>  - provide, in circumstances where it is not possible for a person to exercise their capacity even with support, that another person appointed by the Court may act as their representative</p><p>  - clarify the law for carers who take on responsibility for persons who lack capacity</p><p>  - establish an Office of Public Guardian, with supervisory powers to protect vulnerable persons</p><p>  - subsume into the Bill the provisions in the Powers of Attorney Act 1996 on enduring powers in order to bring them into line with the general principles and safeguards in the Bill.</p><p>  As matters stand, there is no charge or court fee payable for an application to allow a ward of court travel outside the State. When a person is made a ward, the Court is vested with jurisdiction over all matters relating to the person and their estate. Because the Court has full jurisdiction and responsibility for the affairs of a ward of court, the consent of the Court is needed to bring the ward outside the jurisdiction. In practice, this is done by application made by the committee of the ward (who is usually a family member of the ward) to the Office of the Wards of Court.</p><p>  Only in the most exceptional circumstances - for example in an application to allow a ward to travel outside the State for a form of medical treatment that would not be performed in Ireland - would such an application be required to be brought before the President of the High Court or other Judge assigned to wardship matters. There is no fee payable for such an application but there might be legal costs involved as is the case in any court proceedings.</p></reply>

The matters raised relate to the Conveyancing Conflicts of Interest Regulation which was adopted by the Council of the Law Society on 7 September 2012 with a view to it coming into effect on 1 January 2013.  The Law Society is the independent statutory body for the regulation of the solicitors profession in the State. Section 5 of the Solicitors Act 1954 provides for the Society to make regulations which are necessary for the carrying out of its functions and requires that such regulations be laid by the Society before each House of the Oireachtas as has happened in respect of this regulation on 2 October 2012 under S.I. No. 375/2012.</p><p>  The new regulation, which prohibits the same solicitor from acting for both vendor and purchaser in conveyancing transactions, was made by the Law Society on foot of the recommendations contained in the &quot;Conveyancing Conflicts Task Force Report&quot; published by the Society in July. The Task Force was specifically set up to look at the existing guidelines and regulations relating to solicitors acting for both parties in such transactions. The Report, which is publicly available on the Law Society's website (www.lawsociety.ie), details the arguments that were put forward both in favour of and against the introduction of this regulation and explains the reasons behind the decision to propose its adoption. It sets out how the Task Force undertook extensive consultations with members of the solicitors profession and other relevant interested parties and stakeholders and took account, inter alia, of the November 2010 joint HSE and UCD report concerning the &quot;Abuse and Neglect of Older People in Ireland&quot;. The Task Force also researched and reviewed the regulatory regimes in other jurisdictions and analysed judicial and academic commentary relevant to all issues considered.</p><p>  I would expect the relevant costs arising from this regulation to even out on the basis of the actual work being done for each party concerned and this is something that can be monitored including in the context of the new and more transparent legal costs regime to be introduced under the Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011. I also have to acknowledge the lessons of previous litigation in this area and of our last property boom which point to the fundamental need to avoid conflicts of interests in the conduct of conveyancing transactions - be that on the part of solicitors or on the part of their clients including where multiple, elderly or otherwise vulnerable family members may be concerned. While it would be better if such protections were not necessary at all, there can be no doubt that the new Regulation affords better protection - both to solicitors and to their respective clients - from any claims, now or in the future, that the issue of undue influence arises in relation to any conveyancing transaction concerned. Similarly, in non-family conveyancing transactions, the interests of seller and purchaser would seem better represented and protected in their own right under the new Regulation.</p></reply>

As the Deputy will be aware from my replies to previous Parliamentary Questions, the Irish Prison Service provides a wide range of rehabilitative programmes that include education, vocational training, healthcare, psychiatric, psychological, counselling, welfare and spiritual services.  These programmes are available in all prisons and all prisoners are eligible to use the services.   On committal, all prisoners are interviewed by the Governor and are informed of the services available in the prison.  At this point prisoners may be referred to services or they can self refer at a later date.  Where Governors consider, on the information available, that a prisoner needs a particular intervention they will initiate a referral.</p><p>  The Irish Prison Service has also introduced an Integrated Sentence Management (ISM) system which involves a new orientation in the delivery of services to prisoners and an emphasis on prisoners taking greater personal responsibility for their own development through active engagement with both specialist and non-specialist services in the prisons.  The end result is a prisoner-centred multi-disciplinary approach to working with prisoners with provision for initial assessment, goal setting and periodic review to measure progress.</p><p>  The development of prisoner programmes forms a central part of the new Irish Prison Service Three Year Strategic Plan 2012 - 2015.  There is a clear commitment in the Strategy to enhance sentence planning including Integrated Sentence Management and the delivery of prison based rehabilitative programmes such as education, work training and resettlement programmes.</p><p>  As regards the numbers involved, I can confirm that an average of 38% of the prison population attended educational classes in 2011.  The development of vocational training programmes in recent years means that there are now over 100 workshops capable of catering for in excess of 1,000 prisoners each day.  Returns at the end of August 2012 show that approximately 23% of the prison population were engaged in vocational training programmes. There was also a significant increase in the number of prisoners who participated in accredited vocational training course in 2011, when 1219 prisoners attended such courses.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-10-24a.39.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012102400072#WRC00500"><p>The Reception and Integration agency of the Department of Justice and Equality is responsible for the accommodation of asylum seekers in accordance with the Government policy of direct provision.   RIA is required to review its accommodation portfolio on an ongoing basis to reflect current and projected demand for bed spaces. There has in recent years been a consistent downward trend in demand for RIA accommodation. This requires RIA to either end contracts when they come up for renewal or to seek a reduction in capacity. This enables RIA to remain within budget and ensures that the State is not paying for unnecessary services at a time of critical financial pressure.</p><p>  Following the receipt of a number of representations in respect of the closure of the Lisbrook accommodation centre in Galway, I indicated that a review of that decision would take place having regard, inter alia, to the impact on school children of such a closure, as well as the broader financial restrictions within which RIA must operate.  Following this review, I have decided that the decision of RIA should stand.  The fundamental problem with keeping Lisbrook open to the end of the school year in July, 2013 is cost. Effectively, RIA would be buying beds over a 7 month period in 2013 which it does not need. The cost would be over &euro;2 million and I believe that those resources could be put to better use.</p><p>  Plainly, closing down family centres during the non-school summer months is a more desirable option. But the fact is that RIA contract end dates for all its centres are deliberately staggered throughout the year to take account of the ebb and flow of demand for asylum seeker accommodation.  RIA now has spare capacity of 14.8% in its overall portfolio and this must be reduced towards the 10% level recommended in the 2010 Value for Money (VFM) Report on RIA accommodation.  Arising from the closure of Lisbrook and other centres this year, as well as reductions in capacity elsewhere, RIA will - based on current occupancy levels - be within the 10% VFM guideline at the end of this year.</p><p>  RIA makes every effort to keep family centres open, preferring instead to reduce contracted capacities.  But in some cases the economies of scale are such that closure is the only option that remains. RIA engaged in negotiations with its contractors over the course of this year but, as in the case of Lisbrook, some of these negotiations did not resolve themselves before the summer 'window'.  Moreover, having all RIA contracts for family centres end only in July and August each year would make the logistics of running the RIA accommodation system very difficult indeed, leaving aside the problem of having to bear the costs of unnecessary beds in the meantime.</p><p>  That said, I am very conscious of the disruption that will be caused by the closure of this centre. I have instructed RIA to ensure that families of all those children attending secondary school will transfer to another family centre in Galway &ndash; the Eglington in Salthill &ndash; in order that their education should not be interrupted.  These children will continue to attend the same secondary schools. Further, for those families who will be required to transfer to other centres, RIA staff will ensure that it re-locates school-going children in alternative centres where they could access schools nearby.</p><p>  RIA will work with accommodation centre management teams and State service providers locally at each of its accommodation centres to link families and individuals to services as quickly as possible, including local schools, hospitals, Public Health Nurse, GP services, Community Welfare and other services. This process is undertaken in respect of any closure of a centre or where residents move from one centre to another.  In relation to the suggestion that asylum seekers be provided access to full social welfare benefits, this issue was addressed in a Value for Money report on the direct provision system published in 2010 which found that in comparison with a number of options including social welfare, the policy of direct provision was considered to be the best choice for a number of reasons. It is less costly, it is less likely to act as an incentive to new asylum seekers, and it allows the State to manage the challenge of asylum seekers in a way that reduces pressure on local services.</p><p>  Expanding full social welfare benefits to asylum seekers would be contrary to long standing Government policy and is not being contemplated.  Such a policy would have consequences beyond the asylum system, including in relation to the Habitual Residency Condition introduced by the Minister for Social Protection in  2004 which prohibits certain social welfare payments - child benefit or one parent family payment, for example - to a number of non-qualifying groups including asylum seekers. </p></reply>

As you will be aware the Government committed, in the Programme for Government to remove 16 and 17 year old offenders completely from the adult prison system.  In this context, the practice of sending 16 year old boys to St Patrick's ceased on 1st May, 2012. From that date, all newly remanded or sentenced 16 year olds have been detained in the children detention facilities in Oberstown. The Government also sanctioned the provision of the necessary funding for a new detention facility at Oberstown. This is due for completion in mid-2014.  These matters were all dealt with by me in cooperation with my colleague Frances Fitzgerald TD, Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.</p><p>  In the interim, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs has agreed to examine the feasibility of accommodating some categories of 17 year old boys in Oberstown on a phased basis earlier than mid 2014, if possible. Arrangements are also being made for a number of care staff from the Children Detention Schools to work on placement in St Patrick's Institution alongside Prison Staff.

Government policy in this area aims to support and encourage best practice. An aspect of particular importance is charity fundraising. To support best practice in this regard, my Department is currently providing grant funding to a project managed by umbrella charities organisation Irish Charities Tax Research Limited. This project involves the promotion of a voluntary code of practice for charity fundraising. All charities that engage in fundraising from the public are encouraged to sign up to and adhere to this code, the core principles of which are respect, honesty and openness. For the sake of clarity, I can add that this code, with its specific focus on fundraising, is not a general governance code for the community and voluntary sector.</p><p>  Regarding the issue of transparency in the financial governance of charities, it is important to acknowledge that many charitable organisations do operate to high levels of transparency with respect to their finances. There is much good practice in the sector. It needs to be supported where it exists and spread to areas where it is less evident. The Deputy will recall that one of the purposes of the Charities Act of 2009 is to increase transparency in the charities sector. The further implementation of this Act, including the establishment of an independent Charities Regulatory Authority, has been delayed for budgetary reasons, in light of likely costs associated with the establishment of the Authority. As I have emphasised on previous occasions to this House and elsewhere, the decision to defer the full implementation of the Charities Act was taken for budgetary reasons. It remains the intention of Government to advance the fundamental objectives of the Charities Act, including with respect to increasing transparency in the sector. My Department is examining how best to progress the implementation of the Act in the current circumstances. I intend to consult on proposals for this in the coming months. </p><p>  Under the Charities Act, charities will be required to provide annual reports and accounts to the Charities Regulatory Authority, which will in turn be required to make these available to the public. This will greatly enhance the transparency of the sector and in doing so will foster greater accountability and protection against abuse of charitable status and fraud. Notwithstanding this, it should also be recalled that the Charities Act is not prescriptive in matters such as the remuneration of the employees of charitable organisations, which continue to be a matter for individual charities, within the relevant statutory frameworks. As part of the forthcoming consultation on the implementation of the Charities Act, I will also be inviting views on the appropriate levels of financial and activity reporting by charities, bearing in mind the overall objectives of the Act.</p><p>  In the mean time, I would like to remind the House that there is in existence a broad range of regulatory oversight measures that can apply to charities. Many charities are already subject to scrutiny by various State Bodies. As the Deputy has pointed out, many charities receive significant levels of Government funding through grants, contracts for service delivery, and so on. In relation to how they use and account for these public funds, these charities are subject to the oversight of the relevant grant-making or contracting Departments and Agencies, and, where appropriate, of the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General. The Revenue Commissioners have granted charitable tax exemptions to almost 8,000 charities and have significant powers to ensure that such charities comply with tax law. Many charities are incorporated and, as such, are subject to the provisions of company law and required to provide certain information to the Companies Registration Office under the Companies Acts. This information can then be accessed by the public. Such charities would also potentially be subject to scrutiny by the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement. Charities that take the form of a trust are subject to the provisions of trust law. And, of course, any business entity is subject to general criminal and fraud legislation.</p></reply>

While it would be premature to speculate on what it might contain, I do expect that it will contain measures dealing with the further rationalisation of the Garda station network. It is important to remember that when preparing the plan, the Commissioner must, under the Act, have regard to a number of matters, including the resources available to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the priorities for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as determined by the Minister, relevant Government policy, and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's own strategy statement. In drawing up arrangements for the policing of the State each year, the Commissioner and his senior management team also take a number of other factors into account, including population, crime levels and trends, and policing priorities.  The objective is to ensure that optimum use is made of Garda resources and the most effective policing service is provided to the public.</p></reply>

Operational orders are prepared in every Garda Region, in particular in the Dublin Metropolitan Region and Border Divisions, to prevent and detect the organised importation for sale of fireworks and police the Halloween period generally. Persons suspected of engaging in the importation, supply or sale of fireworks are identified and targeted, including through intelligence led operations and searches.</p><p>  During the Halloween period, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na engages with local communities, local authorities and other stakeholders, such as Dublin Bus and the vintners&rsquo; associations, in putting plans in place to address the issues that arise. Through the Schools Programme and other local programmes, members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na deliver the message that fireworks are illegal and highlight the dangers associated with illegally imported fireworks. Garda&iacute; have a liaison mechanism in place with local authorities for the removal of identified stockpiles of combustible materials in advance of Halloween. They also advise managers of off-licences to ensure that their staff are aware of their obligations and responsibilities under licensing legislation relating to the sale of alcohol, in particular to underage persons.</p><p>  Proactive policing arrangements are in place in the period leading up to and during Halloween. Additional patrols are carried out by uniform personnel as part of high visibility policing initiatives, supported by plain clothes personnel, including District detective and drug units, Divisional crime task forces and Traffic Corps personnel and community policing and mounted bike units, supported by public order units as required. Patrols are directed to pay particular attention to areas where people tend to congregate and where the likelihood of both anti-social behaviour and drinking on the streets may occur.</p><p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will utilise the strong legislative provisions in place to combat anti-social behaviour and the misuse of fireworks, including those in the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Acts 1994 and 2003, the Criminal Justice Act 2006 and the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008.</p></reply>

I also published the Irish Prison Service's Action Plan for implementing the Inspector's recommendations.  The report raises serious issues and major concerns including weak management, behaviour of some prison staff, the culture in the prison, the inattention to human rights norms, prisoners on protection and prevalence of drugs.  The Inspector concluded that there has been a culture in St Patrick&rsquo;s which resulted in the human rights of some prisoners (children and young adults) being either ignored or violated.</p><p>  As I informed the House on Wednesday 17 October, neither I nor the Government will tolerate the type of abuse outlined by the Inspector in his report on St Patrick's Institution. Simply put, it is unacceptable and will not be tolerated.  It is also important not to lose sight of the fact that the Inspector acknowledges in his report that the vast majority of staff in St. Patrick's carry out their duties in a professional manner and the problem lies with a very small minority of staff.</p><p>  For many years, I had concerns about St Patrick's and believed that it was an inappropriate facility for children. I was instrumental in ensuring that the Programme for Government included a specific commitment to end the practice of sending children there. I visited St Patrick's within two weeks of my appointment and I met with the Inspector at his request in early May last to discuss the situation with him.</p><p>  An Action Plan addressing all of the Inspector's recommendations was put into place without delay. This included the appointment of a new senior management team which has been tasked with providing clear and decisive leadership to the staff in order that the problems outlined by the Inspector are dealt with quickly and effectively. This team, lead by the new Governor, is liaising closely with the Director General of the Irish Prison Service and the Inspector of Prisons to ensure that each and every one of the Inspector's recommendations are implemented. Concrete measures have already been taken with over 80% of the recommendations being implemented to date. </p><p>  Indeed in this context, the Irish Prison Service has also undertaken to ensure enhanced  prison healthcare procedures are put in place, and records are maintained on the removal and relocation of prisoners. A new dedicated committal unit is in operation, and a new vulnerable persons unit is also being established. Additional security arrangements have been introduced to minimise drugs and contraband entering the prison. Educational facilities will be improved along with the provision of an incentivised regimes programme and an improvement in physical conditions and  facilities generally.</p><p>  The practice of sending 16 year old boys to St Patrick's has already ceased with effect from the 1st May and my colleague, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, has agreed to examine the feasibility of accommodating some categories of 17 year old boys in Oberstown on a phased basis. The remit of the Ombudsman for Children was extended in July of this year to include St Patrick's Institution. The Government has also sanctioned the provision of necessary funding for a new detention facility at Oberstown, which is due for completion in mid 2014. In the meantime, arrangements are currently being made for a number of care staff from the Children Detention Schools to work on placement in St Patrick's Institution alongside Prison Staff. It is intended that this will take place within the next two months.</p><p>  In the interim, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs has agreed to examine the feasibility of accommodating some categories of 17 year old boys in Oberstown on a phased basis earlier than mid 2014, if possible. Arrangements are also being made for a number of care staff from the Children Detention Schools to work on placement in St Patrick&rsquo;s Institution alongside Prison Staff. It is intended that this will take place within the next two months. In addition, as I have already mentioned the remit of the Ombudsman for Children was extended in July of this year to include St Patrick&rsquo;s Institution - something which she has been seeking for a number of years and a request with which previous Governments failed to agree.</p><p>  A new complaints procedure is also being introduced. This process has recently been completed with the appointment of a panel of 22 external investigators and the new complaints system will be introduced on the 1st of November. I have instructed the Director General of the IPS to direct the new investigators to commence an examination of previous complaints in St. Patrick's Institution, such as those referred to by the Inspector in his report.</p></reply>

The Deputy will recall that following extensive consideration of this matter, the Government announced in December last that it had decided not to proceed with such legislation.  There was a substantial concern that any legislative scheme involving interference in the contractual relationships of private parties would find it extremely difficult to survive a Constitutional challenge.  In addition, the Government was advised that any model proposed would require the payment of compensation to landlords whose rights were infringed in order to ensure that the proposal would be compatible with the Constitution and with the European Convention on Human Rights.  The Government was strongly of the view that payment of compensation to landlords in such circumstances could not be justified in the current economic climate.  </p><p>  Although legislative intervention may not be feasible, NAMA is playing a role in dealing with problems caused by upward only rent reviews applying to NAMA properties, and since the start of the year has approved cumulative rent reductions of over &euro;6 million.  I would also mention that I have commenced the Property Services (Regulation) Act 2011 which, amongst other matters, provides for the establishment and maintenance of a Commercial Leases Database by the Property Services Regulatory Authority.  This Database will assist in providing readily accessible, accurate information in order to determine the market rent payable in respect of comparable commercial properties.  Work is underway to ensure that the Database will be operational at an early date.  </p><p>  Finally, I wish to highlight the existence of a rent review arbitration code which was drawn up by a group of experts whose membership was drawn from all stakeholders in the commercial property arena.  The code, which can be found on www.justice.ie,  provides a mechanism to deal with the resolution of rent review disputes in the commercial property sector.</p></reply>

The Irish Short-stay Visa Waiver Programme, which was devised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department, commenced on 1 July, 2011 and was originally scheduled to run on a pilot basis until the end of October, 2012. It allows tourists or business people who have lawfully entered the UK, including Northern Ireland, on a valid UK visa to travel on to Ireland without the requirement to obtain an Irish visa. The Government decided on 12 March to extend the Programme for a further period of four years i.e. to end October 2016 in the light, particularly, of the positive response from tourism agencies and operators.</p><p>  The Programme as it operates at present does not for technical reasons allow for reciprocity between the UK and Ireland. This is primarily due to the UK requirement that all visa applicants supply fingerprint (biometrics) data electronically as an essential element of applying for a UK visa. Quite obviously Ireland does not have the capacity to capture such data for all visa applications worldwide; currently for UK visas this is done in over 150 countries.</p><p>  However, in tandem with the Visa Waiver Programme, work is ongoing, through the regular Common Travel Area Forum meetings between INIS and the UK Home Office, on the development of a short stay Common Travel Area visa which would allow tourists and business visitors to travel to the CTA and to travel freely between Ireland and the UK. It is anticipated that such a visa will prove an attractive option for tourists and business visitors, particularly in the context of the island of Ireland by facilitating visitors to travel freely between Northern Ireland and Ireland without the need for a separate Irish or UK visa.</p><p>  The Common Travel Area visa proposal is an excellent example of the manner in which the Irish and UK immigration authorities are working in close cooperation both to preserve the integrity of the CTA and to harness its potential to deliver economic and tourism benefits for both countries.</p></reply>

Multi-agency approaches have been, and continue to be, used by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na whereby all of the National Units including the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Drugs Unit and the Garda Technical Bureau, along with the Criminal Assets Bureau, are use to combat serious crime including those involved in the trafficking, importation, sale an supply of illegal drugs.</p><p>  As referred to by the Deputy, the emergence in recent times of cannabis cultivation sites and the illicit trade in medicines are particular features of the current drugs landscape.  In this regard, the Garda National Drugs Unit continues to spearhead  &lsquo;Operation Nitrogen&rsquo;, which is an intelligence-led nationwide operation focused on the discovery, and investigation into, cannabis cultivation sites and the prosecution of persons and criminal organisations responsible for them.  As highlighted in the Garda Sioch&aacute;na Annual Report for 2011, this ongoing targeted initiative led to over 500 cannabis grow houses being located under intelligence led operations, resulting in over 26,000 cannabis plants with an estimated value of &euro;10.5m being seized. </p><p>  With regard to the illicit trade in medicines, I can inform the Deputy that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to work closely with all of the relevant State agencies tasked with the enforcement of the medicines legislation.  This was clearly demonstrated by the recent involvement of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, together with the Irish Medicines Board and the Revenue Customs Service, in Operation Pangea V.

At end September, 2012, RIA was providing accommodation and ancillary services to 4,965 asylum seekers at 36 accommodation centres throughout the State.</p><p>  The Direct Provision system is unique and there is no direct comparison with other types of accommodation where children would reside, be it houses with gardens or apartment buildings. Some accommodation centres have more outdoor and indoor facilities than others.  Of the current 36 asylum centres in RIA's portfolio, only 3 were specifically built for the sole purpose of accommodating asylum seekers, that is, they were 'purpose-built'.  All other centres must operate within the physical limitations of the premises' original use e.g. hotel, college dormitory, hostel, etc.  While all conform, at the very least, to minimum contractual and legislative standards, there are necessarily a range of facilities available in centres in the overall RIA portfolio, deriving from their original use.</p><p>  RIA and the management at the centres work with local schools, community groups, sports clubs and NGO's to link children and families into community initiatives, sports and other activities to ensure access to the best available package of services.  Children of asylum seekers can access recreational facilities available in the locality in which they are living.  Some Direct Provision Centres have on-site playgrounds.  Many centres will provide other facilities, for example facilitating parties, and will also facilitate NGO&rsquo;s who organise outings etc. Centres also have links with local community facilities which allow for free and discounted access to amenities outside of the accommodation centre.</p><p>  It is worth noting that asylum seeker children benefit from access to primary and secondary education on the same basis as Irish citizen children in the local community, and both schools and the Community Welfare Service are very supportive of those children in assisting with any associated costs in respect of equipment and transport. An exemption from fees for State Examinations is also available to asylum seekers who are holders of medical cards. Homework clubs and quiet spaces are provided in family centres to facilitate children doing their homework. </p><p>  On-site pre-school services are available in some of the larger direct provision centres. However, in all cases parents may opt to send their children to privately run pre-schools in the community. The Early Child Care and Education (ECCE) Scheme provides for free pre-school placements to all children, including children of asylum seekers in direct provision accommodation.</p></reply>

The programme is central to our foreign policy, has an enviable international reputation, and consistently enjoys strong political and public support.  For 2012, the Government has allocated &euro;639 million to Official Development Assistance (ODA). This level of allocation is expected to achieve an ODA/GNP percentage target of 0.51% - a significant achievement given the extremely difficult economic circumstances facing the country, and a very clear indication of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the poor and hungry in the world. </p><p>  A detailed breakdown of Ireland&rsquo;s ODA is published each year in the statistical annexes to the Irish Aid Annual Report.  The annexes provide a comprehensive analysis of Ireland&rsquo;s ODA, including the developing countries supported; the areas or sectors in which we engage, and the partner organisations implementing our development programmes. I am arranging for a copy of the most recent publication to be sent to the Deputy.  The Government is ambitious for Ireland&rsquo;s overseas aid programme. We are determined to maintain and build on its high international reputation, and to ensure that it continues to build the foundation of real change, future prosperity and wellbeing in the lives of many of the world&rsquo;s poorest people. </p></reply>

The Department of Finance conducted an extensive economic impact assessment during the summer and autumn of 2011 relating to &ldquo;legacy&rdquo; property-based tax relief schemes. This involved: An analysis of all available data from the Revenue Commissioners on claims to date in respect of legacy property reliefs; An analysis of Central Bank and financial institution data in respect of mortgage arrears and defaults in the residential buy to let sector; The production of a detailed consultation paper which presented all preliminary analysis of the data from Revenue Commissioners as well as the Department&rsquo;s own internal economic modelling; A six week consultation period was held to enable all interested parties to submit their views. In addition a copy of the consultation paper was provided to all members of the Oireachtas;  The production and publication of a detailed economic model on how a removal of the legacy property reliefs would impact on individuals; Reviewing and analysing some 750 responses to the consultation paper; Detailed analysis of the impact on various investor types and on jobs and business in a number of economic sectors (healthcare, hotels, student accommodation).</p><p>  The analysis and findings in the final report, which was published and is available on my department&rsquo;s website, were reviewed and validated by the Central Expenditure Evaluation Unit (CEEU) of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and by economic consultants Indecon International Economic Consultants.</p><p>  Finance Bill 2012 contained two measures related to property reliefs designed to reduce the ongoing cost of these schemes to the Exchequer and to eliminate it in as short a time as possible. </p><p>  With effect from 1 January 2012, a USC surcharge will be introduced on all investors with annual gross incomes over &euro;100,000. The surcharge will apply at a rate of 5% on the amount of income sheltered by property reliefs in a given year and will be in addition to any normal USC payable on this income. This USC surcharge will apply to all investors with this level of gross income regardless of whether they invested in Section 23 type investments or accelerated capital allowance schemes.  </p><p>  In addition, investors in accelerated capital allowance schemes will no longer be able to use any capital allowances beyond the tax life of the particular scheme where that tax life ends after 1 January 2015. Where the tax life of a scheme has ended before 1 January 2015 no carry forward of allowances into 2015 will be allowed. The delayed implementation of this measure is designed to give individuals time to adjust to the absence of the carry forward provision.  </p><p>  The interest restriction on residential landlords was introduced in the April 2009 supplementary budget as part of an urgent revenue-raising package aimed at stabilising the public finances.  The reduction in the level at which interest could be claimed for residential rental properties significantly reduced the cost of this relief to the Exchequer. In the case of interest accruing on or after 7 April 2009 (insofar as it would otherwise be allowable) the deduction available to the landlord is limited to 75% of such interest.</p></reply>

The levy will operate for a period of 4 years only (2011 to 2014) and the legislative provisions giving effect to the levy (section 4 of Finance (No 2) Act 2011) were specifically drafted to reflect this.</p><p>The moneys raised from the pension fund levy are being used to pay for the Government&rsquo;s Jobs Initiative introduced in May 2011. The measures introduced as part of the Jobs Initiative   include a new 9% VAT rate on certain activities, the halving of the lower rate of PRSI and small amounts of additional current and capital expenditure.</p><p>The implementation of a jobs and growth strategy is a key priority of the Government. The measures announced in the Jobs Initiative   are aimed at assisting in employment generation &ndash; providing opportunities for those who are out of work, to restore public morale and confidence in the economy and encourage spending by consumers. </p><p>  The chargeable persons for the levy are the trustees or other persons (including insurance companies) with responsibility for the management of the assets of the pension schemes or plans. The payment of the levy is treated as a necessary expense of a pension scheme and the trustees or insurer, as appropriate, are entitled, where they decide to do so, to adjust current or prospective benefits payable under a scheme to take account of the levy. It is up to the trustees to decide whether and how the levy should be passed on and who should be impacted and to what extent, given the particular circumstances of the pension schemes for which they are responsible. </p><p>  However, the legislation also includes safeguards aimed at ensuring that benefits payable, either currently or prospectively to any member, are adjusted in such a way that the reduction in value of those benefits shall not exceed 0.6% of the market value of the assets accounting for the scheme&rsquo;s liabilities to that member. </p><p>  I am conscious of the concerns of pension scheme members about the impact of a levy in circumstances where the pensions sector, in common with other sectors in our economy and society, is finding the current economic and financial environment very challenging.  However, much of the value of pension funds is attributable to the rolled up value of generous tax reliefs that pension savings have historically been granted and continue to receive. The imposition of the levy is for a relatively short period and its purpose is to improve the economic environment by providing the means to encourage job creation in areas of our economy most likely to deliver that employment quickly. </p></reply>

They are not assigned to specific areas of expenditure but rather form part of the pot from which overall Exchequer expenditure is funded.  However, it is the case that receipts from the Household Charge are directed to the Local Government Fund, rather than the Central Fund. </p><p>  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform published the Revised Book of Estimates (REV) for 2012 in February. The REV sets out the voted expenditure allocations for every Government Department and Office.  A breakdown of expenditure from the Local Government Fund is shown on page 114 of the 2012 REV. </p><p>  Similarly, receipts from PRSI are allocated to the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) and the National Training Fund (NTF), rather than the Central Fund. The bulk of receipts go to the SIF. Spending from the SIF is directed to benefit schemes. A complete breakdown of expenditure from the SIF can be found in the 2012 Further Revised Estimate for the Department of Social Protection. It should be noted that as the income of the SIF is presently insufficient to cover all of its expenditures, a subvention is required from the Exchequer to meet the shortfall. Expenditure under the NTF supports training and the identification of skills needs. A breakdown of NTF expenditure can be found on page 133 of the 2012 REV. It should be noted note that the estimated income from contributions on the NTF in 2012 has been revised to &euro;300.8 million.</p><p>  PAYE, Universal Social Charge (USC) and DIRT receipts form part of income tax and are paid into the Central Fund.

However, an institution may choose to apply such internal account structures at its own discretion and so the Central Bank has no power in this area to approve/reject such revisions.</p><p>  In December 2011, the Central Bank of Ireland published the findings of research into charges applied by the main retail banks to personal current accounts. The research found that customers whose accounts go into an unauthorised overdraft position pay the highest fees. The highest current account costs occur when consumers have high numbers of out-of-order transactions occurring on their account such as unauthorised overdrafts, unpaid direct debits and over-limit or referral fees. Customers may make savings by using electronic transactions in place of manual transactions, where possible.</p><p>If customers are not satisfied with their current account provider for any reason, including cost of fees, they have the right to switch to a different provider.

However, I am aware of recent media reports which refer to the ways that some companies structure their international tax affairs to minimise their tax costs.  The ability of entities to reduce their tax liabilities using international structures reflects the global context in which Ireland and indeed all countries operate.  In general, companies are required to pay corporation tax in the country where they carry on the economic activity, not necessarily where their customers are located.  It is important to state clearly that all companies in Ireland pay the standard 12.5% rate on their trading profits which are generated in Ireland.  </p><p>  I wish to advise the Deputy that the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 requires a company&rsquo;s trading profits to be computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting practice subject to any adjustment required by tax law.   In computing such profits, expenses that are incurred wholly and exclusively for the purposes of the trade, including royalties or licence fees paid for the use of intellectual property, are deductible.  Subsidiaries of multinational groups, whether located in Ireland or other countries, will necessarily incur certain bona fide   expenditures including, for example, royalty payments to group companies in foreign jurisdictions for the use of intellectual property rights. Such payments represent the required remuneration of valuable intangible assets funded and owned outside the State. Ireland cannot expect to receive or retain the remuneration of these assets.  Nevertheless, Irish resident companies are chargeable to corporation tax at the standard 12.5% rate on the full trading profits that are generated from their economic activities here.  </p><p>  The tax code contains transfer pricing rules that apply the OECD&rsquo;s arm&rsquo;s length pricing principle to trading transactions between associated companies. This ensures that the profits chargeable to corporation tax in Ireland fully reflect the functions, assets and risks located here by a multinational group.  As with any other rules in relation to the computation of income for tax purposes, the transfer pricing rules include provision for any adjustments to income and tax payable to be made if required.  I would emphasise that Ireland is fully supportive of international efforts to ensure fairness in taxation.  Ireland participates fully in the EU Code of Conduct Group, which addresses harmful tax competition, and in the OECD Forum on Harmful Tax Practices. </p></reply>

The Credit Union Bill delivers on over 60 of the recommendations in the Commission Report, as the following table clearly shows.  The Commission included representatives of the Irish League of Credit Unions, the Credit Union Development Association, the Credit Union Managers Association, the Central Bank and the Department of Finance, as well as independent members.  The Commission met 29 times between June 2011 and 30 March 2012.</p><p>  The Commission sought direct engagement from credit unions to ensure that its recommendations took account of a broad range of perspectives.  A consultation process sought submissions from members of the public and interested parties that would facilitate the good functioning of the Irish credit union movement into the future.  The submissions received were used to inform the Commission&rsquo;s final report.  Furthermore, the Commission undertook a survey of credit unions in Ireland which sought the opinions of credit union boards on a wide range of issues.  The Commission also received a number of presentations, including from those within the credit union movement.</p><p>  The Commission members took a hands-on approach to the Report and the ILCU was centrally involved in its development, drafting and finalisation. The ILCU is not only a signatory to the agreed report, but a co-author of it.  If we are to build confidence in credit unions it is important that all those who drafted and agreed the Commission report continue to stand behind it.  The difficulties being faced by credit unions and the scale of the challenge ahead require steadfastness and leadership at all levels of the movement. </p><p>  The Government has already shown its commitment to the credit union sector by putting aside a figure of &euro;500m to address problems within the sector at a time when the Government faces difficult budgetary choices and competing needs for scarce resources, there is an onus on the credit union movement to embrace the necessary changes to ensure that this commitment on behalf of the taxpayer delivers a viable sector into the future.</p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s commitment to implementing the Commission Report is backed by solid early delivery of major elements of it: </p><p>  - the publication of the Credit Union Bill 2012 (which implements over 60 recommendations); </p><p>  - the commencement of contributions under the Deposit Guarantee Scheme and fitness and probity; and </p><p>  - the appointment of the Credit Union Restructuring Board and the early commencement of its work. </p><p>  In order to ensure full implementation of the Commission Report, I have established an Implementation Group which includes representatives from the Irish League of Credit Unions, the Credit Union Development Association and the Credit Union Managers Association; the Chair of the statutory Credit Union Advisory Committee; a former member of the Commission on Credit Unions; and representatives from the Central Bank and the Department of Finance.  I have asked my officials to arrange for the issues raised in the correspondence to be considered at the next meeting of that Group.</p><p>  In terms of legislation, the vast bulk of the core provisions to apply to credit unions will be set out in the Credit Union Act 1997 and the Credit Union Bill 2012.  However, as recommended by the Commission Report, the Credit Union Bill 2012 seeks to rectify the legal issues surrounding section 184 of the Credit Union Act 1997, which purports to disapply the Central Bank Acts as far as credit unions are concerned, but which has merely served to create legal doubt on this point.  In revisiting section 184, care has been taken to avoid substantive new policy provisions applying to credit unions arising from what is a largely technical amendment.  For that reason provisions such as section 117 of the Central Bank Act 1989 (and the Central Bank codes made under it) and Part IV of the Central Bank Act 1997 (relating to auditors and compliance statements) are disapplied under the Bill.</p><p>  However, with regard to the Central Bank Acts and other financial services legislation it is also important to understand that the agreed Commission Report cannot be implemented if credit unions are to be excluded from their remit: </p><p>  - The provision for credit unions to appeal to the Irish Financial Services Appeals Tribunal is provided for in Part VIIA of the Central Bank Act 1942;</p><p>  - The facility for credit union members - and indeed credit unions themselves - to continue to seek redress through the Financial Services Ombudsman relies on Part VIIB of the Central Bank Act 1942; </p><p>  - The application of the administrative sanction regime to credit unions relies upon Part IIIC of the Central Bank Act 1942; </p><p>  - The application of fitness and probity to credit unions relies on Part 3 of the Central Bank Reform Act 2010; </p><p>  - The resolution powers which the Commission recommends to be applied to credit unions where appropriate are set out in the Central Bank and Credit Institutions (Resolution) Act 2011.</p><p>  It is not the case that the Central Bank Acts are banking legislation.  The principal domestic Act dealing with the establishment of banks is the Central Bank Act 1971.  The references in that Act to credit unions are specifically required to ensure that credit unions are not subject to a banking regime; for example, by exempting credit unions from the requirement to obtain a banking licence in order to accept members&rsquo; savings.</p><p>  It is worth noting that several other pieces of legislation already apply to credit unions and have done so for many years.  </p><p>  - The application of regulatory levies to credit unions has for many years applied to credit unions under the Central Bank Act 1942; </p><p>  - The insuring of savings at credit unions relies on the application of the Financial Services (Deposit Guarantee Scheme) Act 2009;  </p><p>  - The establishment and operational arrangements for the Registrar of Credit Unions itself are set out in the Central Bank Act 1942.  </p><p>  In the broader financial services area, and as part of their core work, credit unions are already subject to a wide range on non-credit-union-specific legislation, such as the Consumer Credit Regulations 2010, the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Act 2005, the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Act) Act 2010 as well as other legislation of general application, such as the Equality Acts and the Data Protection Acts.   In fact, many credit unions have become able to offer an improved range of services to their members by actively securing authorisation from the Central Bank beyond the confines of the Credit Union Acts under the Insurance Mediation Regulations 2005, the Investment Intermediaries Act 1995 and the European Community (Payment Services) Regulations 2009. </p><p>  The Commission specifically recommended that the powers and functions intended under the Supervision and Enforcement Bill 2011 be applied to credit unions.  Restating these provisions in the Credit Union Bill would have no different legal effect and would create needless duplication in the drafting and parliamentary processes, thereby delaying the reforms to no discernible advantage.  My Department is currently considering the issue of an appeal mechanism from directions issued by the Bank under the Supervision and Enforcement Bill and has already met with ILCU to discuss the matter.</p><p>  With regard to term limits, it is important to note that the Commission was charged with bringing forward recommendations for the Irish credit union sector and that it was not bound to limit its thinking to approaches in place in other financial sectors or in other jurisdictions.  I understand that the Commission recommendation on term limits was the subject of much discussion at the Commission and that the ILCU was centrally involved in the development of the final recommendation, which was clear and unambiguous as regards the limits to apply.  The Commission recommendation is reflected exactly in the Credit Union Bill 2012.</p><p>  The position regarding exclusions from Board membership also reflects the Commission recommendation and the discussion at the Commission when it considered the General Scheme of the Bill.  The ILCU played a full part in considering and agreeing the balanced set of exclusions to apply, which are aimed at underpinning good governance and avoiding conflicts of interest.  </p><p>  The correspondence referred to in the question raises concerns about the removal of the role of the treasurer.  Retaining the role of treasurer would conflict directly with the recommendations of the Commission report.  In order to ensure that the role and responsibilities of board and management do not overlap and that board members have governance rather than executive responsibilities, the Commission specifically recommended that the 1997 Act be amended to remove the role of treasurer and assign executive responsibilities to the management of the credit union. However, cognisant of the fact that credit unions are financial institutions, the Commission recommended that the board should include at least one director with specialised expertise, qualifications and background in financial services and/or accounting matters.</p><p>  Volunteers are central to the success of the credit union movement and to its path towards a viable future.  The Commission&rsquo;s agreed report, and the Credit Union Bill which flows from it, retains the voluntary nature of the movement and provides for proper training and development of directors and other volunteers, succession planning and for greater clarity as regards the roles and responsibilities of those in key positions within credit unions, voluntary or otherwise.  This will position well-run credit unions to attract talented and qualified volunteers within the community who see the benefit of self-development through the training, skills and experience to be gained at credit unions.  While participation at board level is an important role, it is equally important to give due credit to the valuable contribution that may be made by volunteers in non-board roles, including by former directors in training and nurturing future board members.</p><p>  The Commission report recognises that volunteers are crucial to the continued success of the movement, and that it is important that credit unions consider fully the role of volunteers when planning their business strategy.  The Commission recommends a planned effort by credit unions to seek-out potential candidates with the necessary levels of skill and commitment, and a greater use of succession plans and volunteer development strategies.   The ILCU can play an important part here, as the Commission Report notes that, given that this is likely to be a movement-wide issue, there may also be a role for representative bodies in providing promotion and marketing, as well as advice on how best to identify, engage and train new volunteers. </p><p>  In relation to the size of the tiers, the Commission Report recommends a tiered approach to the regulation of credit unions and sets out, for illustration purposes only, how such a tiering might work.  The Credit Union Bill specifically provides that requirements being applied to credit unions may be calibrated according to the nature, scale and complexity of the credit unions or categories of credit union concerned.  This is in line with the approach recommended by the Commission and appears to address the concern about regulatory requirements being limited to considerations of asset size alone.</p><p>  The Commission recommended that the establishment of shared service arrangements should be facilitated, by legislation where necessary.  There does not appear to be any obstacles in the current legislation or in the Bill to setting up credit union service organisations (CUSOs) to enable the sharing of services between credit unions.  Indeed the Credit Union Bill facilitates such arrangements by allowing flexibility for Central Bank regulations on investments by credit unions and by specifically providing a framework for the outsourcing of credit union operations.  These changes will help to facilitate the development of shared services arrangements by credit unions.</p><p>  In relation to Social Finance, the Commission Report recommends that the role needs to be carefully designed to integrate prudently with the basic credit union business of savings and lending services for individuals. The Commission also recommends that a formal process of engagement be established between the credit union representative bodies and Government to determine safe ways to invest collective credit union funds into community projects, employment initiatives and small co-operatives.   I remain open to proposals from the credit union movement on this front and it does not appear that primary legislation is required in order to facilitate this.</p><p>  In the case of electronically enabled payment accounts, there does not appear to be any obstacles in the current legislation or the Bill to the development of these initiatives, and indeed many credit unions already offer such payment accounts.  </p><p>  The Commission recommended that a consultation protocol should be in place between the Central Bank and credit unions. This protocol is to be developed following consultation between the Central Bank, myself as Minister for Finance, credit union representative bodies and the Credit Union Advisory Committee.  The protocol is to set out how the Central Bank proposes to engage with credit unions in any formal consultation process prior to the introduction of new regulations. The protocol may provide for varying levels of consultation depending on the nature and complexity of the regulation being proposed. This will have the effect of increasing transparency and confidence in the regulation making process. This protocol is to include the specific requirement that consultation does not impact on the statutory independence of the Central Bank in the regulation of credit unions. I understand that a draft of the protocol has already been circulated to stakeholders for comment and that the ILCU has made a submission which is being considered by the Central Bank.</p></reply>

The Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information was established by OECD member countries and certain other jurisdictions in 2000.  The Global Forum was significantly restructured in 2009 and now counts some 110 countries as members.  The list of members is still growing.</p><p>  All members of the Global Forum are committed to meeting the OECD standard in relation to transparency and exchange of information.  The OECD standard covers the availability of certain taxpayer information and the ability to access that information and to supply it to another country when a valid request to do so is received&mdash; for example, under a Double Taxation Agreement (DTA) or a Tax Information Exchange Agreement (TIEA).   </p><p>  The type of taxpayer information that must be available for exchange covers, in the case of companies for example, the owners of the company and the accounting records of the company.  The competent authority for exchange of taxpayer information under a DTA or TIEA (which in the case of Ireland is the Revenue Commissioners or their authorised representatives) must have powers to access information and then must exchange that information when a request is received that meets the conditions for exchange of taxpayer information which are laid down in the relevant DTA or TIEA.</p><p>  In order to ensure that the OECD standard is being met the legal and regulatory framework (Phase 1 review) and practical experience of exchange of taxpayer information (Combined   review) in all members of the Global Forum is currently being reviewed.  Since the first review was launched in 2010 the Global Forum has adopted and published the reports of over 60 Phase 1 reviews and over 20 Combined reviews&mdash; including the report of the Combined review of Ireland, which was published in January 2011.  The reviews published to date contain recommendations as to how the member countries concerned could improve their legal and regulatory framework and practice and there is an effective follow-up programme to ensure recommendations are implemented.   </p><p>  Since 2009 an additional 800 DTAs and TIEAs have been signed and many countries are now signing and ratifying the Joint Council of Europe/OECD Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters which also provides a legal basis for exchange of taxpayer information.  This increase in the number of instruments to exchange taxpayer information is also changing the &ldquo;global tax transparency&rdquo; landscape.  The G20 has strongly endorsed the work of the Global Forum and recommended that countries join it.  As set out above, it is clear that the Global Forum has made significant progress in achieving global tax transparency.</p></reply>

With regard to the VAT issue addressed in the question, I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that it would appear from the information provided that the named individual would have obtained a VAT input credit on the cost of acquiring the golf lodge on the basis that he would make a taxable supply of a long lease.   For illustration purposes, the VAT input credit would have been &euro;71,365 based on a VAT inclusive purchase price of &euro;600,000 at the 13.5% VAT rate.  VAT on the long lease would have been accounted for by the tenant on a reverse charge basis. Based on the limited information provided it would appear that the named individual has a number of options open to him none of which will require him to suffer a clawback on taking a surrender of the lease.  These options include letting the property to an operator as he suggests and opting to tax that letting and independently letting the golf lodge in the holiday market subject to registering for VAT on a timely basis.  The Revenue/Bord F&aacute;ilte rules referred to by the named individual are not mirrored in the VAT legislation.</p><p>  With regard to the Schemes of Registered Holiday Cottages issue addressed in the question, I am further advised by the Revenue Commissioners that capital allowances on the construction of registered holiday cottages were available where capital expenditure was incurred prior to 31 July 2008.  This date was the final termination date for incurring expenditure which could qualify for the allowances which were given at a rate of 10% per annum for ten years.  The holiday cottage must have been part of a scheme of holiday cottages registered with F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  Generally, a minimum of 8 cottages is required for registration purposes and there must also be a reception building.  Registration must be maintained for a period of 10 years from first use in order to avoid a clawback of capital allowances granted.  Where a cottage ceases to be part of a scheme, it can no longer be registered and if this occurs within the 10 years, the clawback of relief takes place.  In these circumstances there is no mechanism whereby the clawback can be avoided.</p></reply>

However, even with the best possible systems in place, securing equilibrium between demand and supply is not an exact science, and is subject to quite a number of variables.  Recent developments, such as the EU rules on mutual recognition of qualifications, have also meant that supply is more difficult to control and predict.</p><p>  As education at post-primary level is on the basis of subjects, the situation is complex and therefore difficult to predict and plan for.  Post-primary teachers are generally qualified to teach more than one subject but may not be deployed to teach these in equal measures at school level.  School management authorities have the flexibility to deploy teachers to meet demands.  Schools are also responsible for deciding what subjects and programmes to offer and this can vary from school to school in accordance with local need.  This in turn, determines the type of teacher competencies-specialisms required at that time.</p><p>  Teacher allocations to all second level schools are approved annually by my Department in accordance with established rules based on recognised pupil enrolment.  Schools are permitted to fill vacancies that arise within their approved staffing schedule.  The redeployment of surplus permanent teachers is the first mechanism to fill teaching posts in schools. This is key to the ability of my Department to manage within its payroll budget and ceiling on teacher numbers.  Thereafter, teaching posts are filled in the normal manner through the recruitment process at individual school level.</p><p>  Circular 31/2011 details a cascade of measures for recruitment of teachers, prioritising unemployed registered teachers over retired registered teachers and registered teachers over unregistered persons.  Also in October last year my Department issued circular 46/2011 which permits schools to participate in JobBridge, the National Internship Scheme.  I intend to explore the matter of teacher supply further with the HEA, the Teaching Council, and the initial teacher education providers, as appropriate.</p></reply>

The migration of the new applications to SUSI has enabled the awarding authorities under the old system to deal with the renewals on a more efficient basis - these are generally more straightforward and require significantly less documentary evidence.</p><p>  As part of the overall improvement in service, all new student grants approved for this academic year will be paid by electronic funds transfer on a monthly basis directly to students' bank accounts, rather than by cheque to the relevant college.  Those awarded a grant must supply bank account details and confirmation of registration must be received from the institution in order for the first instalment to be paid.  Payments to students have commenced and will continue on a weekly rolling basis for the coming period as grants are approved and bank details are supplied online by the student.</p></reply>

My Department has no role in relation to processing applications for enrolment to schools.  The policy of my Department is to secure the maximum possible level of inclusion of students with special educational needs in mainstream primary and post-primary schools, in order to ensure that as many children as possible can be educated with their peers within their own community.  My Department therefore provides for a range of placement options and supports for schools which have enrolled pupils with special educational needs in order to ensure that, wherever a child is enrolled, s/he will have access to an appropriate education.</p><p>  Children with special educational needs may be enrolled in a mainstream school and attend all mainstream classes and receive additional teaching support through the learning support and/or resource teacher. Or they may enrol in a mainstream school and attend a special class, or they may enrol in a special school.  The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child. The NEWB will try to help parents to find a school placement if their child has been unable to secure a school placement to date. The NEWB can be contacted at National Educational Welfare Board, National Headquarters, 16-22 Green Street, Dublin 7 or by telephone at 01-8738700.</p><p>  In addition, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) Special Education Needs Organisers (SENOs) can assist parents to identify appropriate educational placements for children with special educational needs. Parents may contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs and to seek assistance in identifying placement options, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie. Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to the Secretary General of my Department. Only where an appeal under Section 29 is upheld, may the Secretary General of my Department direct a school to enrol a pupil.</p></reply>

Since 2010 substantial resources have been assigned to analysing the data of the November 2009 event and re-calibrating the hydraulic models of the Lower Lee catchment to take account of this significant dataset. This exercise of review, updating and re-calibration will be completed before the end of this year. </p><p>  In parallel with this detailed exercise, the national CFRAM programme has progressed, with all six CFRAM contracts now commissioned to cover the national river catchments. Mott McDonald has been appointed as consultants for the South -West CFRAM Study which includes the area of the Lee catchment and Cork City and environs. The substantial work almost complete on the Lee CFRAM will be reviewed and incorporated into the South-West CFRAM study which is due for completion at end-2015 in accordance with the EU Floods Directive.</p><p>  The Office of Public Works (OPW) is continuing to work with Cork City Council and Cork County Council to advance mitigation measures in Cork City and surrounding areas where significant flood risk has already been identified. OPW has, within the past week, received tenders for consultants to bring forward measures for the Lower Lee and Blackpool areas, and it is expected that a preferred option will be identified for these areas by the second half of 2013. In addition, it has been agreed that Cork County Council will take the lead in undertaking detailed studies to investigate potential mitigation options for a number of locations including Douglas and Togher, with funding from the OPW. These studies will build on and develop the analysis carried out as part of the River Lee CFRAM Study as appropriate. </p><p>  Pending the completion of the detailed studies, it would be open to the Councils to submit applications for funding under the OPW Minor Flood Works scheme for any small-scale interim measures that may be identified, subject to such measures meeting the criteria of that scheme, being compatible with the CFRAM studies and the overall availability of resources for flood risk management.</p></reply>

There are no formal arrangements in place within the civil service to facilitate requests for transfers to other locations/employments, except in the case of grades represented by the Civil &amp; Public Services Union. Transfers for these (mostly Clerical and Staff Officers) are arranged in accordance with formal procedures agreed with the Staff Side at General Council under the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for the Civil Service.  Transfers between grades in the civil service can be arranged on an informal, head-to-head, basis. Such transfers are arranged between the officers seeking to move and the relevant Personnel Units and require the agreement of both Personnel Officers. </p><p>  The arrangements for the other Public Service sectors are a matter for the relevant parent Department in each case.  </p><p>  The Public Service Agreement 2010-14 (Croke Park Agreement) provides for agreed redeployment arrangements to apply in the Civil Service and in other parts of the public service.   Under the Agreement, redeployment generally takes precedence over all other methods of filling a vacancy and supersedes any existing agreements on the deployment of staff.  It sets out the agreed redeployment arrangements within the Health, Education, and Local Authority sectors and within and between the Civil Service and Non-Commercial State Sponsored Bodies (NCSSB).  It also provides that cross sectoral redeployments will follow the arrangements agreed for the NCSSBs. </p><p>  The Public Appointments Service (PAS) has put in place a system of Resource Panels of Civil Service and State Agency staff to support the redeployment processes in those sectors agreed under the Croke Park Agreement.  The redeployment arrangements allow staff to be moved from activities which are of lesser priority, or which have been rationalised, reconfigured, or restructured, to areas of greater need. In general redeployment opportunities are to be sought in the first instance within each sector (e.g. health, education, local authority, etc.). In practical terms the arrangements represent a means of facilitating the targeted reduction in public service numbers in the period 2010 to 2014 while sustaining the ongoing delivery of services.   While staff may be moved between different locations as a consequence of the redeployment arrangements they are not intended to be a staff mobility scheme and were not designed to facilitate requests from individuals for transfers to address personal circumstances. </p></reply>

To reiterate, over the first two years of the Public Service Agreement 2010-2014, &euro;810 million in sustainable savings have been achieved. This comprises &euro;289 million in respect of the first year of the Agreement and &euro;521m in respect of the second year. Full details of these figures, as well as a breakdown by sector, are available in the two Annual Progress Reports published by the Implementation Body to date.  These reports are available on its website at www.implementationbody.gov.ie/publications.</p><p>  The savings in the public service pay bill reported by the Body are based on the reduction in public service staff numbers during the lifetime of the Agreement only.  They are calculated based on average annualised savings per employee arising from the reduction in public service staff numbers during the relevant review period.  The Government have agreed to accelerate the programme of staff reductions in order to maximise paybill savings. Where staff surpluses are identified a targeted voluntary redundancy (VR) scheme would be made available for selected areas throughout the Public Service.</p><p>  Identification of staff surpluses is underway. My Ministerial colleagues are actively examining particular work areas, bodies, locations or grades at which voluntary redundancy can be targeted because of changes to work configuration or service delivery models, for example. Of course there will be full regard for the skills needs and priorities of Departments now and into the future during this process. </p><p>  Final decisions on numbers reductions to be achieved in each sector will take account of the surpluses identified by Ministers in respect of their portfolios and of expected rates of retirements in those sectors over the next few years.  A full cost benefit analysis will of course be required as part of this assessment. When this assessment has been completed further details of this scheme will be made available by my Department.  In relation to increments, I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 32625/12 of 4 July.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-10-24a.221.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012102400080#WRL00300"><p>The Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT) has jurisdiction under 18 separate pieces of legislation, some of which are lodged as direct claims to the Tribunal and others which come to the Tribunal by way of appeal or implementation of a Rights Commissioner&rsquo;s recommendation/decision. Currently, if an employee or employer wishes to appeal a decision from the EAT the relevant court of appeal is dependent upon the type of legislation the original claim was taken under. Some legislation specifies that a decision of the EAT can be appealed to the Circuit Court for a de novo hearing and others specify that it can only be appealed to the High Court on a point of law. The procedure for appealing EAT Determinations is set out in Circuit Court Rules (www.courts.ie  ).  </p><p>  An appropriate example of the procedure to which the Deputy refers would be the potential appeals path of an EAT Determination under the Unfair Dismissals Acts. This could currently involve an appeal with a fresh hearing to the Circuit Court which in turn could result in a further appeal and a fresh hearing by the High Court.  The case may even have started out as a first instance case before a Rights Commissioner and in such circumstances the EAT hearing would indeed also have been an appeal involving a fresh hearing. Clearly this is not the best use of the resources of those making or defending complaints in the system or for the State. </p><p>  As the Deputy may be aware, I am currently undertaking a root and branch reform of the existing Workplace Relations Bodies. The Reform Programme I have commenced will deliver a two tier Workplace Relations structure by merging the activities of the Labour Relations Commission, the National Employment Rights Authority, the Equality Tribunal and the first instance functions of the EAT and the Labour Court into a new Body of First Instance, to be known as the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC). The appellate functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal will be incorporated into an expanded Labour Court. Work has commenced on the drafting of a Workplace Relations Bill to give effect to the new two-tier structure.  </p><p>  The Workplace Relations Bill which I hope to bring before the House in early 2013 will contain provisions in respect of the relevant procedures for appeals along the lines already outlined in the policy document &lsquo;Legislating for a Worldclass Workplace Relations Service&rsquo;   and also in my presentation before the joint Oireachtas Committee on Jobs Enterprise and Innovation last July.  I intend proposing to the Oireachtas that all first instance complaints requiring adjudication will be heard by the Adjudication Officers of the new Workplace Relations Commission and any subsequent appeals will be heard by the Labour Court as a full fresh appeal.  The Labour Court will act as a court of final appeal for all adjudication decisions of the Workplace Relations Commission, subject to the right of either party to bring a further appeal from a determination of the Labour Court to the High Court on a point of law only.  </p><p>  I fully expect the work that I have initiated with regard to the reform of the Workplace Relations Bodies, including the EAT, to significantly improve the quality of service to users. Since I announced my reform proposals we have undertaken two public consultation processes; published two policy documents; published a new website; introduced a single complaint form and single contact portal and commenced delivery of an Early Resolution Service.  In addition we have prepared the Scheme of the Workplace Relations Bill and secured Government Approval for priority drafting of the Bill. </p><p>  The pace and quality of the delivery of this important Reform Programme is proof that the public sector can be reformed in a way that can save money for the tax payer, while at the same time greatly improving services for users. The significant progress to date means we now have:</p><p>-  A new single contact portal called &ldquo;Workplace Relations Customer Services&rdquo; dealing with all Workplace Relations complaints which has replaced the five separate entry points.</p><p>-  Complaints are now acknowledged, on average, within a week of receipt. This was previously taking up to eight months in some cases.</p><p>-  The employer is also notified, on average, within a week of the complaint being lodged thus increasing the possibility of a resolution being reached without the need for a hearing. Again this was taking up to eight months;</p><p>-   There are now no backlogs for Rights Commissioner hearings;</p><p>-  A Single Complaint Form that deals with over 100 first instance complaints has replaced the 30 forms previously in use;</p><p>-  A new workplace relations interim website www.workplacerelations.ie is in place;</p><p>-  A pilot Early Resolution Service is now seeking to resolve disputes at an early stage without the need for adjudication.</p><p>  I am determined to progress the next phase of the reform and the enactment of the legislation with the same determination and priority that has delivered excellent results so far.</p></reply>

The State pension (transition) is paid to people aged 65 who have retired from work and who have the required number and class of social insurance contributions. State pension contributory (SPC) is paid at age 66 to those who meet the qualifying conditions. </p><p>  The Social Welfare and Pensions Act, 2011 provides that State pension age will be increased gradually to 68 years.  This will begin in 2014 with the abolition of the State pension (transition) thereby increasing State pension age for all to 66 years. The State pension age will be further increased to 67 years in 2021 and to 68 years in 2028. The State pension is the bedrock of the Irish pension system and these reforms are essential to address the challenges of increasing life expectancy and to ensure its sustainability.    These changes apply to all fully insured employees, including some public servants.  </p><p>  The standardisation of State pension age at 66 and the abolition of State pension (transition) removes the retirement condition associated with State pension (transition) which acts as an incentive to leave the workforce and has been widely criticised as a barrier to older people remaining in employment.    There is no retirement condition attached to the State pension (contributory) which is currently payable from age 66.  Public servants (including civil servants) who are due to retire aged 65 in January 2014 will be able to draw their occupational public service pension at age 65.  </p><p>  The changes regarding State pension (transition) will have no impact on public servants (including civil servants) who are on modified social insurance.   However, for those public servants (including civil servants) who are fully insured, their public service pensions (and contributions) are, like many occupational pension schemes, integrated (or co-ordinated) with social welfare benefits.  This means the occupational pension paid is based on the assumption that the pensioner also receives the State pension (transition or contributory).  Where this does not happen, a discretionary supplementary pension may be payable under the relevant public service pension scheme to bridge the gap.   In this instance, a supplementary pension is only payable where the individual, through no fault of their own, does not qualify for social welfare benefit or qualifies at less than the maximum personal rate.  It is therefore necessary to claim any available social welfare benefits in order to receive a supplementary pension.</p><p>  Raising State pension age and the abolition of the State pension (transition) is a necessary step in ensuring the sustainability of pensions into the future.  There is an important and significant policy background to these changes which is that with increases in life expectancy, more people are living to pension age and living longer in retirement.  This has obvious and significant implications in relation to the future costs of State pension provision.  The fundamental principle involved here is that people need to participate in the workforce for longer and they need to contribute more towards their pensions if they are to achieve the income they expect or would like to have in retirement.</p></reply>

Where a death is referred to a coroner, the death is registered by a registrar on foot of a coroner&rsquo;s certificate.</p><p>  In general, only deaths which occur within the State can be registered.  However, Section 39 of the Act provides for the following exceptions:</p><p>  The death of an Irish citizen on board a foreign ship or a foreign aircraft travelling to or from a port, or an airport, as the case may be, in the State;</p><p>  The death of a person on board an Irish aircraft or an Irish ship;</p><p>  The death of a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the Permanent Defence Force or of the spouse or specified members of the family of such a member outside the State while the member is serving outside the State as such member.</p><p>  Usually, when an Irish citizen dies abroad, the death is registered by the civil authorities of the place where the death occurred, and a certified copy of the death registration is obtainable. This certificate, translated, if necessary, is normally sufficient for all legal and administrative purposes here and for these reasons alone there is no necessity for the death to be registered in the State. </p><p>  Section 38 of the Act makes provision for the registration of a death of an Irish citizen domiciled in the State in certain specific circumstances.  Where the death of an Irish citizen domiciled in the State occurs abroad, the death may be registered here if there was not at the time of the death a system of registration of deaths in the place where the death occurred, or such a system that applied to such a death, or it is not possible to obtain copies of or extracts from civil records of the death, i.e. a death certificate. In other words, if the death could not be registered or if a death certificate could not be obtained, the death can be registered here.</p><p>  The number of Irish citizens who are domiciled in Ireland and who die abroad is relatively small in the context of total deaths occurring here in any given year.  My understanding is that the vast majority of these people were travelling abroad for leisure or business purposes.  I am aware that the Oireachtas Committee on Social Protection has recommended amending the current legislation in order to enable deaths of Irish citizens who have died abroad to be registered here. </p><p>  Any broadening of the current provisions will require careful consideration. It will be appreciated that the number of people who live and die in other countries and who have or are entitled to have Irish citizenship is very large.  This would have implications both for the registration process itself and for the vital statistics relating to deaths which are derived from registered events.  This issue is currently being considered in my Department along with a number of other proposed amendments to the Civil Registration Act (2004) and in this regard it is hoped that legislation will be introduced in 2013.</p></reply>

The payment continues to be paid in respect of children up to their 18th birthday who are in full-time education, or who have a physical or mental disability.  The estimated expenditure on child benefit for 2012 is around &euro;2 billion and it is paid to around 600,000 families in respect of some 1.15 million children. Parents of multiple birth children receive an additional monthly premia paid at one and a half times the monthly child benefit payment rate for each twin and double the monthly payment rate for each child in other multiple births. While Budget 2012 maintained this additional monthly payment, the multiple births grant of &euro;635 paid at birth, at 4 years of age and at 12 years of age was discontinued.</p><p>  As a universal payment child benefit assists parents with the cost of raising children and it contributes towards alleviating child poverty. The Government is also conscious that child benefit is an important source of income for all families, especially during a time of recession and high unemployment. Bearing this in mind, any plans to change the Child Benefit scheme would be considered in the context of the annual budget.</p><p>  I am conscious that achieving a better design of the overall system of child income supports, including child benefit, raises complex issues about the effectiveness of the full range of income supports currently provided to families and their children. In this context and in line with a commitment in the Programme for Government, I established an Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare last year, which has been tasked with recommending cost-effective solutions as to how employment disincentives can be improved and better poverty outcomes achieved, particularly child poverty outcomes. The Advisory Group prioritised the area of family and child income supports and has completed its work on this area. Their report is currently receiving my consideration and will assist the Government in setting out a pathway towards a more appropriate system of child income supports.</p></reply>

The Report of the Group, which recommends a scheme for the legal recognition of transgender persons, was approved by the Government on 12 July 2011, and was subsequently published on 14 July, 2011.</p><p>  Since the publication of the Report, the Department has been working on developing draft Heads of a Gender Recognition Bill. In this context, it has engaged in discussions with the relevant medical health professionals and with representatives from interested NGOs.  Given the legal complexities involved in relation to some of the GRAG recommendations relating to the marital and civil partnership status of individuals, in March, my Department sought advice from the Office of the Attorney General, which in turn sought the legal opinion of external counsel on these issues.</p><p>  Preliminary discussions have taken place between my Department, the Office of the Attorney General and the Department of Justice and Equality in relation to the legal opinion of external counsel. The Office of the Attorney General is in the process of considering the various approaches suggested by counsel. Once my Department receives the formal legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General, this will inform the drafting of the Heads of Bill. Given the sensitive and complex nature of the issues involved, it is my intention to ask the Oireachtas Committee on Jobs, Social Protection and Education to discuss the provisional draft Heads of Bill once they are completed.</p><p>  It is therefore not possible to be definitive at this stage about when I will be in a position to introduce legislation to give legal recognition to the acquired gender of transgender persons.  When my Department has received the formal opinion of the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office and when the Oireachtas Committee has discussed the provisional draft Heads of Bill I will be in a better position to give a timeframe for the introduction of the legislation.</p></reply>

In 2005 there were 265,000 on the fuel allowance at a cost of &euro;82 million.  The cost of the scheme has risen by over 160% in seven years.

The objective of the jobbridge scheme is to keep unemployed people close to the labour market and to give them the opportunity to gain quality work experience thereby increasing their employability.</p></reply>

The existence of the Funding Standard itself is not the central issue in relation to whether a scheme is properly funded. Rather the responsibility rests with the employer and the trustees for ensuring that the scheme is properly funded and managed. However, the Funding Standard does provide the regulatory mechanism for ensuring that a scheme can live up to the &ldquo;promised&rdquo; level of pension benefits.</p><p>  The Pensions Regulator suspended the Funding Standard four years ago, following the downturn in the financial market, to give trustees/employers an opportunity to assess the impact on pension funds and to enable them time to develop responses to the challenge. The re-introduction of the Funding Standard was delayed on a number of occasions pending changes to legislation which were designed to help trustees respond to the funding challenges facing pension schemes. Among the measures introduced during that time was provision for sovereign annuities and a requirement for schemes to  hold a risk reserve  A sovereign annuity provides an option to trustees to purchase annuities at less cost than traditional annuities. Sovereign annuity products are now available and it is expected that the range of products will grow over the coming months.</p><p>  The requirement for a risk reserve is being introduced from 2016, to provide a level of protection for scheme members against future volatility in financial markets. It is accepted that the requirement for a risk reserve presents an added challenge for schemes. However, guidance issued by the regulator identifies options which the scheme can consider in meeting this requirement by 2023. It is estimated that the requirement for a risk reserve will add 8% to the liabilities of a scheme.</p><p>  The Pensions Board recently announced that the timeframe for pension schemes to submit funding proposals has been extended to 30 June 2013. This extension will give schemes additional time to help them address the issues they are facing.  It should be noted that the changes to the Funding Standard are being implemented over the next 11 years, not immediately. This is the longest recovery period generally allowed in any European country.  The fundamental problem facing pension schemes is that pensions have become significantly more expensive, because of increasing life expectancy and lower than expected investment returns which are reflected in increased annuity rates. The recent facility to purchase sovereign annuities will enable a higher rate of return to apply, but only in the case of those schemes which actually purchase the bonds/annuities.</p><p>  While it is acknowledged that increased annuity rates are causing significant problems for pension schemes, this reflects the real cost of benefits. If the Funding Standard is changed in such a way that understates the cost of the benefits (by using prescribed non-market rates, or by using sovereign bond rates without a corresponding commitment to buying sovereign annuities on wind-up), then the members may be misled about the ability of the scheme to meet its obligations, and the on-going funding of the scheme will not be enough to close the deficit. This would be likely to make things worse, as future benefits would accrue at a faster rate than they were being paid for.  Overall, the changes made to the regulatory structure for defined benefit schemes are intended to bring increased stability to pension promises in the future and lessen schemes&rsquo; exposure to risks.</p></reply>

This department received a claim for invalidity pension for the person concerned on 5 January 2012.  The medical evidence provided by the claimant in support of her claim was examined by a medical assessor who was of the opinion that the person concerned is not eligible for invalidity pension as she does not satisfy the medical criteria.  The application for invalidity pension was disallowed by a deciding officer.  The person in question was notified of this decision and the reason for it on 11 May 2012. </p><p>  Further medical evidence was subsequently submitted by the claimant.  This additional evidence, along with the original information, was evaluated by a different medical assessor who also expressed the opinion that the person concerned does not satisfy the medical criteria.  Accordingly, the deciding officer has confirmed the original decision and the claimant was notified of the outcome on 11 June 2012.</p><p>  The person concerned appealed the decision and submitted further medical evidence which was forwarded to a different medical assessor for evaluation.  Having evaluated this new medical evidence and all the previous medical evidence available, the medical assessor again expressed the opinion that the claimant did not satisfy the medical criteria for invalidity pension.

In this regard, I understand that Waterways Ireland, in conjunction with F&aacute;ilte Ireland, the South Dublin, Kildare, Offaly, Fingal, Meath, Westmeath and Longford County Councils, and the relevant Rural Partnership Companies, have recently begun the process of formulating a study with a view to identifying the recreational and tourism potential within the Grand Canal Rural and Royal Canal Rural.  The study will address the future recreational and tourism needs in these areas and will be managed through the establishment of a steering group, chaired by Waterways Ireland with representatives from F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the relevant local authorities, as well as the Rural Partnership Companies. The study will also be developed with the overall inland waterways in mind and the broader navigable waterway network as a backdrop. This will allow for the formulation of an integrated plan for the entire canal network, while at the same time ensuring the individual needs of the Grand Canal Rural &amp; Royal Canal Rural can be identified and accommodated.</p><p>  The Deputy will, of course, be aware that a key element of the Waterways Ireland corporate strategy is to ensure that the built heritage of the Royal Canal is developed and managed in such a way that its distinctive heritage values are conserved, while its potential for future public use and enjoyment is enhanced. In order to facilitate this, Waterways Ireland commissioned an inventory of heritage structures along the length of the Royal Canal in 2007. This inventory includes architectural, engineering and industrial heritage and was conducted to ensure that heritage requirements are incorporated into the future design, construction and maintenance phases of Waterways Ireland&rsquo;s projects throughout the Royal Canal.</p><p>  During the restoration of the Royal Canal, Waterways Ireland undertook a number of conservation works to protect heritage, including the complete refurbishment of Lock 45 on the Royal Canal by heritage specialists using traditional techniques, the refurbishment of the masonry arch bridge at Lyneen, the complete redevelopment of the canal building at Richmond Harbour and the commencement of conservation works at Camlin Lock House in Clondra.</p><p>  Finally, I can advise the Deputy that Waterways Ireland proactively engages with relevant statutory bodies with regard to the protection of built heritage along the Royal Canal and that body has advised that it will continue to do this.</p></reply>

In total, there were 67 applications from persons living in County Kerry (4 of whom listed their address as Tralee, none listed their address as Camp), who consented to receive offers of service from Internet Service Providers participating in the Scheme.  Offers of service were made to all of these applicants during the period from April to the end of July this year.</p><p>  The response to date by industry suggests that virtually all eligible applicants under the Scheme are capable of obtaining a broadband service from a supplier using one of the available technology platforms i.e. DSL, fixed or mobile wireless, cable or satellite.  Obviously, where a commercial service is shown to be available, the State cannot intervene with a subvention for alternative services as to do so would be a breach of State Aid rules.  The combination of private investment and State interventions means that Ireland will meet the EU Commission&rsquo;s &quot;Digital Agenda for Europe&quot; target of having a basic broadband service available to all areas by 2013.</p><p>  The Government accepts that the widespread availability of high speed broadband is a key requirement in delivering future economic and social development.  With basic broadband services now widely available across Ireland, the challenge is to accelerate the roll out of high speed services.  The Government's National Broadband Plan, which I published recently, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed services of at least 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses, well in advance of the EU&rsquo;s target date of 2020, and that significantly higher speeds are available to as many homes and businesses as possible.  </p></reply>

No. 326 of 2012). Under the new Regulations:</p><p>  -	most existing smoky coal ban area boundaries were revised to take recent urban development into account;</p><p>-	seven new  towns will be added to the ban from May 2013 - Greystones, Letterkenny, Mullingar, Navan, Newbridge, Portlaoise and Wicklow Town; and     </p><p>-	a prohibition on the burning of bituminous or smoky coal   was provided for, to complement the established ban on its marketing, sale and distribution.</p><p>  The Regulations also require that all bituminous coal sold outside smoky coal ban areas for residential use outside those areas must have a sulphur content of no more than 0.7%.  This consolidates the environmental and related human health benefits achieved by an earlier voluntary agreement with the Solid Fuel Trade Group (SFTG), representing the majority of major coal importers.</p><p>  Some submissions received under the public consultation did suggest a nationwide ban on smoky coal. While I can see merit in this suggestion, it would have market implications and as such would require advance consultation with and the consent of the European Commission under the terms of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.</p><p>  A nationwide ban would also be difficult to implement effectively while smoky coal continues to be freely available in Northern Ireland.  However, there is scope for improved co-operation and policy alignment with authorities in Northern Ireland in relation to air quality generally.  This is an issue I have raised with the Northern Ireland Minister for the Environment, Alex Atwood MLA, who has himself in the past  called for people to burn only smokeless coal.  Our two Departments are working together to further explore options for improved co-operation to mutually benefit air quality on an all-island basis.</p></reply>

The policy contains measures to ensure that prevention, reuse, recycling and recovery are favoured to the disposal of waste; the measures already in place to encourage the development of alternatives to landfill include a landfill levy of &euro;65 per tonne and regulations which require the diversion from landfill of food waste arising on specified premises.  </p><p>  It is this policy approach, consistent with the waste hierarchy as set out in the Waste Framework Directive, rather than determination in favour of or against any particular process or technology, that must guide the necessary process of infrastructural diversification, which can be expected to involve the deployment of a variety of technologies and treatment processes across a network of facilities.</p></reply>

The guidelines are also intended to ensure a consistency of approach throughout the country in the identification of suitable locations for wind energy development and the treatment of planning applications for wind energy developments. This mapping of suitable locations is carried out through the development plan process which makes extensive statutory provision for public consultation.</p><p>  Planning legislation provides for extensive public notification of proposed development at the development management stage. For example, article 17 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001 &ndash; 2010 requires an applicant to erect a site notice in order to lodge a valid application for planning permission. Article 19 of the Regulations requires that this notice must be placed in a conspicuous position on or near the main entrance from a public road to the land or structure concerned, so as to be easily visible and legible by persons using the public road. Alternatively, if the land or structure does not adjoin a public road, the site notice should be placed so as to be easily visible and legible by persons outside the land or structure.</p><p>  The site notice must contain the date on which the site notice is erected and state that the planning application may be inspected or purchased at the offices of the planning authority and that a submission or observation in relation to the application may be made to the authority in writing, on payment of the prescribed fee, within the 5 weeks beginning on the date of receipt by the planning authority of the application. The applicant must erect the site notice no sooner than 2 weeks before making the application for permission in order to facilitate third party inspection of the application. Where it appears to a planning authority that any notice does not comply with these requirements, they may require the applicant to give further notice and evidence in relation to compliance with such a requirement.</p><p>  Article 18 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2006 also provides that a notice be published in a newspaper approved for this purpose. Each planning authority must decide which newspapers should be included on their approved list of newspapers in order to ensure that the newspapers used for the purpose of such notices have a sufficiently large circulation in its functional area.  In addition the planning authority must, under section 34(3) of the Planning and Development Act 2000, have regard to any observations or submissions received concerning the proposed development in accordance with the relevant regulations.  Furthermore, any person who makes a submission to the planning authority may appeal the decision of the planning authority to An Bord Plean&aacute;la. The Board in some instances, at its own discretion, holds oral hearings in relation to cases being considered by it, further adding to the opportunities to participate in the decision-making process.</p></reply>

I am also informed by the LGMA that during the week beginning 15 October, Waterford City Council issued 8,500 letters in relation to the Household Charge.   </p><p>  Currently no single database exists in Ireland of registered property owners. The collection of the Household Charge via a self-assessment declaration provides for the collation of such information in relation to residential property, and local authorities are continuing to identify undeclared properties through appropriate data sharing provisions. Significant efforts have been expended in matching self-declared information with other data sets and in refining the resulting data.   </p><p>  I understand that the addresses and names used in the letters which are currently being issued by Local Authorities, including Waterford City, reminding people to pay the Household Charge, have been based on a data matching exercise with the Property Registration Authority. I understand that every effort has been made to try and ensure letters are sent to current property owners. However there are some instances where letters are being sent to previous owners of properties, due to the fact that the more recent property owners may not have registered their property with the Authority or the transfer of the property has not been completed. Thus in some cases the information contained within these data sets might not have been updated with the most recent and relevant details. As a consequence the data matching exercise can give rise to situations in which people may receive a letter where they have already paid the charge.</p><p>  I understand that the letters which issued in recent weeks invite recipients who are not liable, or who have previously paid the Household Charge, or in the event of inaccuracy or error, to contact the Household Charge Bureau to allow the Agency to update their records accordingly.</p></reply>

I also share the widespread outrage at incidents of aggravated burglary in rural areas and am confident that the Garda&iacute; are doing everything in their power to bring the perpetrators of these heinous crimes to justice.</p><p>  The latest official crime statistics from the Central Statistics Office show that most types of crime are in fact falling, and this reflects well on the work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. In particular, crimes against the person are down including murder (down 8%), as well as assault and related offences (down 9.7%). Public order and damage to property offences are also down (by 13.1% and 10.8% respectively). </p><p>  I remain concerned, as does the Garda Commissioner, about the incidence of burglary and therefore welcome the progress being made as part of Operation Fiacla, which is running for 12 months initially, with effect from February 2012. The Operation is the subject of regular monitoring and review by senior Garda management and is focused on identifying and targeting gangs involved in burglaries around the country so as to disrupt their activities and bring them before the Courts.  </p><p>  Operation Fiacla is intelligence driven, and specific burglary initiatives have been implemented in each Garda Region to target suspect offenders. These initiatives optimise the use of existing structures and local Garda management ensure that all personnel are fully briefed on the initiative, with Divisional Crime Management Teams playing a key coordination and implementation role.  I am further informed that, as of 19 October 2012, 2,493 persons have been arrested and 1,404 persons have been charged as part of the Operation, reflecting the very substantial efforts being made to tackle this problem by the Garda&iacute;. These results show that the Garda Commissioner is effectively deploying the substantial resources available to him in a targeted approach to confront those engaged in this form of criminality. I am hopeful that the successes of Operation Fiacla will be reflected in future crime statistics published by the Central Statistics Office in relation to burglaries.   </p><p>  In addition to the concerted law enforcement efforts which are being pursued by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, crime prevention is a key strategy in tackling crime, in rural as in all other areas. The Garda National Crime Prevention Unit and Crime Prevention Officers at Divisional level provide advice, information and support to organisations, businesses and individuals aimed at reducing burglary and property crime. </p><p>  Furthermore, the Garda National Model of Community Policing plays a key part in responding to crime by taking into account and responding to local conditions and needs. Under this model there will be a community policing team in each District, headed up by a Sergeant. Clear objectives will be set, such as high visibility in the community, ease of contact by members of the public, and enhanced support for crime prevention strategies. In this regard the Garda&iacute; continue to work closely with communities to enhance community safety in a wide range of local fora, including through partnership programmes such as Community Alert and Neighbourhood Watch.</p><p>  It is the Government's intention to ensure that front-line services are maintained at the highest level possible through the most efficient use of resources. The Commissioner has my full support in this regard and I have every confidence that he and everyone in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to deliver an effective police service in rural as in all other areas.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-10-24a.434.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012102400088#WRW00300"><p>I appreciate the sentiments behind the Deputy's proposal in seeking to consider the best approach to the duration of the debt resolution arrangements to be provided under the Personal Insolvency Bill 2012.  However, I could not consider at this point, such a radical shortening as the Deputy proposes of the various durations of the debt resolution arrangements as contained in the Bill. I do not believe that it would achieve a broad desirable outcome as he suggests.</p><p>  The Personal Insolvency Bill 2012 provides for three new, essentially non-judicial debt resolution processes.  The Debt Relief Notice provides, where approved, for an immediate write-off of qualifying debt up to &euro;20,000, though the debtor is subject to a supervision period of 3 years.  The Debt Settlement Arrangement provides for the negotiated and agreed resolution of unsecured debt only. There is no limit on such debt and the Arrangement should not normally exceed 5 years in duration.  The Personal Insolvency Arrangement provides for the negotiated and agreed resolution of both secured debt - up to a limit if &euro;3 million - and unsecured debt where there is again no limit. The Personal Insolvency Arrangement which is a significant and unique approach to seeking to deal with indebtedness should not normally exceed 6 years.</p><p>  The significant reform which the Bill provides for in regard to the judicial bankruptcy process is that there shall be automatic discharge from bankruptcy after 3 years, as opposed to the current 12 years. This reduction is I believe a proportionate response in the context of this judicial process and is consistent having regard to international comparisons, though I appreciate not necessarily that of our neighbouring jurisdiction. Again, I would reiterate that bankruptcy is a process not be entered into lightly. </p><p>  The provision in regard to the Debt Settlement Arrangement mirrors similar time frames allowed for the settlement of unsecured credit in other common law jurisdictions. It permits a reasonable time period for the debtor to make payments to creditors and to receive the likely discount on his or her debts. Thus, creditors and debtors enter, following negotiation, into a consensual arrangement to resolve debt issues relating to unsecured debt.  In circumstances where, at the end of the period, a significant amount of the debt will be written-off, there must be some incentive for creditors to enter into such an agreement. The Deputy's proposal to shorten the period to 2 years would make it very difficult to facilitate the conclusion of an arrangement in most cases. It is also counterproductive in that it would present a major disincentive to creditors ever agreeing to a settlement. There must be a facility, within a specified time line, for some payments to be made. </p><p>  Likewise in the Personal Insolvency Arrangement, which covers both secured debt and unsecured debt, and is a quite unique proposal not yet replicated elsewhere. I believe that the normal period of 6 years duration is of reasonable length for the debtor to fulfil the terms of the arrangement. The terms of the arrangement may include significant debt write-offs by creditors, including in regard to the debtor's principal private residence. There must be a reasonable period of time during which the arrangement remains in place so that some portion of the debt is discharged. During this time, the debtor continues to live in their home.  The new debt resolution processes are designed to provide a viable alternative for most debtors and creditors to petitioning for judicial bankruptcy. They are designed to be attractive to all parties concerned and to provide the optimal outcome in regard to the broader economic and social perspectives.     </p></reply>

It is a statutory requirement that, inter alia, applicants for naturalisation be of good character. In some instances that can be established relatively quickly and in other cases completing the necessary checks can take a considerable period of time.

It does not therefore apply to an Irish citizen who remains in Ireland or who has not exercised their EU Treaty Rights previously in another EU Member State.  In such circumstances, a non-EEA national spouse who wishes to reside in the State on the basis of their marriage to an Irish national should make an application for permission to remain in the State in accordance with Irish immigration law as the spouse of an Irish national.

These programmes are available in all prisons and all prisoners are eligible to use the services.</p><p>  The statistics requested are not readily available and would require a disproportionate and inordinate amount of staff time and effort that could not be justified where there are other significant demands on resources. However, I can advise the Deputy that an average of 38% of the prison population attended educational classes in 2011.  The development of vocational training programmes in recent years means that there are now over 100 workshops capable of catering for in excess of 1,000 prisoners each day.  Returns at the end of August 2012 show that approximately 23% of the prison population were engaged in vocational training programmes. There was also a significant increase in the number of prisoners who participated in accredited vocational training course in 2011, when 1219 prisoners attended such courses.</p><p>  On committal, all prisoners are interviewed by the Governor and are informed of the services available in the prison.  At this point prisoners may be referred to services or they can self refer at a later date.  Where Governors consider, on the information available, that a prisoner needs a particular intervention they will initiate a referral.  Programmes are available to all prisoners but some programmes may not be suitable for prisoners on shorter sentences.  The development of prisoner programmes forms a central part of the Irish Prison Service Three Year Strategic Plan 2012 - 2015.  There is a clear commitment in the Strategy to enhance sentence planning including Integrated Sentence Management and the delivery of prison based rehabilitative programmes such as education, work training and resettlement programmes.    </p><p>  There are a range of drug rehabilitation programmes available for prisoners which involve a significant multidimensional input by a diverse range of general and specialist services provided both by the Irish Prison Service and visiting statutory and non-statutory organisations.  The programmes seek to reduce the demand for drugs within the prison system through education, treatment and rehabilitation services for drug-addicted prisoners.  Particular initiatives include, inter alia, the provision of detoxification, methadone maintenance, education programmes, addiction counselling and drug therapy programmes.  The delivery of these services is being achieved in partnership with community based services and has brought a significant improvement in the range, quality and availability of drug treatment services in the prisons.</p><p>  It is the policy of the Irish Prison Service that where a person committed to prison gives a history of opiate use and tests positive for opioids, they are offered a medically assisted symptomatic detoxification, if clinically indicated. There is no waiting list for a detox as there is no dependency on community place availability. </p><p>  There is no waiting period for methadone maintenance. In line with Action 43 of the National Drug Strategy, the Irish Prison Service ensures the seamless transition of prisoners established on drug treatment from our care into community drug treatment settings as agreed in the protocol developed with the HSE.  If the prisoner is on a community programme prior to committal to prison, the maintenance programme is continued during the prison term. Prior to a patient being commenced on methadone maintenance in prison, a drug treatment place in the community must be secured to ensure continuation of treatment upon release.   Methadone substitution treatment is available in 9 of the 14 prisons and places of detention (accommodating over 80% of the prison population). </p></reply>

It requires the various authorities within the youth justice system to apply incrementally a series of measures, ranging from diversion to community sanctions, and with detention as a last resort.</p><p>  The first measure is the Garda Diversion Programme.  The objective of the Programme is, unless the interests of society otherwise require, to divert any child who accepts responsibility for his or her criminal behaviour from committing further offences.  The Programme provides for the informal caution (without supervision) and the formal (supervised) caution by a Garda, including possible involvement with a Garda Youth Diversion Project (GYDP).  There are 100 GYDPs throughout the country and these are designed to engage with young people who have been involved or are identified as being at risk of involvement in criminal or anti-social behaviour.  The GYDPs aim to bring about the conditions whereby the behavioural patterns of young people towards law and order, can develop and mature through positive interventions and interaction with the project.  The GYDPs also provide a range of education and training programmes e.g. academic support, IT, employment preparation and specific job training.  The Garda Programme of Restorative Justice also works within the Diversion Programme and involves a process whereby the victim of the offence is given the opportunity to meet or have views presented to the offender. </p><p>  Where a young offender comes before the Courts a number of supervised community sanctions may be considered.  Theses sanctions are provided by Young Persons Probation (YPP) a specialised Division of the Probation Service via a number of community based organisations with dedicated resources to work with these young people.  YPPs aim to:</p><p>  -  	To help prevent young offenders re-offending.</p><p>  -  	To assist in reintegration into community and to enhance the support network around each young person in their community.</p><p>  -  	To improve education attainment and progression to training or employment.</p><p>  F&Aacute;S and local VECs work in conjunction with some of the community based projects to offer training and education and counselling and other support services are also offered.</p><p>  Finally, as a last resort, detention may be used.  On admission to the Children Detention Schools, children are assessed by residential care staff to determine their particular areas of risk and need (e.g. anti-social attitudes, substance use, negative peers).  Young people also attend offending programmes run by staff which target behaviour.  For example, the Reasoning and Rehabilitation (R&amp;R) Programme teaches cognitive skills to help young people react more appropriately to situations that might trigger anti-social or criminal behaviour. </p><p>  The Children Detention Schools also prioritise education.  Young people are required to attend school on site and all educational services are provided by County Dublin Vocational Education Committee.  Individual Educational Plans are prepared for each child in detention on arrival and many of the children go on to complete State examinations on the Oberstown campus. </p><p>  The Irish Prison Service which currently caters for young offenders aged 17 or over in St Patrick's Institution provides a wide range of rehabilitative programmes that include education, vocational training, healthcare, psychiatric, psychological, counselling, welfare and spiritual services.  These programmes are available in all prisons and all prisoners are eligible to use the services.   On committal, all prisoners are interviewed by the Governor and are informed of the services available in the prison.  At this point prisoners may be referred to services or they can self refer at a later date.  Where Governors consider, on the information available, that a prisoner needs a particular intervention they will initiate a referral. </p><p>  The development of prisoner programmes forms a central part of the new Irish Prison Service Three Year Strategic Plan 2012 - 2015.  There is a clear commitment in the Strategy to enhance sentence planning including Integrated Sentence Management and the delivery of prison based rehabilitative programmes such as education, work training and resettlement programmes.</p></reply>

Specifically, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Policing Plan sets out key actions aimed at tackling organised crime with a continued focus on drug trafficking, identifying and targeting the proceeds of crime, and challenging organised crime gangs through pro-active, intelligence based operations. The plan also contains key actions to support community safety through targeted high visibility patrols and the application of available technology. The determination with which the Garda&iacute; are putting this Plan into effect is clear from the extent of the Garda operations launched against gangs as well as the many drug seizures that have taken place in recent months and weeks.</p><p>  Organised crime needs to be combatted by disrupting and prosecuting those involved in its operations, and especially the drugs trade which is at the heart of much of its profits. Substantial efforts by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Customs are therefore devoted to damaging this business, with drugs seizures estimated at &euro;59.3m for the first six months of the year. I should add that this figure does not include a number of substantial seizures made towards the end of that period which remain under analysis, including the largest ever inland seizure of cocaine made in this jurisdiction. </p><p>  As Minister, I will continue, with the full support of the Government, to do everything in my power to assist the Garda&iacute; in their work. There is already very strong anti-gangland legislation in place and serious penalties for firearms offences. Members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are continuing to utilise all available legislation and I have made it clear to the Garda Commissioner that if he feels there are other measures which might be taken in this area I will look at that very positively. But it is misleading to suggest that there is some simple legislative solution which will prevent dangerous criminals from trying to kill each other. If that were the case it would have been enacted years ago.</p><p>  Despite the difficulties which are encountered in investigating gangland killings, I understand that the Garda&iacute; have been able to bring people before the courts, particularly in relation to a number of high profile killings in the past couple of years, even though it will be some time before those cases are disposed of. Arrests have also been made in relation to a number of the recent shootings and a person charged in connection with one of the killings. The Garda Commissioner has my full support in steps he is taking to tackle this type of criminality and to bring organised criminals to justice.</p></reply>

These actions include reducing public disorder and criminal damage through pro-active responses, including the designation of public order hotspots and deployment of appropriate resources, as well as improving the feeling of safety in the community through targeted high visibility patrols.  I am advised by the Garda authorities that, within the framework provided by the Policing Plan, each Garda District and Divisional Officer configures their policing response to local conditions to ensure an appropriate policing service is delivered to each locality.  I am also informed that current local policing plans are designed to address issues of crime and public order offences.  In this regard, local Garda management closely monitors the allocation of all resources in the context of crime trends, policing needs and other operational strategies in place on a District, Divisional and Regional level, to ensure optimum use is made of Garda resources, and the best possible Garda service is provided to the public.</p><p>  Furthermore, the Garda National Model of Community Policing plays a key part in responding to crime by taking into account and responding to local conditions and needs.  In this regard, the Garda continues to work closely with communities to enhance community safety in a wide range of local fora, including through partnership programmes such as Community Alert and Neighbourhood Watch.  The 2012 Policing Plan also includes a commitment to improved understanding and responsiveness to community needs with particular reference to Garda participation in Joint Policing Committees (JPCs) and working in partnership with community groups.  JPCs provide the framework for a partnership process involving An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the local authority, which are the two organisations which make the most significant contribution to preventing crime in an area.  They operate with the participation of elected members and officials of the local authority, Garda&iacute;, members of the Oireachtas and representatives of the community and voluntary sector.  Last year, I initiated a review of JPCs which is being managed by my Department in conjunction with the Garda authorities and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government. The objective of this review is that we do all we can to ensure these important local structures continue to enhance our response to policing issues for the benefit of local communities.</p></reply>

This allocation of resources is constantly monitored in the context of crime trends, policing needs and other operational strategies in place on a District, Divisional and Regional level to ensure optimum use is made of Garda resources and the best possible Garda service is provided to the public.  The Garda Commissioner each year prepares a policing plan setting out the proposed arrangements for the policing of the State for the following year, including any proposals to open a Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na station in a new location or cease stationing members in an existing station.</p><p>  The Commissioner is preparing his policing plan for 2013 and I expect delivery of it shortly.  While it would be premature to speculate on what it might contain, I expect it will contain measures dealing with the further rationalisation of the Garda station network.  It is important to remember that when preparing the plan, the Commissioner must, under the Act, have regard to a number of matters, including the resources available to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the priorities for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as determined by the Minister, relevant Government policy, and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's own strategy statement.  Furthermore, in making his assessments on these matters, the Garda Commissioner has asked each Divisional Officer to assess the level of activity in each Garda Station in their area.  It must be stressed that the key objective of any station closure is to promote the more efficient and effective deployment of resources rather than secure a specific cash saving.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-10-24a.494.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012102400091#WRZ00500"><p>I am conscious of public concern about the extent to which offences continue to be committed by persons on bail.  I share that concern.  As the Deputy will be aware, the criminal law takes a serious view of offences committed by persons on bail.  Section 11 of the Criminal Justice Act 1984 provides that any sentence of imprisonment passed on a person for an offence committed while on bail must be consecutive on any sentence passed on him or her for a previous offence, or on the sentence last due to expire, if more than one is being served. It also provides that the fact that an offence was committed while on bail must be treated as an aggravating factor at sentencing and that the court shall impose a sentence that is greater than that which would have been imposed otherwise, unless there are exceptional circumstances.</p><p>  A decision to grant bail in a particular case is a matter for the court, which is, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of its judicial functions. There is a constitutional presumption in favour of bail, since, in the eyes of the law, a person is innocent until proven guilty. The provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights also restrict the extent to which the right to bail can be limited.</p><p>  Prior to the Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution, bail could be refused essentially only on the grounds that a person would be likely to abscond or interfere with witnesses. The Bail Act 1997, which gave effect to the terms of the Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution, provides for the refusal of bail to a person charged with a serious offence where it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person.  In addition, section 6 of that Act, as amended by section 9 of the Criminal Justice Act 2007, provides that every bail recognisance is subject to the condition that the accused person shall not commit an offence while on bail.</p><p>  I believe that bail law must be continually reviewed to ensure that all possible avenues are taken to protect the public against the commission of crime, particularly serious crime, by persons on bail. Accordingly, my Department has been engaged in work to consolidate and update bail law with a view to presenting a clear, accessible and modern statement of the law. In the context of that modernisation of the law, I will be seeking to restructure the law so that it has a focus on the protection of the individual and of the public. My intention is that the new proposals will provide better guidance to the courts on how such protection might be provided. I am also taking the opportunity to introduce some general improvements to bail law to improve the overall working of the bail system.  I will bring proposals to Government on the matter in the near future.</p></reply>

The Deputy will appreciate that a degree of flexibility in allocating and re-allocating vehicles among stations, so as to best match the allocation of resources with policing priorities, is crucial  to the efficient management of the Garda fleet.  I am advised by the Garda authorities that 26 Garda vans are operating in the DMR North Division of which two are  currently allocated to the station referred to by the Deputy.

I have pointed out to the FAI in my previous correspondence that the obligation to obtain vetting disclosures for sports coaches or trainers working with children is a requirement of the Children First Guidelines and the Irish Sports Council Code of Ethics. This Code of Ethics has been in place since the year 2000. The National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Bill 2012 simply confirms this vetting requirement in legislation.</p><p>  If FAI clubs are not in compliance with these codes then they need to submit any outstanding vetting applications regarding the relevant coaches and trainers to remedy the situation. Once this is done the FAI will have substantially met its obligations under the forthcoming legislation.  There is no requirement in the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Bill that all volunteers or members in a club needing to be vetted. There is in fact a specific provision in the Bill providing that persons providing assistance with sports or community organisations on an occasional basis do not require vetting. This is to ensure that soccer parents or club members or volunteers who are providing assistance at an occasional club event do not require vetting. </p><p>  There is also no vetting requirement for persons coaching adult teams &ndash; even if some players on an adult team are under 18.   The liability for submitting vetting applications will rest primarily with the clubs&rsquo; Boards of Management. The FAI will, however, have an obligation to submit vetting applications regarding coaches employed directly by the FAI for youth coaching. Currently it takes between 4 to 8 weeks for each vetting application to be processed.  I expect that the Bill will be enacted before the end of 2012 and I intend to commence the main provisions of the Bill in March 2013. </p></reply>

Services are planned and delivered in the context of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and national child care policy which provides, inter alia, that services and staff will be:</p><p>Child Centred: the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration and children&rsquo;s wishes and feelings should be given due regard;</p><p>Family Oriented: the family generally affords the best environment for raising children and external intervention should be to support and empower families within the community;</p><p>Equitable: all children should have equality of opportunity in relation to access, to participation in and derive benefit from the services delivered and have the necessary levels of quality support to achieve this.  A key priority in promoting a more equitable society for children is to target investment at those most at risk;</p><p>Inclusive: the diversity of children's experiences, cultures and lifestyles must be recognised and given expression;</p><p>Action Orientated: service delivery needs to be clearly focused on achieving specified results to agreed standards in a targeted and cost-effective manner;</p><p>Integrated: measures should be taken in partnership, within and between relevant players, be it the State, the voluntary/community sector and families; services for children should be delivered in a co-ordinated, coherent and effective manner through integrated needs analysis, policy planning and service delivery.</p><p>  In the provision of services the HSE always seeks to ensure that there is an appropriate balance struck between the legislative requirement:</p><p>to promote the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care and protection;</p><p>to have regard to the rights and duties of parents; and</p><p>the need to  have regard to the principle that it is generally in the best interests of a child to be brought up in his own family.</p><p>In this regard the HSE Child Protection and Welfare Handbook makes the following two statements:</p><p>A proper balance must be struck between protecting children and respecting the rights and needs of parents/carers and families. Where there is conflict, the child&rsquo;s welfare must come first&rdquo;; and</p><p>Parents/carers have a right to respect and should be consulted and involved in matters that concern their family.</p><p>  HSE Children and Family Services routinely include parents in child care proceedings including child protection conferences and children in care reviews.  In regard to meeting the needs of children who may require special care and protection the HSE is empowered under the Children Act, 2001 to convene a Family Welfare Conference.</p><p>  In effectively safeguarding the welfare of children the HSE seeks to balance decisive action in the interest of the safety of children with respect for parental and family rights and responsibilities.  In this regard the HSE highlights the crucial role of  wider community engagement in safeguarding and emphasizes the need to ensure that safeguarding is on the agenda of community initiatives and that personal responsibility, community contribution and state support are clearly delineated and complementary.</p><p>  The Child Care Act, 1991, is the key piece of legislation governing the role of the State in the area of child protection.  This Act makes explicit reference to the rights of parents under the Constitution. The proposed constitutional amendment does not give the State any additional rights to interfere in families - the only circumstances in which the State can intervene is in exceptional cases where the parents fail in their duty towards their children to such an extent that safety or welfare of any of their children is likely to be prejudicially affected, the State as guardian of the common good shall, by proportionate means as provided by law, endeavour to supply the place of the parents, but always with due regard for the natural and imprescriptible rights of the child. Article 41 - recognising the right of the family and Articles 42.1 - 42.4 recognising the role of the family as the natural educator of the child, remain unchanged.  The rights and duties of parents remain unchanged.  It remains the prerogative of parents to act as protector of the child's interests and indeed the person best situated to promote the rights of their children under the new Article 42A.1 - save in those exceptional circumstances referred to above where the State must  &quot;supply the place&quot; of parents.</p><p>  In relation to the &quot;best interest&quot; principle - this applies in defined proceedings where there has either been (i) parental failure in the context of care proceeding (ii) adoption or (iii) where the parents (or guardians) of a child are themselves in dispute with each other about the custody and care arrangements for their child.  Constitutional recognition of the principle that the best interests of the child should be the paramount consideration in these proceedings means that this principle should now be a determinative factor in the resolution of such proceedings having regard to the constitutional rights of the family, whereas currently the best interests of the child can only be a determinative factor subject to the constitutional rights of the family.</p></reply>

During the 2010-2012 period, there was an interim qualifying period whereby a person who did not hold a recognised qualification at the equivalent of Level 5 on the National Framework of Qualifications of Ireland (NFQ) but could demonstrate that he/she had a certified award in ECCE that included significant content covering the core knowledge areas of child development, early learning, health and welfare, and provided they had at least 2 years experience of working in a position of responsibility, was able to work as a preschool leader.  For the 2012-2014 period, all early years practitioners working as a preschool leader entering into contract for the first time, must hold a major award at a minimum of Level 5 on the NFQ.</p><p>  A higher capitation rate continues to be available to services participating in the ECCE programme in which all childcare workers have qualification levels above the minimum requirements for the programme i.e. where all the Preschool Leaders in the sessional service room hold a Bachelor degree in childhood/early education (minimum of Level 7 on the NFQ or equivalent) and have 3 years experience working in the sector, and where all the Preschool Assistants in the service hold a relevant major award in childcare/early education at level 5 on the NFQ or its equivalent.</p><p>  It is my objective to incrementally develop the ECCE programme over the term of this Government as resources permit.  The early years sector has been given a guarantee that any change to the minimum qualification levels will be announced with two years notice to facilitate early years services to adjust to the new requirements.   This type of notice is also necessary if State funded training providers are to develop programmes of learning in a flexible manner that will facilitate early years practitioners already working in the sector.  Issues relating to increasing quality will be considered as part of the Early Years Strategy which is currently being developed by my Office.</p></reply>

When fully implemented the programme will offer free screening to men and women aged 55-74 every two years.  As 50% of cancers within this age group are found in people aged 60-69 the programme will begin with this latter age cohort (a population of approximately 500,000).  The NCSS issued a set of Guidelines for Quality Assurance in Colorectal Screeningon 19 October to support the programme. </p><p>  This is the first call/recall screening programme in Ireland to be offered to men as well as women.  Organised population-based call/re-call screening for colorectal cancer is complex.  In order to ensure quality and safety it is imperative that it is introduced in a carefully managed and monitored way.  We must also ensure that risks to patients are minimised and best clinical outcomes are maximised.  Over time the phasing of the programme will allow development of colonoscopy capacity to cater for the full 55-74 year old population.</p><p>  The HSE-NCSS and the Special Delivery Unit in my Department have been working together to develop the appropriate capacity in colonoscopy services nationwide to support the introduction, sustainability and growth of the screening programme, while maintaining and enhancing the capability of the symptomatic endoscopy service.  The focus is on improving quality and access at all publicly-funded screening colonoscopy units.  This applies not only for those referred for colonoscopy as part of the screening programme, but for all men and women who require a colonoscopy or any other diagnostic endoscopic procedure.  This will be achieved by building sufficient capacity in endoscopy services nationwide to sustain the implementation of the national screening programme, while maintaining and enhancing the symptomatic service.  </p><p>  Fifteen candidate colonoscopy units have been identified around the country to support the screening programme and these must achieve accreditation in order to provide colonoscopy services on behalf of the programme. The candidate colonoscopy units are: Cavan General Hospital; Connolly Hospital, Dublin; Kerry General Hospital,Tralee; Letterkenny General Hospital; Louth County Hospital, Dundalk; Mayo General Hospital, Castlebar; Mercy University Hospital, Cork; Midland Regional Hospital, Tullamore; Mid-Western Regional Hospital, Ennis; Sligo General Hospital; South Tipperary General Hospital, Clonmel; St James&rsquo;s Hospital, Dublin; St Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital, Dublin; The Adelaide and Meath Hospital Dublin incorporating the National Children&rsquo;s Hospital, Tallaght; Wexford General Hospital.</p><p>  I regard the colorectal screening programme as a national priority. I am pleased that it will shortly commence, and I am committed to supporting it as it develops.</p></reply>

Unfortunately, it has become necessary for the HSE to suspend certain products from its list of reimbursable items.  This includes gluten-free products.  Gluten-free products have become more widely available in supermarkets in recent years and tend to be significantly cheaper than products sold through community pharmacies.  A Supplementary Welfare Allowance Adult Diet Supplement may be awarded by the Department of Social Protection to eligible persons.  Persons wishing to apply for this allowance can do so by completing an application form which can be downloaded at the following link: http://www.welfare.ie/EN/Forms/Documents/swa9.pdf  .  Separate application forms are available for children.  For persons who are not awarded a Diet Supplement, monies spent on gluten-free foods can be taken into account for tax purposes.</p></reply>

This Strategy places carers firmly on the national agenda by setting the strategic direction for future policies, services and supports provided by Departments for Irish carers.  It sets out a Vision to work towards and an ambitious set of National Goals and Objectives to guide policy development and service delivery. It already also contains a Roadmap for Implementation containing an agreed suite of Actions to be achieved in the short to medium term on a cost neutral basis.</p><p>  It is important to note that it is a Cross-Departmental Strategy that addresses a wide number of priority policy areas such as income support, health, information, respite, housing, transport, training and employment. Each Department has  responsibility for the implementation of actions for which they been allocated responsibility. All Departments and agencies that deal with carers in any of their functions must now take their lead from the Strategy and use it to inform their planning and policies in the future. Delivering on Actions already committed to in the Strategy is the priority for the short and medium term. </p><p>  The implementation of the Strategy will be reviewed on a periodic basis to provide scope for Departments to revisit and propose additional actions. It is a matter for individual Departments to consider the proposals for building a brighter future for Ireland&rsquo;s family carers as part of this process.  My Department is responsible for the oversight of its implementation and will produce progress reports on a periodic basis for the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy.</p></reply>

In the interim, it is open to local authorities to continue to operate the scheme or a similar scheme from their own resources and I am sure they will do if they consider it to be a good use of limited resources.</p></reply>
