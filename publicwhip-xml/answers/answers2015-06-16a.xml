    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-06-16a.9.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1024" speakername="Alex White" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015061600061#WRA00700"><p>I am advised that research on salmon in Ireland&rsquo;s coastal areas and marine environment both concentrates on increasing knowledge of juvenile and adult migratory patterns, identifying and partitioning marine based mortality, understanding the impacts from aquaculture on wild salmon and monitoring salmon survival rates. Stock assessments can only be carried out on the individual stock in each river.</p>  <p>  Juvenile salmon migrate from rivers to marine feeding grounds returning to their native rivers as adults. Research has shown that adult salmon from both rivers in Ireland and other counties travel through Ireland&rsquo;s coastal waters. These &ldquo;mixed stocks&rdquo;, either in coastal waters or distant waters, pose particular difficulties for management as they contain individual fish often from a wide range of rivers some of which are below sustainable reproductive capacity. </p>  <p>  In order to align fully with the EU Habitats Directive and the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organisation (NASCO) advice, the Irish Government closed mixed stock fisheries in 2007 including coastal and offshore fishing for salmon. This measure also had regard to the decline of almost 75% in mixed stock catches in the period 1975 to 2000. Since then the independent Standing Scientific Committee on Salmon (SSCS) advise annually on the predicted returning stocks for all of Ireland&rsquo;s 142 salmon rivers; based on this advice harvest fisheries are only allowed on individual river stocks which are shown to have a surplus of fish over the conservation limit. </p>  <p>  A conservation limit is, in its simplest form, the number of adult salmon required on each river to maintain a healthy population. Fisheries in estuaries may also be permitted where the stocks from individual rivers entering the estuaries are each meeting their individual conservation limits. Ireland&rsquo;s current salmon management regime is compliant with the Habitats Directive under which salmon is a protected species.</p>  <p>  The conservation/exploitation balance is best achieved where fisheries target individual river-based stocks that have been shown to be at full reproductive capacity and capable of sustaining the genetically unique population of that individual river. Any deviation from this policy, such as the opening of drift net fisheries for salmon, would be contrary to national and international independent advice and such a move could potentially lead to conflict with EU and international obligations on grounds of not protecting vulnerable Irish and international salmon stocks.</p></reply>

This Act fundamentally updated the media mergers regime, implementing the recommendations of the Advisory Group on Media Mergers. These changes were designed to deal with contemporary issues like an increasingly fragmented media, the rise of online media and an increasingly dynamic media sector. The central element of the new regime is a new public value test, involving a far more exhaustive definition of media concentration than before and which deals explicitly with cross media ownership as well as the relevant criteria by which media mergers will be examined. Guidelines explaining the legislation governing the new media mergers regulation and providing guidance on the process were published on 10 June 2015.  Retrospective actions are not provided for in the relevant legislation; this regime is designed in the 2014 legislation to give the Minister for Communications the responsibility to assess proposed media mergers, and to empower the Minister to block any merger that is deemed likely to be contrary to the public interest. No provision was made in that legislation to allow a Minister open a case against a media business of their own volition. This would be a substantially different matter to dealing with mergers, and would raise a number of difficult questions about preserving the freedom and independence of the press, even before one considers the legal and constitutional complexities associated with retrospective action of this kind.</p></reply>

These objects provide the companies&rsquo; statutory mandates and encapsulate national policy in terms of public service broadcasting. Section 98 provides that RT&Eacute; and TG4 shall be independent in the pursuance of these objects, subject to the requirements of the Act.</p>  <p>  Section 42 of the 2009 Act provides for the preparation and revision of codes governing the standards and practice of broadcasters, encompassing the issues raised by the Deputy concerning editorial independence. In addition, Part 4 of the 2009 Act makes provision for the preparation and implementation of codes of practice in relation to complaints handling and for a complaints process for cases where, for example, a broadcaster is considered to have failed to have complied with a Broadcasting Code.</p>  <p>  The Broadcasting Act 2009 assigns these functions to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, an independent regulatory body, including the role to investigate and adjudicate cases where complaints are made.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the BAI&rsquo;s approach to regulation in this area respects the editorial independence of broadcasters while providing the appropriate level of regulatory oversight to protect the interests of citizens.</p>  <p>  Ireland has a particularly concentrated media market. This is a function of the small size of the market and the relative ease with which actors from other jurisdictions can enter the market, either merely for advertising sales or with Irish specific editorial content. It falls on Government to vigilantly guard the public interest in maintaining the plurality of media. Accordingly the Government introduced the new media merger regulatory regime in the Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014 and I published the associated guidelines on the 10 June 2015 following a public consultation process.</p></reply>

The Government&rsquo;s national strategy on affordable energy makes it clear that addressing energy poverty is a whole of Government responsibility.</p>  <p>  My Department offers energy efficiency upgrades that are free of charge to households that are at risk of energy poverty. I also introduced a new scheme in 2014 that requires the main energy suppliers to deliver annual energy efficiency savings, a certain proportion of which must be in the energy poverty sector. </p>  <p>  Other Departments are also proactive in tackling energy poverty, including the Department of Social Protection through its income supports for those in energy poverty and the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government which offers a range of supports through Local Authorities. </p>  <p>  While energy poverty will, of course, be an important element of the forthcoming White Paper, there will also be a new Government Strategy on Affordable Energy published in the Autumn. This strategy will be informed by the results of the engagement on the Consultation Paper on Affordable Energy published earlier this year. The aim of the strategy will be to focus on a small number of high impact actions. My intention is that those actions would be progressed over the next three years with a view to tackling energy poverty to maximum effect.</p>  <p>  Responsibility for electricity and gas market regulation is a matter for the CER, which is an independent statutory body.</p></reply>

The MANs consist of fibre rings around 88 towns across Ireland. The MANs are now used by over 60 licensed telecoms operators to provide services in those towns. It is estimated that in excess of 600,000 users are benefiting directly from services provided through the MANs. The MANs have also facilitated foreign direct investment in many of the towns concerned.</p>  <p>  In addition to operating as MSE for the MANs, enet also has private, commercial interests outside of its MSE role.  enet&rsquo;s commercial dealings with telecommunications operators outside of its role as the MSE for the MANs are a private matter for the company. </p>  <p>  In its capacity as MSE, enet is responsible for managing, maintaining, marketing and operating the MANs in a commercial manner on behalf of the State. It is required to operate the MANs on a wholesale, open access and carrier neutral basis. It makes services, including access to dark fibre, managed services, duct-only products and colocation facilities, available to licensed telecommunications operators. These services allow third party operators to avail of the MANs fibre to provide high speed telecommunications services to their end customers. </p>  <p>  The maximum price that enet can charge for MANs services is agreed with my Department and this information is publically available on enet&rsquo;s website. enet is required to treat all operators in an equal manner for equivalent services and they must charge customers the same price for similar type services.  enet takes cognisance of market pricing trends in determining charges for MANs services, while respecting the maximum permitted prices for those services and the need to make a commercial return. The determination of prices to be applied to individual telecommunications operators is a day-to-day matter for enet. In turn, the prices charged by telecommunications operators who avail of the MANs is ultimately a matter for those operators.</p></reply>

Ireland aims to meet this target mainly through the use of sustainable biofuels with electric vehicles also making a contribution.  In this regard, biofuels are readily available in Ireland and regulations on fuel standards, introduced by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government in 2011, and which transpose the Fuel Quality Directive, permit the sale of petrol with up to 10% bioethanol, and diesel with up to 7% biodiesel.  </p>  <p>  Currently, when petrol and diesel are purchased at the petrol pumps, they contain a certain amount of biofuel which has been blended into the petrol or diesel.</p>  <p>  The Biofuels Obligation Scheme was introduced in July 2010 as the primary means through which Ireland would meet the transport target and is the principal support for the uptake of biofuels in Ireland. </p>  <p>  The scheme, administered by the National Oil Reserves Agency, is certificate based and, since January 2013, an obligated road transport fuel supplier, at the end of each calendar year, must hold six biofuel obligation certificates for every 94 litres of petroleum based fuel it has placed on the market. Certificates are only issued for biofuels that have been demonstrated to have complied with the sustainability criteria of the 2009 Renewable Energy Directive. In 2014, approximately 167 million litres of biofuels were placed on the Irish transport fuel market blended with petroleum products. Of this, approximately 25 million litres were produced in Ireland, all of which was from waste materials such as used cooking oil and category 1 tallow. Further increases to the obligation rate will be required in the context of achieving our 2020 target and I intend to consult on a proposed increase shortly.</p></reply>

This points to a situation where the recruitment of glass eels and elvers remains perilously low and sustainable availability of juveniles presents a significant challenge. Stocking of elvers is a long term conservation measure with no short or even medium term benefit as regards eel fisheries. In Ireland, on average it takes up to two decades for eels to reach maturity. To stock home rivers with eels would mean obtaining elvers from some other European source and re-introducing these eels to rivers in Ireland. There are very considerable challenges to this:</p>  <p>  -  the potential for the transmission of disease and parasites when introducing eels from other catchments;</p>  <p>  -  the stock decline is a pan-european issue and any estuaries where elvers are in adequate numbers will be targeted in the first instance by the nation in whose waters the elvers are to ensure that their rivers are adequately populated; </p>  <p>  -  elvers are extremely costly and it would be expensive to source these elvers competing with both the host nation and any other countries for the opportunity to obtain wild elvers, with no benefit to the fishery for many years.</p>  <p>  Stocking is not included as a management action in Ireland&rsquo;s Eel Management Plan (EMP) and surplus elver recruits were not identified for the 2012-2015 period to facilitate a stocking programme. Ireland&rsquo;s EMP is currently being reviewed and a public consultation process is underway. All elements, of the EMP are being considered based on an additional three years of scientific and management advice . </p>  <p>  While I recognise fully the difficulty facing eel fishermen, there is no property right attaching to public eel licences and currently there are no plans to introduce a hardship scheme as outlined by the Deputy.</p></reply>

The Programme is managed by the EPA and co-funded by the EPA, my Department and the Northern Ireland Environment Agency, with oversight from a broad based Steering Committee that includes my Department. </p>  <p>  As is usual in major and broad ranging projects such as this, the project team involves a wide range of expert institutions and companies. CDM Smith is the lead consultant in the consortium engaged to carry out the programme of research and that consortium includes the British Geological Survey, University College Dublin, Ulster University, Queens University Belfast, AMEC Foster Wheeler and Philip Lee Solicitors, each offering a particular specialism required by the project scope. </p>  <p>  The contract for this programme of research was awarded following a robust evaluation process in compliance with public procurement guidelines, where the tender submitted by the CDM Smith headed consortium was evaluated as being the strongest bid. </p>  <p>  I am aware that there has been some recent focus on the fact that CDM Smith has provided expert advice to oil companies involved in the development of unconventional gas resources. CDM Smith has also provided advices to State bodies and regulatory agencies across its area of expertise. </p>  <p>  As I am sure the Deputy will appreciate it is common that a broad range of parties will seek to draw on the specialist expertise available from a firm such as CDM Smith. The fact that disparate entities seek to draw on such expertise, is generally seen as an indicator of a company's recognised experience.</p></reply>

Examples of initiatives undertaken include working directly with the Northwest Chartered Skippers Association in the development and promotion of the sea angling resource, and in relation the Irish Federation Sea Anglers, which will host the 2015 FIPS-M World Boat Competition which will be held in Bundoran, Co. Donegal in September. This event will see more than 20 countries participating and experiencing Ireland's excellent sea angling facilities. IFI is confident that this event will contribute significantly to the local economy not only during the event but also in the approach and aftermath of the event. IFI is supporting this event to ensure the economic contribution is maximised as well as ensuring that the Irish angling experience is promoted to anglers internationally. A shore angling event held in Dingle in 2013 with 124 participants is estimated to have contributed up to &euro;335,000. to the local economy over a period of 6 days. </p>  <p>  In planning for the future, IFI is currently preparing a National Angling Development Plan (NADP) and has undertaken an evaluation of the sea angling product throughout the country, including the west coast. Criteria are being developed which will assist individuals, communities and agencies to identify areas and angling products which can be developed to drive sustainable economic development. The NADP is also being developed with the express purpose of developing our recreational angling resource. It is anticipated that this plan will act as a vehicle to secure funding for the promotion and development of all types of angling including sea angling</p>  <p>  I am keenly aware of potential development opportunities in small boat hire business in west coast areas with no existing sea angling offering. There are also opportunities for Sea Angling Guides along the west coast. Charter Boats are in good supply and safety is well managed by the Marine Survey office. Consistent customer service and disabled access areas need also to be addressed. I have asked IFI in the formulation of the National Angling Development Plan to follow up and advise on these issues.</p></reply>

These objects provide the companies&rsquo; statutory mandates, including the specific objective of providing national, free-to-air public service broadcasting services, as well as the provision of a broad range of other additional services that are seen as fundamental to the role of the public service broadcaster. In their pursuit of these objects, the provisions in the Act subject the public service broadcasting corporations to a range of additional requirements.</p>  <p>  These statutory objects and requirements encapsulate national policy in terms of public service broadcasting and I have no plans to amend the current position. </p>  <p>  In relation to the funding of the public service broadcasters RT&Eacute; and TG4, this is met through a mix of licence fee revenues, Exchequer grant-in-aid and commercial revenues obtained largely from advertising.</p>  <p>  The rationale for providing State funding for Public Service Broadcasting is to provide an independent and reliable income flow that allows these corporations to attain their public service objects, while ensuring they can maintain editorial independence, which is especially important in the context of news and current affairs. On the other hand, independent commercial broadcasters, while bringing choice and competition to the market, are privately owned and funded companies that have entered the market on the basis of a commercial proposition.</p>  <p>  A proportion of the television licence fee monies is available to all commercial, community and public broadcasters through the Broadcasting Funding Scheme. The purpose of this Scheme is to encourage the inclusion of additional programming of a particular character in broadcasters programme schedules. The Scheme is open to independent producers and all &lsquo;free to air&rsquo; broadcasters. It is funded by way of a payment of 7% of net licence fee receipts, which is paid to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI) in respect of this Scheme. This amount was increased from 5% to 7% under the Broadcasting Act 2009.</p>  <p>  I remain to be convinced that the distribution of public funds to independent commercial broadcasters, beyond the supports that already exist, would represent good public or broadcasting policy.</p></reply>

In the context of publishing the results of an RT&Eacute; efficiency review, which was conducted by NewERA, and a broadcasting advertising market review, carried out for my department by Indecon,   I recently briefed the Cabinet on the importance of providing adequate funding for public service broadcasting in a time of stretched family budgets and limited exchequer funds. I set out my belief that a public service broadcasting charge could contribute to this, while reflecting the changing ways that viewers now access public service broadcasting. However, I made clear my legislative priorities in light of this analysis and that it would not be possible to replace the TV licence fee with a public service broadcasting charge within the lifetime of this Government. I also pointed to the need to build public understanding and support for the introduction of such a charge.</p></reply>

It is &ldquo;of its time&rdquo; and also itself a consolidation of legislation dating back to the 1800s. While the Government are committed to modernising and updating this code, it must address a range of complex issues including improving access to fisheries, aquatic alien invasive species (plants and animals), overhauling fishery offences and bringing the penalties in line with the Fines Act, 2010, updating and modernising the current water-keeper system and clarification of ownership of fisheries. Considerable effort has been directed to this task, and I particualrly want to recognise the effort and commitment of the various Angling Federations in advancing a unified submission to my Department. An undertaking was given by my predecessor not to advance legislative provisions as regards Inland Fisheries until the angling stakeholders (the various Angling Federations) had an opportunity to meet and consider what cohesive contribution they could make in respect of to the proposed Bill. The Federations have recently finalised their views in the form of a submission and I intend to meet with them very shortly in advance of an extensive public consultation process which will involve all stakeholders.  <b><font color="#1F497D"> </font></b></p><p>As regards the situation with eel fisheries, I am advised that the latest advice from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) in 2014 states that &ldquo;The status of eel remains critical and ICES advises that all anthropogenic mortality (e.g. recreational and commercial fishing, hydropower, pumping stations, and pollution) affecting production and escapement of silver eels should be reduced to &ndash; or kept as close to &ndash; zero as possible. The annual recruitment to Europe has increased over the last 3 years from 5% to 12% of historic levels, however, recruitment is still well below the reference levels of 1960-1979, there is no change in the status of the eel as being &quot;critically endangered&rdquo;, and the overall requirement and objective remains to provide, with high probability, a long-term 40% escapement to the sea of the biomass of silver eel, relative to pristine conditions (i.e. if the stock had been completely free of man-made influences including commercial fishing).</p><p>A public consultation process on Ireland's eel Management Plan is currently underway as part of the 2015 review and stakeholders have the opportunity to make written submissions up to the closing date of 17 June. To assist the consultation process a number of documents have been made publically available: the activity report of the statutorily independent Standing Scientific Committee on Eels; IFI&rsquo;s three year monitoring report 2012 to 2014; and Ireland&rsquo;s Eel Regulation Report to the EU 2015.  The documents are intended to stimulate an exchange of views within the public consultation for the 2015 review during which it is expected that a range of issues will be raised and considered.</p><p>I intend to make the full details of the outputs of the public consultation available when this process concludes. Similar reviews are being carried out across EU Member States as the eel stock has radically declined throughout Europe.</p></reply>

A number of Legal Counsel also work for the Commission on a per diem basis as required.</p><p>As I informed the Dail previously, most recently on 9 June 2015 in response to parliamentary questions, under its terms of reference the Fennelly Commission was due to issue its final report by the end of 2014, subject to section 6 (6) of the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004, which provides for an extension at the Commission's request.  </p><p>In July 2014, Judge Fennelly advised me that it would not be possible to complete the full investigation by the end of last year but that it may be possible for him to submit an earlier interim report on items (n) and (o) of its terms of reference, if so requested by me.</p><p>In response, I formally requested that Judge Fennelly would submit that interim report, if he believed it to be feasible and appropriate, and I informed the D&aacute;il of that request.</p><p>In November 2014, Judge Fennelly submitted a detailed progress report to me and formally requested an extension of the timeframe for his full investigation until the end of 2015.  I agreed to the extension of the overall timeframe. </p><p>It is solely a matter for the Commission to complete its final and interim reports, in accordance with the procedures set down in the Act.Under section 34, the Commission is required to circulate a draft interim or final report &ldquo;to any person who is identified in, or identifiable from, the draft report&rdquo; but under section 37, it is an offence to disclose the contents of a draft report or to divulge that a draft has been sent to a person.  </p><p>When the Commission's interim and final reports are received they will be published in accordance with the law.</p></reply>

It is an approach which also reflects the latest international developments in this policy arena.</p>  <p>  The self-determination approach will have the effect of separating the formal legal recognition of the preferred gender of a transgender person from the care pathway which any such person may follow.  It does not in any way seek to minimise or diminish the importance of those care pathways or to suggest that continued medical supports may not be required by a person who applies for gender recognition.   By the same token, while the overdue introduction of formal legal recognition will undoubtedly be a positive step for the transgender community, it will not, of itself, address all of the issues that this community faces.</p>  <p>  The research cited by the Deputy relates to persons who underwent sex reassignment surgery, as opposed to the objective of the Gender Recognition Bill which is to legally recognise a person&rsquo;s preferred gender. The key conclusion drawn from the research is that consideration be given to enhancing the levels of care provided to transgender people.  That conclusion remains valid regardless of the system of legal recognition in place.  </p></reply>

Access to these services and supports is imperative for lone parents, in order to ensure that their prospects of securing employment and financial independence are improved. </p>  <p>  Family income supplement is financially the best option available to lone parents who may suffer a financial loss as a result of the reforms.  Lone parents who transition to family income supplement will be eligible to qualify for the new back to work family dividend and as such will be able to retain the child proportion of their welfare payment for one year after transitioning from one-parent family payment and half that amount in the second year.  For each child (subject to a maximum of four children) this equates to an additional payment of &euro;1,550 per annum in the first year and &euro;775 in the second year.</p>  <p>  In order to claim family income supplement, a person must be working a minimum of 19 hours a week or 38 hours a fortnight.  In the case you have outlined this customer is working 30 hours per week and may qualify for FIS subject to the normal conditions of the scheme.  She may then also qualify for the back to work family dividend.  I would advise that this customer should contact her local Intreo Centre/Social Welfare Office to discuss her options.  </p></reply>

The post office is seen as a key piece of financial and social infrastructure for both urban and rural areas.  Part of the strength of the post office brand, and one of its chief selling points, is that it reaches all parts of the country and can be assessed by anyone. It is Government policy that An Post remains a strong and viable company in a position to provide a high quality postal service and maintain a nationwide customer focussed network of post offices in the community.</p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s continuing support for An Post is apparent, both in terms of the cost of postage services and the value of the contract for welfare payments.  In this regard, we anticipate this year that we will pay over &euro;50 million to An Post under a contract for cash payment services to welfare customers.  This contract is very substantial in terms of its reach, value and impact.  </p>  <p>  As you are aware my colleague the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Mr Alex White, T.D., formally launched the Post Office Network Business Development Group under the independent Chairmanship of Mr Bobby Kerr in February, 2015 to explore potential commercial opportunities available to the post office network.  I look forward viewing the report from this Group.  </p>  <p>  I understand An Post is anxious to grow its existing levels of services in the light of emerging market pressures which extend beyond the delivery of welfare payments.  In this context I am pleased to note An Post has tendered for the provision of a new payment and transaction account.  I look forward to that becoming available in the not too distant future as it will provide alternative payment opportunities for my Department&rsquo;s customers.  </p>  <p>  In order to recognise the general societal trend to electronic payments the Department has been changing some of its application forms.  The option to be paid at the post office remains on the forms. </p>  <p>  I want to emphasise that the amendments do not remove the option to be paid at the post office. This option still remains on the forms.  Therefore, customers are free to opt to receive their payment at the post office if they wish. </p>  <p>  The Department is conscious of the important role of the post office around the country, not only in respect of social welfare payments but also in offering other financial services such as paying bills and carrying out a range of banking services.  The Government has consistently stated its commitment to maintaining the post office network as set out in the Programme for Government. </p></reply>

In 2012 the average processing time reduced to 33.8 weeks.  Further improvements were achieved in 2013, when the average appeal processing time reduced to 28.5 weeks.  As at the end of May 2015, the average time taken to process a carer&rsquo;s allowance appeal has reduced further to 21.7 weeks, a reduction of 17.1 weeks since 2011. </p>  <p>  The reduction in processing time reflects the significant resources which have been invested in the Social Welfare Appeals Office over the last number of years.</p>  <p>  In addition the Department has undertaken a process of reform in many of its scheme areas aimed at reducing the time taken to respond to requests for submissions in relation to appeals. The response time to requests for submissions to the Department for appeals of carer&rsquo;s allowance has reduced from an average of 17.9 weeks in 2011 to 14 weeks at end May 2015.</p>  <p>  Processing times are calculated from the registration date to the date of finalisation and include time spent awaiting clarification from the appellant and time in the Department for review and preparation of its appeal submission, and any further investigation, examination or assessment by the Department&rsquo;s Inspectors and Medical Assessors that is deemed necessary.  While this process carries an inherent delay in terms of finalising an appeal, it also crystalises the flexibility and accessibility of the appeals system. By its nature and because it is a quasi-judicial function, the processing of appeals takes time and reflects the fact that, by definition, the appeal process cannot be a quick one.</p>  <p>  Appeal processing times are kept under continual review in the Social Welfare Appeals Office and every effort is made to reduce processing times.</p>  <p>  The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions in relation to social welfare entitlements.</p></reply>

For example, since March 2011 to date,, approximately 41,000 PQs have been tabled to DSP. The vast majority, some 70% of those tabled, refer to the status of social welfare claims by individuals in relation to the variety of schemes administered by the Department.</p>  <p>  A practice of withdrawing PQs has been in place for many years and has assisted the Department to cope with the large volume of PQs it receives annually.  Under this process the Department provides the Deputy with the relevant information in relation to the individual query, in writing, and the TD then withdraws the question.  The staff time involved depends on the nature of the query and how quickly contact can be made with the relevant TD's office.</p>  <p>  This practice is in place in relation to PQs on individual social welfare claims and not policy matters.  </p>  <p>  The Department of Social Protection has always been committed to being as transparent and helpful as possible to all members of the Oireachtas.  In this regard the Department has for many years operated dedicated enquiry telephone lines and specific email addresses for each section in the Department specifically for the purpose of dealing with queries from members of the Oireachtas in relation to individual cases/claims.  Briefing sessions are also provided to Oireachtas members and their staff in relation to the schemes and services provided by the Department.</p></reply>

If the person&rsquo;s doctor recommends that the work is of a rehabilitative or therapeutic nature, recipients of DA can work and earn &euro;120 per week without affecting the rate of DA being paid, while if the weekly earnings are between &euro;120 and &euro;350, fifty per cent of the earnings will be disregarded in the DA means test. </p>  <p>  A person in receipt of DA can apply for Family income supplement (FIS). The qualifying conditions for both schemes are significantly different. </p>  <p>  The FIS scheme is designed to provide support for employees on low earnings with families. To qualify for payment of FIS a person must be engaged in full time paid employment as an employee which is expected to last for at least 3 months and be working for a minimum of 19 hours per week or 38 hours per fortnight.  Furthermore, the average family income must be below a specified amount which varies according to the number of qualified children in the family.</p>  <p>  If the person concerned has secured paid employment, at a minimum level of 38 hours per fortnight, for the duration of their internship they should make an application for FIS and their entitlement will be assessed accordingly. </p></reply>

This is equivalent to a poverty reduction effect of 63%. Ireland is the best performing EU member state in reducing poverty through social transfers, higher even than the Scandinavian countries such as Denmark, Finland and Sweden. </p><p>Furthermore, Irish social transfers are almost twice as effective in preventing poverty as the EU average and up to three and a half times more effective than the member states worst affected by the economic crisis, such as Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain.</p><p>With regard to income inequality, in 2013, Irish social transfers reduced the Gini coefficient from 46 to 30, an inequality reduction effect of 35%. Ireland is the best performing EU member state, again ahead of the Scandinavian countries. </p><p>Social transfers in Ireland reduce income inequality by over twice the EU average and up to five times more than in the crisis countries of Italy, Greece and Cyprus.</p><p>Looking at the trends between 2008 and 2013, Ireland has improved the poverty reduction effect of social transfers from 54% to 63%. A similar improvement can be seen in regard to income inequality: 28% to 35%. </p><p>These data highlight the crucial role that Ireland&rsquo;s social protection system has played in cushioning the effect of unemployment on household incomes and acting as an automatic stabiliser during the economic and fiscal crisis. It also belies the assertion that fiscal consolidation has impacted on the most vulnerable in society. Central to this significant social policy outcome is the Government&rsquo;s commitment to maintain the value of the core welfare rates, while at the same time providing additional welfare funding to cater for an increase of 50% in the number of welfare recipients. </p><p><b>Annex</b><table><tr><th>Comparative EU data for 2013</th><th>ARP before STs<br /><br />(ex-pensions)</th><th>ARP after STs</th><th>PREST</th><th>Rank</th></tr><tr><td>EU (28 countries)</td><td>25.9%</td><td>16.6%</td><td>35.9%</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Ireland</td><td>38.5%</td><td>14.1%</td><td>63.4%</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Denmark</td><td>28.1%</td><td>12.3%</td><td>56.2%</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Finland</td><td>26.4%</td><td>11.8%</td><td>55.3%</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Netherlands</td><td>20.8%</td><td>10.4%</td><td>50.0%</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Czech Republic</td><td>16.6%</td><td>8.6%</td><td>48.2%</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>United Kingdom</td><td>30.1%</td><td>15.9%</td><td>47.2%</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Luxembourg</td><td>29.4%</td><td>15.9%</td><td>45.9%</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>Hungary</td><td>26.3%</td><td>14.3%</td><td>45.6%</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Sweden</td><td>27.1%</td><td>14.8%</td><td>45.4%</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>Austria</td><td>25.9%</td><td>14.4%</td><td>44.4%</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>France</td><td>24.2%</td><td>13.7%</td><td>43.4%</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>Slovenia</td><td>25.3%</td><td>14.5%</td><td>42.7%</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>Belgium</td><td>26.3%</td><td>15.1%</td><td>42.6%</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>Cyprus</td><td>24.3%</td><td>15.3%</td><td>37.0%</td><td>14</td></tr><tr><td>Slovakia</td><td>20.1%</td><td>12.8%</td><td>36.3%</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>Croatia</td><td>29.7%</td><td>19.5%</td><td>34.3%</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>Germany</td><td>24.4%</td><td>16.1%</td><td>34.0%</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><td>Malta</td><td>23.3%</td><td>15.7%</td><td>32.6%</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td>Lithuania</td><td>30.3%</td><td>20.6%</td><td>32.0%</td><td>19</td></tr><tr><td>Spain</td><td>30.0%</td><td>20.4%</td><td>32.0%</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>Estonia</td><td>25.4%</td><td>18.6%</td><td>26.8%</td><td>21</td></tr><tr><td>Portugal</td><td>25.5%</td><td>18.7%</td><td>26.7%</td><td>22</td></tr><tr><td>Latvia</td><td>26.0%</td><td>19.4%</td><td>25.4%</td><td>23</td></tr><tr><td>Poland</td><td>23.0%</td><td>17.3%</td><td>24.8%</td><td>24</td></tr><tr><td>Italy</td><td>24.6%</td><td>19.1%</td><td>22.4%</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>Bulgaria</td><td>26.7%</td><td>21.0%</td><td>21.3%</td><td>26</td></tr><tr><td>Romania</td><td>27.8%</td><td>22.4%</td><td>19.4%</td><td>27</td></tr><tr><td>Greece</td><td>28.0%</td><td>23.1%</td><td>17.5%</td><td>28</td></tr></table></p><p>Source: Eurostat, EU-Survey on Income and Living Conditions, 2013.

As Minister for Finance I can only respond in relation to the recommendations made in relation to my own Department.</p><p>The tribunal pointed out problems to be addressed in our system of financial regulation.  Poor supervision, an overly-deferential attitude by regulators, poor assessment of risks and a lack of follow-through on enforcement, all played a part in the financial crisis.  This Government has undertaken a number of significant reforms since the financial crisis towards building a strengthened regulatory framework for the Irish financial services sector and to respond to the shortcomings identified.  In 2011 the new Fitness and Probity regime was rolled out by the Central Bank in accordance with the provisions of the Central Bank Reform Act 2010.  The regime provides for new powers to be exercised by the Central Bank to ensure the fitness and probity of nominees to key positions within financial service providers and of key office-holders within those providers.  Following on from the Central Bank Reform Act, 2010, the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 enhances the Central Bank's regulatory powers, drawing on the lessons of the recent past in Ireland and abroad.  It strengthens the ability of the Central Bank to impose and supervise compliance with regulatory requirements and to undertake timely prudential interventions.  The Act also provides the Central Bank with greater access to information and analysis and underpins the credible enforcement of Irish financial services legislation in line with international best practice.  The reforms introduced under the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 are complemented by a number of strategically important reforms at EU level in financial services.  Under our Presidency, agreement was reached on the single supervisory mechanism, one of the main cornerstones of Banking Union which will provide for the European Central Bank to act as supervisor for systemic important banks throughout the Union.  Agreement was also reached on the Capital Requirements package which will ensure that European banks hold enough good quality capital to withstand future economic and financial shocks.  These legislative reforms have been supplemented by a significant increase in regulatory activity by the Central Bank with a corresponding increase in staff numbers and skill levels.  The Central Bank of Ireland's Enforcement Priorities for 2015 highlight the importance of enforcement within its risk-based regulatory framework (PRISM).  PRISM represents a challenging and proportionate risk-based system of supervision for all financial institutions operating in Ireland.  The Central Bank's Strategic Plan 2013 2015 also sets out a strategy of assertive risk-based supervision underpinned by a credible threat of enforcement.</p><p>In response to the Tribunal recommendations I considered the provision of tax relief for donations to political parties and decided against introducing such relief.  The Electoral (Amendment) (Political Funding) Act 2012 provided for changes to the Electoral Act 1997 and imposed new limits for donations.  Donations to individuals exceeding &euro;600 must be declared and donations exceeding &euro;1,000 in any one year may not be accepted.  Political party donations greater than &euro;1,500 must be declared and donations greater than &euro;2,500 in any one year may not be accepted.  These limits, in themselves, should act to deter any attempts by wealthy individuals to influence political activity.</p><p>The Office of the Revenue Commissioners have provided me with the following information in relation to Revenue issues raised in the recommendations of the Moriarty Tribunal.</p><p><b>Recommendation: Independence of the Revenue Commissioners</b></p><p>Section 101 of the Minister and Secretaries (Amendment) Act 2011 placed on a statutory basis the independence of the Revenue Commissioners in the exercise by the Commissioners of their statutory functions under the various taxation and customs enactments.  This has given effect to the recommendation of the Report of the Tribunal into Payments to Politicians and Related Matters (that is, the report of Mr. Justice Moriarty), that the principle or convention of the independence of the Revenue Commissioners be placed on the more robust status of a legislative provision.</p><p><b>Recommendation: Representations to Revenue by Office holders</b></p><p>In relation to this proposal, I remain of the view that this recommendation could best be considered in the context of the Government's overall approach to political and parliamentary reform.  Representations are a valid part of the political process.  The Government may wish to consider whether this recommendation should be confined to Revenue, or to Officeholders, or whether the Commissioners decision to publish data on the volume of representations made by each Deputy is an adequate response.</p><p><b>Recommendation: Transmission to other agencies of information obtained by Revenue under bilateral agreements </b></p><p>This recommendation has been considered.  These agreements are international treaties which are very precisely drawn as to the purpose for which information may be used and would not permit such transmission.  However if opportunities arise in the future, the Commissioners will consider the matter further.  The Deputy will appreciate that Revenue is not in a position to comment on matters relating to individuals for reasons of taxpayer confidentiality.</p></reply>

This regulatory regime establishes higher environmental standards for coal supplied in the State compared with Northern Ireland, and provides for enforcement of those standards by the local authorities.  Suppliers who produce or supply solid fuels in contravention of the coal regulations are subject to investigation and prosecution by local authorities and other State agencies charged with preventing such supply. </p></reply>

This report dealt with the lending practices of UK banks to Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs). This report alleged that a division of Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), the Global Restructuring Group (GRG), was guilty of "systematic and institutional behaviour" in artificially distressing otherwise viable businesses and thereby putting such businesses "on a journey towards administration, receivership, and liquidation." (the Principal Allegation)</p>  <p>  I have been informed that in early 2014, a decision was taken by Ulster Bank Ireland Limited that an independent review should be undertaken in the Republic of Ireland into the relevance of the Principal Allegation to the corresponding division, namely the Global Restructuring Group Ireland. </p>  <p>  On the 19th December 2014 Ulster Bank published the findings of the independent review by Mahon Hayes Curran into practices at Ulster Bank's Global Restructuring Group in the Republic of Ireland (GRGI).  The investigation found no evidence to support the allegation and suggested that GRGI's driving policy was to manage its customers through the cycle, supporting them where possible to return them to viability.</p>  <p>  I have been informed that in compiling the report, Mason Hayes &amp;amp; Curran reviewed 32 customer case studies, interviewed 39 staff members and reviewed 140,000 pages of customer files and 24 policy and procedures documents.</p>  <p>  The basis for the sample selected is set out in section 3.2 of the report.  This states that in seeking to determine the number of files to be reviewed, they used internationally accepted statistical sampling methods, as well as specifically looking at cases for customers who had contacted them directly or made a complaint to Ulster Bank Ireland Limited on a Tomlinson related issue and who wished to have such complaint reviewed.  They also thought it would be helpful to concentrate specifically on those trading companies which had been dealt with in Recoveries and placed into receivership, and those customers who had transactions involving WRI (West Register Ireland).</p></reply>

The European Commission assesses compliance with the preventive arm on the basis of two complimentary pillars.  First is the minimum annual improvement in the structural balance and the second is compliance with the expenditure benchmark.  The minimum improvement in the structural balance and the expenditure benchmark are in theory designed to be complementary, although differences between the two metrics can emerge from time to time.</p>  <p>  IFAC noted that the fiscal projections contained in the Stability Programme Update (SPU) did not show Ireland complying with our requirements under the SGP; in other words, that the improvement in our structural balance is below the required 0.6 percentage points in 2016.</p>  <p>  However, SPU estimates show that for Ireland compliance with the expenditure benchmark pillar is consistent with delivering a lower suggested quantum of structural adjustment in 2016.  This somewhat counterintuitive outcome was explicitly addressed in the SPU, and emphasises the material problems posed by some of the technical aspects of the rules.</p>  <p>  Finally, it should be noted that compliance with the requirements of the SGP is ultimately assessed on the basis of analysis undertaken by the European Commission.  In this context, the recent assessment of the SPU published by the European Commission as part of the European Semester process finds that 'on the basis of information in the 2015 Stability Programme Update re-calculated according to the common methodology, progress towards the MTO is in line with the requirements of the preventive arm of the [Stability and Growth] Pact'.  The assessment by the Commission also finds that 'the rate of expenditure growth net of discretionary revenue measures, as planned in the SPU, is expected to be in line with the requirements of the expenditure benchmark pillar'.</p>  <p>  In summary, therefore, the projections in the SPU are consistent with the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact.</p></reply>

Action against it is, therefore, a priority for them, and they undertake, on an ongoing basis, an extensive programme of compliance and enforcement activities that are designed to ensure adherence to the legal requirements governing the supply and sale of fuels and to allow action to be taken against fraud.  Among the key elements of programme are the carrying out of control and compliance inspections at critical points of the fuel supply chain, and the targeting, in co-operation with other enforcement authorities, of the organised crime groups that are responsible for a large proportion of fraudulent activity.</p>  <p>  The Revenue Commissioners have also, since 2011, introduced a range of measures that have enhanced progressively the controls on the fuel supply chain, with the objective of reducing the scope for criminals to source fuels for laundering or to get laundered fuel on to the market.  Key initiatives include the following.</p>  <p>  -	The introduction in September 2011 of a strengthened licensing regime for auto fuel traders. </p>  <p>  -	The putting in place in October 2012 of a new licensing regime for marked fuel traders.</p>  <p>  -	New requirements for the keeping by fuel traders of records of stock movements and fuel deliveries, to ensure that data are available to support supply chain analysis.</p>  <p>  -	The inception, from January 2013, of a requirement that all licensed fuel traders, make monthly electronic returns of their fuel transactions to Revenue, providing data that can be used to identify suspicious or anomalous transactions or patterns of fuel distribution and support follow-up enforcement action, where necessary.</p>  <p>  -	The introduction from the start of April 2015 of a new and more effective product for marking rebated fuels that was identified as a result of a joint process conducted with HM Revenue and Customs in the UK. The work of Revenue officers in testing fuel for the presence of the new marker will be supported by mobile equipment that will allow on the spot analysis of samples.</p>  <p>  I introduced the necessary legislative provisions to underpin these important initiatives, and have also put in place other measures designed to strengthen Revenue's hand in combatting fuel criminality.  The Finance (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that a supplier who is reckless in supplying fuel for a use connected with excise fraud will be liable for duty at the standard rate of tax, and represents a significant disincentive to such activity.  In the Finance Act 2014, I introduced measures to further strengthen Revenue's ability to refuse or revoke a mineral oil trader's licence where the trader does nor comply with excise law, does not maintain adequate stock management systems and records, or provides false or misleading information.  Revenue's action against fuel fraud has already yielded significant results.  In the period since 2011, 31 oil laundries have been detected and closed down, more than 3 million litres of fuel have been seized and 139 filling were closed for trading without a licence or breach of licence conditions.  In addition, industry sources report a much-reduced incidence of laundered fuel on the market and increased road diesel consumption.  While other economic factors have contributed to this growth, reduced fraud is also an important contributory element.  In relation to petrol stretching, I am advised that the Revenue Commissioners have, since last summer, received reports from around the country of problems relating to petrol quality, and suggestions that these problems are attributable to petrol stretching.  Petrol stretching involves the illegal addition of a low-tax commodity to petrol, defrauding motorists and the State.  Every filling station about which a complaint was made has been visited by Revenue officers and petrol samples taken have been sent to the State Laboratory for scientific analysis.  360 samples were submitted but, despite this extensive programme, evidence of the presence of prohibited stretching agents has been found in only two samples, both from one location.  The conclusive results received from those tests led to the seizure of the product.  A case is currently before the Courts in one case, and a file is being prepared with a view to prosecution in the other.  Following a series of further tests conducted by the State Laboratory, results indicated the presence of road diesel in samples from a variety of locations.  This could indicate that petrol was contaminated with road diesel at some point in time.  If the problems that have come to light were caused by unintended contamination as a result of diesel being inadvertently mixed with petrol at some point along the supply chain, there would be no Revenue offence involved.  However, the Revenue Commissioners are investigating the possibility of tax fraud being associated with the identified problems.  In any instance where the analysis of samples by the State Laboratory indicates the presence of illegal stretching agents in petrol, Revenue will take swift and robust action and pursue prosecutions against alleged offenders where possible.  I am satisfied that the Revenue Commissioners are undertaking a wide-ranging and effective programme of action against all forms of fuel fraud and am assured that combatting such illegal activity will continue to be a key priority for them.</p></reply>

The criteria included the desire of having a mix of appropriate backgrounds, namely academia, the financial sector/financial markets and public finance; expertise in macroeconomic/microeconomic and a strong international dimension, in addition to the need to take gender considerations into account. As would be normal practice, the process by which potential nominees were identified, considered and selected involved officials from my Department. The final decisions regarding the appointments were made by me following consultations with Cabinet colleagues and others.<br /><br />Following the term ending of one of the initial Council Members in December 2014, the vacancy was filled through the State Boards appointments process.

The tax is charged on the amount gifted to, or inherited by, the beneficiary of the gift or inheritance. </p><p>For the purposes of CAT, the relationship between the person who provides the gift or inheritance (i.e. the disponer) and the person who receives the gift or inheritance (i.e. the beneficiary), determines the maximum life-time tax-free thresholdknown as the &quot;Group threshold&quot; below which gift or inheritance tax does not arise.</p><p>There are, in all, three separate Group thresholds based on the relationship of the beneficiary to the disponer.</p><p><b>The Group A tax free threshold of &euro;225,000,</b>applies where the beneficiary is a child (including adopted child, stepchild and certain foster children) or minor child of a deceased child of the disponer. Parents also fall within this threshold where they take an inheritance of an absolute interest from a child.</p><p><b>The Group B tax free threshold of &euro;30,150, </b>applies where the beneficiary is a brother, sister, a nephew, a niece or lineal ancestor or lineal descendant of the disponer.</p><p><b>The Group C tax free threshold &euro;15,075, </b>applies in all other cases.</p><p>Where a person receives gifts or inheritances in excess of their relevant tax free threshold, CAT at a rate of 33% applies on the excess over the tax free threshold. In recent years these thresholds were reduced and the rate has been increased in order to maintain the yield from capital taxes in the face of falling asset prices and as part of our fiscal consolidation efforts. In addition, taxes on certain capital are less harmful from an economic perspective than taxes on employment.</p><p>I am aware that property values have increased, with developments that had been restricted to the Dublin area now manifesting in other areas of the country, though not to the same extent in terms of price rises. I recognise that this has a bearing on taxation of the inheritance and gifting of property with respect to CAT thresholds. In this light, I will be keeping Capital Acquisitions Tax thresholds, rates and other aspects of the tax under review, particularly in the context of preparations for Budget 2016 and the consequent Finance Bill.</p><p>In regard to Deputy O'Dea's question about people with disabilities who receive properties through gift or inheritance, the position is that if such an individual is living in the property they receive then they may be able to qualify for an exemption from CAT, provided certain conditions are met. I do not currently have further plans in this area, but I would be glad to examine without prejudice any specific proposals for change that the Deputy may wish to make.</p></reply>

It is also a longstanding practice of the Minister for Finance not to comment on any tax matters that could be the subject of Budget decisions.</p><p>In recent years the DIRT rate has been increased to raise additional revenue.  The Government decided to increase the rate of Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) (previously 33%) to 41% in Budget 2014.  The higher rate of DIRT (previously 36%) for interest paid less frequently than annually was abolished, and all deposit interest is now liable to DIRT at the same rate (41%). </p><p>Up to 2009, individuals may have been taxable on other income at the higher rate of income tax but were only liable to pay tax on interest income at 20%.  Previous DIRT rates were below the higher rate of income tax, and this, in effect, incentivised saving. The decision to raise the rate of DIRT was taken to encourage spending in the economy with a view to stimulating growth and employment.</p><p>Certain exemptions apply from DIRT, the main ones include - </p><p>- Individuals aged over 65 (subject to income limits) </p><p>- Permanently Incapacitated Individuals</p><p>- Companies, Pension Funds and Charities (Irish resident companies pay tax on investment income at 25%)</p><p>- Non-Resident Account Holders</p></reply>

It also seeks to better regulate the insurance industry throughout the EU.  These objectives will be achieved by the correction of weaknesses identified in the current Solvency I regime. To further achieve its objectives the framework Directive has changed the emphasis of the regulatory regime to a system which focuses on risk management. </p>  <p>   In my role as the Minister for Finance I have responsibility for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation. The day to day responsibility for the supervision of financial institutions is a matter for the Central Bank, which is statutorily independent in the exercise of its regulatory functions. The Central Bank of Ireland has informed me that it has a comprehensive and detailed plan for the implementation of the Solvency II Directive in Ireland. The structure of the Solvency II project in the Central Bank includes a Steering Committee to provide strategic oversight, a Programme Board which directs and guides the project and an Implementation team. The Steering Committee is chaired by the Deputy Governor (Financial Regulation), Cyril Roux. The Programme Board is chaired by the Director of Insurance, Sylvia Cronin. A full analysis of the requirements of Solvency II has been undertaken and a number of workstreams were established in the Central Bank to cover each area. Each workstream has a detailed plan and milestones to complete. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Consumer Protection Code, which was revised in 2012, contains a wide range of provisions that protect all consumers in the State, including those of insurance firms whether, or not, they are prudentially regulated here. The Code expects that a regulated entity acts honestly, fairly and professionally in the best interests of its customers. The Code contains specific requirements around Provision of Information, Knowing the Customer and Suitability, Claims and Complaints Handling. The Central Bank can bring enforcement action against regulated firms for breaches of this Code.  </p>  <p>  The Minimum Competency Code, introduced in 2011, ensures that consumers obtain a minimum acceptable level of competence from individuals acting for or on behalf of regulated entities in the provision of advice and associated activities in connection with retail financial products.</p>  <p>  Should Solvency II lead to consolidation in the insurance sector and resulting competition issues, these would be a matter for The Competition Authority which  is under the aegis of the Department of Job, Enterprise and Innovation.</p></reply>

My function is to put in place an appropriate legislative framework for the regulation of the financial services sector. </p><p>The Government undoubtedly recognises that small businesses play a central role in a sustainable recovery of the Irish economy. To facilitate this, Government policy is focused on ensuring that all viable SMEs have access to an appropriate supply of credit from a diverse range of bank and non-bank sources and Financing Growth for SMEs is a key aspect of the Action Plan for Jobs 2015. </p><p>My Department has been involved in a range of initiatives to encourage access to credit for small business, and the establishment of the State Bodies Group has also provided a forum where this issue is discussed and policy options explored.</p><p>The Credit Review Office (CRO) was established to assist an SME or Farm borrowers who have had an application for credit of up to &euro;3 million declined or reduced and who feel that they have a viable business proposition, or who feel that the terms and conditions of their existing loan, or a new loan offer, are unfairly onerous or have been unreasonably changed to their detriment. The Credit Review Office initially dealt with cases from Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks customers and Ulster Bank have recently announced voluntarily joined the Credit Review Office process. This is a strictly confidential process between the business, the Credit Review Office and the bank. Further details are available at .</p><p>The following provides an overview of some other incentives introduced by Government to encourage access to credit for small business:</p><p>- The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland has been established to encourage small business, as an additional means of ensuring that SMEs are provided with sufficient access to credit, with increased flexibility such as loans of longer duration and loans with built-in payment holidays. SBCI loans are currently available through AIB and BOI and subsequent phases will see the SBCI supporting smaller, existing bank and non-bank funding providers and bringing in new participants to the Irish market.</p><p>- The Credit Guarantee Scheme encourages additional lending to small businesses by offering a partial Government guarantee to banks against losses on qualifying loans to eligible SMEs.  </p><p>- The Microenterprise Loan Fund, administered by Microfinance Ireland, was established under the Action Plan for Jobs and can provide loans of up to &euro;25,000 to small businesses who have been refused credit by commercial banks. Microfinance Ireland works in partnership with the Local Enterprise Offices LEOs nationally to administer this fund.</p><p>- With over &euro;2bn of Government supports available to small business in Ireland from over 20 Departments and Agencies, it is vital that SMEs can quickly access information on this range of supports available to them. With this in mind, the Supporting SMEs Online Tool, a cross-government initiative, was launched in May 2014. On answering 8 simple questions, the small business will receive a list of available Government supports. In the first four months after its launch, this website had over 17,000 unique visits. This Supporting SMEs Online Tool is available on the localenterprise.ie website.</p><p>- Another important initiative stemming from the work of the SME State Bodies Group is the range of Skillnets training programmes offered to SMEs. Included in these programmes is a ManagementWorks Programme, a subsidised management development training and mentoring programme available to businesses in all sectors to assist them to grow in terms of their sales, output and employment. Further information is available at </p><p>The Government remains committed to the SME sector and sees it as the key engine of ongoing economic growth.  Consequently the Department of Finance, working with the other relevant Departments and Agencies, will continue to monitor the availability of both bank and non-bank credit with a view to taking appropriate actions as warranted to encourage small business and to ensure that viable SMEs in Ireland have the opportunity to reach their full potential in terms of growth and employment generation.</p></reply>

The second stage of the Bill was taken in the D&aacute;il on 4th February 2015 and the Committee stage of the Bill was taken on 27th May 2015. </p>  <p>  While the legislation is not retrospective, it will apply to all loans as defined, regardless of when they were acquired, thus capturing loans that have already been sold. A similar approach was used in 2013 in relation to debt management firms.</p>  <p>  In relation to the perceived conflict of interest highlighted in the correspondence which is attached, I am unable to comment on the directorships of third party purchasers of loan assets. However, I can confirm that the Special Liquidators devised and ran a competitive sales process, following the receipt of independent advice, for all loan assets of IBRC which they have sold.</p>  <p>  The SLs appointed PwC as independent advisors to value the residential mortgage portfolio and to provide advice in developing a strategy for the sale of the residential mortgage portfolio which would ensure that maximum value was obtained for all creditors of IBRC. Per my instruction, the assets of IBRC could only be sold at a price equal to or in excess of the independent valuations obtained.</p></reply>

Any portion of premium paid in excess of these ceilings no longer qualifies for tax relief.  Prior to this, income tax relief for medical insurance premiums was provided at source, at the standard rate of income tax, on the entire premium amount regardless of cost. Therefore, the State was paying 20% of the cost of all private medical insurance premiums. </p>  <p>  The cost of Income Tax relief in respect of medical insurance increased significantly in the years leading up to Budget 2014, estimated at &euro;404 million in 2011, &euro;448 million in 2012 and &euro;463 million in 2013. Despite the increasing cost of the relief, the numbers insured were estimated to have reduced by approximately 150,000 over the same period, while at the same time the level of medical cover decreased on some policies. Against this background the increase in costs was unsustainable. If the relief had remained unchanged and the trend was to continue, it was estimated that the cost would have increased to approximately &euro;1 billion per annum by 2020.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the recent reform, the tax system is still supporting those who can afford private medical insurance with the cost of the relief estimated at &euro;354 million in 2014. Effectively that means that some taxpayers who could never afford private health insurance, or who have had to give up their policies due to personal circumstances, are continuing to provide financial support via the tax system to those individuals who can afford such insurance. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that the Commission on Taxation in its 2009 report recommended the retention of medical insurance relief but that it should be limited. The introduction in Budget 2014 of an upper ceiling on the amount of medical insurance premiums that qualify for tax relief achieved this recommendation.  </p>  <p>  It is unfair and unsustainable to allow unrestricted tax relief on private medical insurance premiums, particularly at a time when the general population has contributed so much to repairing the public finances. However, the new ceilings ensure a level of continuing support via the tax system for those who purchase medical insurance policies, while reducing Exchequer exposure to more expensive policies.</p></reply>

Returning Officers are required to submit their accounts  for these election events to the Minister for Finance not later than six months after the date on which the poll was taken and so the final cost of the Referendums and Bye-election is not available at this time. </p>  <p>  The estimated cost of the two recent Referendums is &euro;15m. When two or more election events are held on the same day there are significant savings from the sharing of people and facilities. If a simple view is taken it can be said that the cost of each Referendum in this case is an estimated &euro;7.5m. This portrayal of the estimated cost would attribute the significant savings, from having both polls on the same day, to each poll equally.  However it would not be possible to run one Referendum on its own for &euro;7.5m.  </p>  <p>  The Children Referendum, taken as a single poll, in November 2012  at a cost of &euro;12.8m would be more indicative of the cost of a stand-alone referendum when compared with  the cost of &euro;14.4m for the Abolition of the Seanad and Court of Appeal Referendums which were held on the same day in October 2013. The difference between the costs at &euro;1.6m is an approximation of the additional cost of the second Referendum.  </p></reply>

In order to resolve the problem in the short term, the OPW installed a quality wooden handrail and baluster as an alternative so that the viewing platform could be opened to the public and sought to resolve the manufacturing difficulty separately.  Currently, the OPW is actively trying to source an alternative procurement route for the steelwork, which is a specialist item.   It is not possible to say definitively at this stage when the work will be fully completed.</p>  <p>  Enhancing the panoramic views will be addressed separately after the additional forest clearance work to open up the desired vistas has been done; at this stage, this is provisionally scheduled for late 2015 and is dependent on appropriate consent from the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht under the National Monuments Acts being secured.</p></reply>

Since conferring with the Deputy a number of weeks ago, the following has been established:</p>  <p>  Clare Abbey is in State ownership only as far as its outer wall, and not beyond.  The property is therefore effectively landlocked by privately owned land.  A new laneway leading to the site was developed as part of the new motorway link road and this is the sole means of public access.  This lane leads to a turning /parking area which is part of the private land holding and which is used as a farm access to the land beyond.  Any signage in this location will require the owner's agreement; additionally, as the site for the signage lies outside the National Monument boundary, it is likely that planning permission will be required.   </p>  <p>  Killone Abbey is not in State ownership but is in the Guardianship of the Commissioners of Public Works.  Public access to this site is therefore currently at the discretion of the owner.  Given that a private landholding is in question, the erection of a sign would need the approval of the owner.  Similar to the Clare Abbey case, planning permission may also be required here.   </p>  <p>  Understanding that there may be a desire to provide directional signage to these locations, the Office of Public Works (OPW) is contacting the separate owners seeking agreement to proceed.</p>  <p>  There is currently no interpretative signage content for either of these sites.  Having regard to the resources available to the OPW currently, it will not be possible to provide information boards in the short term.  However, the OPW will be interested in speaking to any third party that might be prepared to sponsor such boards.</p>  <p>  I am aware, having met with local interests on a recent visit to County Clare with the Deputy, that there is significant commitment locally and am happy to have my officials meet to discuss all aspects of this matter further.</p></reply>

Subject to the proposed scheme being accepted, the detailed design will be commenced and it is anticipated that this will take until the middle of 2016. Procurement of a civil works contractor will then be undertaken by Cork Council Council. </p>  <p>  The Council expects construction to commence in the second half of 2016, subject to satisfactory completion of the necessary procurement and approval processes.

In the first quarter of 2015, there have been 10 site visits to County Westmeath.  For reasons of commercial sensitivity and client confidentiality IDA Ireland does not comment on upcoming site visits by potential investors.</p><p>Westmeath is marketed as part of the Midlands Region which also comprises counties Longford, Laois and Offaly.</p><p>IDA Ireland is and will continue to market the Mullingar Business and Technology Park through its network of overseas offices and present it to potential clients where the facility is considered to be a suitable property solution to meet their needs.</p><p>I understand from IDA Ireland that the office park in Marlinstown is not an IDA Ireland Business and Technology Park.  However, I have been assured by the Agency that it is also happy to promote the property to a potential and suitable investor should the opportunity arise.</p><p>Earlier this year IDA Ireland launched its 5 year strategy for the period 2015 to 2019 which aims to create 80,000 new jobs in the economy over the period and increase investment into each region by between 30% and 40%.  Additionally, a &euro;150 million property investment plan, spread out over five years, will support the achievement of the organisation&rsquo;s regional goals.  The funding will be used to upgrade Ireland&rsquo;s Business and Technology parks, make investments in a number of strategic utility-intensive sites and build new advanced technology buildings in a number of regional locations.  An advanced office building is planned for 2017 for Co. Westmeath as part of the programme.</p><p>It is also important to recognise the vital role that Enterprise Ireland and the Local Enterprise Offices have in building an indigenous engine of growth by developing the capacity of indigenous companies to scale and create the jobs we need.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-06-16a.610.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1067" speakername="Gerald Nash" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015061600075#WRP02200"><p>I note the findings of the survey which the Young Workers Network conducted on the working lives of the under 35s, with particular reference to low pay and Zero Hours Contracts.  I understand that they have forwarded the findings to the University of Limerick for consideration in the context of the study I commissioned UL to carry out, following a competitive tendering process, into the prevalence of zero-hour and low-hour contracts and their impact on employees.</p><p>The study has a broad scope, covering both the public and private sectors, with a particular focus on the retail, hospitality, education and health sectors.  It will fill the gap in knowledge that currently exists in terms of the hard data and information that is available concerning the prevalence of zero hour and low hour contracts in the Irish economy.  The study will examine how such contracts operate in practice and assess the advantages and disadvantages from the perspective of employer and employee.  It will also assess the current employment rights legislation as it applies to employees on such contracts, and consider recent developments in other jurisdictions, including the UK in particular.  The findings will enable me to make any evidence-based policy recommendations to Government considered necessary on foot of the study.</p><p>A wide range of stakeholders is being canvassed to contribute to the study, which I expect to be completed by the end of the Summer.  The Deputy will appreciate that I cannot anticipate the outcome of the study, or the Government&rsquo;s consideration of the study&rsquo;s findings.</p><p>Making work pay continues to be a cornerstone of this Government&rsquo;s agenda.  In this respect the Government has already introduced a number of measures to enhance workers&rsquo; rights, especially the most vulnerable workers in our society. In particular, the Government restored the cut in the national minimum wage initiated by the previous Government, thereby reaffirming that a statutory minimum wage is a statement of core values, providing a threshold of decency under which society agrees that workers&rsquo; wages should not fall. The national minimum wage in Ireland is relatively high by international standards. The most recent figures published by Eurostat show that Ireland&rsquo;s rate is the fifth highest among the 22 EU Member States that have a national minimum wage. When the cost of living is taken into account, Ireland&rsquo;s rate is the sixth highest. The Government also enacted the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2012, to reinstate the Joint Labour Committee system to support wage setting in sectors where workers are poorly organised and vulnerable and wages tend to be low. </p><p>The establishment of a Low Pay Commission (LPC) is one of the key commitments in the Statement of Government Priorities agreed in July last year.  The National Minimum Wage (Low Pay Commission) Bill 2015 which provides for the establishment of the LPC on a statutory basis was published last month and is currently progressing through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I expect that it will be enacted by the end of next month.</p><p>The Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill, which is also currently before the Houses of the Oireachtas, provides for a new statutory framework to replace the former sectoral Registered Employment Agreements (REAs).  The Bill will also <font color="#2F2F2F">provide a mechanism for workers who seek to improve their terms and conditions in companies where collective bargaining is not recognised by their employer. When enacted it will ensure that such workers, aided by a trade union, can advance claims about remuneration, terms and conditions and have these determined by the Labour Court based on comparisons with similar companies. The Bill includes strong anti-victimisation protections.</font></p><p>The developments outlined above are all key elements of the dignity of work agenda which this Government is pursuing. </p><p>It is also worth noting that the most recent figures for youth unemployment show that the Government is succeeding in its twin track approach of creating the conditions for job growth and helping people back to work, including young people in particular.</p><p>For example, the under-25 age group had an unemployment rate of 20.3% at the end of 2014, down from a peak of 33% in early 2012. The absolute number of young unemployed people has fallen substantially &ndash; from close to 80,000 on average in 2009 to 47,000 on average in 2014. The most recent figures show youth unemployment down by 10,000 year-on-year to 39,000 in Q4 2014. As a result of this fall, young people now represent 19% of all the unemployed, down from a share of 35% in mid-2008. Based on current trends and projections, the youth unemployment rate should fall below 20% in 2015.</p></reply>

IT consultancy contracts are normally placed for a fixed period or for a defined piece of work.  If further support or development is required when a contract expires, this would be the subject of a new tender process, rather than re-negotiating existing contract terms.  For some IT support costs, such as proprietary system support, where open tendering is not always possible, my Department is engaged in an on-going process to ensure that such costs are kept to a minimum.  In general, my Department has engaged in a process of ICT support cost management, through the use of tendering, retiring older technologies, and insourcing supports where specialist skills become available in-house.  In 2014, this pro-active approach to IT support cost management gave rise to identifiable savings which in a full year will amount to &euro;65,000 on the 2014 figure.</p></reply>

I am satisfied however that in all cases, they have the skills and expertise to allow them to contribute positively to the functions of their individual board.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Government decided on 30 September 2014 that all appointments (with some limited exceptions) are to be advertised in the State Boards portal, <i>stateboards.ie,</i>operated by the Public Appointments Service (PAS). </p><p>Appointees must meet specific and detailed criteria determined by the relevant Minister as necessary for the effective performance of the relevant role(s) and are processed by way of a transparent assessment system designed and implemented by PAS to support the relevant Minister in making appointments to State Boards under his/her remit.</p><p>Details of the composition of the boards of all agencies within my Department&rsquo;s remit are available through <i>stateboards.ie.</i></p></reply>

Eight regional Action Plans will be delivered this year, building on the success of the national Action Plan for Jobs process which has contributed to the creation of over 100,000 new jobs since 2012.</p><p>Significant progress has been made in preparing the Action Plan for the Midlands, in consultation with key stakeholders in the region.  My officials are currently finalising the Midlands Plan and I anticipate that it will be launched in the coming weeks.</p><p>The Government has also announced that it will provide up to &euro;250 million in funding over the next five years to support the <i>Action Plans for Jobs: Regional</i>initiative.  This funding includes &euro;150 million for an IDA property investment programme in the regions, and up to &euro;100 million which will be administered by Enterprise Ireland under three separate competitive funds for new and collaborative ideas to support job creation at regional level.</p><p>Last month, I announced details of the first two of the funds to be administered by Enterprise Ireland.  These include a &euro;5 million fund covering the period 2015-2017, open to groups of Local Enterprise Offices who come together to bid for funding for projects to support job-creation initiatives in their areas.</p><p>The second is a &euro;5 million Community Enterprise Initiatives fund, open to groups and organisations in every region of the country who collaborate on new ideas and projects to support job creation. The closing date for applications for this fund is 10<sup>th</sup>July 2015. Full details of the Community Enterprise Initiatives fund are available from Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s website, , or from Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s regional offices.</p></reply>

My Department does not have responsibility for the quay at Seanch&eacute;ibh, which is owned by Galway County Council. Full responsibility for its development, repair and maintenance, rests with that Local Authority.</p><p>My Department does, however provide funding for the small scale development and repair of Local Authority owned piers, harbours and slipways under the annual Fishery Harbour and Coastal Infrastructure Development Programme subject to available Exchequer funding and overall national priorities.</p><p>When funding is made available it is done so on the basis of the project specifications set out by the local authority who are wholly responsible for the design of the works.  The actual works, including ancillary works, are carried out by the local authority themselves.  In addition the Local Authority itself is fully responsible for ensuring that permits relating to the project, including planning permission, foreshore licence etc. are in place, as appropriate.  Other issues aligned to the implementation of the project such as heritage and aesthetic issues are matters solely for the Local Authority.</p><p>I would therefore direct the deputy to contact the Local Authority in the first instance with regard to this matter.  It can also be pursued further with the Local Authorities&rsquo; parent Department, the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government.</p></reply>

In that reply, I explained that further laboratory analysis of cultures is ongoing is relation to tissue taken from the deer to identify linkages between the TB found in deer, badgers and cattle.  This work has not been completed yet.  <font color="#222222">My Department monitors the incidence of TB in wild deer nationally through the analysis of suspect lesions or carcases submitted by farmers and hunters who are permitted to slaughter deer under license from the Department of the Environment. </font>Submissions of deer since 1<sup>st</sup>January 2014 from farmers and hunters to our Regional Veterinary Laboratories indicate very low levels of TB in wild deer in all areas with the exception of parts of Wicklow.  These findings indicate that TB is not a problem in wild deer in these areas and is unlikely to be a contributory factor to TB breakdowns in cattle herds.  <font color="#222222"> </font></p><p>As I indicated to the Deputy in my reply to a Question of 10 June, responsibility for wild deer rests with my colleague, the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht under the Wildlife Acts.  The findings in relation to the Wicklow deer study will be considered by the recently established Irish Deer Management Forum (IDMF) which will assess the findings and make appropriate recommendations in relation to all aspects of deer management for Wicklow and nationally.</p></reply>

EU Regulations governing the administration of these schemes require that full and comprehensive administrative checks, including in some cases Remote Sensing (i.e. satellite) inspections, be completed to confirm eligibility under the schemes.  The application of the person named was selected for a Remote Sensing inspection.  Initial processing of this inspection identified a requirement to verify the eligibility of the land s declared by means of a field inspection.  An initial field visit was carried out on 3 February 2015   however it was not possible to inspect all of the lands to be verified on that date.  A further field visit was carried out on 2 April 2015 to complete the verification of the lands.  The results of these verification checks have now been finalised and there is no financial impact on payments due under both the Single Payment and Disadvantaged Areas&rsquo; schemes.</p>  <p>  Payments under both the 2014 Disadvantaged Areas and Single Farm Payment Schemes are being processed and will issue shortly.</p></reply>

While processing of applications has commenced, applications under the National Reserve and/or Young Farmers &rsquo; Scheme cannot be fully processed until 2015 Basic Payment Scheme applications received have been processed for each farmer concerned and land details verified. </p>  <p>  My Department will correspond in due course with each applicant to advise them of the outcome of their application once it has been fully processed.  Where additional information is required in support of an application, my Department will correspond directly with the applicant with a view to obtaining the required information.</p></reply>

This check confirmed the 2013 area over-declaration was in excess of 20% in the case of both the Single Farm Payment and the Disadvantaged Area Schemes and, therefore, no payment is due to the person named under the 2013 Single Payment and Disadvantaged Area Schemes.  The person named had received payments on 16 October 2013 and   2 December 2013 under the 2013 Single Farm Payment Scheme and a payment under the 2013 Disadvantaged Area Based Scheme, which are deemed overpaid and will be netted-off future payments made by my Department.

The maximum amount payable in respect of any individual bovine animal removed under the scheme is &euro;2,800, except in respect of one pedigree stock bull per breakdown where a ceiling of &euro;3,500 applies.  Both amounts are inclusive of the salvage value paid directly to the farmer by the slaughter plant.  In addition to valuation payments, herdowners who experience a disease breakdown may also qualify for compensation under the Income Supplement, Depopulation or Hardship Grant Schemes, subject to the terms and conditions applying in each case.  Payments under these schemes are designed to compensate herdowners for income losses or additional cost s incurred by farmers who have animals removed as reactors.

The service consists of quarterly independent assessments of my Department&rsquo;s ICT security measures and a biannual independent security review of my Department's ICT infrastructure.  This is required for EU accreditation purposes in order to maintain my Department&rsquo;s status as the EU-accredited paying agency in Ireland.  In addition, services for independent internet-facing application security testing are provided for.  We are currently in the process of re-tendering for this work in accordance with EU procurement procedures.</p><p>-My Department is also heavily reliant on high quality Geographical Information Systems (GIS) to both assist with the effective and efficient administration of the EU Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) based single payment and agri-environmental schemes and also in carrying out our animal health and farm inspection obligations.  Following an open public tendering procedure held in 2012, my Department awarded a contract to Compass Informatics to carry out a review of the operation of the Department&rsquo;s GIS systems and to produce a technical report on how to ensure that these systems continue to serve my Department well into the future.  The final report was completed as scheduled and a number of the recommendations have been implemented.</p><p>The total amount spent on external IT consultants in each year is as follows:<table><tr><th><div><b>-</b></div></th><th><div><b>2010</b></div></th><th><div><b>2011</b></div></th><th><div><b>2012</b></div></th><th><div><b>2013</b></div></th><th><div><b>2014</b></div></th><th><div><b>2015 to date</b></div></th></tr><tr><td><div><b>&euro;</b></div></td><td><div>74,279</div></td><td><div>73,597</div></td><td><div>48,387</div></td><td><div>42,152</div></td><td><div>18,382</div></td><td><div>16,279</div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

On 20 April, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Minister for Justice &amp;amp; Equality attended a joint meeting of EU Foreign Affairs and Justice and Home Affairs Councils in Luxembourg.  At that meeting, the Migration, Home Affairs and Citizenship Commissioner presented a 10 point plan of immediate action to be taken in response to the crisis situation in the Mediterranean.  The key focus of the plan is on preventing loss of life. </p><p>On 23 April the Taoiseach attended a special meeting of the European Council at which the <i>10-point action plan was considered. </i>A comprehensive range of commitments were agreed, including at least tripling financial resources for Operations Triton and Poseidon, thereby enabling an increase in the search and rescue possibilities within the mandate of FRONTEX.  EU leaders also committed to actions to prevent illegal migration flows, to reinforce internal EU solidarity and responsibility in relation to the processing of asylum applications and relocation of migrants, and to combat traffickers in accordance with international law.  As part of the Comprehensive plan, the Council invited High Representative Mogherini to begin preparations for a possible CSDP mission. </p><p>Subsequently, at the formal Meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council with Ministers of Defence in Brussels on 18 May, a Council Decision to establish a European Union military operation, EUNAVFOR Med, in the South Central Mediterranean was adopted.  The Mission&rsquo;s mandate will be implemented in sequential phases.  The first phase of the operation will support the detection and monitoring of migration networks through information gathering and patrolling in accordance with international law.  A second phase, involving the targeting, seizure and possible destruction of the vessels and assets of human traffickers will only begin once appropriate UN Security Council authorisation is in place. The third phase is an operational/disruption phase, and the fourth and final phase is a mission withdrawal and completion phase. </p><p>While our focus remains on the humanitarian search and rescue mission to which we have deployed L.&Eacute;. Eithne, Ireland is fully supportive of the first phase of the CSDP operation which is being carried out in full accordance with international law.  In relation to further phases of the CSDP operation, we believe that many elements of the proposed action will require a UN Security Council Resolution.  The Permanent Defence Force will not be participating in the mission in the absence of such a resolution. Ireland continues to support the actions of the Union to address the major challenge of migration in the Mediterranean.  We cannot allow criminal gangs and smugglers to continue to exploit people at risk.</p></reply>

The Civil Defence Board was identified in the Public Service Reform Plan as a body to be abolished. The then Minister for Defence appointed a 14 person interim Board as a temporary measure in 2011 and in this context none of the positions were advertised. Legislation to dissolve the Board was passed by the Oireachtas in December 2012. Its functions have now transferred back to the Department of Defence. </p>  <p>  There were no appointments to the Board of Coiste an Asgard from 2009. In the context of settling the Estimates for the Department of Defence for 2010, the Government decided that the national sail training scheme operated by Coiste an Asgard would be discontinued as recommended in the Report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure. The formal wind up of the Company including voluntary strike off with the Companies Registration Office was completed in early 2013. </p>  <p>  The only body currently under the aegis of the Department of Defence is the Army Pensions Board. The Army Pensions Board is an independent statutory body established under the Army Pensions Act 1927. The Act specifies that the Board shall consist of a chairman and two ordinary members. The two ordinary members must be qualified medical practitioners of whom one must be an officer of the Army Medical Corps. The chairman and the non-military ordinary member are appointed by the Minister for Defence with the concurrence of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. The Army Medical Corps ordinary member is appointed by the Minister for Defence on the recommendation of the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces. </p>  <p>  There have been three appointments to the Army Pensions Board since March 2011. Commandant Adam Lagun was appointed to the position of Army Medical Corps member of the Board in December 2011. This position became vacant in October 2014 due his deployment overseas. On the recommendation of the Chief of Staff a temporary appointment to the Board was made to cover the absence period of October 2014 to May 2015. Commandant Lagun resumed as Ordinary member of the Board in June 2015. As the Army Pensions Act 1927 specifies that one of the ordinary members must be an officer of the Army Medical Corps, the positions were not publicly advertised on either occasion. Details of these appointments to the Army Pensions Board were published in the Iris Oifigi&uacute;il on 13 January 2012 and 4 November 2014 respectively. </p>  <p>A civilian doctor was appointed as ordinary member of the Army Pensions Board in November 2013. The civilian doctor vacancy was advertised on the Department of Defence website and the Public Appointments Service website. A number of expressions of interest in the position were received and an appointment to the Board was made on foot of this public advertisement process.</p></reply>

Assistance to persons in distress at sea is being provided in accordance with the applicable provisions of international conventions governing search and rescue situations. Co-ordination of search and rescue efforts and the provision of humanitarian assistance is being achieved by close co-operation with the Italian authorities. </p>  <p>  L.&Eacute;. Eithne is deployed on the high seas in international waters between Sicily and Libya, which is where most migrant activity and search and rescue incidents have occurred. To date, L.&Eacute;. Eithne has been involved in a number of rescue operations resulting in the rescue of circa 1,623 migrants. </p>  <p>  Following their rescue, once on board the Irish Naval Vessel, migrants are provided with medical assistance, food, water and dry clothes to those in need. The migrants are then either transported to a port in Italy, or transferred to another international naval vessel, as directed by the Italian authorities. </p>  <p>  The Department of Defence does not have any information on the countries of origin of these migrants or on their welfare following disembarkation in Italy which is a matter for the Italian authorities. </p>  <p>  Our focus will remain on continuing to assist the Italian authorities in the humanitarian search and rescue operation efforts to prevent further tragedy and loss of life at sea.</p></reply>

I am however awaiting the presentation to me in the coming weeks of a report of an independent working group whose remit is to make recommendations on improvements to the protection process, including direct provision and supports for asylum seekers.

The working group developed a work programme early on and established three sub-groups to deal with the following themes. The first deals with conditions in centres, the second deals with supports for asylum seekers and the third deals with improving the processing of protection claims.</p><p>The working group has taken evidence directly from residents in the direct provision system both in writing and orally, visited centres around the country and spoken directly to residents. It has engaged with particular groups of applicants including children, victims of torture, victims of trafficking and sexual violence, members of the LGBT community and has taken oral and written submissions from a number of experts in this field, including the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and the Special Rapporteur on Child Protection, Dr. Geoffrey Shannon. </p><p>When the report of the Working Group is presented to me, it will be submitted to Government who will then consider the recommendations made therein.<font color="#000080"> </font>The Government recognises that the issues examined by the working group are complex and required thorough consideration to ensure that any recommendations are practical and sustainable from a budgetary perspective and do not undermine existing border controls and immigration policies.</p></reply>

Persons  in distress at sea who are rescued shall be disembarked by the rescuing vessel at the nearest safe port in Italy.  In accordance with relevant international and European Law any claims for international protection by persons who are rescued is the responsibility of the state of disembarkation. </p>  <p>  The Deputy might wish to note that section 8 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) provides that any person who arrives at the frontiers of the State or any person who at any time is in the State seeking the status of a refugee may apply to the Minister for Justice and Equality for a declaration of refugee status. There is therefore no legal basis for accepting extra-territorial applications. </p>  <p>  With regard to the granting of refugee status, the Deputy might also note that the processing of asylum applications in Ireland takes place within a well defined national and international legal framework.  All applications for refugee status are examined in accordance with the statutory requirements set out in the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended). Accordingly, where a person makes an application for refugee status in Ireland their application is examined at first instance by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner (ORAC) and, on appeal by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</p>  <p>The Deputy will be aware that as a further part of its response to the migration crisis situation in the Mediterranean, the Government has agreed in principle to resettle an additional 300 vulnerable people. This brings our total commitment on resettlement to the end of 2016 to five hundred and twenty (520) people, or nearly twice the quota proposed by the Commission for Ireland.</p></reply>

Since its establishment, the Authority has published a Register of Charities, containing information on some 8,500 CHY charities with tax exemption status; made contact with all charities on the register requesting them to supply additional information and legal documentation required to support their registered status; developed an online system for organisations to apply for inclusion in the Register of Charities; provided &ndash; through its website and active programme of stakeholder engagement - extensive information to the charities sector on their obligations and duties under the new regulatory regime.  </p>  <p>  As I indicated on the establishment of the Authority, it has a wide range of functions under the Act, which are being introduced on a phased basis, beginning with the compilation of the statutory Register of Charities. I am informed that the initial priority of the Authority has been on the development of the Register with a view to underpinning and supporting the investigatory and enforcement functions.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to inform the Deputies that sanction was granted recently for additional staff members who are currently being put in place.  This will bring the total staffing complement up to 20 and support the Authority in carrying out its statutory functions. Work is progressing on plans to seek sanction for further recruitment of additional specialist resources for the Authority which will allow for commencement of the remaining parts of the Act, including Part 4 which relates to the Authority's investigatory and enforcement functions. </p>  <p>  In the meantime, I am advised that the Authority has put in place an interim process for the handling of complaints it receives about suspected abuse of charitable status or fraud in charities. Under this process, all complaints received in writing will  be subject to an initial review and assessment by the Authority to determine whether any further action is appropriate.</p></reply>

Therefore I can inform the Deputy that the information requested in relation to the total prison population; the number of prisoners, in tabular form, broken down by prison; the capacity of each prison within the State; the percentage occupation of each prison and  the number of prisoners currently on temporary release broken down by prison is available on <i>www.irishprisons.ie</i>.</p><p>I will shortly write further to the Deputy when the available information is verified in relation to statistics on the other matter raised by him.</p><p>On 15 June 2015, there were 489 prisoners (11%) on temporary release across the prison system. This included 169 prisoners who were serving less than 3 months solely for the non-payment of a Court ordered fine and 163 prisoners who were on structured temporary release programmes such as the Community Return Programme or Community Support Scheme.</p><p>The legislative basis for making decisions on temporary release are fully set out in the Criminal Justice Act 1960, as amended by the Criminal Justice (Temporary Release of Prisoners) Act 2003.</p><p>A prisoner may apply through the prison Governor for consideration for temporary release.  Their family or their legal representative can also apply for consideration of such a concession. It is very important to note that it does not necessarily follow that a prisoner will receive temporary release even if the recommendation made by the prison authorities and/or therapeutic services is to that effect. Each application is considered on its individual merits and a number of factors are taken into account when making a decision on whether to grant temporary release.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the Irish Prison Service Three Year Strategic Plan 2012-2015 and the  Joint Prison Service/Probation Service Strategic Plan 2015-2017 includes working towards the objective of ensuring that all prisoners released early from custody are placed on appropriate structured programme of temporary release.</p><p>The Community Return Scheme is an initiative whereby carefully selected prisoners, serving sentences between 1 year and 8 years, can be granted reviewable temporary release coupled with a requirement to do community service work such as painting, gardening or graffiti removal in a supervised group setting. The type of work involved is intended to assist the community and the scheme is involved with a large number of charitable organisations and local community groups.</p><p>In addition to Community Return, a Community Support Scheme has also been introduced to reduce recidivism rates of short term prisoners by arranging for additional support structures post release and by providing for a more structured form of temporary release.</p></reply>

However the PAS process did not lead to any candidate being recommended for the position at that time.</p><p>The position of Secretary General has been filled since October last on an acting basis by Mr. Noel Waters.  Mr. Waters fulfils all the duties of the post.</p><p>In the interim, substantial progress has been made in the implementation of reforms on foot of the Toland Review.

The objective is to support the necessary changes to ensure the Department provides strategic oversight and added value to its agencies.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will recall that the Review Group envisaged a two year timescale for the full implementation of its recommendations and that will certainly be achieved although the work of embedding and sustaining the changes will continue.  It should also be remembered that a number of recommendations reflect changes being made across the civil service under the Civil Service Renewal Plan which my Department is also committed to implementing.  Having said that, since the report was published last July, all the short term recommendations in the report have been implemented addressing issues such as the purpose, functions and procedures relating to the Management Board (MB) meetings have been restructured in line with the recommendations in the Report; the format and structure of my regular meetings with the Management Board, which are also attended by the Ministers of State, have also been formalised; the membership of the Department's Management Board has been extended to include the Director of the Probation Service and two Principal Officers to ensure broader coverage of the Department and its agencies.  External assistance has been procured to support the Board with the changes underway. The new Deputy Secretary post which was recommended in the report has been filled following an open competition conducted by TLAC. There have also been a number of appointments and changes made at senior management level following TLAC competitions. A Corporate Secretariat Office has been established and a Head of Communications and a Chief Information Officer have been appointed to improve managerial support, internal and external communications and work with the Government's Office of the Chief Information Officers to develop the Department's information capacity. Following a Round table consultation meeting with Heads of Agencies, two new groups have now been established to improve coherence, communications and governance across the sector. The first meetings of these groups (Criminal Justice Strategic Group and the Justice and Equality Leadership network) have taken place and work programmes are being developed. Formal annual Performance Agreements have been signed off with a number of agencies and are being monitored regularly - this process is continuing with the aim of formalising and strengthening governance arrangements and two-way dialogue with agencies. A new Strategy Statement for my Department covering the period 2015-2017 was published in April and an Annual Strategic Business Plan has been put in place to set out clearly the strategic objectives and priorities of the Department against which progress can be measured. Twice yearly progress reports will be published on my Department's website. A new more user friendly website has been developed and launched recently. This provides routine access to all replies to Parliamentary Questions as published in the Oireachtas Official Report as well as access to the Department&rsquo;s Twitter feed. The Principal Officer cohort in the Department has established a network aimed at contributing to improving the overall coherence and efficiency of the Department's management and leadership. Measures to ensure that staff are kept informed and consulted on the process include a series of 6 town hall meetings and regular communications through the Department's internal portal. A staff survey has also been conducted with a view to establishing a baseline measurement for staff engagement and informing the change process. Work has also commenced on developing new Human Resources and Learning and Development Strategies.</p>  <p>  The more long term recommendations around culture, leadership and management processes are also being addressed. A series of focus groups are scheduled to take place with staff over June and July to engage on the Department's future organisational culture.  The Department has engaged international expertise to assist in the cultural change project which emphasises the need for a bottom up, organisation-wide approach to this change. </p>  <p>  Another stream of the change programme includes the establishment of the Policing Authority as part of the comprehensive reforms relating to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This work, which is overseen by the Cabinet Committee on Justice Reform, has largely been achieved, including opening up recruitment to international competition for the posts of Garda Commissioner and Deputy Garda Commissioner; expanding the powers and remit of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission; and enacting the new whistleblower protection.  As the Deputy is aware, the legislation relating to the Policing Authority has started its passage through the Oireachtas and it is envisaged that the membership of the Authority and the CEO position will be publicly advertised shortly.  </p>  <p>  The cost of the Report of the Independent Group was &euro;36,000.  I should add that all the members of the Group gave their services free of charge.</p></reply>

This has, of course, included the legal professional bodies who have a range of insights to offer from their direct working engagement  across the justice system. </p>  <p>  On 22 May 2014 I had my first meetings, as Minister, with the Bar Council and with the Honorable Society of King's Inns.  I had a similar meeting with the Law Society on 16 June 2014.  I availed of these meetings to have an initial exchange of views on a range of current matters within my Department's remit including the Government's ongoing commitment to legislative and other reforms such as those contained in the Legal Services Regulation Bill.  On 3 December 2014 I had a further meeting with the Bar Council followed by one with the Law Society on 8 December 2014.  These meetings provided further opportunity for me to discuss key aspects of the Legal Services Regulation Bill as well to discuss broader aspects of the justice system of common interest.  On 3 June 2015 I had a round-table exchange with the Law Society on specific aspects of the Bill relating to solicitors.  I remain open to having further such meetings, as may be appropriate, in support of the ongoing and very detailed work of officials in my Department on the various matters concerned.  These exchanges, at both official and Ministerial level, continue to take place on a very positive and constructive basis.</p>  <p>  For the sake of completeness, I would wish to point out that my role as Minister for Justice and Equality, including in the promotion of key reforms such as those of the Legal Services Regulation Bill, includes my active participation in an array of events such as the annual conferences, parchment and graduation ceremonies that may be held from time to time by the legal professional or educational bodies.</p></reply>

In addition, in the case of an assault causing serious harm, an offender can be prosecuted under the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997 and could be subject to a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy refers in particular to the position regarding assaults on prison officers I would draw his attention to a number of measures taken in recent years by the Irish Prison Service.  These are  primarily designed to ensure the safety of staff and prisoners by targeting the avenues by which contraband such as drugs, weapons and mobile phones are brought into our prisons.  These measures, which are in addition to the introduction of enhanced CCTV coverage and ongoing training of Prison Officers in relation to Control and Restraint techniques, include the use of hand-held metal detectors, netting over prisons yards and security screening machines to detect and prevent weapons from entering the prison to further limit the scope of acts of violence.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Irish Prison Service had established a Focus Group on Hospital Escorts and Procedures.  In addition, a Control and Restraint Advisory Group has been convened and this Group has identified a number of proposals and recommendations regarding the safety requirements in the case of prisoner escorts.  An implementation group has been established, chaired by the Governor of the Prison Service Escort Corp (PSEC), and I am advised that the implementation of these recommendations has commenced.</p></reply>

The scheduling of court cases and the allocation of court business is a matter for the Presidents of the courts and the presiding judge who are under the Constitution independent in the exercise of their judicial functions.  The Presidents monitor waiting times across all courts lists and seek to ensure the optimum use of court time.  However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has informed me that the primary objective for the Service is to maintain the delivery of front line court sittings and services.  The Courts Service continuously works to support the judiciary and assist in ensuring that cases are dealt with as effectively and as speedily as possible.  Available resources and operational and organisational structures are kept under ongoing review to ensure that resources are targeted and focussed on keeping waiting times in the provision of services to a minimum.  However, delays in the hearing of cases can occur for a number of reasons which can be outside the control of the courts and the Courts Service, such as the unavailability of a witness or where the parties or the legal practitioners may not be ready to proceed.  The following tables set out the waiting times for civil cases in the High Court, Court of Appeal and Supreme Court.<table><tr><th>High Court </th><th>Waiting time</th></tr><tr><td>Asylum</td><td>4 months</td></tr><tr><td>Chancery Actions</td><td>4 months</td></tr><tr><td>Chancery Special Summonses</td><td>3 weeks</td></tr><tr><td>Commercial List</td><td>1 week to 4 months depending on duration</td></tr><tr><td>Family Law</td><td>4 months</td></tr><tr><td>Garda Comp </td><td>4 weeks</td></tr><tr><td>Hague Luxembourg Convention</td><td>6 weeks</td></tr><tr><td>Jury List </td><td>4 months</td></tr><tr><td>Judicial Review</td><td>4 months</td></tr><tr><td>Non Jury (including Circuit Court appeals) </td><td>6 months</td></tr><tr><td>Cork Personal Injury List</td><td>23 months</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin Personal Injury List</td><td>4 weeks</td></tr><tr><td>Dundalk Personal Injuries  </td><td>5 months</td></tr><tr><td>Galway Personal Injuries  </td><td>4 months</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny / Waterford Personal Injuries</td><td>9 months</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick Personal Injuries</td><td>7 months</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo Personal Injuries  </td><td>5 months</td></tr></table><table><tr><th>Court of Appeal</th><th>Waiting Times </th></tr><tr><td>New Appeals</td><td>8 &ndash; 9 months from date of lodgement on notice to appeal to hearing </td></tr><tr><td>Transferred Appeals</td><td>8 -9 months from application to  Direction List </td></tr></table><table><tr><th>Supreme Court </th><th>Waiting Times</th></tr><tr><td>New Appeals </td><td>See below</td></tr><tr><td>Priority Legacy Appeals</td><td>12 months</td></tr><tr><td>Legacy Appeals</td><td>54 months</td></tr></table></p><p>With regard to the Court of Appeal, I am informed that every new appeal appears in a Directions List usually within 4 weeks, for appeals categorised under the provisions of Order 86A Rule 7 of the Rules of the Superior Courts as expedited appeal and within 7 weeks for all other appeals.  Two such Direction Lists are held each week, one for appeals categorised as expedited appeals and one for all other appeals and hearing dates are allocated for the first available date having regard to the time required for the hearing.  I am informed that appeals requiring a priority hearing, for example Article 40 (habeas corpus), bail, extradition and Hague Convention cases will be accommodated at short notice and by scheduling additional sittings if necessary.  </p><p>In relation to appeals transferred to the Court of Appeal from the Supreme Court, over 1,350 such cases exist and I am informed that they are managed by way of parallel listing system in the Directions List.  The court has been proactive in listing over 150 transferred appeals for directions and allocating hearing dates and will in due course list further tranches of transferred cases.  In the meantime any party to a transferred appeal may apply for directions by way of the procedures set out in a Practice Direction issued by the President of the Court of Appeal and any such application will be included in the weekly Directions List and a hearing date allocated usually within 8 to 9 months of the directions hearing.</p><p>The Supreme Court's list is in transition and it is managing a legacy appeal caseload together with applications under Article 64 of the Constitution (transferred appeals) and applications for leave to appeal under the new Constitutional jurisdictions.  In relation to new appeals, leave to appeal has been granted in a small number of cases since the establishment of the Court of Appeal.  It is proposed to deal with these cases as expeditiously as possible.  In respect of priority legacy appeals and other legacy appeals, I am informed that the historic average waiting period has been 12 months and 54 months respectively but it is anticipated at this point that the legacy appeal caseload will have been disposed of by mid 2016 subject to the level of new business that is filed with the Court.</p></reply>

It also involved the refurbishment of accommodation in &Aacute;ras U&iacute; Dh&aacute;laigh to house the Office of the Court of Appeal and staff of the court, as well as accommodation for courts, judges and staff who had to be relocated there from the Public Records Office building.  The cost of these building works to date has been &euro;2.497 million. A small amount of works remain to be completed which are expected to be undertaken during the summer of 2015. I am informed that in relation to ICT services for the Court of Appeal, expenditure of &euro;467,000 was incurred to date in providing ICT equipment for the courtrooms, judges and staff of the Court.

The General Scheme of a Marriage Bill 2015, published on my Department's website on 9 March 2015, set out the framework for the legislation which would be proposed if the referendum on the Thirty-fourth Amendment of the Constitution were passed by the people. That General Scheme made it clear that the issue of guaranteeing the freedom of religion of religious solemnisers will be addressed in that context. Specifically, Head 7 sets out firstly that the legislation will not oblige a religious body to recognise a particular form of marriage ceremony, and secondly that the legislation will not oblige a registered solemniser who is registered in the Register of Solemnisers on behalf of a religious body, to solemnise a marriage in accordance with a form of ceremony which is not recognised by that religious body.</p>  <p>  The Marriage Bill 2015, currently at an advanced stage of drafting, will give legislative effect to that principle.</p></reply>

An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continuously conducts awareness and education campaigns and enforcement initiatives to increase driver awareness and prevent and detect breaches of road traffic and transport legislation, thus promoting an improved compliance culture among road-users.  I am advised by the Garda authorities that there is extensive enforcement of motor insurance legislation compliance with 101,731 prosecutions instigated for no insurance between 2012 to 7 April 2015.</p></reply>

This limit was set in 2006 and was last reviewed in 2009 in advance of the expansion of the scheme to cater for business-to-business claims of the same nature which came into effect on 5 January 2010.  I am informed that the review found that the existing limit was appropriate and should remain unchanged as an increase might result in a negative impact on the level of service provided by Small Claims Registrars throughout the country.  The procedure is labour intensive but  provides a satisfactory service at present.</p>  <p>  In addition, European Small Claims Procedures, provided for under Regulation (EC) No. 861/2007, currently provide for a maximum claim limit of &euro;2,000.

The primary purpose of Section 63 of the Road Traffic Act, 2010 is to ensure that the driving licence number of individual offenders is recorded to enable the application of appropriate penalty points to the licence on conviction by the Court, and the Courts Service has put in place arrangements to record these details.  As I have recently advised the Deputy, I understand that an arrangement has been put in place between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Courts Service to facilitate the bringing of prosecutions for the non-production of a driving licence in these circumstances and that these prosecutions will commence in the very near future.</p>  <p>  I can further advise the Deputy that my Department is in ongoing contact with the relevant agencies with a view to ensuring that the most efficient and effective processing and recording of data in respect of non-production of licences applies.  As part of this process, the Criminal Justice (Fixed Charge Processing System) Working Group is studying other possible measures to assist with the association of driving licence details with penalty points.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and I have recently received an update on the Group's ongoing examination of this issue, and have asked that further consideration be given to these matters with a view to more detailed analysis being submitted later this year.</p></reply>

Responsibility for the efficient deployment of Garda vehicles in each Division is assigned to the Divisional Officer, who may allocate vehicles between stations, as required by operational circumstances.  The Deputy will appreciate that a degree of flexibility in allocating and re-allocating vehicles among stations, so as to best match the allocation of resources with policing priorities, is essential to the efficient management of the Garda fleet.</p><p>In that context, I am advised by the Garda authorities that the information requested by the Deputy is as shown in the following table:<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Commissioned </th><th>De-commissioned</th></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>1</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>1</td><td>6</td></tr></table></p><p>The Deputy will be aware that I recently secured a further &euro;10 million for investment in the Garda fleet of which &euro;7 million was made available in 2014.  This funding brings the total investment in the Garda fleet in 2014 to &euro;11 million.  The remaining &euro;3 million is being made available for the purchase and fit out of additional Garda vehicles in 2015.</p><p>In October, 2014, an order was placed for 370 new vehicles.  These vehicles were delivered towards the end of 2014, and following fit out, are being allocated in accordance with the Garda Commissioner's operational requirements.  I am further advised that the allocation of resources at both Divisional and District level, including the provision and deployment of Garda Community Relations vans, is subject to ongoing analysis and review.</p></reply>

That review has been completed and amendments to the Spent Convictions Bill and National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 are currently being finalised.</p><p>I intend to bring the amendments to the Bill before the Oireachtas as soon as possible with a view to commencing the Act in the autumn.  Pending the amendment of the Bill, an Administrative Filter for Garda Vetting Disclosures has been introduced, which provides that certain minor offences that are over seven years old are no longer disclosed.<b><font color="#000080"> </font></b>This Administrative Filter already gives effect to the main provisions likely to be contained in the amended Act.</p><p>A copy of this Administrative Filter is enclosed. </p><p><b>Garda Vetting Procedures</b></p><p><b>Administrative Filter</b></p><p>In anticipation of the amendment and commencement of the National Vetting Bureau Act 2012, an administrative filter in respect of Garda Vetting Unit Disclosures will operate in accordance with the following procedural guidelines. </p><p><b>A.

District Court Convictions which will not be disclosed: </b></p><p>1) Motoring Offences: </p><p><b>District Court</b>convictions for motoring offences will not be disclosed after 7 years even where more recent offences have been committed.  This is because it is considered that old minor motoring offences would not be relevant due to the passage of time. </p><p>2) Minor Public Order Offences : </p><p>The following convictions under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 will not be disclosed <i>if</i>the offence is over 7 years old even where more recent offences have been committed:</p><p>- Section 4 (Intoxication),</p><p>- Section 5 (Disorderly conduct),</p><p>- Section 6 (Threatening, abusive or insulting behaviour),</p><p>- Section 7 (Distribution or display of material which is offensive),</p><p>- Section 8 (Failure to comply with direction of Garda),</p><p>- Section 9 (Wilful obstruction).  </p><p>3) Other minor offences &ndash; 1 Only:</p><p>District Court<b></b>convictions for any other minor offence will not be disclosed after 7 years where the person has one such offence only (excluding motoring or public order offences over 7 years old).  This provision does not apply to offences against the person or to sexual offences.</p><p><b>C.

(Section 1 (2) relates solely to persons &ldquo;convicted on indictment&rdquo;.) </p><p><b>D. Offences in respect of which a person is charged but subsequently not prosecuted or acquitted. </b></p><p>Non convictions will be considered for disclosure where the circumstances of an offence gives rise to a bona fide concern that the person concerned may harm a child or vulnerable person. This information will only be disclosed if the information is of such a nature that its disclosure is necessary, proportionate and reasonable in the circumstances for the protection of children or vulnerable persons, or both, as the case may be.</p><p>The Garda Central Vetting Unit will make such decision in the context of:</p><p>-The information concerned</p><p>-The relevance of the information to the type of work/activity</p><p>-The source and reliability of the information</p><p>-The rights of the vetting applicant and any submissions made by them.</p><p>Where the GCVU makes a determination to disclose information under this section  the GCVU will:</p><p>-Notify the person who is the subject of the application for the vetting disclosure concerned, in writing, of its determination and of the reasons for it,</p><p>-Provide to the person a copy of the information to be disclosed,</p><p>-Notify the  person of the intention to disclose the information to an Authorised Signatory for the registered organisation concerned after the expiry of 14 days from the date of notification, and</p><p>-Allow the applicant the opportunity to make a written submission.</p><p>-There will also be an appeals process in respect of a decision to disclose the information. </p><p>The GCVU will not issue a vetting disclosure in respect of a person until this process has been completed.</p></reply>

These services are ongoing, but organisations apply for funding each year. Also included is funding for awareness raising, which tends to be project based. Again organisations apply on an annual basis. Both schemes are advertised in the national press.</p><p>The amount sought by You are Not Alone in 2012 is not available. Offaly Domestic Violence Support Service received slightly more than they applied for in 2013, because a very small additional amount was available for allocation later in the year. </p><p>In relation to funding for the  domestic violence perpetrator intervention programmes this is negotiated annually with the programme providers before they submit their final proposals for funding. This means that the proposed funding and allocated funding are usually aligned, subject to any funding revisions under the Estimates process. In a number of years allocations were made in a calendar year, but applied to an academic year, so draw downs in the calendar year were greater in two instances than allocations.</p></reply>

Following completion of consultation with relevant stakeholders I will seek Government approval for the publication of the strategy which I expect to seek in the near future.</p><p>Included as part of the strategy will be the enactment of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill. I envisage the Bill will be published  this D&aacute;il session. The Bill will provide for new offences of purchasing, in the context of prostitution, sexual services.  It also includes wide ranging provisions to enhance the protection of children and vulnerable persons from sexual abuse and exploitation.  When enacted, the Bill will facilitate full compliance with the criminal law provisions of a number of EU, UN and Council of Europe legal instruments as well as implementing the recommendations of a number of Oireachtas Committees.<b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p></reply>

Since its establishment, the Authority has:</p>  <p>  -	published a Register of Charities, containing information on some 8,500 CHY charities with tax exemption status;</p>  <p>  -	made contact with all charities on the register requesting them to supply additional information and legal documentation required to support their registered status;</p>  <p>  -	developed an online system for organisations to apply for inclusion in the Register of Charities;</p>  <p>  -	provided &ndash; through its website and active programme of stakeholder engagement - extensive information to the charities sector on their obligations and duties under the new regulatory regime.  </p>  <p>  As I indicated on the establishment of the Authority, it has a wide range of functions under the Act, which are being introduced on a phased basis, beginning with the compilation of the statutory Register of Charities. I am informed that the initial priority of the Authority has been on the development of the Register with a view to underpinning and supporting the investigatory and enforcement functions.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that sanction was granted recently for additional staff members who are currently being put in place.  This will bring the total staffing complement up to 20 and support the Authority in carrying out its statutory functions. Work is progressing on plans to seek sanction for further recruitment of additional specialist resources for the Authority which will allow for commencement of the remaining parts of the Act, including Part 4 which relates to the Authority's investigatory and enforcement functions. </p>  <p>  In the meantime, I am advised that the Authority has put in place an interim process for the handling of complaints it receives about suspected abuse of charitable status or fraud in charities. Under this process, all complaints received in writing will  be subject to an initial review and assessment by the Authority to determine whether any further action is appropriate. I am advised that the specific case raised by the Deputy will be addressed by the Authority via this interim process.</p></reply>

It was not possible to present the information in tabular format as per the Deputy's request.</p><p>In relation to the public advertising of vacancies, the Deputy will be aware that there are many constraining factors which impact on the filling of vacancies to State Boards. Board vacancies are not always advertised on the Public Appointments Service (PAS) website. Many are advertised on the Department's website or the websites of the organisations concerned. The Deputy will also be aware that there are many cases where legislation requires that a vacancy must be filled by candidates holding certain qualifications or must be nominated by certain prescribed bodies and in such instances public advertisement of the vacancy is usually not necessary. Other than that I am not not in a position to provide further information as in order to do so it would be necessary to disaggregate every single appointment made since 2011 and the resources are simply not available to undertake this task.</p><p>However, to the extent possible I have provided below a narrative account of the vacancies filled since 2011 and the manner in which they were filled.</p><p>The Deputy may wish to note that the term 'State Boards' is somewhat imprecise as it includes bodies with a wide and diverse range of functions many of which would not fall into the more commonly understood definition of Board which is a body with a governance oversight of an organisation.  To be of assistance to the Deputy I have interpreted his question as embracing all bodies called Boards, irrespective of their functions, as well as other bodies with a governance remit whose title does not include the term &ldquo;Board&rdquo;.</p><p><b><i>Censorship of Publications Board</i></b><b></b><b><sup>1</sup></b></p><p>Five appointments were made to the Censorship of Publications Board in March 2014.

These positions will be advertised on www.stateboards.ie in due course. All of these positions will be filled from applications received in response to the public advertisement process.</p><p><b><i>Charities Regulatory Authority</i></b></p><p>In 2014, sixteen appointments were made to the Charities Regulatory Authority. All of these positions were filled from applications received in response to a public advertisement process. The Charities Regulatory Authority was established on a statutory basis on 16 October 2014.</p><p><b><i>Children Detention Schools Board of Management</i></b></p><p>One appointment was made to the Children Detention Schools Board of Management.  The position was not advertised as the appointment was made under Section 167(4)(a) of the Children Act 2001 as amended, which requires at least one officer of the Minister.  The person appointed was a civil servant.</p><p>The Deputy should note that responsibility for the Children Detention Schools Board of Management moved to the Department for Children and Youth Affairs on 1 January 2012.</p><p><b><i>Classification of Films Appeal Board</i></b></p><p>All positions (nine members) on the Classification of Films Appeal Board are currently vacant. These positions were advertised on www.stateboards.ie on 29 May 2015. All of these positions will be filled from applications received in response to the public advertisement process.</p><p><b><i>Courts Service Board</i></b></p><p>The Courts Service Board has eighteen members, it is chaired by the Chief Justice and includes nine other judges, the CEO of the Courts Service, persons nominated by the Law Society, Bar Council and ICTU, an elected staff representative and three persons nominated by the Minister for Justice. Thirty one vacancies occurred.  There have been thirty one appointments, six of which were individuals nominated by myself or my predecessor Mr. Alan Shatter, T.D., including two civil servants from my Department.  None of the vacancies were publically advertised.</p><p><b><i>Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Arbitration Board</i></b></p><p>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Arbitration Board is appointed by the Government and consists of a Chairperson, a member nominated by the representatives associations and a member nominated by the Government.  The Chairperson is appointed on the nomination of the Ministers for Justice &amp;amp; Equality and Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform in agreement with the representative associations.  Four vacancies occurred and four appointments were made to the board.</p><p><b><i>Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Complaints Board</i></b></p><p>The Board of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Complaints Board (GSCB) consists of a Chairman and eight ordinary members one of whom is nominated by the Garda Commissioner.  The term of office for the Board of the GSCB is 5 years.  The Board&rsquo;s current term of office commenced on 8 May 2012.</p><p>Members of the Board, other than two serving public servants, are entitled to be paid remuneration.  However, in line with a request from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform the Board members have agreed to avail  of the option to waive their Board fees.  Accordingly, the members of the current Board have received no remuneration since their appointment to the Board.</p><p>In view of the impending dissolution of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Complaints Board, the serving members of the executive Board were reappointed for a five year term or until the dissolution, whichever is the earlier. There is no requirement for Board members to appear before an Oireachtas Committee prior to appointment. </p><p>Please note that the Garda  S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission is not a Board it is a three member Commission</p><p><b><i>Judicial Appointments Advisory Board</i></b></p><p>The Judicial Appointments Advisory Board consists of eleven members, it is chaired by the Chief Justice and includes four other judges, the Attorney General, persons nominated by the Law Society and Bar Council and three persons nominated by the Minister for Justice and Equality. Fourteen vacancies occurred. Thirteen appointments were made to the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board.  Five of the appointments were individuals nominated by myself or my predecessor Deputy Shatter. There is currently one vacancy on the Board, which was publically advertised through the Public Appointments Service, I intend to fill this vacancy shortly.  </p><p><b><i>Legal Aid Board</i></b></p><p>Sixteen vacancies occurred during the period referred to by the Deputy.  Of the sixteen appointments to this Board, nine were civil or public servants. The positions were not publicly advertised.</p><p><b><i>Mental Health (Criminal Law) Review Board</i></b></p><p>Five vacancies occurred. Five appointments were made to the Mental Health (Criminal Law) Review Board. Individuals are appointed by the Minister on foot of their experience and expertise which is invaluable to the work of the Board.  <b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p><p><b><i>National Disability Authority (NDA)</i></b></p><p>Fourteen vacancies arose on the Board of the National Disability Authority during the period referred to by the Deputy, and fourteen appointments were made to the Board. All were publicly advertised.

These posts were not advertised on this occasion.  This was not felt necessary given the small number of appointees sought, the low level of activity and remuneration of the Board and the need to put the Board, with continuity of experience, in place as soon as possible.  <b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p><p><b><i>Private Security Authority (PSA)</i></b></p><p>The Private Security Authority has eleven Board members, one Chairman and ten ordinary members.  The current Board was appointed in July 2013 for a four year term. All 11 positions became vacant prior to this.</p><p>Four of the Board positions are nominations from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, my Department, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Employment and the Private Security Authority as required under the Private Security Services Act 2004 (as amended).  Therefore it is only possible to advertise a maximum of seven positions. My predecessor as Minister sought Expressions of Interest for all such seven positions.</p><p>Six appointees were taken from those who had submitted an Expression of Interest. </p><p><b><i>Property Registration Authority</i></b></p><p>Ten appointments were made to the Property Registration Authority in the period referred to by the Deputy. Of these appointments, the Chairperson whose term of office expired in November 2014 was re-appointed for a further term of office. Four of these appointments related to an officer of the Minister, an elected staff representative, a nominee of the Bar Council and a nominee of the Law Society - as provided for the legislation which established the Authority. The other appointments were made from among applicants who responded to public advertisement processes.</p><p><b><i>Property Services Appeal Board</i></b></p><p>Six appointments were made to the Property Services Appeal Board in July 2012.

The Chairperson, who was a member of the Property Services Regulatory Authority Implementation Team, was appointed in order to provide continuity to the Authority which had operated on a non-statutory basis for a number of years. Five of these appointments expired in April 2015. All of the outgoing members, one of whom was the officer of the Minister, were re-appointed for a further term of office.</p><p><b><i>Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission</i></b></p><p>On 8 September 2011, the Government decided to merge the Human Rights Commission and the Equality Authority to establish a new Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC) to promote human rights and equality issues in a more efficient, effective and coherent way.</p><p>The fourteen outgoing members of the Equality Authority accepted reappointment in September 2011 for a further term which concluded at the end of July 2012.</p><p>In the case of the Human Rights Commission 3 Commissioners were appointed by a Government Decision on the 20 December 2011 and their term expired on 31 May, 2012.</p><p>The Working Group established to advise on the practical issues in relation to the establishment of a new merged Commission recommended that an Independent Selection Panel be set up for the purpose of appointing new and future members of this Commission.  This is in line with a fundamental requirement of the Paris Principles that the members of the IHREC be independent and that the selection process be independent of Government.</p><p>In November 2012, advertisements inviting expressions of interest for the position of Chief Commissioner and of &quot;ordinary&quot; members appeared in the media.  The Independent Selection Panel forwarded its recommendation of fourteen names in March 2013. While the persons recommended could not be appointed to the IHREC in advance of the required legislation being enacted and commenced, the Government appointed fourteen individuals as members of the Human Rights Commission and subsequently they were appointed as members of the IHREC when the legislation was enacted, on a three-year and five-year basis to ensure that the terms of office of all members of the new Commission will not come to an end at the same time so as to preserve institutional continuity.</p><p>On 31 May, 2013, my predecessor Mr. Alan Shatter, T.D. appointed twelve of their number to the Board of the Equality Authority, under the Employment Equality Act 1998, as amended, on an interim basis of three years, but which expired when the Bill to establish the IHREC was enacted and commenced and the two Bodies were dissolved.</p><p>Ms Emily Logan was nominated by PAS as Chief Commissioner of the IHREC and at a Government meeting on 18 July 2014  Ms Logan was appointed on an interim basis as President of the Human Rights Commission pursuant to section 5 of the Human Rights Commission Act 2000. She was also appointed as Chair of the Equality Authority pursuant to section 41 and 42 of the Employment Equality Act 1998.</p><p>The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014 which passed both Houses of the Oireachtas was signed by the President on 27 July 2014. Her formal appointment and the formal appointment of the other fourteen members to the new IHREC were made by the President on the 31 October 2014 following the passing of motions in both Houses of the Oireachtas on 23 October 2014.</p><p>Future selection of persons to serve as members of the IHREC will be vested in the Public Appointments Service (PAS) as provided for in the IHREC Act 2014.</p><p><b><sup>1 </sup></b>Responsibility for the Censorship of Publications Board and the Censorship of Publications Appeal Board was transferred from the Minister for Arts, Heritage and Gaeltacht to the Minister for Justice and Equality with effect from 10 March 2015 (S.I. 89/2015 refers.)</p></reply>

The Report was not carried forward by the Government of the day which took a cautious approach.  The implementation of the Report at this remove, and the introduction of any legislation to enable the type of collective legal action envisaged would, therefore, remain matters for the Government and the Oireachtas who would have to be convinced of their merits and impacts in the public interest - including in terms of the sustainability of a collective action regime and its potential costs to the parties concerned and to the Exchequer.  These are also issues which would require the inputs of several Government Departments impacting as they do on areas of law such as those of consumer protection, competition, the environment and the provision of financial and other services.  Consideration would also have to be given to the relevant intervening developments that have taken place at the national, European Union and wider international levels.  While not part of the current Legislation Programme, therefore, this is a complex area of legislative reform that will require renewed and thorough consideration and, on that basis, I am happy to keep it in mind for possible inclusion in any future legislative programme that may be considered by the Government.</p></reply>

The funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 380,000 young people and involve approximately 1,400 youth work staff in 477 projects and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country. In 2015, funding of &euro;49.9m has been provided to my Department for these schemes. There has been no reduction in the overall allocation for youth services in 2015. This was an important priority for the voluntary youth organisations that have a key role in the provision of quality youth work services for young people.</p>  <p>  Kerry Diocesan Youth Service provides a wide range of services for children, young people and their families throughout County Kerry.  Kerry Diocesan Youth Service receives funding from a number of statutory bodies including my Department for these services. My Department provides funding to Kerry Diocesan Youth Service for youth services under the Special Projects for Youth scheme which supports projects which target young people who are disadvantaged including young Travellers and young people who are out of school and at risk of drugs, substance abuse or homelessness. Funding is also provided for a youth information centre in Tralee. In 2015, funding of &euro;429,285 has been allocated to Kerry Diocesan Youth Service for these youth services.  I am also aware that my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality provides funding to Kerry Diocesan Youth Service, through the Community Programmes Unit of the Irish Youth Justice Service, for the operation of Garda Youth Diversion Projects in the county.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that I launched Kerry Diocesan Youth Service&rsquo;s Strategic Plan last week, and that I am familiar with the very important work being done by the Service.</p>  <p>  Ongoing engagement with the voluntary youth sector is an important priority for my Department in the development of youth policies and in matters to do with the provision of services for young people. Youth Work Ireland and its member services have contributed to the recently completed Value for Money and Policy Review of the youth funding programmes that target disadvantaged young people and to the development of a National Youth Strategy, which will be available shortly.</p>  <p>  Last week, officials of my Department met with the President, Chief Executive Officer of Youth Work Ireland and with a group  of Youth Work Ireland member services including Kerry Diocesan Youth Service. The meeting discussed matters to do with governance requirements in relation to public funding, the changes that are taking place at both national and local level in the structures that support local youth services, and the proposals for implementing the new youth funding programme as recommended in the Value for Money and Policy Review report.</p>  <p>  My Department and Youth Work Ireland has now formalised this meeting arrangement, with a view to monitoring the impact of the changes underway in the structures and systems for the governance of youth funding programmes and addressing the challenges that arise for the voluntary youth services at local level in delivering services for young people.</p>  <p>  My Department is committed to working collaboratively with the voluntary youth sector services throughout the country on these issues, and on the implementation of the new National Youth Strategy, to secure improved outcomes for young people.</p></reply>

Tusla is currently in the process of recruiting eight additional staff for domestic, sexual and gender based violence services.</p>  <p>I requested that Tusla give particular priority to protecting frontline services, and in that context, funding for the 16 Rape Crisis Centres nationwide which provide services directly to rape survivors has been protected in 2015. Almost &euro;4.0m in funding is dedicated to Rape Crisis Centres in 2015, with funding maintained at 2014 levels. The Rape Crisis Network Ireland (RCNI) does not provide services directly to survivors of sexual violence.</p>  <p>  The specific funding provided for RCNI by Tusla was to develop and maintain a database of information recorded by workers in Rape Crisis Centres. Tusla had concerns that this database did not capture information from all 16 Rape Crisis Centres as only 11 centres are affiliated with the Network.</p>  <p>  In addition, Tusla did not always have timely access to the data collected, which is essential to support the delivery of high quality services across both the domestic violence and sexual violence services sector.</p>  <p>  Consequently, Tusla has taken the decision to put in place a comprehensive data system that best meets the current and future data needs of a developing service.  In order to plan properly for the future, Tusla needs access to complete and reliable information.</p>  <p>  As part of revised governance arrangements, funded sexual violence services will provide information directly to Tusla, creating, for the first time, a comprehensive dataset on all such services funded by the Agency. This information is critically important as Tusla continues to reform services to ensure that we provide the best possible response to survivors of sexual violence.</p>  <p>  I was not in a position to meet with the RCNI on 29th January, 2015 due to other Parliamentary commitments in the Seanad.  I did meet with representatives of the Rape Crisis Centres on two occasions last March, and constructive discussions were held.</p></reply>

This includes adherence to deadlines set by the Oireachtas for both oral and written Parliamentary Questions.</p>  <p>  Parliamentary Questions are circulated to relevant Departmental Units and generally approved at the level of Unit Principal Officer. Ultimately, they make their way via the Department&rsquo;s Secretary General to myself. While there are no official protocols in place to set standards, guidance is available to staff which addresses issues of timeliness and quality of draft responses. In fulfilling my remit as Minister I aim to ensure that the detail included in responses to Deputies is succinct and pertinent to the issue being discussed. In the context of oral PQs, any Deputy is free to pose additional questions and I endeavour to respond on the day to those additional questions. In cases where I do not possess the details sought, I undertake to send a written response to the Deputy as soon as possible following the PQ session.</p>  <p>  Good relationships have been built up with the Questions Office in Leinster House. Where guidance or notifications of changes in practice issue from the Oireachtas to my Department, the staff of the office of the Secretary General circulate same without delay. The Secretary General&rsquo;s office is also available to advise officials preparing responses to questions, should any issues arise.</p></reply>

My officials acknowledged all expressions of interest received and maintained a database of those expressions. In May 2013 the Public Appointments Service (PAS), on behalf of my Department, sought expressions of interest from those interested in being appointed to the Board of the Family Support Agency having regard to both its existing statutory functions and its planned role in facilitating the establishment of the Child and Family Agency.</p><p>New arrangements concerning appointments to State Boards were approved by Government in November 2014. Guidelines covering the process to be used were published on 25th November 2014 by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. Under these new arrangements, PAS will manage the process of  advertising and subsequently, the selection of suitable potential appointees to State Boards.</p><p>Currently, there are vacancies for the positions of chairperson and one ordinary member of the Board of Management of the Children Detention Schools following the resignations of Mr. Joe Horan and Ms. Rachel Grimes respectively. Another member of the Board, Ms. Ursula Kilkelly, is currently performing the role of acting Chairperson. There is also one vacancy on the Board of the Child and Family Agency following the recent resignation of Ms. Ita Mangan. My Department is currently engaging with the relevant Boards and with PAS to advertise these vacancies on the new State Boards website. I am also arranging for certain vacant positions on Gaisce, the Presidents Award scheme, to be advertised through the State Boards process.  Arrangements will also be made to advertise for members of the Adoption Authority of Ireland as the current Board's term ends later this year.</p><p>In making my decisions on appointments to boards, subject to the governing legislation, I will consider the most suitable persons for the positions available with due regard to the body or agency in question and its particular responsibilities and I will seek to ensure that the appropriate mix of skills and experience is in place to achieve the best result.</p></reply>

The author of this appendix acknowledged that its conclusions remained a matter of conjecture until such time as a more forensic examination of the home&rsquo;s records could be undertaken by the HSE.</p>  <p>  As these matters were outside the direct remit of the McAleese Committee, the HSE subsequently advised that these wider concerns would be examined separately by the HSE.  At that time my Department advised the HSE that any validated findings of concern from this separate process should be appropriately communicated by the HSE.  I can confirm that my Department is not aware of any such subsequent report by the HSE. As these issues are now within the remit of the Child and Family Agency, I will ask the Agency to reply directly to the Deputy and request that I am sent a copy of this reply.</p>  <p>  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs became actively involved in responding to the concerns relating to Mother and Baby Homes following the publication of information on the former Bon Secours Home in Tuam around mid-2014. The Inter Departmental Review Group was set up by my predecessor to assist Government in its deliberations on the terms of reference of a Commission of Investigation and to map the important dimensions of the issues in the short time available. The more extensive process of assembling and investigating all relevant records now forms a very significant part of the Commission&rsquo;s work. The Group's Report cites a range of academic research and published social histories which explore matters related to Mother and Baby Homes and demonstrates that concerns in relation to the role and purpose of these institutions have been the subject of attention, report and debate since their establishment in the early years of the State.</p>  <p>  This work culminated in the establishment of the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes and certain related matters in February 2015. Using its extensive legal powers, this Commission is now examining matters within its comprehensive terms of reference to ensure that what happened to vulnerable women and children in Mother and Baby Homes is fully examined. Its findings will be published.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004, together with the terms of reference set out in S.I. No. 57 of 2015, provides this Commission with all necessary powers to comprehensively examine the broad range of public concerns that have been expressed in relation to mother and baby homes.</p></reply>

These services were previously funded by the Health Service Executive (HSE).</p>  <p>  Sexual violence services are being developed by Tusla, as a national specialist service, so as to enable better outcomes for both children and adults who are survivors of sexual violence.</p>  <p>  Tusla has undertaken a comprehensive review of sexual violence and domestic violence services. The purpose was to identify strategic priorities and set out a roadmap for the delivery of these services.  Tusla considers that there is scope for a more co-ordinated and more equitable provision of these services across the country.  In reviewing the make up of current services, it is seeking to address any identified gaps in services, to avoid duplication and to support effective delivery of frontline services nationally.</p>  <p>  Tusla has appointed a national manager to ensure a single line of accountability for all resources in this important area.  Tusla is currently in the process of recruiting eight additional staff for domestic, sexual and gender based violence services.</p>  <p>  Tusla has commenced an external consultancy process to assist with developing key components of models of domestic and sexual violence service provision.  This does not involve an evaluation of current service providers, but there will be outputs from this process, including a report for internal Tusla for planning and implementation purposes. </p>  <p>I requested that Tusla give particular priority to protecting frontline services, and in that context, funding for the 16 Rape Crisis Centres nationwide which provide services directly to rape survivors has been protected in 2015. Almost &euro;4.0m in funding is dedicated to Rape Crisis Centres in 2015, with funding maintained at 2014 levels. I can confirm that no Rape Crisis Centres are to be closed.</p>  <p>  Tusla has advised that it informed RCNI of it's decision to withdraw funding at a meeting last December.  I subsequently became aware of this decision in January of this year and had ongoing discussions with Tusla in relation to its budgetary plans for 2015 including its decision to withdraw funding from RCNI.</p>  <p>  The specific funding provided for RCNI by Tusla was to develop and maintain a database of information recorded by workers in Rape Crisis Centres. Tusla had concerns that this database did not capture information from all 16 Rape Crisis Centres as only 11 centres are affiliated with the Network.</p>  <p>  In addition, Tusla did not always have timely access to the data collected, which is essential to support the delivery of high quality services across both the domestic violence and sexual violence services sector.</p>  <p>  Consequently, Tusla has taken the decision to put in place a comprehensive data system that best meets the current and future data needs of a developing service.  In order to plan properly for the future, Tusla needs access to complete and reliable information.</p>  <p>  As part of revised governance arrangements, funded sexual violence services will provide information directly to Tusla, creating, for the first time, a comprehensive dataset on all such services funded by the Agency. This information is critically important as Tusla continues to reform services to ensure that we provide the best possible response to survivors of sexual violence.</p>  <p>  Tusla's own analysis indicates that there is sufficient service provision with regard to Council of Europe guidelines and Tusla is currently looking at access to these services arising from population distribution.</p>  <p>  In 2015, Tusla will spend approximately &euro;19m on these services. The information sought by the Deputy in relation to a breakdown of funding by constituency has been requested from the Child and Family Agency and I will respond directly to the Deputy when the information is received.</p></reply>

The main purpose of the Act is to restate the general prohibition on abortion in Ireland while regulating access to lawful termination of pregnancy in accordance with the <i>X </i>case and the judgment of the European Court of Human rights in the <i>A, B and C v Ireland </i>case.  The Act also creates procedures which apply to the lawful termination of pregnancy.

This is not surprising given the age and structure of many of our public nursing homes.  Compliance issues are in the main related to physical infrastructure and to issues such as personal space and privacy and access to toilet facilities.  It is important to stress that the care provided to residents of these facilities is of a generally high standard. </p>  <p>  Discussions are ongoing between the Health Service Executive (HSE) and HIQA in this context.  Addressing these issues will require prioritisation across facilities within the overall resources that can be made available and it would not be helpful to that exercise to highlight individual units where issues arise.</p>  <p>  It is also important to point out that the Department of Health is not and cannot be involved in the dialogue between HIQA and the HSE on the status of individual units.</p></reply>

In addition, capital funding has been agreed for a new theatre on site at Crumlin, which will expand theatre capacity further. As a further measure, available capacity is being identified in other hospitals and some children are being transferred for their surgery, where it is considered clinically appropriate for them. The Children's Hospital Group, Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital Crumlin and the HSE are working together on an ongoing basis to identify all options to increase capacity further.</p>  <p>  In relation to the particular patient query raised by you, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly.

In line with practice in other EU Member States, the HSE, through the National Contact Point (NCP) office, provides information for patients on the Cross-Border Directive on its website -  - and also by phone.  The principal function of the NCP (which is the mechanism specified under the Directive for the dissemination of information on the Directive by Member States) is to facilitate exchange of information for patients concerning their rights and entitlements relating to receiving healthcare in another Member State, in particular the terms and conditions for reimbursement of cost and the procedures for accessing and determining those entitlements.  The NCP also has a responsibility to ensure that all enquirers are informed of the right to healthcare, if any, that they may have through the European legislation on the coordination of social security schemes (EU Regulation 883/04) and which may be more beneficial to them.  The NCP is able to inform patients what the cost of their treatments would be in Ireland to allow them make a comparison with the costs they are being quoted for comparable treatment in another Member State. </p><p>The healthcare being sought under the CBD can only be healthcare that a person would be entitled to within the public health system in Ireland, which is not contrary to Irish legislation.  Referral for care under the CBD can be made by a GP, a hospital consultant and certain other HSE clinicians.  It will be a matter for the patient and his/her referring doctor to identify the clinician abroad and satisfy him/herself in relation to the qualifications, quality and safety of the services being availed of in the other jurisdiction. </p><p>Prior authorisation may be required from the HSE for certain healthcare.  This requires completion of an application process; consequently patients intending to access care under the CBD should check with the HSE in advance of travelling.  The costs must be borne by the individual and he/she then will seek reimbursement for the cost of the healthcare upon return to Ireland.  The HSE will reimburse the patient for care which meets the terms of the CBD in line with the Directive.  Costs will only be reimbursed up to the level that would have been arisen if the healthcare had been provided in Ireland or the actual cost of the healthcare in the other member state, whichever is the lesser.  All other costs associated with accessing care abroad under the CBD are a matter for the patient and will not be reimbursable by the HSE.</p></reply>

In many instances respite services are part of the overall suite of services provided by voluntary service providers to people with disabilities under their service level agreements with the HSE.  The HSE remains committed to working with all voluntary disability service providers to ensure that all of the resources available for specialist disability services, including respite services, are used in the most efficient and effective manner possible. </p>  <p>  The HSE&rsquo;s Social Care Operational Plan for 2015 aims to provide 190,000 overnight stays in centre-based respite services to almost 5,300 people.  The HSE is also committed to continuing to explore methods of community respite care as an alternative to centre-based respite care, including advancing the Host Family Support Model. </p>  <p>  In relation to the specific query raised by the Deputy, as this is a service issue, it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.  If the Deputy has not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days, he can contact my Private Office and they will follow up the matter with the HSE.</p></reply>

This will be done in collaboration with acute hospitals, the Special Delivery Unit and the National Treatment Purchase Fund.   </p>  <p>  The HSE, in conjunction with Hospital Groups, is focused on delivering on this requirement through maximising the use of internal capacity within and across Hospital Groups in the first instance.  However, there are key limiting factors, primarily in terms of theatre nursing staff and consultant manpower in particular specialties.  Consequently, it is recognised that judicious outsourcing is also required, and this is being managed through a public tendering process.  The elimination of the longest waiting periods for treatment is a key performance objective for 2015 and its achievement will allow for progressive improvement in access to treatments throughout the year.</p></reply>

In our statement of Health priorities for 2015, the Minister for Health and I have reiterated our commitment to implementing the Strategy.</p><p>The National Positive Aging Strategy provides a vision for an age-friendly society and includes four National Goals and underpinning Objectives to provide direction on the issues that need to be addressed to promote positive aging. As Minister of State with responsibility for older people, I am driving implementation at the political level. The Strategy is a cross-Departmental one and my Department has an overall coordinating and collating role and a more direct role for the health-related objectives.</p><p>A key objective of this Strategy is to change the mindsets of decision makers across Government agencies and to raise the priority that is given to the concerns of older people. The first step in doing this is to establish a system of regular reporting on actions and initiatives that impact on older people, and these reports are regularly sought and collated by my Department. The fact that such reports are already and will continue to be required will in itself increase the focus that is given to older persons' issues, and these reports will be submitted for consideration by the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy and Public Sector Reform chaired by An Taoiseach.  Implementation is accordingly an ongoing process.</p><p>It is important to point out the many initiatives already in train which contribute to the Strategy's goals. For example, in the health sector, in the area of older people&rsquo;s services and supports, the Review of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme will be completed shortly. The Single Assessment Tool, which will allow for a systematic assessment of need and allocation of services to older people, is being developed by the HSE; measures are being taken to ensure integrated care for older patients, and palliative care services are being improved. The Deputy will also be aware that &euro;25m<b></b>was allocated in Budget 2015 to support services that provide alternatives to, and relieve pressures on acute hospitals.  In April 2015, an additional &euro;74m was allocated to further tackle the ongoing issue of delayed discharges in acute hospitals. The majority of these patients are older people, and these funds are being applied across both long term and short term residential services and at community level.  As a result the waiting time for funding of approved patients under the Nursing Home Support scheme has fallen to four weeks now from eleven weeks in March.</p><p>A Healthy and Positive Aging  Initiative (HaPAI) has also been established to implement the research objective of the National Positive Aging Strategy. It is a joint initiative between the Department of Health, the HSE&rsquo;s Health and Well-being Programme and the Atlantic Philanthropies and will run from October 2014 to December 2017, with a commitment to Department of Health funding for a further two years. The Initiative will monitor changes in older people&rsquo;s health and well-being linked to the Goals and Objectives of the Positive Aging Strategy. This will be done primarily through the development of positive aging indicators to be published every two years. A preliminary positive aging report will be published shortly.  The HSE will also develop a physical activity communications campaign under the Initiative.</p></reply>

Since coming into office, this Government has prioritised the reform and resourcing of our mental health services in line with the recommendations in <i>A Vision for Change</i>.  Additional funding totalling &euro;125 million has been provided primarily to strengthen Community Mental Health teams for both adults and children and to enhance specialist community mental health services for older people with a mental illness, those with an intellectual disability and mental illness, and forensic mental health services.</p><p>Implementation of <i>Vision</i>is ongoing and work will be undertaken during 2015 to prioritise outstanding actions informing the identification of any gaps in service.  The additional &euro;35 million provided for mental health in Budget 2015 will be directed towards the continued prioritised development and reconfiguration of Community Mental Health teams.  In addition, the funding will also permit urgent specialist needs to be addressed, including psychiatric intensive care, forensic mental health, mental health intellectual disability care, and psychiatric liaison services.</p><p><i>A Vision for Change </i>contained a commitment that it would be reviewed after 7 years.  It was decided to give priority to the review of the Mental Health Act 2001, after which consideration would again be given to reviewing <i>Vision.</i>The Expert Group which I set up to review the Mental Health Act 2001 has now completed its work and I plan to shortly seek Government approval for the drafting of a General Scheme of a Mental Health (Amendment) Bill to incorporate the recommendations of the review in revised legislation. </p><p>Preliminary work on the development of a successor policy to <i>A Vision for Change</i>is underway and the parameters of a review will be agreed as soon as possible.</p></reply>

The new hospital, as you are aware, will be co-located with St James's Hospital, and ultimately tri-located with a maternity hospital to be developed on campus. In addition to the main hospital, the project includes two satellite centres at the campuses of Tallaght and Connolly Hospitals.  Design development is ongoing and a planning submission is to be made in the coming weeks. Subject to planning, work is scheduled to commence at the main site at St. James's, and at satellite centre sites at Connolly and Tallaght, in early 2016.</p>  <p>  Minister Howlin has committed to making &euro;200m available from the sale of the National Lottery for the new children's hospital, adding to the existing &euro;450m Exchequer funding and underlining the Government's commitment to the project.  Current estimates are that the core hospital, including both satellite centres, will be delivered within this envelope.  This includes provision for inflation, VAT and contingencies; it does not include equipment or ICT which can be purchased, licensed or leased separately. Philanthropic and commercial funding streams will be targeted as appropriate for supporting elements of the project to include car parking, academic and research facilities, and estimates will continue to be reviewed and refined at each stage of the project.</p>  <p>  I hope this answers the question for the Deputy.</p></reply>

In line with Government Decision S180/20/10/1617 of 2014, relating to the advertising for expressions of interest in vacancies on State Boards, and Department of Public Expenditure and Reform Guidelines, my Department in conjunction with the new Public Appointments Service website portal, Stateboards.ie, currently advertises for board vacancies as they arise, where I, as Minister for Health, have nominating rights under relevant legislation.  In a number of cases the Minister for Health may decide to re-appoint a board member for a second term, which is in keeping with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's Guidelines.  I also appoint members on the nomination of various bodies in accordance with the relevant legislation. I have no function in these nominations other than the actual appointments.</p><p>There have been 586 appointments to Boards under the aegis of the Department of Health since March 2011 to date.

The labelling must specify that they have a high caffeine content, are not recommended for children, pregnant or breast-feeding women and must also state the caffeine content expressed per mg/100 ml. This does not apply to tea and coffee where the name of the food includes 'tea' and 'coffee'.</p><p>Any future action on taurine will be informed by scientific recommendation by the European Food Safety Authority before being considered for EU regulation by Member States.</p><p>I have asked the Safe<i>food</i>to undertake a review of the position regarding energy drinks in Ireland and I expect that a report will be presented to me in this matter in the near future.</p></reply>

It should be noted that the nature of orthodontic care means that immediate treatment is not always desirable. It is estimated that in up to 5% of cases it is necessary to wait for further growth to take place before treatment commences.  Patients are assessed by the HSE Orthodontic Service under the modified Index of Treatment Need. Patients with the greatest level of need i.e. Grade 5 or Grade 4 are provided with treatment by the HSE. Information on waiting times is collated by the HSE by region rather than by county and for the intervals as shown below.  The information on waiting times for treatment for Quarter 1 of 2015 is as follows:<table><tr><th>Waiting time from assessment to commencement of treatment </th><th>1-6 months</th><th>7-12 months </th><th>13-24 months</th><th>25-48 months</th><th>Over 48 months</th><th>TOTAL</th></tr><tr><td>HSE Dublin Mid-Leinster </td><td>1,140</td><td>875</td><td>1,432</td><td>1,208</td><td>199</td><td>4,854</td></tr><tr><td>HSE Dublin North East</td><td>258</td><td>483</td><td>1,010</td><td>1,546</td><td>672</td><td>3,969</td></tr><tr><td>HSE South</td><td>783</td><td>740</td><td>758</td><td>1,488</td><td>66</td><td>3,835</td></tr><tr><td>HSE West</td><td>839</td><td>1,152</td><td>2,103</td><td>1,209</td><td>64</td><td>5,367</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>3,020</td><td>3,250</td><td>5,303</td><td>5,451</td><td>1,001</td><td>18,025</td></tr></table></p><p>There are no comparable figures for waiting times for 2008 as the current method of collating waiting times was introduced in 2013.

All medical card holders are entitled to specific dental treatments e.g., an annual dental examination, two fillings in each calendar year, extractions as necessary. Additional treatments are available to persons with specific medical conditions, including persons in receipt of care or services for a disability, persons on a register of disability and more vulnerable clients. The HSE prioritises for treatment patients with special needs, high risk patients and those who have greater clinical needs. Expenditure by the HSE on the treatments referred to by the Deputy in 2009 was as follows:<table><tr><th>Treatment Type</th><th>Expenditure (approx)</th></tr><tr><td>Prophylaxis (scale and polish)</td><td>&euro;7.8 million</td></tr><tr><td>Protracted periodontal</td><td>&euro;8.9 million</td></tr><tr><td>Amalgam restoration (filling)</td><td>&euro;19.2 million</td></tr><tr><td>Composite restoration (filling)</td><td>&euro;11.2 million</td></tr></table></p><p>The cost of restoring these treatments, which had been provided before 2010, to all medical card holders would depend on a number of factors, including the underlying oral health of the population and the likely level of take-up of such services. Expenditure on the DTSS since 2009 has been as follows:<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Expenditure</th></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>&euro;87.5 million</td></tr><tr><td>2010 </td><td>&euro;79 million </td></tr><tr><td>2011 </td><td>&euro;53 million</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>&euro;63 million </td></tr><tr><td>2013 </td><td>&euro;63 million </td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>&euro;70 million</td></tr><tr><td>2015 (projected)</td><td>&euro;76 million</td></tr></table></p><p>The HSE continues to monitor the operation of the DTSS to ensure the most beneficial, effective and efficient use of available resources. Future service provision will be informed by the National Oral Health Policy, which the Department of Health is currently developing.</p></reply>

NIAC is a committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland comprising of experts in a number of specialties including infectious diseases, paediatrics and public health.  The committee's recommendations are informed by public health advice and international best practice. </p>  <p>  Immunisation is regarded as one of the safest and most cost-effective of health care interventions.  International studies and scientific assessments suggest that the best way to prevent most disease due to human papillomavirus (HPV) is to vaccinate as many girls and women as possible.  The HPV vaccine protects girls from developing cervical cancer when they are adults.  It is available free of charge from the HSE for all girls in 1st year of secondary school.  This is in accordance with the recommendation received from NIAC which indicated that the HPV vaccine should be offered on an annual basis to all girls aged 12.  The advice, based on public health considerations and supported by the cost-effectiveness analysis, is that HPV vaccines confer maximum benefit both individually and on a population basis if administered prior to HPV exposure.  </p>  <p>  Gardasil vaccine has been authorised for use across the European Union since September 2006.  It was first introduced into the national immunisation programme in Ireland in 2010 and it is estimated that over 55 million girls and women have been vaccinated worldwide since it was first authorised.</p>  <p>  While no medicine (including vaccines) is entirely without risk, the safety profile of Gardasil has been continuously monitored since it was first authorised both nationally and at EU level.  This is done by both monitoring of individual adverse reaction reports received by competent authorities across Europe (including the HPRA) and Periodic Safety Update Reports (PSURs) submitted by the Marketing Authorisation Holder (i.e. license holder) for the vaccine on a regular basis.  The most recent EU review of cumulative global safety update data completed in December 2014 concluded that the benefit/risk profile for Gardasil remains positive and concluded that no updates to the product information (Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and Package Leaflet (PL)) were considered necessary.</p>  <p>  Up to the 31/05/2015, the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) has received 861 reports of suspected adverse drug reactions in association with Gardasil.  National monitoring experience has been consistent with the expected pattern of adverse effects known to occur with the vaccine, as outlined in the approved product information (Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and Package Leaflet (PL)) for Gardasil.  The majority of the reports received to date involved events/reactions related to injection site reactions, malaise, headache, myalgia, fatigue, gastrointestinal symptoms and skin reactions.  Vaccination related events such as dizziness and syncope (fainting) was also reported and would not be unexpected in this patient population.</p>  <p>  The HPRA published updates relating to national monitoring experience on its website during the first year of the HPV schools immunisation programme, with additional updates on national monitoring experience included in several editions of its Drug Safety Newsletter.</p></reply>

Appointments to positions in the Health Service Executive, apart from those positions which are subject to the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Act 1926, are subject to the Code of Practice published by the CPSA.  The Code of Practice sets out the regulatory framework for appointment to positions in the civil and public service, and details how the core principles of probity, merit, equity and fairness might be applied on a principle basis. </p><p>Principal 4 of the Code of Practice relates specifically to the fairness of the appointment process.  It states that any form of unacceptable or unlawful direct or indirect discrimination, whether active or passive is wholly opposed.  It also states that the selection process adopted and the manner in which it is applied must be undertaken with real commitment to equality of opportunity.  Office holders have an obligation to treat candidates fairly, to a consistent standard and in a consistent manner.</p><p>The HSE operate an equal opportunity/diversity policy which aims to create a workplace which provides for equal opportunities for all staff and all potential staff and protects their dignity at all times.

In many instances respite services are part of the overall suite of services provided by voluntary service providers to people with disabilities under their service level agreements with the HSE.  The HSE remains committed to working with all voluntary disability service providers to ensure that all of the resources available for specialist disability services, including respite services, are used in the most efficient and effective manner possible. </p>  <p>  The HSE's Social Care Operational Plan for 2015 aims to provide 190,000 overnight stays in centre-based respite services to almost 5,300 people.  The HSE is also committed to continuing to explore methods of community respite care as an alternative to centre-based respite care, including advancing the Host Family Support Model. </p>  <p>  In relation to the specific queries raised by the Deputy, as these are service issues, they have been referred to the HSE for direct reply.

Following this evaluation, the NCPE concluded that it was unable to recommend reimbursement of the product as the manufacturer was unable to demonstrate sufficient effectiveness and a fair price for Fampridine in the Irish healthcare setting.  Further information on the NCPE's evaluation can be found on the centre's website at www.ncpe.ie.  The NCPE has not carried out any further pharmacoeconomic evaluations of Fampridine.  </p>  <p>  In July 2014, Biogen Idec submitted a revised application to the HSE for the inclusion of Fampridine in the GMS and community drugs schemes.  The HSE has since been engaging with the company seeking an improved commercial offering and these engagements have been completed.  It is not possible to say when a decision on the funding of this medication will be made as the HSE is considering the outcome of those commercial engagements as well as the outcome of discussions which the HSE has had with clinical experts regarding this drug.</p></reply>

As is often the case in these matters, however, it has not proved possible to establish the full facts in every instance.  The promotion and protection of human rights is a core principle of Ireland's foreign policy and we have prioritised the protection of trades unionists, human rights defenders and others who are in immediate danger. I remain concerned at reports of violence against civil society leaders in Colombia, including trades unionists and others.</p>  <p>  Human rights in Colombia, and in particular the slow pace in the decrease of impunity, are a major concern for the EU and for Ireland and are addressed in detail in the context of the EU-Colombia Human Rights Dialogue.  Through this mechanism, which addresses the subject directly with the Colombian authorities at official level, the Union engages in a structured manner across the full range of human rights issues, including as regards human rights defenders and trade unionists, prisoners, land restitution, environmental issues, and economic crimes.  I believe that this policy of engagement, dialogue and scrutiny, which is ongoing, regular and structured, is the best way to promote human rights and the interests of labour in Colombia.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will know, Colombia is facing a significant challenge in overcoming decades of violence, and he will be aware of the peace talks in Havana between the government and the main guerrilla organisation. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights in Colombia has pointed out that an end to the longstanding armed conflict has the potential to transform Colombia in terms of its level of respect for and enjoyment of human rights. As I noted at the Foreign Affairs Council on 20 April, the peace process in Colombia is potentially one of the most significant advances in conflict resolution the region has seen and we strongly support it.</p>  <p>  Our Embassy at Mexico City is accredited to Bogot&aacute; on a non-residential basis.  Officers of the Embassy regularly discuss human rights issues, including some of those mentioned by the Deputy, with government interlocutors during their visits to Colombia and meet with international and local civil society organisations working on human rights issues there, including on labour and environmental rights. The Embassy oversees Irish Aid funding which supports civil society organisations in Colombia, with a focus on the protection of human rights defenders and raising awareness of violations. In addition, Irish Aid provides funding to the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, focused on their work in support of human rights in south-west Colombia.</p>  <p>  The EU-Colombia/Peru Free Trade Agreement, in addition to the emphasis it places on human rights, includes a mechanism for oversight and monitoring of the implementation of labour laws involving the active participation by civil society actors, and establishes an obligation of transparency and public accountability regarding initiatives that could have consequences for labour and/or the environment. This process is overseen by a Trade Committee which will review the implementation of all aspects of the Agreement, including labour, environmental, and trade issues in regular meetings. A meeting of the Committee will take place later this month. Ireland will be represented at the meeting and this will allow us to hear directly the views of Colombia civil society organisations and experts about the implementation of the Free Trade Agreement. </p></reply>

We are almost two thirds of the way through this extreme spike in passport applications and average turnaround times for passport express have remained at 10 or 11 days.  Additionally at this time of year approximately 250 customers are seen daily by appointment at our public counters in Dublin and Cork and receive a turnaround service of between one and 10 days as appropriate. This high level of service delivery has been achieved in no small part due to the dedication of the staff in our passport offices in Dublin, Balbriggan and Cork.  In line with the wider public service reform programme, the passport service actively pursues opportunities to improve customer service with reduced staff numbers through an effective combination of internal and external service delivery initiatives. Additionally, to cope with the seasonal demand the passport service recruited 160 additional temporary staff, most taken from the live register.  I am aware that problems have arisen for certain callers seeking to reach us by phone. I regret these difficulties and we are currently exploring ways in which this can be resolved while maintaining overall service levels and application processing times.  I would advise applicants that our online tracker service which is updated a number of times a day is the best way of getting the most up to date progress report on an application. The passport service provides advice and answers queries via social media to over 3000 twitter followers.  Additionally the Department&rsquo;s website is an easy way of getting answers to the most frequently asked passport queries.</p></reply>

As in the case of the earlier UK and Danish guidelines, they provide that labeling where it appears must be accurate, including in relation to settlements. I support the proper labeling of settlement goods, and I hope to see guidelines introduced at EU level, for the greatest effectiveness and impact. Following the letter which I and other Foreign Ministers sent to the High Representative in April, I believe this can be achieved.   I have stated before that if it proved impossible at EU level, which I do not expect, then I would be ready to introduce such guidelines nationally. </p></reply>

As we operate in almost 80 jurisdictions, it is not feasible nor, in many cases legal, to operate a standard Irish contract.  In line with best international practice, our locally engaged staff are employed under local labour laws.  Salaries at our missions are based on local norms for the roles undertaken and are closely aligned with the salaries paid by similar partner countries.  Contracts of employment for locally engaged staff contain a range of terms and conditions that would be found in similar Irish contracts including remuneration, tenure, description of duties, annual leave, hours of attendance, sick leave and other general provisions found in employment contracts of this nature.  Missions engage with local legal advisers to ensure the contracts meet our obligations in each location.  The Department also has access to a wide array of information on international employment conditions through our membership of ECA, an independent consultancy.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that the Department takes its legal and moral responsibilities to our locally engaged staff seriously and keeps matters relating to their terms and conditions under ongoing review.</p></reply>

It undertook to use all tools at the EU&rsquo;s disposal and to work with countries of origin and transit of migrants to tackle the root causes of the current human emergency.  Ireland strongly supports this comprehensive approach which includes continued provision of development assistance, supporting conflict resolution and capacity building and a range of measures aimed at minimising the risk of further tragedies and loss of life. This overall strategy included a commitment to undertake systematic efforts to disrupt the activities of illegal traffickers, who exploit vulnerable people for profit and put their lives at risk.   Accordingly, the May Foreign Affairs Council adopted a decision to establish a military operation under the Common Security and Defence Policy.  The operation will be implemented in several phases, initially focusing on detecting and monitoring migration networks through information gathering and patrolling on the high seas.  Subsequent phases provide for boarding, seizure and diversion of vessels suspected of being used for human smuggling or trafficking, and for taking necessary measures against such vessels including through disposing of them or rendering them inoperable.</p>  <p>  Ireland was instrumental in ensuring that the Council decision stipulated that the operation must be carried out in accordance with international law and that vessels assigned to it will be ready and equipped to perform search and rescue tasks as necessary.  We also support the phased approach to implementation taking account of any applicable UN Security Council Resolution and consent of the coastal states concerned.</p>  <p>  Separately the Government has despatched a naval service vessel and crew to assist in humanitarian search and rescue tasks in the Mediterranean.</p></reply>

My Department has not incurred expenditure on external public relations services since my entry into office in July 2014.  The expenditure in question has rather arisen in the context of specific initiatives under Ireland&rsquo;s overseas development programme for which we have from time to time commissioned companies with a public relations and communications background to provide other professional services such as project management, logistics and event management.  DHR Communications has been contracted to manage and administer grants to journalists reporting on international development issues under the Simon Cumbers Media Fund (SCMF) and to manage and administer annual Africa Day celebrations.  The SCMF involves managing three funding rounds each year and managing the SCMF student competition. This typically involves the following activities: Convening national and regional information workshops; Managing and administering the application process; Organising the judging process; Providing detailed feedback to all applicants; Processing grant payments and keeping detailed administrative and financial records; Maintaining and updating the SCMF website.  </p><p>It should be noted that expenses paid to third parties account for approximately 30% of the total paid to DHR for managing and administering the Simon Cumbers Media Fund. This includes costs associated with maintaining and updating the SCMF website, facilitating the judging process and raising awareness of the Fund among journalists.  DHR was awarded a new two-year contract in April 2015 following a competitive tendering process.</p><p>Following a further competitive tendering process, DHR was also engaged to plan, manage and execute a national Africa Day 2015 flagship event in Dublin. Like annual Africa Day events held over successive years, this incorporated musical entertainment and cultural activities aimed principally at family audiences. DHR&rsquo;s role involved the administration of a small grants scheme for regional events which they managed on behalf of the Department in partnership with a number of local authorities.  DHR also worked to raise public awareness of the Africa Day events, including through the use of social media and the Africa Day website. This work represented a very minor element of the overall project and was conducted in close cooperation with my Department&rsquo;s communications office.</p><p>In relation to the expenditure on Africa Day, expenses paid to third parties accounted for between 70% and 80% of the total costs listed below. This included expenditure on security, sanitation, venue set-up, health and safety issues and small grants to facilitate the participation of community groups.</p><p>The table following sets out the payments to DHR since July 2014.</p><p><b>Expenditure July 2014 to date</b><table><tr><th>Receipt and Project/Event</th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th></tr><tr><td>DHR Communications &ndash; Simon Cumbers Media Fund</td><td>&euro;32,220</td><td>&euro;15,387</td></tr><tr><td>DHR Communications &ndash; Africa Day</td><td>&euro;39,587</td><td>&euro;143,880</td></tr></table>It is important to note that the variance in Africa Day amounts for 2014 and 2015 is accounted for by the fact that a majority of 2014-related expenditure was incurred prior to my entry into office in July of last year.</p></reply>

Travel and meetings often take place out of hours and away from the officer&rsquo;s headquarters leading to subsistence and/or taxi requirements.  The central aim of the departmental travel policy is to minimise official travel costs and to achieve value for money for expenditure necessarily incurred, consistent with the effective discharge of official duties.</p><p>The Department complies with Department of Public Expenditure and Reform Circulars in relation to subsistence payments, including reimbursement of taxi costs.  The Department is subject to audit by both the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Department&rsquo;s Internal Audit function. </p><p>In September 2014 the Revenue Commissioners commenced an audit of my Department. Prior to this audit, my Department reviewed findings of similar audits of other Government Departments previously undertaken by the Revenue Commissioners.  On that basis, my Department undertook a review of certain expenditure for the period to be audited.  Based on this review, my Department made a voluntary declaration to the Revenue Commissioners in relation to certain taxi costs where it was considered that there was an additional tax liability.  </p><p>The Revenue audit covered the period 1 January 2012 to 31 July 2014.  On the completion of the Revenue audit in November 2014, my Department made a payment of &euro;33,570.12 in respect of taxes, interest and penalties.</p><p>This settlement comprises &euro;22,340.97 in respect of underpaid PAYE; &euro;5,614.36 underpaid Employer PRSI; &euro;2,820.23 interest on late payment and &euro;2,794.56 penalties. Because of the voluntary declaration, the Revenue Commissioners applied a penalty rate of 10%.</p><p>The settlement covers the following areas:</p><p>1. Taxis &euro;26,660.90 - this relates to taxi journeys between officers&rsquo; home and headquarters. In accordance with Departmental policy, officers who come in before 07:00 and leave after 21:00 may use a taxi.  Under tax legislation, travel between home and headquarters gives rise to a Benefit in Kind tax liability.</p><p>2. Interview Boards &euro;2,679.65 - while the Department deducted withholding tax from payments to individual board members, the Revenue Commissioners have advised that these payments should be processed through payroll. This would result in the Department paying Employers PRSI.</p><p>3. Payments to two retired staff taken back to undertake project work &euro;4,229.57 - while the Department deducted withholding tax from payments to these individuals, the Revenue Commissioners have advised that these payments should be processed through payroll.  This would result in the Department paying Employers PRSI.</p><p>As a result of the Revenue Commissioners audit, my Department has introduced new procedures for processing payments to external members on interview boards and retired civil servants returning to work on contract; and to applying tax on official taxis costs taken by officers between headquarters and home in accordance with Revenue regulations.</p></reply>

The conflict in Ukraine was among a number of important foreign policy issues which was discussed. In their summit declaration, G7 leaders expressed full support for the efforts to find a diplomatic solution to the conflict within the framework of the Normandy format and the OSCE Trilateral Contact Group on Ukraine.  They called on all sides to fully implement the ceasefire and withdraw all heavy weapons from the contact line.      On economic sanctions against Russia, the G7 agreed that the duration of existing restrictive measures should be clearly linked to the full implementation of the Minsk agreements. This is foreseen by 31 December 2015 under the terms of the Package of Measures signed by the parties to the conflict on 12 February in Minsk. The G7 also reaffirmed that the sanctions could be strengthened or relaxed depending on developments.   This is consistent with the EU position on economic sanctions against Russia as agreed at the March European Council.  </p></reply>

Each application received by the Passport Service must, therefore, contain relevant evidence that clearly demonstrates that person&rsquo;s entitlement to Irish citizenship before a passport can issue to him/her. The child in question was born in the State in 2013 to parents who are non-EU nationals.  His entitlement to Irish citizenship is, therefore, subject to Section 6A of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, as amended (the Act).<font color="#004080"> </font>This provides that a person, born in the State on or after 1 January 2005, where neither parent is an Irish or British citizen or otherwise entitled to reside in the State or Northern Ireland without restriction at the time of that person&rsquo;s birth, may claim citizenship by birth in the State (and thereby establish eligibility for an Irish passport) only where a parent has been lawfully resident in the State for three years of the four years preceding that<font color="#004080"> </font>person&rsquo;s birth.  It should be noted that periods of authorised residence in the State for study are excluded under the Act for the purposes of section 6A.</p><p>In line with guidelines provided by the Department of Justice and Equality (D/JE), which is responsible for immigration and citizenship, the proofs of lawful residence of a non-EU parent, which are accepted and considered by this Department for the purposes of passport applications are immigration stamps in passports or the registration cards/books, which are given to persons registering with the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB).  </p><p>A passport application for this child was received by the Department on 5 March, 2014.  However, it could not be finalised for passport issue because the duration of his mother&rsquo;s lawful residence was insufficient to demonstrate his entitlement to Irish citizenship under section 6A of the Act. </p><p>This decision was reached on the basis of submitted evidence of the mother&rsquo;s lawful residence, which included the immigration stamps on her passport and her registration card.</p><p>The Department wrote to the applicant&rsquo;s mother on 19 May, 2014 to inform her of this. This included a request for any correspondence, which she may have received from the D/JE that granted her right to reside in the State.  (This letter would have enabled her to subsequently obtain the relevant immigration stamps from GNIB for her passport.) </p><p>This evidence is crucial to the Department&rsquo;s assessment of her child&rsquo;s passport application.  The calculation of residence for the purposes section 6A of the Act is strictly based on the validity period of an immigration stamp and/or registration card.

The ESF will contribute almost &euro;611 million and the Exchequer will contribute &euro;542.43 million.  The Programme is focused on Promoting sustainable and quality employment and supporting labour mobility; Promoting social inclusion, combatting poverty and any discrimination and Investing in education, training and vocational training for skills and lifelong learning. Over a third of the total allocation is focused on the social inclusion and combatting poverty element, which will, in particular, help to support the upskilling of people from disadvantaged groups with a view to enabling them to gain employment and help to reduce poverty.

It is the management authority that employs the school principal, teachers and other staff members. In ETB schools, the ETB is the employer. </p><p>Accordingly, whereas I provide funding and policy direction for schools, neither I nor the Department have legal powers to instruct schools to follow a particular course of direction with regards to individual complaint cases, or to investigate individual complaints except where the complaint involves a refused enrolment, expulsion or suspension, in accordance with Section 29 of the 1998 Education Act.</p><p>In dealing with parental complaints, my Department's role is to clarify for parents how their grievances and complaints against the school can be progressed. Where a parent feels that the school's board of management has failed to investigate or adequately investigate their complaint, they should contact the Ombudsman for Children.</p><p>The Office of the Ombudsman for Children may independently investigate complaints about schools recognised with the Department of Education and Skills, provided the parent has firstly and fully followed the school's complaints procedures.</p><p>Section 28 is the section of the Education Act 1998 that provides for parental complaints in schools. It expresses a desirability of determining appeals and resolving grievances in the school.</p><p>I am not satisfied with the current provisions of Section 28. I plan to revise it and to provide in law for a Parent and Student Charter. Changing how schools engage with, listen and respond to parent concerns will be an important part of a Charter. Providing parents with the rationale for any decision is important. If schools help parents to understand the basis for a decision parents are more likely to accept the fairness of decisions.</p></reply>

It is schools that employ teachers and not my Department. However, my Department has issued a number of Circulars addressing this issue in recent years.</p><p>Under these Circulars School Principals must maintain a list of unemployed registered teachers who are available for substitute work at short notice and report to the Board of Management on any exceptional occasion where they have had to engage a registered teacher who is retired. Circular 31/2011 details a cascade of measures for the recruitment of teachers, prioritising registered teachers over retired registered teachers and unregistered people.</p><p>A retired teacher who returns to teaching on or after 1 February 2012 will commence at the first point of the incremental salary scale (i.e. the lowest point or starting salary for teachers). Incremental credit for service prior to 1 February 2012, qualification allowances and certain job role allowances are also not payable. This measure represents a significant financial disincentive for teachers who retired at the top of their salary scale, often with a post of responsibility allowance, to return to teaching. </p></reply>

The Guidelines provide practical guidance on how post-primary schools can promote mental health and well-being and school connectedness in an integrated way. The Guidelines also provide evidence-based advice on how to support young people who may be at risk of suicidal behaviour.

SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated, and in accordance with the terms of the scheme as set out in my Departments Circular. </p><p>  In circumstances where a parent may have a concern about the manner in which an SNA is being deployed in a school, they should raise this matter with the school Principal/Board of Management of the school in the first instance. </p></reply>

The operation of that scheme is an issue for the Minister for Social Protection.  There are no plans for responsibility for food provision to schools to transfer to my Department. </p><p>  My Department's main responsibility in this area is to equip students with the key skills and knowledge to enable them to make informed and healthier choices in a range of areas, including nutrition.  This is addressed in schools through subjects such as Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE), and Home Economics as well as in PE. </p><p>  Schools are performing strongly in this area. For example, the data from the latest Lifeskills survey, 2012, indicate that almost all primary schools provide information to students on the importance of a balanced diet and on the food pyramid.  The data from the 2015 survey are currently being analysed. </p><p>  My Department is currently finalising guidance for schools about measures to promote healthy lifestyles.  This guidance encompasses measures to promote healthy eating, healthy vending, as well as the promotion of P.E. and Physical Activity.  The guidance has been drafted in consultation with the Department of Health and the HSE.  It will issue in September 2015, to post primary schools initially.  The issue of this guidance will coincide with the publication by the Department of Health of updated guidelines for post primary schools on the development of healthy eating policies. </p><p>  In cooperation with schools my Department is also promoting physical activity in schools through the P.E. curriculum, supporting extra-curricular physical activities, and through initiatives such as the Active Schools Flag. This emphasis on physical activity is an important complement to the measures in place to promote healthy eating among our students.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-06-16a.1726.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1061" speakername="Jan O'Sullivan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015061600106#WRVV00300"><p>The main programme for food provision in primary and post primary schools is the School Meals Scheme.  The operation of that scheme is an issue for the Minister for Social Protection.  My Department's main responsibility in this area is to equip students with the key skills and knowledge to enable them to make informed and healthier choices in a range of areas, including nutrition.  This is addressed in schools through subjects such as Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE), and Home Economics as well as in PE. </p><p>  My Department collates data from schools on a range of issues relating to healthy eating and physical activity through the 'Lifeskills' survey of all primary and post primary schools.  This survey first issued in 2009 and was repeated in 2012.  The findings from the 2012 survey were published by my Department last year and are available on www.education.ie.  The 2015 Lifeskills survey is currently being completed by primary and post primary schools.  It is my intention to publish the results of this survey before the end of 2015.  This will provide a benchmark for schools' performance in this area since 2009 and 2012. </p><p>  One of the specific issues addressed through the Lifeskills survey is whether schools have a healthy eating policy in place.  The data from schools indicated that almost all primary schools and the majority of post primary schools have a healthy eating policy in place or are in the process of developing one.</p><p>  The survey also asks schools whether there is a facility on site, such as a vending machine or school shop, for selling less healthy foods.  The data from the 2012 survey indicated that approximately 30% of post primary schools had a vending machine that contained less healthy alternatives.  There were no such facilities reported in respondent primary schools.  In response to such findings, my Department has finalised guidance for schools about how to further promote healthy lifestyles.  This encompasses measures to promote healthy eating, healthy vending, as well as the promotion of P.E. and Physical Activity.  The guidance has been drafted in consultation with the Department of Health and the HSE.  It will issue in September 2015, to post primary schools initially.  The issue of this guidance will coincide with the publication by the Department of Health of updated guidelines for post primary schools on the development of healthy eating policies.</p></reply>

In that regard, the Department was granted a limited derogation from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform which allowed administrative and maintenance posts in ETB schools to be sanctioned in exceptional circumstances.</p><p>The school to which the Deputy refers is an Education and Training Board (ETB) school.  The Department provides an administrative support staffing allocation to each ETB, and the distribution of this staffing allocation amongst its schools is a matter for the ETB in question.  Accordingly, requests for additional administrative support staff are made to the Department by ETBs, not by individual schools.  In July 2013 the Department received a request from Waterford and Wexford ETB for additional administrative resources, in respect of the school to which the Deputy refers. This request was granted.  The Department has not been contacted by the ETB since that point in time.</p><p>  If the school authorities wish to pursue this matter they should address their concerns to Waterford and Wexford ETB in the first instance.</p></reply>

The GAM/EAL arrangements for the 2015/16 school year are set out in Circular 0005/2015 and are based on a school's mainstream classroom posts for the 2014/15 school year.  Appendix C of that circular lists the allocation for all schools.  Where schools do not have sufficient GAM/EAL hours to create a full-time post, a process is in place for such schools to enter into cluster arrangements with neighbouring schools.  Schools have autonomy on how to deploy the resource between language support and learning support depending on their specific needs. </p></reply>

This application must be considered in the context of the general demographic need in the area.  In this regard, my Department's Forward Planning Section is monitoring the demographic demand in the area and a new primary school was opened in Ballinteer in September 2012.  When fully developed, this school will have capacity for 16 mainstream classrooms.  </p><p>Last April, my Department approved grant aid to the school to which the Deputy refers under the Summer Works Scheme for window replacement.  This is in addition to grant aid of over &euro;635,000 that the Department provided to the school in recent years for additional accommodation, prefab replacement and roof works.  Last December, the school also received a total of &euro;12,141 under the Minor Works Grant Scheme and this scheme facilitates schools in prioritising capital works that they wish to undertake to the school's structure and site.</p></reply>

The criteria by which SNA support is allocated to pupils is set out in my Department's Circular 0030/2014.</p><p>  It is important to note that each school's allocation of SNA support can change from year to year and may be increased or decreased as students who qualify for SNA support enrol or leave a school.  New students with care needs may, or may not, enrol to replace students who have left, for example, or SNA allocations may be decreased where a child's care needs have diminished over time.</p><p>  The deployment of SNAs within schools is then a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated.  It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised.</p><p>  The NCSE invited schools to make applications for SNA support for children who have assessed care needs for the coming 2015/16 school year by 18th March 2015, for their consideration. </p><p>The NCSE are currently considering all of the applications for support which have been received, including those which have been received after the 18th March, and will advise schools of the outcome of their applications ahead of the new school year.</p><p>  All schools have the contact details of their local SENO, while Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.</p></reply>

While recognising the role that denominational schools have played in welcoming children from diverse backgrounds and the continuing role for denominational schools, we have made changes to the patronage system with the model of provision for new schools being reflective of parental demand for the types of schools they want to send their children to.  We are also making progress under the patronage divesting process, with five schools divested to from denominational patronage between 2013 and 2014, and a further four to divest patronage in September 2015.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Programme for Government gives a commitment to move towards a more pluralist system of patronage for our schools.  In this context, the Minister established a Forum on Patronage and Pluralism which, among other issues, made recommendations as to how all primary schools can cater for the diverse range of beliefs and nationalities that are now an intrinsic part of Irish society.  Details of the outcome of the work of the Forum are published on the Department's website. </p><p>  The Programme for Government also contains a commitment that &quot;People of non-faith or minority religious backgrounds and publicly identified LGBT people should not be deterred from training or taking up employment as teachers in the state.&quot;</p><p>  In this regard, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC) designate was asked to undertake a public consultation and examine the issues involved in relation to amending Section 37 of the Employment Equality Acts 1998 - 2011.  The Commission forwarded legal advice it had obtained as well as the options it had considered.  These have been considered by the Attorney General's Office.</p><p>  My colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will bring forward the necessary amendments to the legislation. </p></reply>

These were issues that were central to the recommendations made in the Moriarty Tribunal Report which was published in March 2011.  The Tribunal recommended that the income of political parties be disclosed and that political donations, apart from those under a modest threshold, be reported. </p>  <p>  The 2012 Act brought into force restrictions on corporate donations and considerable reductions in the maximum amount that a political party or an individual can accept as a political donation.  The donation limit for a political party was reduced from &euro;6,348.69 to &euro;2,500, while for an individual politician or candidate it fell from &euro;2,539.48 to &euro;1,000.  A limit of &euro;200 was placed on donations in cash.  The threshold for the receipt of anonymous donations was reduced to &euro;100.  The donation threshold amount that gives rise to the requirement to open a political donations account was reduced to &euro;100.  Anonymous indirect donations were banned.  The threshold at which political party donations must be reported and published was reduced from &euro;5,078.95 to &euro;1,500.</p>  <p>  The 2012 Act provides that political parties are required to submit audited annual accounts to the Standards in Public Office Commission (SIPO) for publication.  In line with SIPO guidelines, which came into effect on 1 January 2015, the first set of accounts required to be audited will be in respect of 2015 and must be submitted to SIPO by mid 2016.  This requirement goes beyond the Moriarty Tribunal recommendation by providing that both the income and expenditure of political parties will be reported and open to public scrutiny.  By restricting corporate donations, the Act also went beyond the recommendations made by the Tribunal.</p>  <p>  Work on preparing a draft general scheme for the Electoral (Amendment) (Political Funding) Bill had commenced before the publication of the Moriarty Tribunal Report in March 2011.  No specific meetings were held in relation to the recommendations in the Moriarty Report; however, account was taken of the recommendations as part of the ongoing work in developing the Bill, prior to its enactment in 2012. </p></reply>

This policy provided for charges based on actual metered consumption and is consistent with the requirements of the Water Framework Directive.  The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides for the transfer of responsibility for the delivery of water services from the local authorities to Irish Water and, with effect from 1 January 2014, Irish Water is responsible for the provision of public water services, including responsibility for the charging of non-domestic customers.  The Act   provides that Irish Water shall charge each customer for the provision of services provided by it.  The Act also provides that responsibility for the independent economic regulation of the water sector is assigned to the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and the CER has been given statutory responsibility for protecting the interests of customers.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that the existing arrangements for all non-domestic customers are remaining in place with no changes for the time being.  On this basis, the local authorities will continue to bill for non-domestic water services as agents of Irish Water.</p>  <p>  The CER has outlined, in its Water Charges Plan Decision Paper of 5 March 2015, the areas that it will be progressing in 2015, which includes the development of the work programme for an enduring Non-Domestic Tariff Framework.  Later this year, the CER will publish a detailed work plan in relation to non-domestic charges and will consult widely as part of that plan. </p></reply>

An assessment of Ireland&rsquo;s progress towards achieving its emissions reduction targets under the Effort-Sharing Decision is set out in <i>Ireland&rsquo;s Greenhouse Gas Emission Projections 2014 &ndash; 2035</i>, published by the Environmental Protection Agency in May 2015.  Furthermore, in October 2014, the European Council endorsed a binding EU target of an at least 40% domestic reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to 1990 levels and specified that the target will be delivered collectively by the EU in the most cost-effective manner possible, with the reductions in the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) and the non-ETS sector amounting to 43% and 30% by 2030 compared to 2005, respectively.  While the specific details of each Member State&rsquo;s contribution towards these targets have yet to be determined, the Council agreed that all Member States will participate in this effort, balancing considerations of fairness and solidarity. </p><p>The extent of the challenge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, in line with our EU and international commitments, is well understood by Government, as reflected in the <i>National Policy Position on Climate Action and Low-Carbon Development</i>, published in April 2014, and in the <i>Climate Action and Low-Carbon Development Bill 2015</i>, published in January 2015.  The National Policy Position provides a high-level policy direction for the adoption and implementation by Government of plans to enable the State to move to a low-carbon economy by 2050.  Proposed statutory authority for the plans is set out in the <i>Climate Action and Low-Carbon Development Bill 2015</i>. </p><p>In anticipation of enactment of the planned legislation, work is already underway on developing a low-carbon plan - the National Mitigation Plan, the primary objective of which will be to track implementation of measures already underway and identify additional measures within the longer term to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and progress the overall national low car bon transition agenda to 2050.  Last week, I launched a six week consultation on the development of the National Mitigation Plan and I look forward to receiving input from all interested parties on how we might address the specific challenges ahead and harness the opportunities that arise as Ireland moves towards a low-carbon sustainable economic future.  To stimulate discussion on the matter, a background paper outlining the development of the National Mitigation Plan to date, and the planned process for its further development, has been prepared and is available at the following link:</p></reply>

A range of measures are being taken to support increased housing delivery.  In particular, the Urban Regeneration and Housing Bill 2015 , which was published on 5 June, is primarily focused on addressing housing supply-related issues with a view to facilitating increased activity in the housing construction sector.  The Bill provides for changes in development contributions, amendments to the Part V provisions of the Planning and Development Acts to support the provision of social housing, as well as the introduction of a vacant site levy. Having regard to the definition of &ldquo;vacant site&rdquo; in the Bill as published, it is proposed that the levy will be applied from 1 January 2019 onwards to vacant sites exceeding 0.1 hectares in area which are located in designated areas identified by a planning authority in its development plan or local area plan for residential or regeneration development.  The levy will not be applied to sites which include any structure or dwelling that is a person&rsquo;s ordinary place of residence. It is intended that the Bill will complete its passage through both Houses of the Oireachtas by the Summer recess.</p><p>Since the publication of <i>Construction 2020</i>, there are already some welcome and positive signs of recovery in the sector.  Particularly notable in this regard is the increase in the number of house completions in 2014 to 11,016 units nationally &ndash; an increase of 33% on the 2013 figure.  In Quarter 1 2015, some 2,629 units have been completed, an increase of 26% on the same period in 2014.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, Article 43 of the Constitution provides that the State will vindicate the private property rights of every citizen to own, transfer, bequeath and inherit property.  The State further guarantees to pass no law to abolish these rights.  While Article 43 also declares that the State may pass laws de- limiting the exercise of such private property rights in the interests and exigencies of the common good, ultimately it is a matter for the Courts to adjudicate on individual cases where a dispute has arisen between parties with regard to private residential properties.</p></reply>

Given the links between these unlawful activities to organised criminality, the Irish Revenue Commissioners are fully supported in this area by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>Fuel laundering continues to be a serious concern for authorities in both Ireland and Northern Ireland.  Recognising this shared concern a Cross Border Fuel Fraud Enforcement Group, comprising representatives from the Police Service of Northern Ireland, HM Revenue Customs, the UK National Crime Agency, the Revenue Commissioners, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Irish Criminal Assets Bureau has been established to target these activities on an all island basis.  Arising from the work of this Task Force, a number of groups involved in the laundering and distribution of illegal fuels, operating in both jurisdictions, have been identified and are being specifically targeted for investigation by all law enforcement agencies concerned. </p><p>My Department assists local authorities in carrying out their role as competent authorities under waste legislation, which is to take the necessary measures, on behalf of the State ,to ensure that any waste generated and left abandoned by the diesel launderers is disposed of without endangering human or animal health and without harming the environment, in particular without risk to water. </p><p>Approximately 1,400 incidents of diesel laundering waste dumping have been dealt with by local authorities to date and my Department has financed the substantial costs associated with such disposal.  The overwhelming majority of the clean-up operations have taken place in counties along the Northern Ireland Border.  In 2015 to date, some 113 tonnes of laundering waste has been managed by Monaghan County Council and a further 156 tonnes by Louth County Council.  The approximate cost of the disposal of recovered laundering waste inclusive of transport is &euro;500 per tonne so approximately &euro;135,000 has been incurred in dealing with this waste since the start of the year. </p><p>Given the possible origin of the laundered waste material from Northern Ireland there is a clear need to ensure that efforts to tackle the issue and support remediation measures have full cross border support.  To drive this agenda I have previously written to my counterpart in the Northern Ireland Executive, Minister Mark Durkan, to highlight the problem and I have also raised the issue directly with EU Environment Commissioner Vella and have requested the Commission&rsquo;s support in this area, in particular in the context of the North-South dimension. </p><p>The matter was also raised at the meeting of the North South Ministerial Council in May, which was attended by my colleague Deputy Ann Phelan, in her capacity as Minister of State at my Department.  On foot of these discussions it was agreed that<b></b>both Department&rsquo;s would provide a full update on the extent of the diesel laundering problem, any cross Border initiatives which can be taken to mitigate against the proliferation of this practice and the measures which can be taken to protect the environment and human health at the next Council meeting.</p></reply>

Rathmines Pembroke Community Partnership was unsuccessful in its tender to deliver the SICAP in the Canal/Rathmines/Pembroke Lot area, and I am advised that as a result the company is no longer in a position to continue managing the project referred to.  As SICAP will be overseen and managed by the new Local Community Development Committees (LCDCs) in each Local Authority area, the configuration of delivery bodies/delivery arrangements for the Dublin City area for local and community programmes is a matter for the LCDC of Dublin City Council to consider in consultation with the relevant stakeholders, commensurate with service needs.

The HAP scheme will bring all social housing supports provided by the State under the aegis of local authorities.  The scheme will remove a barrier to employment by allowing recipients to remain in the scheme if they gain full-time employment.  HAP will also improve regulation of the rented accommodation being supported and provide certainty for landlords as regards their rental income.  Further to the enactment of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014 on 28 July 2014, the first phase of the HAP statutory pilot commenced with effect from 15 September 2014 in Limerick City and County Council, Waterford City and County Council and Cork County Council. HAP commenced in Louth, Kilkenny, South Dublin and Monaghan County Councils from 1 October 2014.  Subsequently, on 18 December 2014, Dublin City Council became part of the statutory HAP pilot, with a specific focus on accommodating homeless households.  Dublin City Council is implementing the HAP pilot for homeless households in the Dublin region on behalf of all 4 Dublin local authorities. </p><p>During the legislation&rsquo;s passage through the Oireachtas in July 2014 an undertaking was given that a progress report would be prepared for the relevant Oireachtas Committee.  I can confirm that data from the pilot sites has been gathered and I submitted a report to the Oireachtas Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht at the end of April 2015.  Based on the findings of that review, the second phase of the HAP statutory pilot has recently commenced with the HAP scheme becoming operational in Donegal County Council on 25 May 2015 and in Offaly County Council on the 15 June, 2015.  HAP will become operational in Carlow, Clare and Tipperary  County Councils and Cork City Council from 29 June 2015 . </p><p>While there are currently no plans to include Longford and Westmeath County Councils in this phase of the pilot, the <i>Social Housing Strategy 2020 </i>sets ambitious targets for the roll-out of HAP across all local authorities.  Specifically, the Strategy requires that all eligible households that require HAP will transition to the new scheme between 2014 and 2020.  As such, both of these local authorities will be included in further phases of the roll-out of HAP. </p></reply>

However, I am conscious that concerns have been raised in relation to the costs imposed by the (S.I .

As Minister, I have a responsibility to ensure that the cost of compliance with regulations is fair, reasonable and proportionate and I have already publicly indicated my willingness to consider and take whatever steps are reasonable and appropriate should this prove not to be the case.  </p><p>The key impact on costs associated with the S.I. No. 9 of 2014 lies in the requirement for the appointment of an Assigned Certifier whose role, in conjunction with the builder and the project team, is to draw up and execute an appropriate inspection plan and to certify the building on completion.  While fees for professional services are determined by market forces and are therefore outside the scope of my regulatory powers, my Department has prepared a which has been subject to a recent public consultation exercise undertaken as part of a general review of S.I.

Under the European Union (Drinking Water) Regulations 2014, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas library, suppliers of drinking water are required to ensure that the water supplied complies with the chemical and microbiological parameters set out in the Regulations.  The maximum allowable value for lead is 10 microgrammes per litre, which came into effect on 25 December 2013. </p>  <p>  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is the supervisory authority with responsibility for monitoring Irish Water&rsquo;s compliance with the Drinking Water Regulations.  In the event of non-compliance with the quality standards set out in the Regulations, the water supplier is required to investigate the cause in consultation with the EPA and, if a potential risk to human health exists, with the Health Service Executive (HSE), to ensure that the appropriate remedial actions are taken, including the issue of notifications to consumers affected or restriction of the supply.  A case by case approach will be considered by Irish Water, in line with its statutory responsibilities and in recognition of the statutory responsibilities of the HSE and the EPA.</p>  <p>  Irish Water has informed my Department that, having over recent months replaced the approximate 2 kilometres of water-mains which contained lead, no part of its estimated 60,000 kilometres of distribution system now contains lead.  As part of its metering programme, Irish Water has identified significant numbers of lead service connections between the public mains and the customer stopcock and water meter.  Irish Water is committed to replacing these over time.  The data being collected by Irish Water is being provided to the HSE for assessment and a rolling programme of advising relevant customers who are at risk of having lead pipework has commenced.  If a property owner replaces the lead pipework on their property, Irish Water will also replace the pipework between the watermain and the property boundary. </p>  <p>  The Water Services Act 2007 provides that the owner of a premises is responsible for the maintenance and renewal of the internal water distribution system. Responsibility for replacing lead pipes from the property boundary to the house and within the house therefore rests with the homeowner.  In a joint position paper on lead published by the EPA and HSE in 2013, it is recommended that all lead pipes and plumbing in public and private ownership should be replaced over time. </p>  <p>  Last week I announced a National Strategy to reduce exposure to lead in drinking water which has been approved by the Government.  The Strategy was prepared by my Department and the Department of Health in consultation with Irish Water, the HSE and the EPA.  As part of the Strategy I will be establishing a new grant scheme to assist low income households to replace lead pipes in their home.  Funding for the scheme will be finalised in the context of Budget 2016.  It is envisaged that the grant scheme will be administered by local authorities and that the available resources will be prioritised to areas of highest risk.  The terms and conditions of the scheme will be publicised as soon as they are finalised.</p></reply>

The Act further provides that where the owner or occupier of a derelict site does not carry out the works as required by the local authority , the local authority has the power to carry out the works and recover any costs incurred from the owners or occupiers of the site.  Section 23 of the Act provides that where a levy is being applied, the rate of levy shall be three per cent of the market value of the site as determined by the local authority.

Under stage one of the selection process for the new programme, any entity who wished to be considered as a Local Action Group was invited to submit an expression of interest.  For the purposes of the new programme, there are 28 sub-regional areas in Ireland and 45 separate expressions of interest were received.  A single expression of interest has been received in 17 of the 28 areas and at least 2 expressions of interest have been received in the remaining 11 areas.  In areas where multiple expressions of interest were received, my Department has given an undertaking to facilitate discussions between the relevant entities with a view to engaging all parties and if possible to reach an agreement to develop one coherent local development strategy for their area.  In this regard, my Department commenced meetings recently with a range of entities and these will continue over the coming period.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, I expect that all the expressions of interest will be presented to an Independent Evaluation Committee for assessment and decision by late June.

The Groups will then be provided with a minimum of 6 months to develop their strategies but I expect some strategies to be submitted much earlier than this.</p>  <p>  The Independent Evaluation Committee will also assess and make the final decisions with regard to the quality of the local development strategies.  In areas where a single strategy is submitted, the Committee in question will review and evaluate these strategies with a view to ensuring that the strategies meet the required standard.  In areas where entities do not come to an agreement and multiple strategies are submitted, it will be a matter for the Evaluation Committee to a make a decision on which local development strategy best meets the needs of the community.

The haulage industry is seeking a reduction in motor tax for the sector, a change in the basis of taxation from unladen to gross design vehicle weight and the introduction of road user charging.  In relation to the latter two proposals, these are currently being considered and implementation, if recommended, would be for the medium to long-term.  In relation to the first proposal, any changes to rates of motor tax are for consideration in the context of the budget.  Motor tax is payable on a 3, 6 or twelve month basis.  In respect of periods of non-use of a vehicle, the Non-Use of Motor Vehicles Act 2013 provides that, where a vehicle is not going to be used in a public place, the vehicle may be declared off the road during the last month of an extant tax disc or previously made declaration of non-use, for a period of between 3 and 12 months.  The Act also provides that an owner can return the vehicle to the road early if circumstances, such as a pick-up in business, require it, by applying for a vehicle licence for the vehicle.  The vehicle licence will commence from the month in which the application to tax the vehicle is made and the end date of the Declaration of Non- Use will be changed to the end of the month before the vehicle licence commences.</p>  <p>  The Diesel Rebate Scheme is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Finance.</p></reply>

Additional travel associated with Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the EU in 2013 and preparation for it in 2012 would account for increased subsistence and taxi expenditure in those years.

The scheme is administered by local community and voluntary groups with the support of my Department.</p><p>My Department undertook to consider new approaches to the Seniors Alert Scheme in 2014 and arising from this, it was decided that the scheme be managed by Pobal, given that organisation&rsquo;s significant experience delivering programmes on behalf of Government.</p><p>Pobal&rsquo;s management and administrative services for the Scheme included an invitation to tender for the supply and installation of personal monitored alarms, which was publicly advertised on eTenders on 20 October 2014.  The tender process, which is being led by Pobal, is almost complete.  Following on from this, a panel of regional suppliers will be contracted to provide the equipment within specific regional areas.  The tender was broken down into 10 regional lots to ensure that SME&rsquo;s were not disadvantaged due to excessively large lot sizes.</p><p>It should be noted that there are no legal mandatory standards required for the manufacture of personal alarms.  Many of the existing units comply with the EU standard; newer manufacturers of equipment or the newer more innovative technologies may meet other quality standards e.g. ISO standard.  Under the tender competition, those suppliers that meet the minimum requirement would score the minimum amount of marks available and suppliers that propose products over and above the minimum requirements would be awarded a higher score.</p><p>A monitoring services panel was also advertised via eTenders on 6 November 2014.This process will engage a panel of quality checked monitoring suppliers who will outline the costs they charge and the service they provide.  This information will be provided to the community groups and individuals to ensure they can make the best choice in relation to the<font color="#1F497D">ir</font>monitoring services supplier.</p><p>The use of this panel is voluntary; monitoring costs are not grant-aided and have always been the responsibility of the beneficiary.  The older person will continue to be responsible for choosing the monitoring supplier of their choice and they are free to continue to use their current provider.  Annual monitoring costs (generally between &euro;60 - &euro;80 per annum) are borne by the beneficiary.  The contract for monitoring services is a matter between the beneficiary and the monitoring service provider; my Department has no role in the matter.</p><p>Under the current Scheme the maximum grant per beneficiary for equipment is as follows: monitored personal alarms (with pendant) - &euro;250; additional pendant/Re-installation - &euro;50; the transfer of the operation of the scheme to Pobal is scheduled for completion by end July 2015; the strategic policy direction of the Scheme will remain my Department&rsquo;s responsibility.  In the meantime, community and voluntary groups wishing to draw down grant support under the Seniors Alert Scheme should continue to apply to my Department in the usual way.</p></reply>

Applications for a new round of funding, which commenced on 1 July 2014, were subject to an appraisal process. 55 applications were approved for funding for the two-year period from 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2016. A number of previously funded organisations were not approved for funding on this occasion.

Over the past number of years, my Department has continued to meet its existing contractual commitments on RAPID projects throughout the country. There is now just one remaining measure under the RAPID programme, which accounts for unpaid commitments, namely the sports capital top-ups. In 2015, I allocated funding of &euro;500,000 for sports capital projects under the programme and these are being jointly funded with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport. Drawdown to date has been &euro;52,000 with further drawdowns anticipated over the remainder of the year.</p><p>The RAPID programme has made substantial progress in identifying the needs of disadvantaged communities and in bringing forward important local projects in response to those needs.</p><p>The following table shows the funding allocated to RAPID since 2010 by my Department.<table><tr><th>Year </th><th><div>DECLG RAPID Exchequer Funding &euro;000s </div></th></tr><tr><td>2010 </td><td><div>&euro;6,067 </div></td></tr><tr><td>2011 </td><td><div>&euro;2,269 </div></td></tr><tr><td>2012 </td><td><div>&euro;3,077 </div></td></tr><tr><td>2013 </td><td><div>&euro;261 </div></td></tr><tr><td>2014 </td><td><div>&euro;170 </div></td></tr><tr><td>2015 allocation </td><td><div>&euro;500 </div></td></tr></table>While not Exchequer funding, my Department has also provided funding to RAPID areas from Dormant Accounts. Disbursements on dormant accounts measures are paid in the first instance &ldquo;up front&rdquo; from the Department&rsquo;s Vote in the same way as with any other spending programme. Therefore, Government Departments have to source funding for dormant accounts programmes from their Exchequer allocation. The difference with dormant accounts expenditure compared with other funding programmes is that once expenditure takes place, either on administration of the measure, or by the project itself, it is reimbursed to the Exchequer from the Dormant Accounts Fund in accordance with the Dormant Accounts Acts, in the form of Appropriations-in-Aid payable through the relevant Department&rsquo;s Vote.  In this way, the costs associated with dormant accounts measures are Exchequer neutral, though it should be noted that Government Departments cannot spend Appropriations-in-Aid directly themselves once they are reimbursed from the Fund.  There are instead refunded to the central Exchequer.</p><p>The following table shows the detail of Dormant Accounts funding provided for projects in RAPID areas since 2010 through the Vote of my Department.<table><tr><th>Year </th><th><div>DECLG RAPID Dormant Accounts Funding &euro;000s </div></th></tr><tr><td>2010 </td><td><div>&euro;4,820 </div></td></tr><tr><td>2011 </td><td><div>&euro;1,125 </div></td></tr><tr><td>2012 </td><td><div>&euro;721 </div></td></tr><tr><td>2013 </td><td><div>&euro;141 </div></td></tr><tr><td>2014 </td><td><div>&euro;57 </div></td></tr><tr><td>2015 to 31 May </td><td><div>&euro;5 </div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

The Report contained 34 recommendations focussed on supporting the medium term economic development of rural areas in the period to 2025. On my appointment as Minister for Rural Affairs in July 2014, and in line with the recommendations in the CEDRA report, I immediately established the CEDRA Interdepartmental Group (IDG).  The IDG, which is made up of representatives from all relevant Government Departments, is currently working in a coordinated way to ensure that each Department&rsquo;s policy development and implementation fully consider the needs of rural communities. In this context, it is about maximising the financial resources already available for rural development and ensuring that these resources are directed in a way that best supports the sustainable economic development of rural areas.</p>  <p>  The CEDRA IDG has met four times to date and a further meeting of the group is planned for July 2015. In between these meetings officials who sit on the group continue to work to examine ways in which their respective areas can improve consideration for rural development in their policy design and implementation processes. Significant progress has already been made in terms of implementing the recommendations of the CEDRA Report and this will continue through the work of the IDG over the coming period.</p>  <p>  Funding of &euro;1 million has been provided in the 2015 Vote of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine for pilot innovative projects which progress the CEDRA remit. A strong framework work programme for this fund has been developed and will be progressed for the remainder of this year. It is envisaged that the proposed work programme will include pilot schemes on female entrepreneurs, social farming, village regeneration based on food markets and agri-tourism.</p>  <p>  Specifically a tender issued last week for the development and implementation of a pilot programme to develop the entrepreneurial skills of nascent female entrepreneurs living in rural areas. Further proposals are being developed, which will enhance existing social farming operations and small towns-villages regeneration. In addition, plans are being formulated for a further pilot competitive call around agri-tourism projects with a particular emphasis on food and beverages, which could be partially funded from this CEDRA allocation. Details on the latter proposal will be finalised shortly.</p>  <p>  In order to maintain strong links with people in rural Ireland who are involved in or have a strong interest in the economic development of rural areas and communities, both Minister Kelly and I have also established an Expert Advisory Group to monitor progress and provide advice in respect of the implementation of the recommendations in the CEDRA report. This group is chaired by Mr. Pat Spillane. The group has met twice so far and another meeting is scheduled for 30 June.</p></reply>

The regime is designed in the 2014 legislation to give the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources the responsibility for assessing proposed media mergers, and to empower the Minister to block any merger that is deemed likely to be contrary to the public interest in maintaining the plurality of media in the State.  No provision was made in that legislation to allow a Minister open a case against a media business of their own volition in the absence of a proposed merger. This would be a substantially different matter to dealing with mergers, and would in effect mean empowering a Government Minister to determine the fate of media businesses, to order the breakup of any media organisation at any given time, albeit within the confines of the law.</p>  <p>  I believe such legislation would raise a number of difficult questions about preserving the freedom and independence of the media, in addition to the legal and constitutional complexities associated with retrospective action of this kind.</p>  <p>  Ireland enjoys an exemplary record with regard to the freedom of the media. Protecting this freedom and ensuring the public interest in maintaining the plurality of media in the State is achieved are our most important aims in this area. I believe the reforms introduced by the Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014 strike an appropriate balance.</p></reply>

It also supports the development of renewable electricity which is important for both security of supply and for reducing carbon emissions from electricity generation. The levy is designed to compensate electricity suppliers for the additional costs they incur by purchasing electricity generated by these producers. It has been in place since 2001.  The legal basis for the PSO levy and its method of calculation are set out in Regulations made under the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999 (S.I. 217 of 2002). The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) determines the PSO levy which is a charge on all electricity customers without exception.</p>  <p>  While I fully understand and appreciate concerns about the cost of the PSO levy to all customers, including sports clubs and charities, the development of renewable energy in Ireland, supported by the renewable energy part of the PSO, will enable Ireland to reduce its fossil fuel dependency and vulnerability to rises in fossil fuel prices. The PSO levy is also vital to enable Ireland to meet its 40% target for electricity generated from renewable sources by 2020, which in turn is important for the achievement of Ireland's 16% EU 2020 target for renewable energy.</p>  <p>  The PSO levy has been relatively high in recent years due to lower wholesale electricity prices. This results in lower predicted market income for the PSO plants and, therefore, a higher levy is required to cover their allowed costs. The lower wholesale electricity price is being driven by lower international gas prices which in turn drives up the PSO levy. However, lower gas and wholesale prices also reduce the wholesale cost of electricity that suppliers pay. In turn, suppliers are in a position to reduce their retail prices and potentially offset the PSO levy increase. Increased competition in the retail electricity market has led to a number of suppliers reducing their retail prices of late and I welcome these developments. The CER is tasked with retail market monitoring and executes this role vigorously to ensure competition leads to the fairest prices for customers.</p></reply>

The National Broadband Plan is delivering high speed telecommunications access to every home and business in Ireland regardless of its location through a combination of commercial investments and a partnership between Government and telecommunications companies to ensure the required high speed capable infrastructure is accessible at all premises.</p><p>The commercial telecommunications sector is currently investing approximately &euro;2.5 billion in network infrastructure upgrades and enhanced services with approximately 1.6 million of the 2.3 million addresses in Ireland expected to have access to commercial high speed broadband services over the next 18 months. Services are already available to approximately 1.2 million addresses. These very significant investments represent a step-change in the quality of broadband services available.</p><p>Last November I published a national high speed coverage map for 2016. This map is available at . The map shows Ireland with two colours, BLUE and AMBER. The areas marked BLUE represent those areas that will have access to commercial high speed broadband services over infrastructure installed on a commercial basis by end 2016. All premises within the Amber area will be included in the State's intervention to make the required infrastructure available to provide high speed services in other areas.</p><p>I anticipate that the first homes and businesses will be connected in 2016 and connections will continue thereafter, with the intention of having accessible infrastructure available at all premises within a five year period.</p><p>In relation to energy infrastructure, in July 2012 my predecessor published an Energy infrastructure policy statement in which the Government reaffirmed the imperative need for development and renewal of our energy networks, in order to meet both economic and social policy goals. The statement was particularly important as it required local government planning authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la to have regard to it thereafter. An additional key element of the strategy was that it affirmed the major investment underway in the high voltage electricity transmission system under EirGrid&rsquo;s Grid 25 Programme was the most important such investment in Ireland&rsquo;s transmission system for several generations. The Grid 25 Strategy is designed to put in place a safe, secure and affordable electricity supply throughout Ireland and to help Ireland to achieve its 2020 renewable energy targets. Grid 25 has been reviewed in 2011 and again last year, each taking account of changing technical and economic circumstances. The outcome of the 2014 review was published in March this year in the form of a draft grid development strategy. It states that Ireland&rsquo;s energy transmission needs can be met with reduced new infrastructure build because of new technological developments and updated projections of future electricity demand.</p><p>The 2009 EU Renewable Energy Directive set Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our energy requirements from renewable sources by 2020. In order to meet this target, Ireland is committed to meeting 40% of electricity demand from renewable sources, 12% renewables in the heating sector and 10% in transport. Ireland has made good progress with regard to renewable energy deployment. To date, wind energy has been the largest driver of growth in renewable electricity. Provisional figures provided by the SEAI for 2014 show that 8.6% of Ireland's overall energy requirement was met by renewable energy. In addition, SEAI has calculated that 22.6% of electricity, 6.7% of heat and 5.2% of transport were met from renewable sources.</p></reply>

The re-use of existing infrastructure like poles, ducts, sites and masts, will minimise the cost of the State intervention by avoiding unnecessary new build. It is also consistent with the Broadband State Aid Guidelines and the EU&rsquo;s recent Broadband Cost Reduction Directive (2014/61/CE).</p>  <p>  Therefore, my Department is compiling a register of owners of existing infrastructure that could be used to support the NBP network roll-out, and publishing it on our website.</p>  <p>  The purpose of this register is to provide potential bidders with information on infrastructure which could be used as part of their bid. The register enables bidders to clearly see the type and general location of existing infrastructure which could be re-used but is not designed to be a detailed database of infrastructure. Rather it is a mechanism to facilitate engagement between bidders and infrastructure owners. If bidders are interested in seeking further information on infrastructure owners assets, in terms of exact location, pricing, terms and conditions etc, then they can make contact and seek further information directly with the owners concerned. This may also be relevant in the case of assets that are not within the National Broadband Plan intervention area, but could nevertheless be beneficial to the roll-out of other telecommunication services and services in areas that are being served commercially.</p>  <p>  In terms of including state assets, My Department carried out a series of bilateral meetings with semi-State and public sector organisations, the purpose of which was to maximise participation in the register and to discuss the practical arrangements for compiling it. In addition, my Department also met with a number of commercial companies with relevant telecoms infrastructure in rural areas and issued a direct invitation to over 50 companies to register their infrastructure on the register. This, together with advertisements placed in national newspapers on the 14 April last, ensured that the widest audience of asset owners was reached and encouraged to submit their details to the register.</p>  <p>  On 15th May, my Department published the register with details of those owners of infrastructure, as notified to us. To date, 21 owners have registered their details with my Department but the register remains open to any interested party should they wish to have their details included. Indeed, since publication, my Department has received further details for inclusion.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to engage with various organisations to ensure the maximum level of infrastructure re-use as the sharing of existing telecommunications infrastructure is considered a key enabler in reducing the overall cost of the project and in ensuring value for money to the State.</p></reply>

A Smart Grid Working Group comprising representation from my Department, Eirgrid, the ESB, the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and the development agencies has drawn up a Smart Grid Roadmap setting out how a smart grid can contribute to increasing the amount of renewable energy on the electricity system, improving our security of energy supply and meeting Ireland&rsquo;s emissions reductions targets.</p>  <p>  As a component of this, the planned national roll-out of smart meters, led by the CER, will enable electricity customers to manage their own consumption of electricity better.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, EirGrid continues through its Grid 25 strategy and its "DS3" programme (Delivering a Secure, Sustainable Electricity System) to develop and operate the electricity network to meet the challenges of the deployment of increasing levels of renewable generation in order to maintain high quality, secure and competitive power supplies in line with best international practice, for the benefit of all electricity consumers.</p>  <p>  Separately, analysis of the potential of microgeneration technologies has been carried out by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI).

This will be achieved through a combination of commercial investments and a State led intervention in areas where commercial services will not be provided.  The commercial telecommunications sector is currently investing approximately &euro;2.5 billion in network upgrades and enhanced services with approximately 1.6 million of the 2.3 million premises in Ireland expected to have access to commercial high speed broadband services over the next 18 months. These very significant investments represent a step-change in the quality of broadband services available.</p><p>Last November I published a national high speed coverage map for 2016. This map is available at . The map allows all members of the public, be they business or residential, to see whether their premises or home will have access to commercial high speed broadband services by end 2016 or whether they will be included in the Government's proposed intervention. It also provides detailed information on over 50,000 townlands throughout the entire country including Co Cork.</p><p>The areas marked BLUE represent those areas that will have access to commercial high speed broadband services by end 2016 and includes Sallybrook in the townland of Knocknahorgan, Co Cork.</p><p>The AMBER area shows the target areas for the State intervention. All premises within the AMBER areas will be included in the State's intervention.</p><p>eircom recently announced an investment that may address a further 300,000 premises with fibre-to-the-premises technology. My Department will be rigorously examining the assurances from eircom in relation to these new plans, which is a requirement for all operators, and will review how this impacts the proposed intervention area.</p><p>More generally I can confirm that next generation broadband services have been rolled out to 126,118 addresses to date in Co Cork with a further 55,664 expected to be served over the next 18 months. The remaining 85,972 addresses in Co Cork will be covered by commercial investment or be the target for the proposed State intervention under the National Broadband Plan.</p><p>Intensive design and planning work is under way in my Department to produce a detailed intervention strategy for the AMBER area.

Issues around climate change are primarily a matter for my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  As regards energy, it is acknowledged that fossil fuels will remain part of the energy mix as Europe transitions to a decarbonised energy system by 2050. However, significant progress is being made in increasing the share of renewables in that mix. The 2009 EU Renewable Energy Directive set Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our energy requirements from renewable sources by 2020 and in order to meet this target, Ireland is committed to meeting 40% of electricity demand from renewable sources, 12% renewables in the heating sector and 10% in transport.  Ireland has made good progress with regard to renewable energy deployment. To date, wind energy has been the largest driver of growth in renewable electricity. Provisional figures provided by the SEAI for 2014 show that 8.6% of Ireland's overall energy requirement was met by renewable energy. In addition, SEAI has calculated that 22.6% of electricity, 6.7% of heat and 5.2% of transport were met from renewable sources.</p>  <p>  With regard to 2030, at the October 2014 meeting of the European Council, agreement was reached on the headline targets for the 2030 Climate and Energy Framework, requiring a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of 40%, an increase in EU energy from renewable sources to 27%, and an indicative target of 27% energy efficiency. Ireland will make a contribution to the achievement of these targets that is technically feasible, cost effective and fair in terms of burden sharing across Member States.</p></reply>

The remaining vacancies will be filled in accordance with the relevant statutory provisions and the Guidelines on Appointments to State Boards which were approved by Government last November.</p><p>The following table sets out the position in relation to the appointments and current vacancies on those State Boards under the aegis of my Department. <table><tr><th>Board</th><th>No. of Board positions</th><th>Number of appointments (March 2011 to date)</th><th>Number of current vacancies</th></tr><tr><td>An Post</td><td>15</td><td>14</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><td>RTE</td><td>12</td><td>12</td><td>Nil </td></tr><tr><td>Broadcasting Authority of Ireland</td><td>9</td><td>10</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><td>Bord na M&oacute;na</td><td>12</td><td>14</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><td>Ervia</td><td>9</td><td>12</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Eirgrid</td><td>10</td><td>9</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>ESB</td><td>12</td><td>10</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Irish National Petroleum Corporation (INPC)</td><td>3</td><td>11</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><td>National Oil Reserves Agency</td><td>6</td><td>6</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI)</td><td>12</td><td>24</td><td>1[1]</td></tr><tr><td>TG4</td><td>12</td><td>8</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>DHDA</td><td>14</td><td>13</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>Ordnance Survey of Ireland</td><td>10</td><td>11</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><td>Mining Board</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Inland Fisheries Ireland</td><td>9</td><td>5</td><td>Nil</td></tr></table>[1]A nomination has been made by the Minister in relation to the vacancy on the Board of SEAI although this is subject to confirmation pending the nominee&rsquo;s appearance before the Joint Oireachtas Committee.</p></reply>

This will be achieved through a combination of commercial investments and a State led intervention in areas where commercial services will not be provided.</p><p>The commercial telecommunications sector is currently investing approximately &euro;2.5 billion in network upgrades and enhanced services with approximately 1.6 million of the 2.3 million premises in Ireland expected to have access to commercial high speed broadband services over the next 18 months. These very significant investments represent a step-change in the quality of broadband services available.</p><p>Last November I published a national high speed coverage map for 2016. This map is available at . The areas marked BLUE represent those areas that will have access to commercial high speed broadband services by end 2016.</p><p>The AMBER areas show the target areas for the State intervention.

Energy efficiency has a central role to play in meeting this objective. Improving the efficiency with which we use energy is already delivering real environmental, social and economic benefits for Ireland. This is why energy efficiency will be a key element of the Energy White Paper which I will publish in October. The Energy White Paper will set out the strategy for Ireland's sustainable energy transition.    Achieving this transition requires us to meet the challenge of significantly reducing our harmful emissions while ensuring all of our energy needs are met. While the scale of the effort required to do this cannot be met by energy efficiency alone, energy efficiency has a central role to play as part of a range of measure, which must also include increasing our use of renewable energy. Ultimately, energy efficiency measures, whether in heating, in transport, or in use of electricity, along with continued smart grid development, will deliver the means through which demand can be reduced and made more flexible. </p>  <p>  Roll out of smart grid technologies will also allow us to increase the levels of renewable electricity generation with consequent benefits for the sustainability of our electricity generation portfolio. This position is fully aligned with both the EU and the International Energy Agency (IEA), which see energy efficiency as critical to facilitating the integration of greater levels of renewable electricity generation and achieving a cost effective transition to a sustainable energy system.   </p></reply>

The EU aims to deliver a 20% improvement in energy efficiency, a 20% reduction in Green House Gas emissions and 20% of energy from renewable sources by 2020.    The 2009 EU Renewable Energy Directive set Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our energy requirements from renewable sources by 2020. In order to meet this target, Ireland is committed to meeting 40% of electricity demand from renewable sources, 12% renewables in the heating sector and 10% in transport. Policies and schemes are in place to incentivise the use of renewable energy. The REFIT schemes underpin the development of a range of renewable energy technologies. As regards energy efficiency, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) is continuing to implement policy with the roll out of efficiency measures in homes and businesses throughout the country.</p>  <p>  Ireland has made good progress with regard to renewable energy deployment. To date, wind energy has been the largest driver of growth in renewable electricity. Provisional figures provided by the SEAI for 2014 show that 8.6% of Ireland's overall energy requirements were met by renewable energy. In addition, the SEAI has calculated that 22.6% of electricity, 6.7% of heat and 5.2% of transport demand was met from renewable sources.</p></reply>

Prospecting licensees provide biennial reports of progress in efforts to locate minerals, which are vetted in advance of approval to continue exploration.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s strategy for the exploitation of the State&rsquo;s natural hydrocarbon resources aims to maximise the level of exploration activity and increase the level of production activity, while ensuring a fair return to the State from these activities. It is important then that the State provide the right environment to encourage the industry to take the risk associated with investing in exploration. This is achieved by: 	offering attractive and innovative licensing opportunities, such as the 2015 Atlantic Margin licensing round; providing a fit-for-purpose, transparent and robust regulatory regime; deepening knowledge of our offshore petroleum potential, in particular through data acquisition and supporting key research projects; and actively promoting the opportunity to invest in exploration in the Irish offshore, in particular to companies not currently active here.</p>  <p>  Finally, in terms of the inland fisheries resource, scientific assessment from the independent Standing Scientific Committee and management advice from Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI) is provided annually in respect of each of Ireland&rsquo;s 142 salmon rivers. The conservation/exploitation balance is best achieved where fisheries target individual river-based stocks that have been shown to be at full reproductive capacity and capable of sustaining the genetically unique population of that individual river.</p>  <p>  IFI is currently preparing a National Angling Development Plan. Criteria are being developed which will assist individuals, communities and agencies to identify areas and angling products which can be developed to drive sustainable economic development.</p></reply>

Construction and testing of the infrastructure is on-going with first gas anticipated later this year.

Together with my fellow EU energy ministers I have contributed to the debate on the Energy Union strategy, most recently at energy ministers' meetings in Luxembourg, Brussels and Riga.Among the proposals in the strategy designed to achieve the full integration of the European internal energy market are measures to ensure greater transparency in the composition of energy costs and prices by developing regular and detailed monitoring and reporting on energy prices, with particular attention to the role of taxes, levies and national supports. The Commission also intends to prepare an ambitious legislative proposal to redesign the electricity market, including a proposal to link wholesale and retail markets. For our part, the Integrated Single Electricity Market Project (I-SEM), led by the regulators in Ireland and Northern Ireland, will deliver improved electricity regional market integration. </p><p>I have engaged with the energy supply companies to impress on them the importance of the market passing on savings to customers in a timely manner.

Ireland aims to meet this target mainly through the use of sustainable biofuels with electric vehicles also making a contribution.</p><p>The Electric Vehicle Grant Scheme supports, through grants of up to &euro;5,000, the early deployment of electric vehicles in Ireland. These grants are in addition to the VRT reliefs of up to &euro;5,000 which apply to electric vehicles.

In this regard, Ireland's third National Energy Efficiency Action Plan to 2020, which is available my Department&rsquo;s website, estimates that approximately 50,000 EVs could form part of the transport fleet in 2020. However, the extent to which electric vehicles are adopted in the short-to-medium term will depend on a range of factors including,<i>inter alia</i>, the strength of the economy, the overall numbers of new cars being purchased, the cost of purchasing and running electric vehicles compared to internal combustion engine comparators, and the number of different electric vehicle models available to purchase.</p></reply>

The work of the group expanded to include a full review of commercial motor tax, which has led to the group taking longer than anticipated to finalise its proposals.</p>  <p>  The Group held a targeted stakeholder consultation in November 2014 which concluded in February 2015 and has held meetings with stakeholders, including representatives of the hauliers and their customers.</p>  <p>  The report of the group is currently being finalised for submission to me and to the Ministers for Finance and for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  I expect to receive the report in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

The procedures, designed to introduce greater transparency in answering Parliamentary Questions, require that all such parliamentary Questions be referred to the Agency or Agencies in question for a direct response to the Deputy within 10 working days.</p>  <p>  I have continued with these procedures since being appointed to this Office and where Deputies have not received a direct response from Agencies, I ask that they contact my officials and they will follow-up on their behalf. Overall, I am satisfied that the procedures for answering Parliamentary Questions assigned to my Department are working well.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that new standing order 40A(1) was brought into being on 21st July 2011.

The Act gives primary responsibility to planning authorities to identify and protect the architectural heritage by including relevant structures on the Record of Protected Structures (RPS).  Inclusion on the RPS places a duty of care on the owners and occupiers of protected structures and also gives planning authorities powers to deal with development proposals affecting them and to seek to safeguard their future.</p><p>Section 53(1) of the Planning and Development Acts 2000, as amended, enables me, as Minister, to make recommendations to a planning authority concerning the inclusion of specific structures in its RPS.  These recommendations are based on the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage (NIAH) surveys conducted by my Department.  The aim of the NIAH survey is generally to include structures which are of international, national and regional importance.</p><p>As already outlined, inclusion in an RPS is a devolved process and a reserved function of the local authority.</p><p>However, my Department has published a series of documents to guide local authorities in that function, such as the <i>Architectural Heritage Protection Guidelines for Planning Authorities (2004),</i>which were reissued in 2011.  My Department has also published a series of advice documents, which are available on its website at .</p><p>Finally, my Department often receives information relating to existing or potential risks to protected structures from local authorities, the Heritage Council, heritage-based NGOs and members of the public.  Where applicable, my Department will make the necessary enquiries in relation to same.</p></reply>

Therefore, while my Department has the lead role in the implementation of the EU Birds and Habitats Directive, and operated a programme for farmers in these areas in the past, significant funding is now provided through the Rural Development Programme (run by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine).  The new national agri-environment scheme, GLAS, will provide significant supports for Hen Harrier within the SPAs and in important breeding areas outside the SPAs.  In addition, I understand that GLAS+ will be available to farmers who have large farm holdings within these priority areas for Hen Harrier. </p>  <p>  I am aware that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine intends to bring forward plans for a separate locally-led measure under the Rural Development Programme in the near future and that the Hen Harrier has been identified as requiring further focus under this measure.  I am supportive of this initiative, and staff of my Department will be available to assist the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in this regard, as required.</p></reply>
