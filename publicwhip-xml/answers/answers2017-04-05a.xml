Notwithstanding this fact, my Department has continued to provide some additional non-teaching resources, including the services of a Home School Community Liaison Coordinator, in respect of the number of eligible pupils from the former DEIS schools.  These resources  are provided by way of continued support for the targeted cohort of pupils as a transitional measure until the pupils in question have completed their post primary education.  In the case of a post-primary school, these supports are provided for six years.</p>  <p>  Given that the cohort of pupils from the former DEIS schools will have completed their second level education at the end of the current school year, the additional DEIS related resources from which this school has benefitted, will cease with effect from the end of the current school year.</p>  <p>  This procedure has been notified to the school and outlined in a response to representations made on behalf of the school.  I also met recently with representatives of the school and their public representatives and where they outlined their perspective and concerns.  I have asked my officials to examine the issues raised.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the situation in relation to the school in question is entirely unrelated to the actions contained in the DEIS Plan 2017. This procedure in relation to amalgamations between DEIS and non-DEIS schools has been applied uniformly since the inception of DEIS.</p></reply>

This includes no change to the current situation regarding posts allocated under previous educational disadvantage schemes in DEIS schools, including those in Dublin's north inner city.  This is of course subject to the usual arrangements which apply in relation staffing allocations which are based on pupil enrolment.</p>  <p>  A central aim of the Plan will be to use available resources to have maximum impact, particularly in communities where there are high concentrations of educational disadvantage.  I wish to promote new approaches in pursuing this objective including initiatives in leadership, clusters and bridges to initiatives from the communities.</p>  <p>  I shall also be evaluating the impact of all existing initiatives.  This will include an evaluation of teaching resources for schools participating in DEIS to inform future policy in an Irish context.  </p>  <p>  Pending the outcome of such an evaluation, the current staffing schedule available to primary urban Band 1 schools to provide smaller classes will continue to be applied in addition to teaching posts already available to these schools under previous educational disadvantage schemes.</p>  <p>  As with all additional resources provided to schools under the DEIS Programme,  these resources should be deployed by schools to meet the objectives of DEIS as set out in the School Plan.</p></reply>

Innovation 2020, Ireland&rsquo;s strategy for Research and Development, Science and Technology proposes the development of career pathways for researchers to help them maximise their potential and, as a consequence, help to maximise the return on Ireland&rsquo;s investment in innovation and research. </p>  <p>  In this regard the Irish Universities Association is developing a draft framework to address these issues. Success in initiatives such as Horizon 2020 will be maximised if researchers are being supported from an early-stage to improve their, and Ireland&rsquo;s, research impact.  </p>  <p>  The Expert Group on Future Funding for Higher Education, was established to develop a strategy for funding the third level sector. The report outlines the funding challenges in the sector and offers recommendations for the medium term.  As committed to in the Programme for Government, the report has been referred to the Education Committee for consideration. </p>  <p>  In the short term, in Budget 2017 an additional &euro;36.5m has been made available with &euro;160m additional overall agreed for the next three years. This is the first time in nine years that additional Exchequer funding has been secured for the higher education sector. This will assist with demographic increases and initiatives on disadvantage, skills, research and flexible learning. </p>  <p>  My Department, and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, are currently undertaking a public consultation process on a proposed Exchequer-Employer investment mechanism for the higher and further education sectors.  The mechanism, which estimates an increase in the National Training Fund levy from 0.7% to 1% between 2018 and 2020, could yield an additional &euro;200m revenue in 2020. Details of the process are available on the websites of both Departments. </p>  <p>  It is  approaches such as these that will contribute to and inform the development of a long-term sustainable funding model for the higher education sector.  </p>  <p>  In addition to the work being done by the Irish Research Council in the area of human capital, I provided funding in Budget 2017 for the Council to commence in 2017 a new Frontiers Research Programme, which will enable the next generation of researchers to transition to Principal Investigator status.</p></reply>

Variables used in the compilation of the HP Index include those related to demographic growth, dependency ratios, education levels, single parent rate, overcrowding, social class, occupation and unemployment rates. This data is combined with pupil data, anonymised and aggregated to small area, to provide information on the relative level of concentrated disadvantage present in the pupil cohort of individual schools. I am satisfied that this data is applied uniformly to all schools in a fair and objective way, to identify the relative level of concentrated disadvantage present in each school.</p>  <p>  The new model is explained in detail  in the DEIS plan and on the DES Website. However it is also my intention to make available to all schools detailed information relating to the identification model and how the data is used to determine a schools' level of disadvantage.  This will include the importance of quality of Primary and Post Primary Online Database data to the process and of ensuring that school data is sufficiently detailed and up to date, including, where possible, the use of Eircodes.   Arrangements for this are in hand and schools will be advised shortly.  </p>  <p>  In relation to schools who have concerns about their non-inclusion in the most recent round of DEIS, the following process applies.</p>  <p>  1. A verification process is currently ongoing in relation to all schools who contacted the Department.  This is aimed at ensuring that the model was run correctly and the 2015/16 pupil data supplied by schools through the POD/PPOD systems was correctly used. This process is expected to be concluded shortly and schools will be informed of the results.</p>  <p>  2. A further process will take account of updated data as it becomes available. All schools are being contacted to request them to ensure that their POD/PPOD data is fully correct and up to date, including Eircodes. As soon as the updated Census data becomes available, this data will be run through the model with the fully up-to-date POD/PPOD data. If this exercise reveals that any school which did not qualify for DEIS in the February 2017 round actually meets the criteria applicable to schools with the highest concentration of disadvantage based on the fully up-to-date information then it will be included, subject to resources.</p>  <p>  3. As part of the announcement made in February, it was made clear that we would continue to refine the model in light of best practice. As part of this process, any other factors raised by schools in the context of their DEIS status will be considered by my Department as part of its delivery of commitments under the DEIS Plan 2017.</p>  <p>  In addition to the implementation of this new objective and independent data-based model of identifying levels of disadvantage within school populations, the DEIS Plan 2017 commits to a further programme of work to refine the model in terms of resource allocation to evaluate the impact of individual policy measures and to create a more dynamic model where levels of resources more accurately follow the needs identified by that model.</p></reply>

All applications for capital funding must be considered in the context of the limited funding available, which must of necessity, be prioritised for this purpose and to provide mainstream classroom accommodation where additional teachers are being appointed. </p>  <p>  My Department has explained to the school that for the reasons I have outlined, it is not possible at this point to approve funding for the ancillary accommodation sought. However, funding has been approved to the school for a learning support / resource area to meet its immediate accommodation needs. The school has recently written to my Department relating to the accommodation approved and my Department will be in further contact with the school shortly following consideration of the correspondence.</p></reply>

However, I believe it has a bright future ahead of it and a major role to play in providing choice to parents in the future.</p>  <p>  Community National Schools are multi-denominational and they provide for belief nurturing during the school day.  The aim of the model has been to cater for the diversity present within the community in a single school setting.  The philosophy of the Community National School as a multi-denominational school is based on best practice in this area, and on each child better understanding and ultimately celebrating both their own and their friends&rsquo; belief and cultural identities. Belief identity is explicitly not left at the school gate, but used as a means of enriching the learning experience on the basis of mutual understanding and integration. </p>  <p>  &lsquo;Goodness Me, Goodness You&rsquo; (GMGY) is the patron&rsquo;s programme that underpins the characteristic spirit of CNS schools. GMGY is a common programme suitable for pupils of all faiths and beliefs and none.  </p>  <p>In Junior Infants to 2nd Class, the children follow the GMGY programme together for the majority of the school year, exploring common themes. There is a belief-specific aspect of the programme. In the junior classes only, children have been grouped for a four week period during GMGY time according to their faith or belief tradition, in line with the wishes of their parents. Lesson content was designed specifically for each grouping. In 3rd to 6th   class, children remain in their class groups throughout the year and learn about different faiths and religions together. Belief-specific teaching is integrated into GMGY for these classes.</p>  <p>The manner in which schools deliver belief-specific teaching in Junior Infants to 2nd   class has evolved. The majority of CNS schools no longer group children according to their beliefs for the four week period. Instead, these schools have integrated belief-specific teaching so that all children learn about different religions and beliefs together and all class groups remain together throughout. As I indicated in a recent statement, I see merit in this approach. </p>  <p>  This model has the merit of responding to the needs of parents who wish their children to be able to prepare for specific events - for example Communion and Confirmation in the case of Catholic families &ndash; but also respects the best principles of inclusion and mutual understanding that are central to multi-denominational education. </p>  <p>  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) is to commence a review of the GMGY programme for Junior Infants to 2nd   class, starting in September 2017. As part of that review, the belief-specific teaching aspect of the programme will be examined. The Education and Training Boards, as patrons, are also looking at how Goodness Me Goodness You can be delivered on the ground in the most inclusive fashion possible. I look forward to seeing the outcomes of these processes.</p></reply>

A template anti-bullying policy which must be used by all schools for this purpose is included in the procedures.</p><p>The procedures for schools outline key principles of best practice for both preventing and tackling bullying and require all schools to commit to these principles in their anti-bullying policy. In particular, they emphasise that a cornerstone in the prevention of bullying is a positive school culture and climate. In that regard, the procedures set out the need for schools to encourage and strengthen open dialogue between all school staff and pupils and to ensure that they provide appropriate opportunities for pupils to raise their concerns in an environment that is comfortable for the pupil.</p><p>The anti-bullying procedures also include specific requirements in relation to the use of prevention and education strategies and the consistent investigation, follow up and recording of bullying behaviour.</p><p>The procedures for schools put in place important new oversight arrangements at school level that involve the school principal reporting regularly to the Board of Management and a requirement for the Board to undertake an annual review of the school's anti- bullying policy and its implementation. Confirmation that the annual review has been completed must be provided to the Parents' Association and published on the school website. </p><p>While there is no requirement on schools to report incidents of bullying behaviour to my Department, in the course of their whole school inspection work, my Department&rsquo;s Inspectorate gathers information about how schools deal with bullying in a number of ways through: </p><p>- Review of relevant school documentation, including the school&rsquo;s Code of Behaviour and Ant-Bullying policy; </p><p>- Meetings with parents and student representatives at which there is an opportunity for parents and students to raise issues where relevant and </p><p>- The inclusion of parent and student Questionnaires on items relating to bullying. </p><p>Students and parents are also asked to respond to questions about how the school deals with bullying and discipline in the school and whether or not the school provides a safe environment for children. </p><p>Where responses indicate that students and/or parent do not believe that bullying is dealt with effectively, Inspectors raise this issue with school management who have ultimate responsibility for Anti-Bullying policies and procedures.</p><p>The publication of the new procedures for schools represented the conclusion of just one of the twelve actions set out in the Action Plan on Bullying which was published in January 2013.  Other actions that have been progressed include:  </p><p>- A new national anti-bullying website, <i>www.tacklebullying.ie,</i>was launched in November 2015. The website provides a single point of information and support for young people, parents and teachers affected by bullying - My Department supports anti-bullying initiatives aimed at young people such as, the StandUp! Against Homophobic and Transphobic bullying campaign, organised by BeLonG To, the National Youth Service for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender young people in Ireland and the Europe-wide initiative, Safer Internet Day.  </p><p>- Since 2013 new resources to tackle cyberbullying  &ldquo;UP2US&rdquo;, &ldquo;My Selfie and the wider world&rdquo; and &ldquo;Lockers&rdquo; were  launched through the internet safety initiative, Web wise and an P2US social media roadshow was run in collaboration with Beat 102-103.</p></reply>

Implementation in senior classes (third to sixth classes) will follow in September 2019.  </p>  <p>  The new Primary Language Curriculum is innovative in aiming to ensure that language skills are transferred effectively, from one language to the other, whether that is English or Irish. Gaining proficiency in both languages will provide pupils with transversal skills that will assist them in learning foreign languages during their post-primary education experience and beyond. Practically all children in our primary schools are studying two languages from an early age.</p>  <p>  My Department's Action Plan for Education commits to exploring the potential for the greater use of CLIL (content and language integrated learning) to increase the use of language skills and increase confidence in language learning in a range of language Support Material for teachers has been developed by the NCCA in this area. </p>  <p>  Work on the redevelopment of the new Mathematics Curriculum for primary schools has commenced, with implementation scheduled for September 2018 for junior infants to second class.</p>  <p>  A review of the overall structure and time allocation in the primary school curriculum is also underway.  The target date for completion is Q4, 2018.

In this particular case the complexity of the issues associated with the development of the site options under consideration, combined with competing demands on my Department's resources, resulted in a lengthier time for site appraisal than would generally have been the case. </p>  <p>  Following on from the site assessment exercise, a preferred site option was identified and officials from Donegal County Council, on behalf of my Department, have engaged with the landowner in question with a view to its acquisition.  These negotiations have not yielded a positive result to date but are currently ongoing.</p>  <p>  At the request of my Department, Council officials have also engaged with the relevant landowners in respect of a second suitable site and this may provide an alternative option, if agreement can be reached on a purchase price. </p>  <p>  Due to the commercial sensitivities attaching to site acquisitions generally, it is not possible to provide any further information at this time regarding the negotiation process or the site options.

The report provides an important summary of the current position in relation to the various initiatives taken by successive governments in support of persons who were abused when as children they resided in institutions and it sets out the position in regard to how those initiatives have been funded. The report highlights in particular the fact that the religious congregations who managed many of those institutions will fund at most approximately 21% of the &euro;1.5 billion cost of the response to residential institutional child abuse with the State, i.e. the taxpayer meeting the vast bulk of those costs. </p>  <p>  I am disappointed and frustrated that the organisations responsible for protecting children and managing the institutions in which abuse of children took place have failed to adequately contribute towards the cost of the response that has been put in place. It has been the position of successive Governments that, given that the religious congregations were responsible for the management of institutions where horrific abuse of children took place, as documented in the report of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse (the &ldquo;Ryan Report&rdquo;), they should commit to making further substantial contributions towards the cost of abuse.  Having regard to the work of the independent panel's report, the Government adopted a position that the congregations had the resources to bring their contribution over time to 50% of the then estimated costs. Regrettably the congregations have never agreed to this position, with the result that the State has met the bulk of the costs involved.</p>  <p>  To date contributions amounting to some &euro;210 million in cash, counselling and property transfers have been made by the 18 religious congregations who managed most of the institutions. These contributions are being made under two rounds: the binding 2002 Indemnity Agreement and the voluntary offers made in 2009 in the aftermath of the publication of the Ryan Report.</p>  <p>  Some &euro;112.9 million of the &euro;128 million (or 88%) provided for under the 2002 Indemnity Agreement has been fully contributed. 11 property transfers remain to be fully completed. Work to complete these transfers is actively progressing and I should point out that in most of the remaining cases the transfer process is at a very advanced stage. It is worth noting also that most of the properties are already in use by the intended recipients.</p>  <p>  The offers made in the aftermath of the publication of the Ryan Report by many of the congregations that were party to the 2002 Indemnity Agreement, included cash and properties and were valued by the congregations at &euro;352.6m. I should stress that these offers are voluntary and do not form part of any agreement.</p>  <p>  Regrettably one significant element of the most recent offer, relating to playing fields and associated lands, valued at &euro;127 million, was withdrawn by the Christian Brothers. When this is combined with some changes in the valuation of properties previously offered, the total value of the voluntary offers currently in place stands at &euro;193 million, of which contributions of cash and property amounting to some &euro;97.3 million have been realised. It is expected that the outstanding congregational cash contributions will be received by 2018 while work is progressing to complete remaining property transfers.</p></reply>

I welcome the clarity that the UK Prime Minister's announcement brought. Adopting a proactive approach from the start, the Irish Government has been comprehensively preparing for this very eventuality. The contingency framework that the Government put in place maps the key issues that will be most important to Ireland in the coming weeks and months.  My own Department contributed fully to the preparation of the education components of that framework. While negotiations on the UK/EU relationship post-Brexit have not yet begun the results of our overall analysis, consultations and planning now enable us to move confidently to that next phase. </p>  <p>  It is my priority to continue to engage actively on a number of fronts in dealing with the impact of Brexit on the Education sector. Consultation has been fundamental to my Department&rsquo;s preparations for Brexit. We have consulted extensively with our stakeholders. Between December and January both I and Minister of State Halligan have led consultations with stakeholders from right across the higher education, further education and training; and primary and post-primary education sectors.  </p>  <p>  Among the key issues identified in these consultations are Brexit's likely impact on the future of the Common Travel Area and its implications for students, teachers, academic staff and researchers, mutual recognition of qualifications, UK/Ireland research collaboration and partnerships between education institutions and enterprise as well as the implications for EU funding for research and the impact on EU funding programmes such as Horizon2020, PEACE IV and Erasmus+. </p>  <p>  All of these issues will be factored in to my Department&rsquo;s overall approach to future discussions and negotiations and to our input to Government's preparations for EU-UK negotiations. Both I and my Department will continue to consult with the sector interests as necessary through the period ahead.</p>  <p>  Engagement at political and institutional level has been another key part of my approach. I have met my counterparts Peter Weir and Simon Hamilton of the NI Executive, and most recently I met with the UK&rsquo;s Secretary of State for Education, Justine Greening. I have also recently held meetings with the Minister of State for Exiting the EU, David Jones, the UK&rsquo;s Opposition Spokesperson on Brexit, Keir Starmer, as well as members of the All Party Parliamentary Group on the Irish in Britain. I have also had meetings with Ministers from other EU Member States and with representatives of the EU Commission. </p>  <p>   I look forward to building on this engagement over the coming months in order to ensure that our priorities are to the fore, are fully understood and taken into account.</p></reply>

However, since 2012, receipts from the NTF levy have increased annually, due to improved employment levels. The accumulated surplus in the Fund has been critical in maintaining expenditure levels, particularly in the provision of training for the unemployed, in a period when receipts were falling. </p>  <p>  It is considered prudent to continue to maintain an adequate surplus in the Fund to meet demand in future years and while the surplus represents a very significant sum, it would only cover 7 months NTF expenditure at current levels. In addition, the operation of the EU Fiscal Rules and the inclusion of the NTF in my Department's overall annual expenditure ceiling mean that, in the absence of an increased rate of contribution, additional expenditure cannot be sourced from the NTF without a corresponding drop in Exchequer expenditure. The surplus remains available for investment in education and training programmes to meet skills needs.</p>  <p>  I am reviewing the allocation of funding to programmes in the Further Education and Training and Higher Education sectors as between NTF and Exchequer sources in terms both of the emphasis required on training for employment and training persons in employment and of satisfying the needs of enterprise to meet strategic skills requirements. One objective of this review is to direct NTF allocations in a manner that best reflects enterprise priorities as identified through the revised national skills architecture.</p></reply>

Schools will be frontloaded with resources to provide additional teaching support to all pupils who need such support. </p>  <p>  Where parents have concerns that their child is not getting access to the support the child needs, they should raise this concern with the Principal and in the event that they are not happy with the response they should raise this with the Board of Management. </p>  <p>  As the profiled allocation is made to the school, schools may appeal the basis of this allocation and specifically whether the data used to calculate the profile was correct and whether it was correctly applied in the case of the school.</p>  <p>  The NCSE has published details of the appeals process on the NCSE website: www.ncse.ie.  Should a school wish to appeal they should do so by March 31st 2017. </p>  <p>  Schools will be able to appeal whether the data used to calculate their school profile was correct and complete and whether it was correctly applied in the calculation of their 2017/18 allocation.</p>  <p>  DES Circulars 0013/2017 and 0014/2017 outline the basis on which the Education Research Centre determined the allocations for all schools.  </p>  <p>  In advance of the submission of an appeal, schools should read carefully the DES circulars and in particular the relevant section, which relates to the breakdown of the allocation, which may be under consideration for appeal.   </p>  <p>  The model will also allow for some additional provision for exceptional circumstances or where a school&rsquo;s enrolment levels increase very substantially prior to the next review of the model. The National Council for Special Education will support schools in managing their special education teaching allocations in the first instance.

A very important feature of these new specifications is the introduction of practical assessment components.  The NCCA has recommended that, in each of these subjects, there should be a 90-minute, externally-assessed practical examination, attracting 30% of the overall marks for the Leaving Certificate examination.  Candidates will be directly assessed by observation of how they perform the practical activities and indirectly assessed through a subsequent assessment of the work they generate.</p>  <p>  As this is a new development, the specifications have been approved by my Department, on a provisional basis, pending a trial of the assessment arrangements.  The State Examinations Commission (SEC), in consultation with the NCCA, has been asked by my Department to carry out this trial and preparations are well underway.  The trial is planned to take place during the fourth quarter of 2017, as outlined in my Department's Action Plan for Education 2017, and is likely to involve approximately twenty-five schools.  The SEC has, in the past week, issued an invitation to schools to take part in the trial.  Students from Leaving Certificate Biology, Chemistry, and Physics classes will participate.  In some schools the trial will be in just one of the subjects, while others will have the trial practical examination in two or all three subjects.  This is to ensure that the feasibility and implications of running such examinations in all three subjects are properly assessed.</p>  <p>  In addition to these developments, the NCCA has completed a new subject specification for Leaving Certificate Agricultural Science and this has been approved by my Department for implementation.</p>  <p>  These developments provide important opportunities to increase interest in and take-up of STEM subjects and progress the Action Plan for Education.</p></reply>

The report outlines the funding challenges in the sector and offers recommendations for the medium term.  As committed to in the Programme for Government, the report has been referred to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Skills for consideration.  However, it is important to recognise, as the Cassells Report has done, that doing nothing is not an option and that other measures to improve equality of access will also be necessary.</p>  <p>  While Cassells deals with the medium and long term funding needs of higher education my Department and I also have to consider the immediate challenges and in that context the Department placed a particular focus on this area in Budget 2017 securing additional funding for the sector for the first time in recent years.  In Action Plan Education 2017, Higher Education will be a particular focus.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2017 an additional &euro;36.5m has been made available with &euro;160m additional overall agreed for the next three years.  This is the first time in nine years that additional Exchequer funding has been secured for the higher education sector.  This will assist with demographic increases and initiatives on disadvantage, skills, research and flexible learning.</p>  <p>  My Department, and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, are currently undertaking a public consultation process on a proposed Exchequer-Employer investment mechanism for the higher and further education sectors.  The mechanism, which estimates an increase in the National Training Fund levy from 0.7% to 1% between 2018 and 2020, could yield an additional &euro;200m revenue in 2020.  Details of the process are available on the websites of both Departments.  This review will complement the ongoing work by the Oireachtas Committee in relation to the Cassells report.</p>  <p>  It is approaches such as these that will contribute to and inform the development of a long-term sustainable funding model.</p></reply>

However, I believe it has a bright future ahead of it and a major role to play in providing choice to parents in the future.</p>  <p>  Community National Schools are multi-denominational and they provide for belief nurturing during the school day.  The aim of the model has been to cater for the diversity present within the community in a single school setting.  The philosophy of the Community National School as a multi-denominational school is based on best practice in this area, and on each child better understanding and ultimately celebrating both their own and their friends&rsquo; belief and cultural identities.  Belief identity is explicitly not left at the school gate, but used as a means of enriching the learning experience on the basis of mutual understanding and integration.</p>  <p>  &lsquo;Goodness Me, Goodness You&rsquo; (GMGY) is the patron&rsquo;s programme that underpins the characteristic spirit of CNS schools and is a common programme suitable for pupils of all faiths and beliefs.  The GMGY programme is being developed by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) and delivered on an action research basis.  The action research approach allows for the development of the curriculum with the content and approaches being adjusted and adapted based on feedback on the material and methodologies.</p>  <p>  In Junior Infants to 2nd Class, the children follow the GMGY programme together for the majority of the school year, exploring common themes.  There is a belief-specific aspect of the programme.  In the junior classes only, children have been grouped for a four week period during GMGY time according to their faith or belief tradition, in line with the wishes of their parents.  Lesson content was designed specifically for each grouping.  In 3rd to 6th class, children remain in their class groups throughout the year and learn about different faiths and religions together.  Belief-specific teaching is integrated into GMGY for these classes.</p>  <p>  The manner in which schools deliver belief-specific teaching in Junior Infants to 2nd class has evolved.  The majority of CNS schools no longer group children according to their beliefs for the four week period.  Instead, these schools have integrated belief-specific teaching so that all children learn about different religions and beliefs together and all class groups remain together throughout.  As I indicated in a recent statement, I see merit in this approach.</p>  <p>  This model has the merit of responding to the needs of parents who wish their children to be able to prepare for specific events - for example Communion and Confirmation in the case of Catholic families &ndash; but also respects the best principles of inclusion and mutual understanding that are central to multi-denominational education.</p>  <p>  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) is to commence a review of the GMGY programme for Junior Infants to 2nd class, starting in September 2017.  As part of that review, the belief-specific teaching aspect of the programme will be examined.  The Education and Training Boards, as patrons, are also looking at how Goodness Me Goodness You can be delivered on the ground in the most inclusive fashion possible.  I look forward to seeing the outcomes of these processes.</p></reply>

While the economic recovery has created a strong and growing demand for graduate level employment, the higher education system continues to expand and enrol more students, and to provide an increasing supply of graduates for the labour market.  Overall student numbers in the sector increased from 196,000 in 2011/12 to about 210,000 in 2014/15.  In addition to this general growth, additional programmes have been put in place to address specific skills needs, through the Springboard+ programme and the ICT skills initiatives.</p>  <p>  The performance of the Higher Education system in meeting human capital needs is also strong by comparison with other European countries: Ireland has one of the highest rates of 30&ndash;34-year-olds with higher education attainment, and Ireland performs particularly strongly in terms of graduates with STEM qualifications when considered against fellow EU member countries.</p>  <p>  Ireland ranks 3rd in the EU28 in its tertiary attainment rate (Higher Education Qualification) (52.3% in 2015) for 30 &ndash; 34 year olds.  We are still significantly ahead of the EU28 average which rested at 38.7% in 2015.  This strong performance is confirmed in the recent OECD publication Education at a Glance which was published on 15 September 2016 and which placed Ireland 6th in the OECD in terms of its Tertiary Attainment Rate amongst 25-34 year olds.</p>  <p>  International benchmarks show that Ireland continues to be a leading European country in overall educational attainment at tertiary level, and particularly so for younger cohorts of the population.  This reflects both the strong demand for tertiary education in Ireland and the strong incentives that are built into the funding model to encourage institutions to seek higher enrolment numbers.</p>  <p>  The latest information available from the Higher Education Authority (HEA) demonstrates that the total number of graduates who gave their County of origin as Wexford, from all HEA funded Higher Education Institutions (HEIs), was 1,610 in 2014/15.  This is an increase of 13% over five years from the equivalent figure of 1,424 in 2010/2011.</p>  <p>  Next Steps:</p>  <p>  The outlook for future skills needs shows demand for higher education graduates from enterprise continuing to increase, along with growing demands from the increasing pool of school leavers.</p>  <p>  The implementation of a System Performance Framework, Strategic Dialogue and the agreement of compacts with the Higher Education Institutions underpins a changed relationship between the State and the higher education system, and this provides for a new level of accountability for public funding against national objectives.</p>  <p>  I published the second Systems Performance Report in December 2016 and this reviewed the performance of the higher education system for the years 2014 and 2015, in critical areas such as access and its responsiveness to skills needs of the economy.</p>  <p>  I am now developing a new Systems Performance Framework for the period 2017 &ndash; 2021 which will set out the ambition, goals and objectives for higher education for this five year period.</p>  <p>  In terms of County Wexford specifically, one of the most ambitious objectives of the System Performance Framework is an extensive restructuring of the higher education landscape, involving institutional mergers and new collaborative arrangements.</p>  <p>  The Institute of Technology Carlow already have a Wexford Campus, based in Wexford Town, which offers an extensive range of award qualifications from Level 6 through to postgraduate Level 9 on the national Framework of Qualifications (NFQ).</p>  <p>  I can also assure the Deputy that there are plans in place for the development of a Technological University for the whole South-East region.  The Technological University for the South-East (TUSE) project was initiated in 2011 and consists of a consortium involving the Institute of Technology Carlow and Waterford Institute of Technology.</p>  <p>  Strategic vision for TUSE:</p>  <p>  The core elements of a new agreed vision and values for the TUSE have already been set out by both Institutes and includes a commitment to:</p>  <p>  -  A systematic focus on the preparation of graduates for complex professional roles in a changing technological world;</p>  <p>  -  Advancing knowledge through research and scholarship;</p>  <p>  -  Dissemination of this knowledge to meet the needs of society and enterprise;</p>  <p>  -  Particular regard to the needs of the region.</p>  <p>  In relation to the legislation, to underpin the development of Technological Universities, the third Government Legislative Programme of this new Partnership Government was published on 17 January 2017, and the Technological Universities Bill is listed on the D&aacute;il Order Paper and is awaiting Committee Stage.</p>  <p>  Following the finalisation of the ongoing consultation process I will then advance the legislation having determined a position in relation to any matters raised.</p>  <p>  In addition to the merger projects, work is ongoing on greater inter-institutional collaboration in order to enhance the ability of institutions to respond to regional needs.  The implementation of actions in the National Skills Strategy including the further development and work of the Regional Skills Fora which will be responsible for bringing together higher and further education providers to better align education provision with skills needs.  Further actions include the planned entrepreneurship education policy statement and foreign languages in education strategy and implementation of the ICT skills action plan and ongoing engagement between higher education and employer interests will all contribute to addressing the issues raised in the coming years.</p></reply>

These schools now form part of the network of specialised placements for students with ASD.</p>  <p>  As each child with autism is unique, they should have access to a range of different approaches to meet their individual needs.  This facilitates access to individualised education programmes which can be supported by Special Needs Assistants and fully qualified professional teachers who may draw from a range of autism-specific interventions, including Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA), Treatment and Education of Autistic Communication Handicapped Children (TEACCH) and Picture Exchange Communications System (PECS) as well as the appropriate school curriculum with the option, where possible, of full or partial integration and interaction with other pupils.</p>  <p>  The use of ABA as part of the range of interventions may be particularly useful for addressing behavioural issues.  My Department supports the use of ABA and training is provided for teachers in its use.</p>  <p>  However, my Department does not accept, based on research, advice and best practice, that ABA should be the only approach used.  While ABA may help to improve behaviour, other approaches, such as a number of those, to which I have referred, are just as important in developing children's communication and speech skills.</p>  <p>  All recognised schools must operate in line with this policy.  This policy has been informed by published research, including the Report of the Task Force on Autism (2001), the Evaluation of Educational Provision for Children with Autistic Spectrum Disorders (ASD) (2006) and the NCSE&rsquo;s policy advice on Supporting Students with Autism Spectrum Disorder (2016).</p></reply>

This protection is not available to those who are outside the terms of that Agreement. By deciding to reject the Lansdowne Road Agreement, the ASTI has placed its members outside that Agreement and has decided that the Agreement&rsquo;s benefits and protections will not apply to its members. My Department made this position clear to the ASTI prior to its recent ballot.</p>  <p>  The process of identifying staff surpluses takes place in the first half of each year and takes effect from the start of the following school year. The process operates and deals with any surplus for the following school year.  </p>  <p>  The process for the 2017/18 school year is currently under way in my Department. 60 secondary schools were identified as possible surplus schools for the 2017/18 school year. These 60 schools received a letter notifying them of their surplus and were given an opportunity to respond to same. This represents the total number of schools where potential surpluses could arise.</p>  <p>  However, at this stage of the process it is too early to say what the final position as regards the level of surplus will be, either generally or in particular schools. The level of surplus is influenced by many factors including retirements, career breaks, job-sharing etc. and additional allocations for the forthcoming year in respect of demographics. This continues to evolve as new information is received from relevant schools. Given that Budgets 2016 and 2017 did not negatively impact on teacher allocations, it would not be surprising that the level of redeployment would be lower than in recent years. </p>  <p>  My Department expects to know the final position in relation to the number of surplus teachers shortly. This is no different to what has transacted in previous years.</p></reply>

The key data sources are the DES Primary Online Database (POD) and Post-Primary Online (PPOD) Databases and the CSO Small Area of Population (SAP) data from Census 2011 as represented by the Pobal HP Deprivation Index (HP Index). This data  provides information on the relative level of concentrated disadvantage present in the pupil cohort of each individual school and is applied uniformly across all schools in the country, including schools in the area mentioned by the Deputy. Variables used in the compilation of the HP Index include those related to demographic growth, dependency ratios, education levels, single parent rate, overcrowding, social class, occupation and unemployment rates. This data is combined with pupil data, anonymised and aggregated to small area, to provide information on the relative level of concentrated disadvantage present in the pupil cohort of individual schools. </p>  <p>  In its initial application, the new identification model has identified that there are schools in disadvantaged areas, not previously included in DEIS, whose level of disadvantage is at the same level as the current DEIS category for schools serving the highest concentrations of disadvantage.  Accordingly, we are moving as a first step to include these schools in the DEIS Programme with effect from September 2017.</p>  <p>  The implementation of a new objective central data-based model of identifying levels of disadvantage within school populations will be followed by a further programme of work to create a more dynamic model where levels of resource more accurately follow the levels of need identified by that model. Once this work has been completed, consideration will be given to extending DEIS supports to a further group of schools as resources permit.</p>  <p>  The next phase of the identification process will be to update the model to take account of 2016 National Census data and 2016/17 online pupil data.  These updated data will facilitate a further assessment of all schools and will be possible when the updated datasets are available later this year.</p>  <p>  The DEIS Plan provides for a verification process and any school wishing to seek verification of the information used to assess the level of disadvantage of its pupil cohort may submit an application for same to social_inclusion@education.gov.ie</p></reply>

Within this approach, there is capacity to allow religious schools to require parents or students to indicate some support or respect for the ethos of the school.</p>  <p>  As I specifically outlined in the consultation paper, I am mindful of the need to avoid possible pitfalls and unintended consequences with each of these approaches, including possible impacts on minority religions and on the wishes of Protestant, Jewish, Islamic and other communities to be able to run schools in accordance with their ethos and admit children from their communities to attend those schools.</p>  <p>  Other possible consequences to be avoided include possible breaches of the constitution, technical and administrative difficulties impacting on the capacity to effectively run the system of over 4000 schools and the possibility of creating &lsquo;postcode lotteries&rsquo;, such as other countries have experienced, resulting in pronounced divergence in the quality of schools in more advantaged compared to less advantaged areas. </p>  <p>  My Department has begun the process of examining the submissions and formulating next steps. I will then develop and implement measures to deal with this issue.</p>  <p>  With regard to the teaching of religion in schools, Article 44 of the Constitution and Section 30 of the Education Act 1998 provides that parents have a right to have their children opt out of religion classes if they so wish. </p>  <p>  The Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2016 includes a specific requirement that school enrolment policies must include details of the school&rsquo;s arrangements for any students who do not wish to attend religious instruction. This is an important measure which will help ensure transparency from the outset as to how a school will uphold the rights of parents in this regard.</p></reply>

As set out in the staffing schedule, the enrolment figure required to retain the 19<sup>th</sup>classroom teaching post is 502 pupils. </p><p>For 2017/18 an additional Special Education Post (S.E.T. Post) has been allocated to this school under the new Special Education allocation model. This revised allocation process will replace the General Allocation Model and English as Additional Language Support (GAM/EAL) scheme, whereby a general allocation of resources had previously been allocated to primary schools annually.</p><p>The staffing schedule includes an appeals mechanism for schools to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeals Board.  Details of the criteria for appeal are contained in the staffing schedule, Circular 0017/2017. </p><p>The Primary Staffing Appeals Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-04-05a.146.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017040500071#WRD01600"><p>I wish to advise the Deputy that DES Circular 0013/2017 for primary schools and 0014/2017 for post primary schools were published on 7th March 2017.</p>  <p>  These Circulars set out the details of the new model for allocating special education teachers to schools.</p>  <p>  The revised allocation process replaces the generalised allocation process at primary and post primary school level for learning support and high incidence special educational needs, and the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) allocation process which provided additional resource teaching supports to schools, to support pupils assessed as having Low Incidence disabilities.</p>  <p>  The new Special Education Teaching allocation provides a single unified allocation for special educational support teaching needs to each school, based on each school&rsquo;s educational profile.</p>  <p>  Allocations based on the school profiles were issued to all schools on 7th March.  Details of the special education teaching allocations have also been published on the NCSE website.</p>  <p>  The aim of this new model is to deliver better outcomes for children with special educational needs. Substantial research, analysis, consultation with service users and stakeholders, and piloting have gone in to the development of this model and all of the evidence points to the fact that this new system will deliver better outcomes for children. </p>  <p>  No school, including the school to which the Deputy has referred, will lose supports as a result of the implementation of the new model. In addition, no school will receive an allocation, for the support of pupils with complex needs, less than the allocation they received to support such pupils during the 2016/17 school year. </p>  <p>  An additional 900 teaching posts have been provided to support the introduction of this new allocation model. The provision of an additional 900 teaching posts is a very significant investment in the provision of additional teaching support for pupils with special educational needs in our schools. This is additional to an increase of 41% in the number of resource teachers allocated to schools annually by the NCSE since 2011. </p>  <p>  The additional funding will provide for additional supports to over 1200 schools who are identified as needing additional supports as a result of the new model. Supports for children with special educational needs is a key priority for this Government. The new funding will ensure that all schools receive a sufficient allocation of special education needs resources to provide additional teaching support to all pupils, including pupils who have yet to enrol in their school, who require such support. </p>  <p>  In relation to the particular school referred to by the Deputy in his question, this school had a General Allocation Model allocation of 60 hours for the 2016/17 school year, which combined with 55.25 resource teaching hours allocated to the school by the National Council for Special Education, gave a total allocation to the school of 115.25 additional teaching hours for the 2016/17 school year.</p>  <p>  The profiled allocation for the school had indicated an allocation requirement of 102.5 hours for this school for 2017/18, which would have resulted in a nominal reduction of 12.75 hours.</p>  <p>  However, as no school will receive and allocation less than their 2016/17 allocation, the school has maintained its existing level of allocation.</p>  <p>  The special education teaching allocation for this school for 2017/18 is 115.25 hours.</p>  <p>  There has therefore been no reduction to the special education teaching allocation for this school.</p>  <p>  It should also not be assumed that the potential reduction indicated for this school will be applied in the future, when the next profiling exercise occurs, as a new profiled allocation will be calculated at that time, which will take into account any changes to the school population or profile.</p>  <p>  DES Circulars 0013 and 0014 2017 advised schools that any future adjustments to the allocations for schools will take place on a graduated basis, which will take account of changes to school enrolments, and the pupil population, including the number of pupils in the complex needs category, since the initial allocations were developed.</p>  <p>  Guidelines for schools on the organisation, deployment and use of their special education teachers to address the need of pupils with special educational needs are also being prepared and will be published shortly.</p>  <p>  The Guidelines will support schools to reflect on how they can review and manage their timetabling practices to ensure the timetable is sufficiently flexible to meet the needs of all pupils in their school who have special needs. The Guidelines encourage schools to ensure they deploy their resources appropriately to meet the needs of all of the children in their school who require additional teaching support, including pupils with emerging needs, or new entrants. </p>  <p>  The NCSE has also announced the commencement of an independent appeals process through which schools may appeal the allocation made to their school if they believe the data upon which the allocation is based is incorrect or has been incorrectly used.</p></reply>

Special Schools funded by my Department are intended to cater for children and young persons with special educational needs from 4 years until the end of the school year in which they reach their 18th year. </p>  <p>  Special Schools are staffed in accordance with arrangements set out in my Department's Circular 0042/2011, which provides for enhanced pupil teacher ratios for pupils attending Special Schools ranging from 6-1, to 12-1, on the basis of disability categorisation of pupils attending the school.</p>  <p>  Many special schools now enrol students from disability categories other than from those provided for by their school designations.</p>  <p>  There are currently 1,153 special classes nationally, which is an increase of over 100% on the number available in 2011. Of these, 127 are ASD early intervention classes, 525 are primary ASD classes and 237 are post-primary ASD classes. The remainder are non-ASD special classes.</p>  <p>  With regard to Cork City and County, there are 145 ASD special classes. Of these, 24 are ASD early intervention classes, 80 are primary ASD classes and 41 are post-primary ASD classes. </p>  <p>  The NCSE, in consultation with the relevant education partners, must take into account the present and future potential need, location and sustainability in looking to establish special classes in certain areas.  In this regard the NCSE has advised that they are continuing to engage with schools in opening special classes where there is an identified need for special class provision and in order to ensure there are sufficient placements available to meet demand. </p>  <p>  Parents/guardians may contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs and to seek assistance in identifying placement options, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.</p></reply>

This has been made clear in the circular and the schedule of posts which accompanied it.  It has also been made clear in all of our communications with schools and with management bodies.  </p>  <p>  This means that there is now an obligation on schools to ensure that these hours are used for guidance activities.  Schools can decide to allocate more hours to guidance than the amount allocated on the schedule.  They cannot allocate fewer.  </p>  <p>  The guidance plan will outline the school's approach to guidance generally, and how students can be supported and assisted in making choices and successful transitions in the personal and social, educational and career areas.</p>  <p>  In line with best practice, and in line with practice in the Irish educational system for almost 20 years, the allocation of these hours within the school take place in accordance with the Whole School Guidance Plan.  </p>  <p>  The guidance counsellor will form a central part of the plan, which sets out how the entire resources of the school will work towards achieving the best possible outcomes for the students in the guidance area.  It is likely that the vast majority of these activities will be delivered by guidance counsellors; however, in many schools it will be decided that some activities may be delivered by other staff members - eg year heads.  These decisions will depend on the specific needs of the student population.</p>  <p>  My Department has also made it clear that schools' guidance plans should include specified time allocation for guidance counsellors to be available for one to one guidance counselling, and time allocation for the role in supporting the organisation and work of the Student Support Team.</p>  <p>  As part of the Whole School Evaluation process, inspectors in the Department of Education and Skills examine guidance provision in schools, including confirming that a whole-school guidance plan is in place.  The Department's Inspectorate also has a specific programme of guidance inspections in schools.</p>  <p>  Following a school inspection any recommendations made by an inspector will be communicated to the school, and the Board of Management and patron body will be required to implement these recommendations.  The Inspectorate carry out follow-through inspections to monitor compliance by schools with recommendations made.</p>  <p>  The Department, in determining its inspection programme for schools, will take into account all information available to it, including where a complaint has been made regarding non-compliance, and decisions around inspections will be based on this information. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-04-05a.178.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017040500072#WRE02000"><p>The Deputy may be interested in the legal framework applicable to young offenders and the activities and services funded by my Department which support the operation of the law in this area.  </p>  <p>  Statutory provision in relation to young offenders is set out in the Children Act 2001 (as amended).  Accordingly, where a young person under the age of 18 comes into conflict with the law, the principles of the Act apply.  A key principle in the Act is that detention should be a last resort.  In support of this principle, the legislation facilitates the incremental application of a series of measures, ranging from diversion in the first instance through community based sanctions, to detention.</p>  <p>  The first main filter in the youth justice system is the Diversion Programme operated by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, involving at different stages and depending on the seriousness of the offence, the informal caution (without supervision) and the formal caution (with supervision), including possible involvement with a Garda Youth Diversion Project.  The second main filter is the range of non-custodial sanctions available to the courts including court orders for dismissal; conditional discharge; the payment of fines, costs or compensation; the binding over of parents; and orders imposing community sanctions supervised by the Probation Service. In supervising community sanctions, the Probation Service utilises a number of community based organisations with dedicated resources to work with young offenders.  </p>  <p>  Finally and as a last resort, detention in the Oberstown Children Detention Campus may be used.  In this regard, I should mention that my colleague the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Dr. Katherine Zappone recently announced the roll-out of a pilot Bail Supervision Scheme for young people which will assist them in complying with their bail conditions pending the hearing of their case.  International evidence suggests that this scheme should impact remand trends by offering the court a new option &lsquo;bail with supervision&rsquo; as an alternative to a remand in detention.  This alternative option should also help a young person to moderate their chaotic circumstances and promote greater stability. </p>  <p>  It will be seen, therefore, that the focus under the law is to adopt a graduated approach which in the main serves to keep the vast majority of young offenders out of the criminal justice system.  The Deputy might wish to note that in its 2015 Report, the statutory committee to monitor the effectiveness of the Diversion Programme reported that 74% of children referred to the Diversion Programme were admitted to it, thereby keeping them out of the criminal justice system and away from the potential negative influence of more serious recidivist offenders.  The report also highlighted that 71% of children referred to the Programme were referred only once that year.</p>  <p>  The operation of the above statutory framework is substantially supported by the significant investment by my Department through the Irish Youth Justice Service in community based programmes which are directed at diverting young people from further involvement in criminal or anti-social behaviour. These youth justice community programmes, which are managed by Community Based Organisations, proceed on the basis of evidence that diversion programmes in the form of high quality preventative intervention can do more to reduce crime than more costly custodial sanctions. </p>  <p>  In 2017, approximately &euro;21m, inclusive of &euro;4m in Dormant Accounts Fund monies, will be allocated by my Department to Garda Youth Diversion Projects, Young Persons Probation Projects and other community based youth justice initiatives around the country. This substantial investment in community level youth justice projects and activities is managed in partnership with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Probation Service.  I might also point out that all 105 Garda Youth Diversion Projects and four of the eighteen Young Persons Probation Projects are part supported by the Irish Government and the European Social Fund (ESF) as part of the ESF Programme for Employability, Inclusion and Learning (PEIL) 2014-2020.  The projects attract this EU funding as a social inclusion measure which increases the education and employment opportunities available to young people in addition to diverting them from any further involvement with the criminal justice system.  </p>  <p>  The purpose of this investment in youth crime intervention work is to engage young people in a process of learning and development that enables them to make positive lifestyle choices.  The targeted supports involved seek to provide participants with the life skills that help them to make positive choices and desist from criminal and anti-social behaviour which in turn will enable them to be positive contributors to society.  Project activities are wide and varied focusing on the specific risk and needs of young offenders which in the case of the Garda Youth Diversion Projects are assessed upon their referral into a project.  Each project develops a tailored suite of interventions to use with each young person based on the risks and needs identified.  Examples of activities undertaken across the projects include education and employment related programmes, peer relations programmes, substance abuse programmes, personality and behaviour related programmes with referral to appropriate agencies where required, leisure and recreation programmes, family and parenting related programmes, etc.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is probably aware, the Youth Action Project Sligo (YAPS) Garda Youth Diversion Project serves Sligo Town and its environs. In 2016 the Project's catchment area was extended in the Sligo/Leitrim area. The YAPS Project engages with young people in Leitrim in youth centres based in Manorhamilton and Drumshanbo by way of outreach support.  The Monitoring Committee referred to above reported in 2015 that some 153 young people in the Sligo/Leitrim area were referred to the Diversion Programme that year, down 4% on the number of referrals in 2014.  Recent information in relation to youth crime in County Sligo and County Leitrim indicates that theft from shops, breach of bail and public order offences are the three most common offences in the catchment area. Nationally, theft and related offences, public order and damage to property were the main categories of offences for which children were referred to the Diversion Programme in 2015. In 2017, my Department through the Irish Youth Justice Service is providing &euro;116,500 to the YAPS Project.</p></reply>

Section 117(1) of the Act requires the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate to benchmark their recommendations by reference to the best standards of comparable police services.  Arising from this requirement, every inspection conducted by the Garda Inspectorate, and any recommendation arising, has involved examining and taking account of policing practices in other jurisdictions. </p><p>The Garda Professional Standards Unit, which was established under Section 24 of the 2005 Act, undertakes reviews, as directed by the Garda Commissioner, into operational, administrative and management matters relating to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at all levels.  Arising from these reviews, the Unit proposes measures to improve performance and promote the highest standards of practice throughout the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with reference to those of comparable police services.  The Garda Commissioner, on an ongoing basis, draws on the Unit's proposals to enhance policing practices and policies. </p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the Garda Commissioner published her Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 in June 2016.  This Programme includes recommendations from the various Garda Inspectorate Reports including the most recent Inspectorate Reports - 'Crime Investigation' and 'Changing Policing in Ireland'.</p><p>Key reforms being implemented include the replacement of the current District model of policing with a Divisional model where responsibilities will be allocated on a functional rather than geographical basis.  This will be subject to modifications to ensure the close relationship with communities is maintained in large rural Divisions.  In line with international norms, a medium term target of 20% civilians to be achieved by 2021 has been set. </p><p>The implementation of the Modernisation and Renewal Programme is primarily a matter for the Commissioner.  However, the Government decided that the Policing Authority should be requested, in accordance with section 117(A) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 (as amended), to monitor the implementation of the agreed recommendations in 'Changing Policing in Ireland' and to report to me at regular intervals.  I have received the first such progress report from the Policing Authority. Their next progress report is due by the end of April. </p><p>In July, the Government approved a Five Year Reform and High Level Workforce Plan for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This Plan marries the agreed recommendations in 'Changing Policing in Ireland' with a major investment programme that will increase the number of garda&iacute; to 15,000; double the number of civilians to 4,000; and more than double the number of reserves members to 2,000.  This investment in human capital is supported by a &euro;300 million capital plan that will deliver leading-edge technology and other capital infrastructure to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The 2017 Estimates reflect this commitment by providing the resources to recruit 800 garda&iacute;, 500 civilians and 300 reserves in 2017.  </p><p>Separately, I am advised that the Garda Inspectorate and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are working towards the production, in tabular form, of a current implementation status report of the recommendations contained in a number of Garda Inspectorate Reports and this report will be published on the Inspectorate's website when it is completed.  </p><p>The Deputy will be aware that at yesterday's Government meeting I received approval to begin the process of establishing a Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.  I expect that the Commission will have regard to best policing practice internationally.</p></reply>

The question of not returning a person to a place where certain fundamental rights would be breached (or <i>non refoulement</i>as it is commonly referred to) is fully considered in every case when deciding whether or not to make a deportation order.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-04-05a.203.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017040500073#WRF00700"><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 was enacted on the 22nd of February 2017.  The Act contains provisions which strengthen existing criminal law in combatting child exploitation and, in particular, address the use of modern communication technologies as a tool which may lead to child sexual exploitation. </p>  <p>  Section 8 of the Act creates two offences.  The first criminalises persons who contact children either online or through mobile communications such as text messaging for the purpose of sexually exploiting the child.  This offence is targeted at the initial stages of grooming and does not require physical contact or meeting between the adult and child in question.  The offence does not necessarily require that the communication contain a sexual advance or include sexual material as these are not generally features of sophisticated grooming.  This offence carries a penalty of up to 14 years&rsquo; imprisonment.  </p>  <p>  Section 8 also includes an offence of sending sexually explicit material to a child.  This offence protects children from unwarranted and unwanted advances.  There is also recognition that the intention behind this type of activity may be to expose the child to such material with a view to developing the child&rsquo;s familiarity with such material or activity.  The penalty for this offence is up to 5 years&rsquo; imprisonment.   </p>  <p>  In relation to the broader area of safety online which would include children as well as adults, the Law Reform Commission published its Report on Harmful Communications and Digital Safety in September 2016.  While noting the positive benefits to society of the interconnected digital world in which we live, the report also noted the emerging trend to engage in online communications that cause significant harm to others. </p>  <p>  In December 2016, the Government gave its approval for the drafting of a General Scheme of a Bill which would provide for new and amended criminal offences along the lines set out in that report.  It is intended that this Bill will address the criminal law aspects of the Law Reform Commission&rsquo;s report.  The Commission has proposed extending some existing offences and creating some new criminal offences specific to digital communications.  The precise formulation of the offences will be subject to review and potential variation during the drafting of the General Scheme.</p>  <p>  While it is not feasible to regulate or monitor the internet in anticipation of all possible incidents such as cyberbullying, if a member of the public becomes aware of activity on the internet which they suspect may be illegal, they can report it confidentially to Hotline.ie which is operated by the Internet Service Providers Association of Ireland with oversight by the Office for Internet Safety (OIS) in my Department.  Hotline.ie provides the public with the means to report illegal online content, such as child sexual abuse material and liaises with an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as appropriate, to have illegal content taken down. </p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has an arrangement in place with a large internet service provider to block access to child sexual abuse content in accordance with a list they provide.  Among the aims of this initiative is to reduce inadvertent viewing by members of the public, including children, of this illegal material.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also has a Schools Programme where personal safety issues, including online safety, are highlighted and discussed with children and young people in schools.</p>  <p>  In order to assist the public to stay safe on the internet, the OIS in my Department has a series of booklets aimed at parents.  The booklets provide information on various aspects of internet safety including filtering, using social networking sites and cyberbullying.  The booklet on cyberbullying gives information on such matters as prevention and key advice for children, young people and parents including advice for parents who suspect that their own child may be a cyberbully.  These information resources are made available free of charge on the OIS website and also in hard copy on request.  The website also contains a wide range of information and links to further resources on internet safety.  </p>  <p>  With regard to the request for information on the prevalence of reported cases of these activities, I have asked the Garda Authorities for this information and I will furnish it to the Deputy as soon as it is available to me.</p></reply>

Subsequently, following receipt of a health and safety report from the Office Public Works in 2010, it was decided that Wicklow Courthouse no longer offered a safe environment for court users or the general public and so all sittings of the courts, including the District Court, transferred to Bray Courthouse from September 2010. </p><p>The Courts Service has also informed me that a number of years ago they acquired a site adjacent to Wicklow town courthouse with the objective of refurbishing and extending the existing building.

The position in relation to the provision of translation services is unchanged: the current service provider is contractually obliged to provide such services in a professional manner and in accordance with industry standards.  Free online translation services are not used by the International Protection office (IPO).</p><p>The Chief International Protection Officer (CIPO) who, under the International Protection Act 2015, is independent in the performance of his functions, has further informed me that the quality of all translations provided is kept under constant review, both by the contractor and by the IPO.  Any issues raised regarding the quality of translations are immediately addressed as part of this ongoing quality review.  As part of this process, the CIPO has advised me that the IPO is engaged with the service provider at present about a number of quality issues in respect of the Application for International Protection Questionnaire.  The IPO will be in contact with any applicants who may be impacted, if required, when the quality review has been completed.</p><p>On the issue of the return of questionnaires, may I refer the Deputy to my responses to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 86, 88, 89 and 102 of 23 February, 2017.  The Application for International Protection Questionnaire (IPO 2) is designed to be used by the IPO on an ongoing basis and not just as part of the transition arrangements, therefore the questionnaire does not, and cannot indicate any time-frame for its return.  The indicated time-frame for return is detailed with the accompanying documentation.</p><p>As I have stated previously, I can inform the Deputy that the information sent to transition applicants in January- February 2017 made clear in Paragraph 7.3 that the IPO 2 Questionnaire should be returned <i>'if possible</i>, no later than 20 working days from the date of the covering letter'.  The next paragraph 7.4 went on to state clearly that opportunities to add to the information supplied exist up to two weeks, <i>'if you are in a position to do so,' </i>before the scheduled interview in order to '<i>facilitate the translation of documents if required and ensure that the IPO interviewer has all your papers available and considered in advance of the interview date</i>'.  The word deadline or statutory deadline does not appear and no negative consequences for failing to meet an 'if possible' time-frame were included or implied.  The twenty working day time-frame reflects the willingness of the IPO to begin work on the new single procedure as soon as possible in respect of legacy applications, particularly those in prioritised categories, and a satisfactory number of applicants were in a position to respond promptly, allowing the single application process to commence.</p><p>I am happy to restate that this is purely an administrative time-frame and NGOs and service providers have been informed of that throughout the planning process.  Flexibility is being provided by the IPO in recognition of the complexity of the process for applicants affected by the transition provisions and the demands placed on their legal advisors by the transitional arrangements - the wisdom of accessing legal advice is stressed in the Questionnaire.  A call centre is available to answer any queries and extra time is available if required for the completion of the IPO 2 Questionnaire.  It can be seen therefore that no impediment or disadvantage exists to prevent the careful filling out of the new single application form.  I understand, so as to remove any false impressions that may be circulating abroad that the 'if possible' time frame is some sort of statutory deadline, that the IPO has written to the members of the Customer Liaison Panel to confirm the arrangements and that similar clarification has been provided on the IPO website.  </p><p>The CIPO informs me that adherence to time-frames helps to ensure that the work of the Office continues and that applicants get timely decisions, particularly those in prioritised categories.  For those applications which have been made since the commencement of the 2015 Act i.e. on or after 31 December 2016, and are not affected by the complex transition provisions, the IPO is asking those applicants to adhere to the time-frames indicated in their accompanying documentation.  However, flexibility continues to be afforded to this group of applicants, if, for example, they are waiting on legal advice.</p><p>Applicants have a duty to cooperate as set out in Section 27 of the International Protection Act 2015 (the 2015 Act) and there are consequences for failing to cooperate set out in Section 38, therefore it is entirely appropriate and necessary to include an alert in the Questionnaire.  It should also be noted that Section 38 of the 2015 Act, which deals with the consequences of non-cooperation, sets out specifically the procedure to be followed in these cases and gives applicants ample opportunities to address any potential non-cooperation issues.</p><p>In relation to the availability of the Questionnaire, under the 2015 Act, applicants are required to apply in person for international protection either at the frontier of within the State.  At their time of application and in line with the requirements of the 2015 Act, applicants are fingerprinted, photographed, issued a reference number and a temporary Residence Certificate.  Normally at that time, the IPO provides the IPO 2 Questionnaire and an accompanying information pack.  In order to maintain the integrity of the Questionnaire and the application process generally, it has never been the practice to make the questionnaire available publicly or online.  Such publication would leave the process open to abuse by non-applicants and those who are not at the frontier or within the State as required by law.  Additional copies of the Questionnaire are, however, provided to applicants and their legal representatives on request, once their application reference numbers have been assigned.</p></reply>

The Directive and Regulations are primarily a matter for the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  These Regulations are enforced by the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, ComReg and the Central Bank, the latter having specific responsibility in relation to financial service matters.  While these Regulations are enforced by the three aforementioned bodies, it is ultimately a matter for the Courts to determine whether a specific term of a contract is unfair having regard to the features of the contract.</p><p>The raising of this issue once again underlines the critical importance of those who are in mortgage arrears and who have been issued with legal proceedings, engaging with their lender and with the court processes.  Relevant court processes provide various forms of protection under the Insolvency Acts and the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2013.  In addition, they will also have the possibility of availing of the free legal and financial advice services provided for under the Government&rsquo;s Abhaile service launched in October 2016.　</p><p>The latter initiative allows those who are in danger of losing their home to avail of free professional advice, including advice from a Personal Insolvency Practitioner.  Under this Scheme, home owners who are in arrears on their home mortgage and at risk of losing their homes are provided with access to free independent expert financial and legal advice and assistance, so that a solution can be put in place that will deal with their debt and keep them in their home, where that is a sustainable option.</p><p>The Abhaile service is in addition to the help already available from Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) to homeowners in mortgage arrears.  This includes the presence of MABS court mentors at all Circuit Court repossession hearings across the country to provide information and assistance to unrepresented borrowers; and providing in-house dedicated Mortgage Arrears advisers in MABS offices across the country, specifically to assist and negotiate on behalf of borrowers in mortgage arrears.  <b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p></reply>

A person guilty of theft is liable to a penalty of a fine or up to ten years' imprisonment or both.  The Deputy may also wish to note that the offence of robbery, under section 14 of that Act, is committed where a person steals, and immediately before or at the time of doing so, and in order to do so, uses force on any person or puts or seeks to put any person in fear of being then and there subjected to force.  This offence carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.  Under section 53 of the Act, where the facts of a case constitute a minor offence, the defendant may be tried summarily if certain conditions are met.  In that event, the maximum penalty that may be imposed is 12 months' imprisonment or a class A fine. </p>  <p>  A person who commits an assault may also be convicted of an offence under the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997.  The offences in this Act include assault (section 2), carrying a penalty of up to 6 months' imprisonment or a fine or both, assault causing harm (section 3), carrying a penalty of up to 5 years' imprisonment or fine or both and assault causing serious harm (section 4), which carries a penalty of up to life imprisonment or a fine or both.  </p>  <p>  In determining the sentence to be imposed in any particular case, the trial judge may take into account all the circumstances of the case, including any aggravating or mitigating factors. </p>  <p>  Having regard to this, I am satisfied that the penalties which apply in this area are sufficient.  While I do not have any plans at present to amend the legislation, I will continue to keep the matter under review.</p></reply>

However, these persons could qualify under the Civil Legal Aid Scheme or the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme should they meet the required criteria. </p><p>The provision of civil legal aid in the State is delivered through the Legal Aid Board which administers the Civil Legal Aid Scheme on foot of the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995 (as amended) and the Civil Legal Aid Regulations 1996 to 2016.  All applicants for civil legal aid and advice are required to meet a merit test and financial eligibility criteria under section 29 of the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995 and the Civil Legal Aid Regulations 1996 to 2016.  The vast majority of applicants granted legal aid and advice are also required to pay some contribution, with some exceptions, such as in regard to defence of District Court child care proceedings and  in representation of victims in rape trials.  In addition, there are some matters for which there are no financial eligibility criteria, such as legal services provided as part of Abhaile, the Government&rsquo;s Mortgage Arrears Resolution Service, to a person who satisfies the criteria for admission to that scheme.</p><p>It should also be noted that the Civil Legal Aid Act provides that the Legal Aid Board may waive any contribution payable or accept a lower contribution on the grounds that a failure to do so would cause undue hardship to the applicant. The Legal Aid Board has a policy role in relation to the provision of civil legal aid and periodically brings proposals to my Department in relation to the financial eligibility and other criteria in relation to civil legal aid.  I understand that the Legal Aid Board are to consider the criteria in 2017 and I will consider any proposal it may make in due course.</p><p>The Deputy will also be aware that the Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act 1962, which is the primary legislation covering the operation of the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme, provides that free legal aid may be granted, in certain circumstances, for the defence of persons of insufficient means in criminal proceedings.  Under the 1962 Act, the courts, through the judiciary, are responsible for the granting of legal aid.  My Department is responsible for the payment of fees and expenses to the legal practitioners.  I have no function in the day to day operation of the scheme, the assignment of lawyers or the granting of aid which are matters for the court and, as such, are handled by the judiciary.</p><p>In regard to standard court fees, I wish to inform the Deputy that fees charged in the courts are set by means of Statutory Instrument.  Court fees orders are made by myself as the Minister for Justice and Equality with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  The Courts Service keeps its fee structure under continuous review in accordance with the power given to it under the Courts Service Act.</p></reply>

Under the Constitution, the State is obliged to provide an accused person with the means to obtain appropriate legal representation.  Moreover, the European Convention on Human Rights provides that every person charged with a criminal offence is entitled to defend themselves in person or through legal assistance of their own choosing, if they have insufficient means to pay for legal assistance, to be given it free when the interests of justice so require. </p><p><b><i>Civil Legal Aid</i></b><b></b></p><p>The Legal Aid Board, established under the Civil Legal Aid Act, 1995 provides civil legal aid and advice to persons of limited means, who cannot afford to pay a solicitor privately.  The Legal Aid Board operates 30 full time law centres and a number of part time law centres in Ireland.  The Board also provides mediation services in 17 offices around the country to help separating couples to negotiate their own agreement. </p><p>It is not possible to extract and isolate the total cost of civil legal aid in any one office/county in a given year as it would be necessary to devise a basis on which to attribute, to each county, all expenditure incurred by the Board centrally.  Complexities may also arise at local level with regard to the delivery of civil legal aid; for example a client living in County Limerick may choose to apply to Ennis Law Centre.  Also, in a case where two parties to a dispute seek the services of the Board at one law centre, one party will be required to engage with a different law centre, which may be in a neighbouring county. </p><p>The majority of the Board's income consists of a grant received from the Department of Justice and Equality.  Funding provided by the Government from the year 2009 to 2016 totals almost &euro;264 million, the breakdown of which is shown in the following table.  This funding is used to provide the Board's services in all its offices across the country, as well as the support services provided to law centres centrally from the Board's head office.<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Amount of Expenditure (&euro;)</th></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>&euro;34,640,000</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>&euro;32,370,000</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>&euro;30,370,000</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>&euro;32,922,000</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>&euro;33,759,000</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>&euro;32,574,000</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>&euro;32,471,000</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>&euro;34,838,000</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Of these, local authorities confirmed demand for 2,748 of these properties.  Of these, 2,378 properties have been delivered or contracted for delivery to local authorities and approved housing bodies for use as social housing.  It is important to note that NAMA has no role in identifying the suitability of these properties for social housing and has no involvement in the selection of occupants for these properties. </p>  <p>  To facilitate the delivery of these residential properties, NAMA established a special purpose vehicle, National Asset Residential Property Services ("NARPS").  The establishment of NARPS has streamlined social housing delivery to local authorities and approved housing bodies both by significantly reducing the up-front capital costs for local authorities in the delivery of these properties for use as social housing and by providing NAMA, the owner of NARPS, with an attractive commercial income stream.</p>  <p>  NARPS purchases properties directly from NAMA debtors and receivers, at market value.  NARPS then onward leases these properties to local authorities and approved housing bodies on long term (20 year 9 months) leases, which include an option for the local authorities or approved housing bodies to purchase the unit at market value towards the end of the lease term. </p>  <p>  Of the 2,378 houses and apartments delivered for social housing to end of last year, 1,019 of these were delivered through NARPS and a further 337 properties are contracted for acquisition by NARPS.  In 2016, 85% of all units delivered for social housing by NAMA were delivery through NARPS.  The NARPs portfolio comprises properties primarily located in Dublin (43%) and Cork (23%) and comprises 61% apartments and 39% houses.  </p>  <p>  As I discussed in my response to parliamentary questions 72 and 73 on 10 December 2015, NAMA has a number of potential options regarding its strategy for NARPS in the context of its overarching mandate.  Decisions relating to this strategy are a matter for the NAMA Board and I am advised that such matters are actively considered in the context of NAMA's ongoing activities.  To my knowledge - and I am assured I and my officials will remain informed - while such issues are actively considered, there are no immediate plans to dispose of NARPS.  Furthermore, while under active and ongoing consideration, there are no definitive plans regarding assets which may remain in NAMA when NAMA ceases, not least because the definitive composition of such assets cannot yet be known with certainty.</p>  <p>  NARPS is a subsidiary of NAMA and I assume that NAMA will have the opportunity to dispose of its interest in NARPS as part of its ongoing deleveraging.  However, it is important to note that regardless of the disposal option that is ultimately determined by the NAMA board, it is envisaged that the existing contractual agreements and long term leases between NARPS and the local authorities and approved housing bodies will remain in place and the rights of each party under those contracts will not be adversely affected.</p></reply>

To qualify for a Primary Medical Certificate, an applicant must be permanently and severely disabled within the terms of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994 and satisfy one of the following conditions:</p>  <p>  -  be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs;</p>  <p>  -  be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs;</p>  <p>  -  be without both hands or without both arms;</p>  <p>  -  be without one or both legs;</p>  <p>  -  be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg;</p>  <p>  -  have the medical condition of dwarfism and have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs. </p>  <p>  The Senior Medical Officer for the relevant local Health Service Executive administrative area makes a professional clinical determination as to whether an individual applicant satisfies the medical criteria.  A successful applicant is provided with a Primary Medical Certificate, which is required under the Regulations to claim the reliefs provided for in the Scheme.  An unsuccessful applicant can appeal the decision of the Senior Medical Officer to the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal, which makes a new clinical determination in respect of the individual.  The Regulations mandate that the Medical Board of Appeal is independent in the exercise of its functions to ensure the integrity of its clinical determinations.</p>  <p>  The criteria to qualify for the Scheme are necessarily precise and specific.  After six months a citizen can reapply if there is a deterioration in their condition.</p>  <p>  The Scheme represents a significant tax expenditure.  Between the Vehicle Registration Tax and VAT foregone, and fuel grant provided for members of the Scheme, the Scheme represented a cost of &euro;65.1 million in 2016.  This does not include the revenue foregone to the Local Government Fund in the respect of the relief from Motor Tax provided to members of the Scheme.  </p>  <p>  I recognise the important role that the Scheme plays in expanding the mobility of citizens with disabilities and that the relief has been maintained at current levels throughout the crisis despite the requirement for significant fiscal consolidation.  From time to time I receive representations from individuals who feel they would benefit from the Scheme but do not qualify under the six criteria.  While I have sympathy for these cases, given the scale and scope of the Scheme, I have no plans to expand the medical criteria beyond the six currently provided for in the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994.</p></reply>

This is a matter for the Board and Management of a bank itself. </p>  <p>  The recent Ulster Bank closures are a response to changing ways of banking due to less use of cash, increased use of technology and corresponding reduced visits to branches.  That said, I expect that Ulster Bank will do everything that it can to mitigate the impacts of these branch closures on local communities, including technology and the use of alternative means of service delivery.  I also expect that the bank will ensure that customers are kept informed about developments and provided with the appropriate assistance to move branches, switch to other banks and avail of alternative means of accessing financial services.  The Central Bank will also have a role in ensuring that consumer protection rules are followed.</p>  <p>  I understand from discussions with officials in Ulster Bank that their current intention is to retain an ATM at Arva and Cootehill, County Cavan, while Carrickmacross, County Monaghan will be served by a Mobile Bank which will operate in that area.  In all locations Ulster Bank are committed to working with the local community to ensure a service is maintained.</p>  <p>  Finally, the continued presence of a viable and active Ulster Bank in the Irish market will be important in fostering competition for banking services.

Individuals must first submit an application for the incentive to receive an indication of the level of tax relief that may be available to them, and subsequently submit a claim for a tax refund where they have entered into a contract to purchase or have commenced to self build.  The refund is generally payable to the contractor at the deposit stage in the case of a home purchase, or in the case of a self-build, is paid to the applicant when they have drawn down the first tranche of their mortgage.</p><p>Up to 31 March 2017 there were 4,698 applications made to Revenue in respect of the HTB incentive.

Work conducted in the Department to assess the potential economic and financial sector implications arising from Brexit, includes a scoping study in November 2015 under the Department of Finance-ESRI joint research programme; an initial short-term economic estimate published in the Summer Economic Statement 2016; an in-depth analysis of the possible sectorial and regional impacts of Brexit arising from Ireland's trade relationship with the UK, published with Budget 2017; and, a joint research paper with the ESRI that modelled the medium to long term macroeconomic impact of Brexit under a number of scenarios, including a WTO relationship.  All of these outputs have been made public. </p>  <p>  In April 2017, updated macroeconomic forecasts will be published by my Department, as part of the Stability Programme Update.</p>  <p>  We know from our own published research that the potential impact on the Irish economy is significant.  It is important to recognise that the full impact of the UK's exit is only expected to materialise over time.  As we cannot control the international environment, we will need to continue to improve our competitiveness, including by focussing on costs we can control, by boosting our productivity and ensuring sustainable public finances. </p>  <p>  The best and most immediate policy under the Government's control to counter the likely negative economic impacts of Brexit is to prudently manage the public finances in order to ensure that Ireland's economy continues to remain competitive in the face of future economic headwinds. </p>  <p>  Important steps have already been taken to prepare the economy.  In Budget 2017, I confirmed the Government's intention to establish a rainy day fund, to commence in 2019 after Ireland has achieved its Medium Term Objective under the EU's fiscal rules and is running balanced or surplus budgets; I also announced the Government's decision to set a new domestic target of a debt to GDP ratio of 45 percent to be reached by the mid-2020s, or thereafter, depending on economic growth.  These decisions will help to ensure that the public finances can withstand negative impacts from Brexit or other economic shocks.  Also in Budget 2017, I announced a number of sectorial measures to mitigate Brexit impacts in exposed sectors of the economy.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department are working closely with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) to assess the potential impact of Brexit on the SME sector.  The Deputy may also wish to note that, aside from the SBCI, there are significant Government measures to support the financing needs of SMEs that are facing challenges (over 170 supports are provided by 30 separate agencies).  These measures include the Supporting SMEs Online Tool, the Credit Guarantee Scheme, the Microenterprise Loan Fund, Local Enterprise Offices and the Credit Review Office.  These supports will play an important role in assisting companies and SMEs to meet the challenges of Brexit.</p>  <p>  Separately, Minister of State Eoghan Murphy T.D. has responsibility for Financial Services, including the implementation of the International Financial Services (IFS) 2020 Strategy.  Important work is ongoing, as part of IFS 2020, to ensure that we maximise opportunities for inward investment arising as a result of Brexit.</p>  <p>  We are now at the start of a process within which there is expected to be a number of phases.  The Department of Finance contingency work continues to examine all scenarios in relation to Brexit, and will continue to monitor the economic impacts, to carry out relevant analysis and to frame budgetary policy advice in this new context.  The work being done by the Department will help to ensure that Ireland will be in a position to respond to the economic challenges arising from Brexit and to ensure that Ireland's interests are protected in the upcoming negotiations at EU level.</p></reply>

This improvement has occurred notwithstanding the substantial appreciation of euro against sterling in the second half of last year, following the UK's vote to leave the EU last June.</p>  <p>  The gains in Irish competitiveness since 2008 have been hard-won through productivity improvements and wage and price moderation.  It is important that this competitiveness is preserved and continues to support growth.  This is all the more important given the risks posed by Brexit. </p>  <p>  We must be cognisant that favourable exchange rate movements can reverse, as can be seen for example in the strengthening of the euro against sterling last year.  Similarly, gains from the fall in oil prices may unwind in the future.  Indeed, the drag on consumer prices from low oil prices is already beginning to ease.  In addition, excessive rent and house price growth are also a potential threat to competitiveness. </p>  <p>  These risks highlight the importance of maintaining competitiveness oriented policies, including sustainable fiscal policies, to help address emerging uncertainties.  It is also important that at firm level, pay moves in line with productivity developments.</p></reply>

In this context, S.I. No. 47/2015 (the statutory instrument which implements the mortgage measures) provides that a "first-time buyer" means, "subject to paragraph (2), a borrower to whom no housing loan has ever before been advanced"; (paragraph 2 subsequently provides that where the borrower under a housing loan is more than one person and a housing loan has previously been advanced to any one of those persons, none of those persons is a first-time buyer).</p>  <p>  On the Revenue aspect, there are two schemes in the Taxes Consolidation Acts 1997 which provide assistance for first-time purchasers. Section 266A provides for a repayment of DIRT to first-time purchasers and was introduced by the 2014 Finance Act. Section 477C is the new Help-to-Buy scheme that was introduced by the 2016 Finance Act. For the purposes of these provisions, a first-time purchaser is an individual who has not, either individually or jointly with any other person or persons, previously purchased or previously built, directly or indirectly, on his or her own behalf a dwelling.</p>  <p>  It is a matter of fact whether an individual meets the requirements as a "first-time buyer" or "first-time purchaser" under the two different statutory frameworks. Where the position is unclear, for example where a person has their name added to a mortgage, the individual should provide full details to their proposed lender or to the Revenue Commissioners as appropriate so that they may consider the position and assist the individual.</p>  <p>  Under the Help-to-Buy Scheme, an individual who is aggrieved by a decision made by the Revenue Commissioners to refuse a claim may appeal that decision to the Appeal Commissioners within 30 days of the notice of the decision. Likewise, if an individual is unhappy with a decision made by a regulated financial service provider, the errors and complaints resolution provisions of the Consumer Protection Code will be available, and if necessary a complaint can be submitted to the independent Financial Services Ombudsman.</p></reply>

These Regulations set out an individual member savings limit of &euro;100,000. The Regulations introduced on 1 January 2016 also provided that credit unions could apply to the Central Bank to retain individual members' savings in excess of &euro;100,000, which were held at commencement of the Regulations and that Credit unions with total assets in excess of &euro;100m could apply to the Central Bank for approval to increase individual member savings in excess of &euro;100,000.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank have informed me that it is their duty to ensure that actions taken represent the best overall outcome, from the perspective of ensuring the protection of members' funds by credit unions and safeguarding the stability of the sector. A maximum individual member's savings limit of &euro;100,000 ensures the protection of members' savings and continue to ensure that credit unions' funding is sufficiently diversified and is not dependent on a small number of members. This cap is based on the savings amount protected under the Deposit Guarantee Scheme and would therefore ensure that no member of a credit union would lose any of their savings in the event of a resolution. It is aimed at protecting members' savings and also at protecting the financial stability of the sector, given the wider potential negative impact on the sector of any credit union member losing some of their savings.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank have further informed me that in relation to concerns raised regarding competition, they have been provided with specific regulation making powers by the Oireachtas in relation to credit unions. Where the Central Bank regulates one category of regulated entity by imposing specific regulatory requirements which may be different to those imposed on other categories of regulated entities, this simply reflects the nature of the distinct categories of entities involved. As in other areas of the regulatory framework, this limit takes account of the nature, scale and complexity of credit unions and is considered appropriate by the Central Bank at this time given the current credit union business model. </p>  <p>  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) has responsibility for enforcing Irish and EU competition law. More information on their role in this regard is available on their website, www.ccpc.ie.</p></reply>

The Teacher Conciliation Council is part of the scheme of Conciliation and Arbitration for Teachers and was set up to deal with claims and proposals relating to the Terms and Conditions of employment of teachers. The Council is composed of representatives of teachers, school management, the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and is chaired by an official of the Workplace Relations Commission.</p>  <p>  The Teacher Exchange scheme is open to primary teachers who are registered with the Teaching Council, have completed probation and who wish to exchange their posts for educational purposes. Educational purposes would include enabling teachers in primary schools to gain experience of teaching in different types of settings. The concept is that teachers will gain a different experience, enrich their knowledge and understanding of their professional work and share this understanding with colleagues.</p>  <p>  The minimum period for which an exchange may occur is one year and the maximum is five years. </p>  <p>  In 2016 the issue of this limit and the purpose of the scheme was reviewed under the auspices of Teachers Conciliation Council. Having considered the matter and taking into account all circumstances both the union and management partners considered that their preferred option is to retain the existing scheme as set out in the published circular.</p>  <p>  However, in response to a request for consideration of a voluntary transfer scheme for Primary Teachers from the Irish National Teachers&rsquo; Organisation, I have decided to extend the maximum period for which an exchange may occur for one further year.  </p>  <p>  This new voluntary transfer scheme is to be considered under the auspices of the Teacher Conciliation Council.  </p></reply>

While SOLAS offers a bursary to employers to encourage them to employ female apprentices, the number remains low.</p>  <p>  Currently the Apprenticeship Council is overseeing the expansion of the apprenticeship system into a range of new areas, following a call for proposals from employers and education and training providers.  The first of these new apprenticeships were launched in 2016, with the Insurance Practitioner Apprenticeship launching in September and the Industrial Electrical Engineer Apprenticeship getting underway in November.  We have already seen an increase in female participation in these new programmes with almost 40% of the initial intake on the Insurance Practitioner programme being female.  With further new apprenticeships getting underway in 2017, many of which are in sectors where there is a different gender balance in the workplace, it is expected, as these new apprenticeships are rolled out, that this will lead to a continued increase in female participation.</p>  <p>  The Department of Education and Skills, in conjunction with SOLAS, will review the pathways to participation in apprenticeship in a range of diverse groups, including female participation, in light of the broadening of the apprenticeship system into new areas.  The review will be completed in 2018 and any recommendations made will be implemented immediately.  A promotion campaign around opportunities for learners and employers in apprenticeship is getting underway.  This campaign will have a particular focus on encouraging women to engage in apprenticeship programmes.</p></reply>

No. 16863/17). </p>  <p>  The Government is committed to progressing the development of a dynamic and innovative education system that reflects the diversity of twenty-first Century Ireland.  The Programme for a Partnership Government reflects the Government&rsquo;s objective of strengthening parental choice and further expanding diversity in our school system.  The desire of parents for diversity in education is primarily being pursued by increasing the number of non-denominational and multi-denominational schools with a view to reaching 400 by 2030.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that on the 30th January, 2017, I  announced new plans aimed at providing more multi-denominational and non-denominational schools across the country, in line with the choices of families and school communities and the Programme for Government commitment in this area.</p>  <p>  This will involve the Education and Training Boards in the initial phase, as the State&rsquo;s local education authorities, identifying areas where there is likely to be demand for greater diversity and they will work with pre-school services to establish evidence of this demand among the cohort of pre-school parents.  There will then be discussions between individual ETBs and the existing patrons/landowners concerning the possible transfer of schools to accommodate this demonstrated demand for diversity.</p>  <p>  Each ETB will then prepare a report for the Department outlining the levels of demand within their functional areas and the responses of the existing patrons as to how this might be accommodated through the reconfiguration of existing school provision.  The location of these schools is therefore unlikely to become available until after the reports have been submitted.</p>  <p>  In the subsequent implementation phase, where the level of demand for multidenominational schools is sufficient to justify transfer of a school from denominational to multi-denominational patronage, a process will commence to give effect to that.  There will be a role for the existing patron/landowner in consulting with local community and school interests and taking into account proposals from different prospective multi-denominational patrons.  It is envisaged that transfers will largely be by way of voluntary transfer of live schools by existing patrons.</p>  <p>  While these new structures are being introduced, my Department will continue to work with the main stakeholders to progress delivery of diversity in areas already identified, in 2017 and beyond.  </p>  <p>  In addition to progressing the reconfiguration of existing school provision to provide greater choice to parents in areas of stable population, the Government is committed to ensuring that parental preferences will continue to be key to patronage decisions on new schools established in areas of demographic growth.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-04-05a.301.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017040500076#WRJ01100"><p>I wish to advise the Deputy that DES Circular 0013/2017 for primary schools and 0014/2017 for post primary schools were published on 7th March 2017.</p><p>These Circulars set out the details of the new model for allocating special education teachers to schools.</p><p>The revised allocation process replaces the generalised allocation process at primary and post primary school level for learning support and high incidence special educational needs, and the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) allocation process which provided additional resource teaching supports to schools, to support pupils assessed as having Low Incidence disabilities.</p><p>The new Special Education Teaching allocation provides a single unified allocation for special educational support teaching needs to each school, based on each school&rsquo;s educational profile.</p><p>Allocations based on the school profiles were issued to all schools on 7th March.  Details of the special education teaching allocations have also been published on the NCSE website.</p><p>The aim of this new model is to deliver better outcomes for children with special educational needs.  Substantial research, analysis, consultation with service users and stakeholders, and piloting have gone in to the development of this model and all of the evidence points to the fact that this new system will deliver better outcomes for children. </p><p>No school will lose supports as a result of the implementation of the new model. In addition, no school will receive an allocation, for the support of pupils with complex needs, less than the allocation they received to support such pupils during the 2016/17 school year.  No allocation made for such pupils by the NCSE will be removed from schools as long as that pupil remains in the school. </p><p>An additional 900 teaching posts have been provided to support the introduction of this new allocation model.  The provision of an additional 900 teaching posts is a very significant investment in the provision of additional teaching support for pupils with special educational needs in our schools.  This is additional to an increase of 41% in the number of resource teachers allocated to schools annually by the NCSE since 2011. </p><p>The additional funding will provide additional supports to over 1,000 schools who are identified as needing additional supports as a result of the new model.  Supports for children with special educational needs is a key priority for this Government.  The new funding will ensure that all schools receive a sufficient allocation of special education needs resources to provide additional teaching support to all pupils, including pupils who have yet to enrol in their school, who require such support. </p><p>Under the new allocation model, schools will be provided with a total allocation which includes a baseline allocation for the school and an allocation based on the school&rsquo;s profile. </p><p>The provision of a profiled allocation will give a fairer allocation for each school which recognises that all schools need an allocation for special needs support, but which provides a graduated allocation which takes into account the actual level of need in each school. </p><p>Schools will be frontloaded with resources, based on each school&rsquo;s profile, to provide supports immediately to those pupils who need it without delay.  This will reduce the administrative burden on schools as schools will no longer have to complete an application process annually and apply for newly enrolled pupils who require resource hours.  Children who need support can have that support provided immediately rather than having to wait for a diagnosis.</p><p>Schools will therefore no longer have to make applications, for newly enrolled pupils for whom resource teaching hours may have been provided under the old model, or for pupils who have received a new diagnosis, as schools will now receive a single allocation for all of their special education teaching needs, based on their school size and profile.</p><p>The new allocations to schools will include provision to support all pupils in the schools, including where a child receives a diagnosis after the allocation is received by a school, or where there are newly enrolling pupils to the school.</p><p>All allocations to schools include a supplementary provision, which has been referred to as the &lsquo;baseline allocation&rsquo; which is allocated over and above the profiled allocation. </p><p>For students who start school from September 2017, with a specific diagnosis, either in junior infants or transferring from another school, the resources they need will already be in the school under the new model.  </p><p>It should be noted that this is a brand new model of allocation and is not comparable to the existing model.  By using a broad range of attainment and socio-economic criteria, it is expected that generally, a school&rsquo;s profile will remain relatively constant from year to year.  Each year, some students with additional teaching needs will leave and others will enrol, broadly balancing the school profile.  Resources allocated under this model will not normally be adjusted between allocations. </p><p>The NCSE has published details of the appeals process on the NCSE website: <i>www.ncse.ie</i>. </p><p>Schools were asked to submit appeals by March 31st 2017.The appeal process will consider whether the data used to calculate their school profile was correct and complete and whether it was correctly applied in the calculation of their 2017/18 allocation.</p><p>DES Circulars 0013/2017 and 0014/2017 outline the basis on which the Education Research Centre determined the allocations for all schools.  </p><p>The model will allow for some additional provision for exceptional circumstances or where a school&rsquo;s enrolment levels increase very substantially prior to the next review of the model.  The National Council for Special Education will support schools in managing their special education teaching allocations in the first instance. Only in very exceptional circumstances, where it can be demonstrated that the schools profile has changed very significantly since the allocation was made to the school, may an additional allocation of hours be made to the school. </p><p>Guidelines for schools on the organisation, deployment and use of their special education teachers to address the need of pupils with special educational needs are also being prepared and will be published shortly.</p><p>The Guidelines will support schools to reflect on how they can review and manage their timetabling practices to ensure the timetable is sufficiently flexible to meet the needs of all pupils in their school who have special needs.  The Guidelines encourage schools to ensure they deploy their resources appropriately to meet the needs of all of the children in their school who require additional teaching support, including pupils with emerging needs, or new entrants.</p></reply>

Indeed international research indicates that school leadership is second only to classroom teaching as an influence on pupil learning. </p>  <p>  Budget 2016 provided 250 posts to second level schools to enable Deputy Principals to be more fully available to assist the school principal with the leadership of the school. At primary level Budget 2016 provided for additional release days for teaching principals to range between 15 and 25 days depending on the size of the school. </p>  <p>  Budget 2017 has provided for the equivalent of 170 additional posts to second level schools to employ an additional Deputy Principal to assist the school principal with the leadership of the school. With effect from September 2017, schools with pupil enrolment in excess of 700 will be allocated additional Deputy Principal posts.</p>  <p>  Budget 2017 also provides for the commencement of the restoration of middle management posts in both the primary and post-primary sector. </p>  <p>  The recently established Centre for School Leadership (CSL) is a collaboration between my Department and the representative professional bodies for school principals. It has been created to offer professional and practical support to schools leaders. This support structure for leadership teams in schools will attempt to ensure that school leaders have opportunities to access, share and create knowledge and experience within their leadership roles. The work of the Centre draws on best international practice and research in the professional development of school leaders. Priorities for the Centre include a new post graduate qualification for aspiring school leaders, a mentoring programme for newly appointed school principals, coaching support for serving principals, a review and alignment of leadership programmes with Department standards. </p>  <p>  Last year my Department published &ldquo;Looking at Our School 2016", a quality framework for primary and post primary schools which is designed to support the efforts of teachers and school leaders, as well as the school system more generally, to strive for excellence in our schools. </p>  <p>  The current review of the post of responsibility structure in schools will, in the context of restoration of posts, address the further development of a distributed leadership model.</p></reply>

Other measures include the Student Assistance Fund and the Fund for Students with Disabilities. </p>  <p>  The Report of the Expert Group on Future Funding for Higher Education, published in July 2016, clearly outlines the funding challenges facing the higher education sector. The report also makes a number of recommendations for consideration for the future. As committed to in the Programme for Government, I have referred the report of the expert group to the relevant Oireachtas Committee for its consideration, in order to build political consensus on the most appropriate future funding model for the higher education sector.</p>  <p>  While the Cassells report deals with the medium and long term funding needs of higher education, we also have to consider the immediate challenges. In that context, I am pleased to have secured additional funding for the sector, in Budget 2017, for the first time in nine years. An additional &euro;36.5m has been made available in 2017 as part of a &euro;160m three year funding package. This includes &euro;8.5m for access measures, including the reintroduction of postgraduate maintenance grants for the most disadvantaged students. This additional money will allow the sector keep pace with demographic increases and introduce targeted initiatives in areas such as disadvantage, skills, research and flexible learning. Among those who will benefit from the additional third level funding being made available are students from disadvantaged backgrounds, lone parents, and Travellers.</p>  <p>  In addition, my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform are currently undertaking a public consultation process on a proposed Exchequer-Employer investment mechanism for higher education and further education and training. It is estimated that the mechanism, which proposes an increase in the National Training Fund levy from 0.7% to 1% between 2018 and 2020, could yield close to an additional &euro;200m revenue in 2020.

These included pay reductions and also reductions to the pay of new entrant public servants, including teachers, since 2011. Collective agreements reached between the Government and the public service unions provided vital industrial peace during this very difficult period for the State.</p><p>The Lansdowne Road Agreement has allowed a programme of restoration to start. I have used this to negotiate substantial improvements in pay for new teachers. The agreement reached with TUI and INTO will see pay rises of between 15-22% (between &euro;4600 and &euro;6700) for new entrant teachers. </p><p>I accept that ASTI members had outstanding pay demands and that the deal did not travel the full distance that they set out to achieve.  However, it has restored an estimated 75% of the difference in pay for more recently recruited teachers and delivers full equality at later points in the scale. This is substantial progress and strikes an equitable balance with other claims for funding on my Department, particularly needs such as enhanced services for children with special educational needs, for disadvantaged schools, for growing schools, for higher education and for apprenticeships. The door remains open to the trade union movement seeking to advance this issue further in the context of future public service pay talks.</p><p>In education, there is a well-established increment system. Teachers are not paid equally. For example, the pay scale for teachers appointed prior to 2011 ranges from &euro;32,009 to &euro;60,155 depending on the date that the individual began teaching. Part of the negotiation to date has secured a convergence of the scales of recruits at different periods. Any further negotiation on new entrant pay cannot focus on just one sector. A broader assessment of pay and new entrant pay will be informed by the analysis of the Public Service Pay Commission.</p><p>Following discussions, the Teachers Conciliation Council published a set of proposals in November for consideration by ASTI members aimed at finding a resolution to their dispute. </p><p>The proposals provided ASTI members with an opportunity to benefit from the programme of pay restoration I mentioned above, including the agreement reached with TUI and INTO, which will see pay rises of between 15-22% (between &euro;4600 and &euro;6700) for new entrant teachers. </p><p>In addition, there were other immediate undoubted benefits for individual ASTI members in accepting the proposals including:</p><p>- Avoiding an increment freeze</p><p>- Inclusion of the S&amp;amp;S allowance of &euro;1,592 into the pay scale</p><p>- Continued alleviation of the FEMPI Act pay reductions</p><p>- The Ward Report measures and a revised sequence for filling posts which enable fixed-term and part-time teachers to gain permanent, full-time jobs more easily and quickly than before</p><p>- An increase in the quantum of the Croke Park hours that can be worked on other than a whole-school basis</p><p>- A review of the usage of the Croke Park hours</p><p>- Protection against compulsory redundancy</p><p>- The &euro;1,000 increase now being paid to public servants on 1 April 2017, brought forward from 1 September 2017 under the LRA.</p><p>ASTI members have voted to reject the proposals put forward aimed at resolving their dispute and in consequence, to reject the Lansdowne Road Agreement.

The central vision of the Plan is that the Irish Education and Training System should become the best in Europe over the next decade.  The Plan&rsquo;s high-level goals are based on the five policy areas which I believe will help us to achieve this ambition. The goals are:</p>  <p>  1. Improve the learning experience and the success of learners</p>  <p>  2. Improve the progress of learners at risk of educational disadvantage or learners with special educational needs</p>  <p>  3. Help those delivering education services to continuously improve</p>  <p>  4. Build stronger bridges between education and wider community</p>  <p>  5. Improve national planning and support services</p>  <p>  The basic aim of this Government is to sustain our economic progress and use it to build a fair and compassionate society.  Education is the best means of delivering a fairer society, breaking down cycles of disadvantage and ensuring that all our people, in particular those with special educational needs, are able to participate in that progress and fulfil their potential.  Excellent and innovative education and training are the pivot around which personal fulfilment, a fair society and a successful nation should revolve.  It is central to sustaining economic success and in converting economic success into building a strong community.  Having the best education and training service in Europe will allow us to provide better opportunities for more people from disadvantaged groups, as well as ensuring that we create more sustainable well-paying jobs.</p>  <p>  Our approach to special education has undergone a huge transformation with a growing proportion of children with special educational needs being educated with their peers in mainstream schools.  The participation and progress of learners with special educational needs across the whole education system remains a key focus with an emphasis on improving whole-school and whole system approaches.  The Action Plan 2017 sets out a range of measures which will be undertaken during this year.  These include allocating teachers to schools under the new allocation model to support children with special educational needs, publishing the outcomes of a comprehensive review of the SNA scheme, and consult with partners on the implementation of sections of the EPSEN Act and on the provision of services to children with Down Syndrome. </p>  <p>  Quality of provision is the cornerstone to the success of the education and training system.  We recognise the fundamental roles that leaders, teachers and support staff play and we want to strengthen the system&rsquo;s capacity to continuously improve and to deliver the highest quality education and training services for learners.  The Action Plan 2017 details actions which will ensure that leadership, management, quality frameworks, teaching methods, and initial and continuing training are all operating to the highest standards across the continuum of education and training provision.  These actions include expanding the range of supports available through the Centre for School Leadership, providing dedicated professional support to teachers to support the implementation of curricular and policy change, and developing and introducing a new postgraduate qualification for aspiring school leaders.</p>  <p>  To become an innovation leader and to build a strong talent base, we as a nation must effectively engage with enterprise.  We must work to address identified skills needs in critical areas, and recognise the shifting global economic and political climate in which services are delivered and jobs are created.  Successful enterprise engagement is the foundation of much of the planned activity detailed in the Action Plan 2017.  This includes driving the growth of traineeships and apprenticeships, ensuring the relevance of work placements and work-based projects, and increasing the diversity of opportunity in learning beyond school.  </p>  <p>  In order to ensure that progress is made in all of these areas, including helping children with special needs, supporting schools and building a stronger bridge between education and the workplace, updated annual Action Plans will be published each year, detailing the actions that will be implemented during that year.  As part of this process, actions will be monitored against published timelines and progress reports will be published on a quarterly basis.</p></reply>

This will contribute to delivering a step-change in the development of critical skills, knowledge and competences and providing the foundations for participation in work and society. </p>  <p>  The roll-out of the new Leaving Certificate subject of Politics and Society commenced in 41 schools in September 2016, following an open invitation to introduce this as an optional Leaving Certificate subject.  Politics and Society aims to develop the student's ability to be a reflective and active citizen, in a way that is informed by the insights and skills of social and political science.  The introduction of the specification was part of my Department's commemoration of 1916 and its commitment to education for sustainable development.  The subject will be available to all schools from 2018. </p>  <p>  The Government is committed to enhancing the availability of technology in schools through the introduction of ICT/Computer Science as a Leaving Certificate subject.  As set out in the Action Plan for Education 2016-2019, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) is conducting a scoping exercise in this regard. Informed by this research, the NCCA are working on development of a draft subject specification in 2017, with a view to implementation in schools in September 2018. </p>  <p>  Physical Education has been developed by the NCCA as a full subject that can be assessed for the Leaving Certificate in a manner similar to other subjects.  I have approved a Senior Cycle Framework for PE - non-examinable, and a Leaving Certificate PE specification - an examinable subject for Leaving Certificate. </p>  <p>  The Framework will assist schools to design a P.E. programme for those students who may not choose to take P.E. as part of their Leaving Certificate examination.  These developments are in keeping with the strong emphasis from my Department on promoting and encouraging Healthy Lifestyles for all students and commitments in the Programme for Partnership Government. </p>  <p>  The Action Plan for Education also includes commitments to finalise and implement additional subject specifications at Leaving Certificate level as resources permit.</p></reply>

At primary level, Budget 2016 provided for additional release days for teaching principals to range between 15 and 25 days depending on the size of the school. </p>  <p>  Budget 2017 provided for an additional &euro;7.75m to strengthen school leadership which has provided for the equivalent of 170 additional posts to second level schools to employ an additional Deputy Principal to assist the school principal with the leadership of the school.  With effect from September 2017, schools with pupil enrolment in excess of 700 will be allocated additional Deputy Principal posts.</p>  <p>  Budget 2017 also provides for the commencement of the restoration of middle management posts in both the primary and post-primary sector with effect from the 2017/18 school year.</p>  <p>  The recently established Centre for School Leadership (CSL) is a collaboration between my Department and the representative professional bodies for school principals.  It has been created to offer professional and practical support to schools leaders.  This support structure for leadership teams in schools will attempt to ensure that school leaders have opportunities to access, share and create knowledge and experience within their leadership roles.  The work of the Centre draws on best international practice and research in the professional development of school leaders.  Priorities for the Centre include a new post graduate qualification for aspiring school leaders, a mentoring programme for newly appointed school principals, coaching support for serving principals, a review and alignment of leadership programmes with Department standards.</p>  <p>  Last year my Department published &ldquo;Looking at Our School 2016", a quality framework for primary and post primary schools which is designed to support the efforts of teachers and school leaders, as well as the school system more generally, to strive for excellence in our schools.</p>  <p>  The current review of the post of responsibility structure in schools will, in the context of restoration of posts, address the further development of a distributed leadership model.</p></reply>

The quality of our teaching profession is the single most critical factor in sustaining and enhancing the quality of education outcomes in our system.  We know that providing the best possible professional development and ongoing practical support to these key people in the education sector is vital if we are to realise the ambitious objectives that we have for Irish education.  Specific targets for 2017 are outlined in the Action Plan for Education.</p>  <p>  My Department spent approximately &euro;46.5 million on teacher continuing professional development (CPD) in 2016 across the primary and post primary sectors.  The teacher CPD budget represents 0.56% of my Department's overall net expenditure.</p>  <p>  The spend of &euro;46.5 million includes all costs associated with the provision of CPD at primary and post primary level funded by my Department.</p>  <p>  The professional development needs of serving teachers in recent years have been addressed through the provision of an induction programme for newly qualified teachers, national in-service for new and revised curriculum areas including junior cycle, the new primary language curriculum and ongoing support for the curriculum generally with a particular focus on priority areas - literacy and numeracy, well-being, support for school leaders and for teachers to meet the needs of children with special educational needs. </p>  <p>  The responsibilities of the recently established Centre for School Leadership, a partnership between my Department, IPPN and NAPD, cover the range of leadership development from pre-appointment training and induction of newly appointed principals, to CPD throughout leaders' careers. </p>  <p>  Other areas of expenditure include training for child protection, Board of Management training, a Teacher Fee Refund Scheme, Teacher Professional Networks and a number of postgraduate programmes to meet particular identified needs such as the teaching of mathematics and special educational needs. </p>  <p>  The Teaching Council is the professional body and regulator for teachers.  It has published its policy, Cos&aacute;n, on teacher learning and will continue to engage with stakeholders, including teachers, in preparation for the commencement of section 39 of the Teaching Council Acts 2001-2015 which will enable the Teaching Council to review and accredit programmes of CPD.</p></reply>

This will benefit approximately 1,100 post graduate students who meet the eligibility criteria for the special rate of maintenance grant.</p>  <p>  The Student Grant Scheme is now open for applications for the 2017/18 academic year.  This earlier opening date will facilitate earlier decisions for students on their grant applications and therefore provide students with greater certainty about the financial support that will be available to them. </p>  <p>  In addition to this specific measure targeted at postgraduate students, I also secured an additional &euro;4.5 million in Budget 2017 for other new access measures that will benefit target groups such as lone parents, travellers, mature students, and students with disabilities. </p>  <p>  The new measures being introduced as a result of Budget 2017 will complement the existing student supports that are already in place. In total my Department will invest approximately &euro;450 million in access supports in the 2017/18 academic year.

These included pay reductions and also reductions to the pay of new entrant public servants, including teachers, since 2011.  Collective agreements reached between the Government and the public service unions provided vital industrial peace during this very difficult period for the State.</p><p>The Lansdowne Road Agreement has allowed a programme of restoration to start.  I have used this to negotiate substantial improvements in pay for new teachers.  The agreement reached with TUI and INTO will see pay rises of between 15-22% (between &euro;4600 and &euro;6700) for new entrant teachers. </p><p>I accept that ASTI members had outstanding pay demands and that the deal did not travel the full distance that they set out to achieve.  However, it has restored an estimated 75% of the difference in pay for more recently recruited teachers and delivers full equality at later points in the scale.  This is substantial progress and strikes an equitable balance with other claims for funding on my Department, particularly needs such as enhanced services for children with special educational needs, for disadvantaged schools, for growing schools, for higher education and for apprenticeships.  The door remains open to the trade union movement seeking to advance this issue further in the context of future public service pay talks.</p><p>In education, there is a well-established increment system.  Teachers are not paid equally. For example, the pay scale for teachers appointed prior to 2011 ranges from &euro;32,009 to &euro;60,155 depending on the date that the individual began teaching.  Part of the negotiation to date has secured a convergence of the scales of recruits at different periods.  Any further negotiation on new entrant pay cannot focus on just one sector.  A broader assessment of pay and new entrant pay will be informed by the analysis of the Public Service Pay Commission.</p><p>Following discussions, the Teachers Conciliation Council published a set of proposals in November for consideration by ASTI members aimed at finding a resolution to their dispute. </p><p>The proposals provided ASTI members with an opportunity to benefit from the programme of pay restoration I mentioned above, including the agreement reached with TUI and INTO, which will see pay rises of between 15-22% (between &euro;4600 and &euro;6700) for new entrant teachers. </p><p>In addition, there were other immediate undoubted benefits for individual ASTI members in accepting the proposals including:</p><p>- Avoiding an increment freeze</p><p>- Inclusion of the S&amp;amp;S allowance of &euro;1,592 into the pay scale</p><p>- Continued alleviation of the FEMPI Act pay reductions</p><p>- The Ward Report measures and a revised sequence for filling posts which enable fixed-term and part-time teachers to gain permanent, full-time jobs more easily and quickly than before</p><p>- An increase in the quantum of the Croke Park hours that can be worked on other than a whole-school basis</p><p>- A review of the usage of the Croke Park hours</p><p>- Protection against compulsory redundancy</p><p>- The &euro;1,000 increase now being paid to public servants on 1 April 2017, brought forward from 1 September 2017 under the LRA.</p><p>ASTI members have voted to reject the proposals put forward aimed at resolving their dispute and in consequence, to reject the Lansdowne Road Agreement. It is regrettable that many ASTI members will now suffer permanent financial losses and loss of other benefits as a result of this choice.  </p><p>The proposals represented the final outcome of the process and there will be no further offer made to ASTI.  The Government is committed to continuing to work with unions inside the agreement in progressing consideration of pay and conditions issues.  The work of the Public Service Pay Commission is now underway in this regard.</p></reply>

To this end, my Department uses a Geographical Information System to identify the areas under increased demographic pressure nationwide. The system uses a range of data sources in carrying out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level.  The outcome of the latest demographic exercises was that in November 2015, 13 new schools were announced to open nationwide in 2017 and 2018.</p>  <p>  The November 2015 announcement also detailed the new building projects and major extensions, including special schools, that will be progressed in areas where significant demographic need has been established.

School projects that were announced under my Department's 5 Year Plan (2012-16) will also be advanced in the Capital Programme.</p>  <p>  The Capital Programme also provides for devolved funding for smaller scale projects for schools, where an immediate accommodation requirement has been identified, such as the appointment of an additional teacher.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-04-05a.382.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017040500078#WRL02300"><p>I am taking it that the Deputy is referring to the combined numbers of Leaving Certificate Mathematics candidates at all three levels (Higher, Ordinary, and Foundation) who were awarded E grades, F grades or no grade in the 2016 State Examinations.  The designation of any performance in the certificate examinations as a 'fail' ceased in 1968. </p>  <p>  The nature of curricular examinations such as the Leaving Certificate and the procedures currently in place for awarding grades are such that a certain amount of fluctuation in the grade distribution from year to year is to be expected.  Grade distributions are also affected significantly by the proportion of candidates who opt to take the examination at each level.  In particular, if the proportion of candidates opting for Higher level increases, the candidates making this move will tend to be those who were towards the higher achieving end of the Ordinary level distribution and will tend to fall at the lower achieving end of the Higher level distribution. This will obviously affect the grade distribution at both levels. Influenced by the combined effect of syllabus change in mathematics, known as Project Maths, and the introduction by the Higher Education Institutions of 'bonus points' for Higher level mathematics, the number of students in recent years presenting for Higher level in Leaving Certificate Mathematics examinations has increased significantly, from 15.8% in 2011 to 28% in 2016. </p>  <p>  During the standard-setting process that happens as part of the marking process each year, the State Examinations Commission (SEC) takes account of these and any other relevant factors in the course of satisfying itself that the distribution of grades awarded is appropriate and that it accurately reflects the performance of the candidates in comparison to the achievement standards envisaged when the syllabus was designed.</p>  <p>  In the context of a significant migration of mathematics candidates from Ordinary to Higher level, it may be noted that a similar absolute number of candidates awarded E, F or no grade at Ordinary level will inevitably be manifested as a higher percentage, since the total number of candidates at this level has reduced.</p>  <p>  The number of candidates who failed to achieve at least a D3 grade at any level of the mathematics examination in 2016, while marginally higher than in the last three or four years, is very similar to the number in the years before that (2009 to 2011, for example).  In the context of the factors mentioned above, there is nothing especially unusual about the grade distribution in mathematics for 2016.</p>  <p>  In the case of the current syllabus change in mathematics, there has been a deliberate attempt to increase the emphasis on higher-order thinking skills, including interpretation, problem solving, and dealing with the unfamiliar.  These are skills that students find difficult to master and teachers find difficult to instil in students.  The syllabus expectations are ambitious at all levels. </p>  <p>  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) will be undertaking a review of the Project Maths initiative, now that the full implementation of all phases of the curricular change is complete.  By this time, students will have been through the new mathematics cycle a few times and the NCCA will have good information on which to base the assessment of its impact, especially on the learning of under-achievers.  I have asked the SEC to ensure that any lessons that can be learned from candidate performance in recent examinations, and the 2016 examination in particular, be fed into that review process.  The Project Maths Implementation Support Group, an industry-education partnership set up by my Department, including third level bodies, Engineers Ireland, Science Foundation Ireland, will also be able to provide their considered opinions to this process.</p></reply>

The HEA funds retention initiatives in Computer Science disciplines in higher education institutions through the Information Technology Investment Fund.  In 2015 these initiatives included additional classes, attendance mentoring, teaching and learning initiatives, student support sessions, buddy practicals and maths enabling courses.  </p><p>In 2016 the National Forum for Teaching and Learning established an ICT Retention Scoping Group to examine ways in which students could be enabled to complete ICT courses.  The group working with practitioners and industry recently made a number of recommendations including capacity building within the school system, improved career guidance, sharing of good practice on pedagogy and retention across the sector and strengthen links with the FET and post primary sectors. </p><p>One of the key objectives of the National Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education2015-2019 (National Access Plan) is to address the issue of non-completion within higher education institutions, for those in under-represented target groups.  The Plan also commits to the further development of mechanisms to track the progression, retention and student experience of target groups.  The target student groups include entrants from socio-economic groups that have low participation in higher education; first time mature student entrants and students with disabilities. </p><p>To support the implementation of these objectives, a Working Group has been established to consider the issues contributing to the non-completion of target groups in the National Access Plan and to produce recommendations for policy and practice.  The group is chaired by the Higher Education Authority (HEA) and includes representatives of relevant stakeholders.  The HEA, with assistance from the National Forum for the Enhancement of Teaching and Learning, is currently undertaking a scoping exercise to inform the work of the group.</p></reply>

The Plan sets out how we will manage the pipeline of new apprenticeships already established through the first call for proposals in 2015 and also commits to a new call for apprenticeship proposals later this year, to provide for the needs of all sectors, including hospitality and tourism.  Over the lifetime of the Action Plan, 50,000 people will be registered on apprenticeship and traineeship programmes representing a doubling of current activity. </p>  <p>  Work is progressing on the development of a new Commis Chef Apprenticeship led by the Irish Hotels Federation and the Restaurants Association of Ireland working with Kerry Education and Training Board.  It is planned that this programme will commence later this year.  The Apprenticeship Council also recently approved development funding for a separate proposal to develop a Chef de Partie Apprenticeship.  The Apprenticeship Council will continue to work with the proposers of these new programmes to develop them into sustainable apprenticeships that can be delivered on a nationwide basis.  The funding for planned and forecast expansion in 2017 will see an additional &euro;20million provided.  </p>  <p>  In 2015 a new Career Traineeship initiative was initiated by SOLAS in collaboration with the ETBs and enterprise to develop a more effective model of work-based learning, primarily at NFQ levels 4 and 5, incorporating best national and international research and practice.  Networks have been created to facilitate partnerships between ETBs and employers to identify training needs, design training programmes, recruit learners and deliver training on and off the job.  The Career Traineeship model of work-based learning is currently being piloted with the hospitality and engineering sectors, with the involvement of seven ETBs.</p></reply>

The report of the Expert Group on Future Funding for Higher Education, which considers a number of potential funding options including for the deferred payment of student fees, is currently being examined by the Oireachtas Committee on Education and Skills with a view to making recommendations on a long-term sustainable funding model for higher education.  This process includes receiving input from relevant stakeholders and I understand the Union of Students in Ireland is one of the groups who have made a submission.  It will be important to obtain political and societal consensus on achieving a sustainable funding model for the higher education sector in the future and my Department and I continue to work with the committee as it undertakes its deliberations.</p>  <p>  In follow-up to the Expert Group report, appropriate technical work will be undertaken by an inter-Departmental group chaired by my Department in relation to income contingent student loans in order to inform future funding policy options, including in light of recommendations from the Oireachtas Committee on Education and Skills.</p>  <p>  Increased Exchequer funding of &euro;36.5 million was secured in Budget 2017 for the higher education sector.  This includes an increase in the funding available to students from disadvantaged backgrounds and other under-represented groups to assist them in overcoming financial barriers to accessing and completing higher education.  Provision is also being made in the Department's expenditure ceiling in 2018 and 2019 for demographic increases which cumulatively represents an additional &euro;160 million investment in the sector over the period 2017-2019. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform are currently undertaking a public consultation process on a proposed Exchequer-Employer investment mechanism for higher education and further education and training.  It is estimated that the mechanism, which proposes an increase in the National Training Fund levy from 0.7% to 1% between 2018 and 2020, could yield close to an additional &euro;200m revenue in 2020.  Comments on the proposal may be submitted to the Departments of Education and Skills and Public Expenditure and Reform by 5 p.m. on Thursday 13th April 2017.  Full details of the consultation process are available on the websites of both Departments. </p>  <p>  The intention is that, taken together, these approaches will contribute to and inform the development of a long-term sustainable funding model for the higher education and further education and training sectors.</p></reply>

Depending upon the negotiated terms of Brexit there may be future implications for Irish students studying in the UK.  My Department is keeping this matter under constant review and it is my stated intention to seek to have the best outcome for our students. </p>  <p>  A principal concern of mine is to protect to the greatest extent possible student mobility between Ireland and Northern Ireland, the UK and within the EU and to support our strategy to increase non-EU student flows.  I am particularly concerned to facilitate the continued feasibility of the UK as an option for our further and higher education students.</p>  <p>  With such issues in mind a key part of my approach has been to engage on Brexit-related matters at political and institutional level. I have met my counterparts Peter Weir and Simon Hamilton of the NI Executive, and most recently met with the UK&rsquo;s Secretary of State for Education, Justine Greening. I also met the Minister of State for Exiting the EU, David Jones, the UK&rsquo;s Opposition Spokesperson on Brexit, Kier Starmer, as well as members of the All Party Parliamentary Group on the Irish in Britain. I have also had meetings with Ministers from other EU Member States and with representatives of the EU Commission at which our priorities and concerns were raised.</p>  <p>  In relation to Irish students currently studying in Higher Education Institutions in the UK and those planning to do so in the coming years, the UK Government have outlined that the EU referendum outcome and the triggering of Article 50 will not lead to any immediate change to the immigration status of current EU students, including those that are on courses in this academic year (2016&ndash;17).  </p>  <p>  It has also been outlined in separate statements from across all UK nations (England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland) that current university students from the EU and those applying to courses starting in 2017&ndash;18 will not see any changes to their loan eligibility or tuition fee status. This position will apply for the full duration of the course, even if the course finishes after the UK has left the EU.  For students looking to study in Scotland, this position has been extended to those enrolling for 2018&ndash;19.</p>  <p>  Separate statements from across all UK nations confirm that current EU students, including 2016&ndash;17 entrants, will remain eligible to receive loans and grants to fund their studies for the duration of their courses.</p>  <p>  EU students attending universities in England and Wales who are eligible under current rules to receive loans and grants from the Student Loans Company will continue to do so for the duration of courses they are currently enrolled on. This has been confirmed by the Student Loans Company for England, and by Universities Wales for Wales. </p>  <p>  Under EU law, students from EU member states applying for undergraduate degrees at Scottish universities are currently eligible for free tuition. For EU students attending a university in Scotland, the Scottish government and Universities Scotland have confirmed that there has been no change in current funding arrangements. This means that eligible EU students already studying in Scotland, including those that commenced their studies the current academic year (2016&ndash;17) will continue to benefit from free tuition and, for those who meet the residency requirement, associated living cost support.</p>  <p>  In Northern Ireland, the Department for the Economy has issued a statement confirming that EU nationals who are currently receiving student loans from Student Finance Northern Ireland, including those that started courses last autumn (in the 2016&ndash;17 academic year) will continue to receive these loans and grants until they finish their course.</p>  <p>   EU students applying for a course starting in 2017-18:</p>  <p>  - In England: The Government has outlined that EU students applying to start a course in England in 2017-18 will continue to be eligible for tuition fee loans and for 'home' fee status for the duration of their study.</p>  <p>  - In Wales: The Education Secretary has announced that EU nationals who intend to begin studying in the academic year 2017-18 will also continue to receive financial support.</p>  <p>  - It has also been confirmed in a statement from the Scottish Government that students starting courses in 2017 at universities in Scotland will continue to receive free tuition and other support for the full duration of their course.</p>  <p>  - Similar announcements have been made in respect of EU students applying to universities in Northern Ireland.  Student Finance Northern Ireland has said that EU nationals currently in higher education and those who intend to begin studying from 2017 who are assessed as eligible to receive loans and/or grants, will continue to receive these until they finish their course.</p>  <p>  EU students applying for a PhD starting in 2017-18:</p>  <p>  It has been confirmed by the UK Government that EU nationals starting courses in the next academic year (2017-18) will continue to be eligible for Research Council PhD studentships to help fund their studies for the full duration of their course. This will be the case even if the course finishes after the UK has left the European Union.</p>  <p>  The foregoing is the most up-to-date information available to my Department in relation to the implications of Brexit on EU Students (including Irish students) currently studying or wishing to study in Higher Education Institutions in the UK in the coming years.</p>  <p>  However, to ensure the utmost clarity for each individual student, I would advise all prospective Irish and other EU students to contact the higher education institution they are planning to apply to, or which they are already attending, in order to absolutely confirm its policy with regard to fees and tuition support for 2017-2018 and into the future.</p>  <p>  My Department, as with all Government Departments, is continuing to engage with these matters and to plan for scenarios that might arise out of the EU-UK Brexit discussions. We will continue to contribute to the EU preparations for negotiations and to assist with those negotiations to the greatest extent possible.</p></reply>

The Council immediately began work on a call for proposals for the development of new enterprise-led apprenticeships.  The call issued in January 2015 and over 80 proposals were received from industry stakeholders working with education and training providers. </p>  <p>  The Apprenticeship Council has been working with the proposers of these new programmes to develop them in sustainable apprenticeships that can be delivered on a nationwide basis. The first of these new apprenticeships commenced recently with the launch of the Insurance Practitioner Apprenticeship in September 2016 and the new Industrial Electrical Engineer Apprenticeship in November 2016. </p>  <p>  Three further apprenticeships in the manufacturing area have also recently completed validation and approval.  Employers in those areas, including those in the Kildare region, will be able to recruit apprentices to these programmes shortly.  Ten further new apprenticeships are due to launch later this year in various sectors including financial services, hospitality and ICT and a pipeline of new apprenticeships is in place for subsequent years.  This pipeline will be refreshed through the launch of a new call for proposals later this month.</p>  <p>  I have also launched an Action Plan to expand Apprenticeship and Traineeship in Ireland 2016-2020, which sets out how state agencies, education and training providers and employers will work together to deliver on the Programme for Government commitments on the expansion of apprenticeship and traineeship in the period. The Plan sets out how we will manage the pipeline of new apprenticeships already established through the first call for proposals and also commits to a new call for apprenticeship proposals later this year. Over the lifetime of the Plan, 50,000 people will be registered on apprenticeship and traineeship programmes which represents a doubling of current activity. </p>  <p>  Registrations in the 27 craft apprenticeship trades are rising strongly as the employment and economic situation improves and I welcome that employers throughout the country are engaging strongly with the apprenticeship system.  In 2015 there were 3,153 registrations in existing apprenticeships which represented a 17% increase on the previous year. In 2016 there were 3,742 new registrations in craft apprenticeships, 182 of which were taken on in the Kildare region. This year the strong growth in new registrations continues with 893 apprentices registered at the end of February, 48 of which are in Kildare. Current forecasts are that annual registrations will increase to 4,147 in 2017 and 4,697 in 2018.  </p>  <p>  A campaign to promote apprenticeship is currently being developed by SOLAS in consultation with key partners, including the Apprenticeship Council. The campaign will raise awareness and promote the values of apprenticeship for individual apprentices and for employers and it will cover both existing apprenticeships and the new apprenticeships now coming on stream.</p>  <p>  On a broader note a number of strategies have been developed by the education and training system at all levels to meet existing and future skills demands in the workplace. Last year my Department published the National Skills Strategy 2025 and the Action Plan for Education 2016-2019 both of which contain over 100 actions designed to see the system become the best in Europe over the next decade. Some of these actions are specifically aimed at ensuring that the labour force has access to education and training provision that equips them with the skills that enterprise needs, now and in the future. </p>  <p>  In 2016, as part of the National Skills Strategy 2025, nine Regional Skills Fora, including one in the Mid-East covering County Kildare, were established. The Mid-East Regional Skills Forum has identified a number of sectors including the agrifood film/audio visual, construction, hospitality, manufacturing and the equine sectors where there are skills needs. In order to address these skills needs the Forum has, and will continue to engage with relevant stakeholders.</p></reply>

Meetings were also held with the Minister of State for Exiting the EU, David Jones, the UK&rsquo;s Opposition Spokesperson on Brexit, Kier Starmer, as well as members of the All Party Parliamentary Group on the Irish in Britain. Meetings have also taken place with Ministers from other EU Member States and with representatives of the EU Commission including Commissioner Navracsics.</p>  <p>  While no dedicated Unit has been created, the EU/International Unit of my Department has been given overall responsibility for co-ordinating our response to Brexit.  This Unit has been prioritising Brexit work to date and will keep staffing requirements under constant review.</p>  <p>  In discharging its Brexit-related functions, the EU/International Unit participates in the Inter-Departmental Senior Officials Group, chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach, which coordinates the whole-of-Government response to the outcome of the UK referendum, and supports the Cabinet Committee on Brexit.  This is further underpinned by the Unit's active engagement with other Departments in Brexit Workgroups on the Economy and Trade; the Common Travel Area; and European Union Programmes - three of the six sectorial workgroups established to provide key sectorial or thematic advices to the Cabinet Committee and Government. The Unit also chairs the Education and Research Subgroup under the Economy and Trade strand of co-ordination. The Subgroup  includes relevant areas within the Department and relevant Agencies of the Department and other Departments/Agencies.</p>  <p>  As specific issues on the negotiations agenda emerge, the Department will ensure timely, focused inputs from the relevant policy areas and external stakeholders, through appropriate consultative mechanisms.</p>  <p>  Significant additional resource requirements are not envisaged for the negotiation phase, but for those that will arise, it is anticipated that costs arising can be provided for from within existing Departmental budgets.</p></reply>

Accordingly, non-binding Labour Court recommendations which will result in a pay increase, such as those referred to by the Deputy, are precluded from implementation. This was provided for in the Haddington Road Agreement and continues to be provided for in the Public Service Stability Agreement (Lansdowne Road) 2013-2018.</p>  <p>  Following lengthy discussions facilitated by the Labour Relations Commission (LRC) in August 2013 and February 2014, terms of reference were agreed for an internal job evaluation exercise to establish the correct rate of pay for the employees of all grades within the Tyndall National Institute. The terms of reference covered all staff in the Institute comprehended by the unions' parity claim, including those staff who were the subject of a previous Labour Court recommendation (LCR 20577). The terms of reference provided for an Oversight Committee comprised of management and union representatives to monitor progress and prevent delays. An appeals process was also agreed between the parties which could be invoked following the conclusion of the evaluation exercise.</p>  <p>  Pricewaterhouse Coopers (PwC) were appointed to conduct the exercise following a tender process. The selection was made by a joint panel made up of representatives of the employer and both unions.</p>  <p>  It was also agreed that, following completion of the internal job evaluation exercise, the parties would engage in discussions to seek agreement on the implementation of PwC's recommendations and the outcome of the appeals process. In the event that agreement could not be reached the matter would be referred to the Labour Court and the parties would be bound by the outcome.</p>  <p>  The PwC job evaluation report was presented to the parties in December 2014 and as part of the appeals process, an independent appeal officer heard and reported on appeals by Tyndall staff. The parties met under the auspices of the Workplace Relations Commission in relation to the effective implementation date of the recommendations of the Job Evaluation Exercise. Agreement could not be reached on the implementation date and that matter was referred to the Labour Court for a binding decision. I understand that the Labour Court has very recently recommended that the outcome of the Job Evaluation Exercise be implemented in full with effect from 12 September 2016.</p></reply>

The Action Plan contains hundreds of actions to be implemented with particular focus on re-skilling and upskilling employees to meet the existing and future skills needs of employers.</p>  <p>  In addition, published in 2016, the National Skills Strategy 2025, contains over 125 Actions and sets an ambitious trajectory for the next ten years for skills development in Ireland and marks an important step in the evolution of Ireland&rsquo;s education and training system to a system which fully supports upskilling and lifelong learning and is more responsive than ever to the changing needs of participants and enterprise.</p>  <p>  SOLAS is currently overseeing the development of a Policy Framework for Employee Development in order to guide activity undertaken by the Further Education and Training (FET) sector to support employee development. This will be published in Q2 2017.</p>  <p>  The recent launch of the Action Plan to Extend Apprenticeship and Traineeship in Ireland 2016-202 is being used to promote the essential skills attained from VET as a route to skilled employment and not just as a stepping stone to higher education.  A further call for Apprenticeships is scheduled in the near future.</p>  <p>  Skillnets, co-funded through the Irish National Training Fund and the European Social Fund, supports and works with businesses in Ireland and their employees to address their current and future skills needs by providing high quality, subsidised training through their training networks in a range of regions and sectors.</p>  <p>  Springboard+ provides free higher education places, primarily to jobseekers in need of upskilling or re-skilling to allow them to re-enter the labour market and involves a job placement.  From 2017 the eligibility criteria for Springboard+ will be expanded to include homemakers and those in employment in the Biopharma/Med Tech sector who wish to upskill or reskill to meet a specific emerging skills need.</p></reply>

The Council immediately began work on a call for proposals for the development of new enterprise-led apprenticeships.  The call issued in January 2015 and over 80 proposals were received from industry stakeholders working with education and training providers.</p>  <p>  The Apprenticeship Council has been working with the proposers of these new programmes to develop them in sustainable apprenticeships that can be delivered on a nationwide basis. The first of these new apprenticeships commenced recently with the launch of the Insurance Practitioner Apprenticeship in September 2016 and the new Industrial Electrical Engineer Apprenticeship in November 2016.</p>  <p>  Three further apprenticeships in the manufacturing area have also recently completed validation and approval.  Employers in those areas, including those in the Kildare region, will be able to recruit apprentices to these programmes shortly.  Ten further new apprenticeships are due to launch later this year in various sectors including financial services, hospitality and ICT and a pipeline of new apprenticeships is in place for subsequent years.  This pipeline will be refreshed through the launch of a new call for proposals later this month.</p>  <p>  I have also launched an Action Plan to expand Apprenticeship and Traineeship in Ireland 2016-2020, which sets out how state agencies, education and training providers and employers will work together to deliver on the Programme for Government commitments on the expansion of apprenticeship and traineeship in the period. The Plan sets out how we will manage the pipeline of new apprenticeships already established through the first call for proposals and also commits to a new call for apprenticeship proposals later this year. Over the lifetime of the Plan, 50,000 people will be registered on apprenticeship and traineeship programmes which represents a doubling of current activity.</p>  <p>  Registrations in the 27 craft apprenticeship trades are rising strongly as the employment and economic situation improves and I welcome that employers throughout the country are engaging strongly with the apprenticeship system.  In 2015 there were 3,153 registrations in existing apprenticeships which represented a 17% increase on the previous year.  In 2016 there were 3,742 new registrations in craft apprenticeships, 182 of which were taken on in the Kildare region.  This year the strong growth in new registrations continues with 893 apprentices registered at the end of February, 48 of which are in Kildare. Current forecasts are that annual registrations will increase to 4,147 in 2017 and 4,697 in 2018.</p>  <p>  A campaign to promote apprenticeship is currently being developed by SOLAS in consultation with key partners, including the Apprenticeship Council. The campaign will raise awareness and promote the values of apprenticeship for individual apprentices and for employers and it will cover both existing apprenticeships and the new apprenticeships now coming on stream.</p>  <p>  On a broader note a number of strategies have been developed by the education and training system at all levels to meet existing and future skills demands in the workplace. Last year my Department published the National Skills Strategy 2025 and the Action Plan for Education 2016-2019 both of which contain over 100 actions designed to see the system become the best in Europe over the next decade. Some of these actions are specifically aimed at ensuring that the labour force has access to education and training provision that equips them with the skills that enterprise needs, now and in the future.</p>  <p>  In 2016, as part of the National Skills Strategy 2025, nine Regional Skills Fora, including one in the Mid-East covering County Kildare, were established. The Mid-East Regional Skills Forum has identified a number of sectors including the agrifood film/audio visual, construction, hospitality, manufacturing and the equine sectors where there are skills needs. In order to address these skills needs the Forum has, and will continue to engage with relevant stakeholders.</p></reply>

Special Classes and Special Schools are staffed with a lower pupil&ndash;teacher ratio ranging from 6-1 to 12-1, on the basis of disability categorisation of pupils attending the school.</p>  <p>  There are currently 1,152 special classes nationally, which is an increase of over 100% on the number available in 2011.  Of these, 126 are ASD early intervention classes, 526 are primary ASD classes and 236 are post-primary ASD classes.  The remainder are non-ASD special classes.  125 special schools also provide specialist education for those pupils who need it, from infants to eighteen years of age.</p>  <p>  With regard to Kildare in particular there are 4 special schools, 7 non-ASD special classes Special Classes and 59 ASD special classes, including 6 ASD early intervention classes, 41 primary ASD classes and 12 post primary ASD classes. </p>  <p>  The NCSE, in consultation with the relevant education partners, must take into account the present and future potential need, location and sustainability in looking to establish special classes in certain areas.  In this regard the NCSE has advised that they are continuing to engage with schools in opening special classes where there is an identified need for special class provision and in order to ensure there are sufficient placements available to meet demand. </p>  <p>  Parents/guardians may contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs and to seek assistance in identifying placement options, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.</p></reply>

Under this scheme schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly. </p>  <p>  In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service.  The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring.  Psychologists use a problem solving and solution focused consultative approach to maximise positive outcomes for these pupils.  NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process.  Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. </p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention. </p>  <p>  I would advise that if there are concerns in relation to the educational or social and emotional development of any student these should be raised by the parents, in the first instance, with the Principal of the school he/she is attending, with a view to Principal discussing the situation with the assigned NEPS psychologist or local NEPS service.</p></reply>

The four Themes emerged as a roadmap for the embedding of ICT in teaching, learning and assessment.</p><p>The implementation of the Strategy is currently underway with funding of &euro;210m committed towards its implementation.  The first tranche of this funding, &euro;30m,  issued recently to schools for the upgrade of ICT infrastructure.  The need to provide funding for this purpose was highlighted in the Census analysis.  The criteria for funding provides that each school is expected to draw up an eLearning Plan using a whole school approach and taking account of its context and circumstances.  The Plan will outline the vision of the school for the embedding of ICT in teaching, learning and assessment and incorporates targets and priorities for improvement and development.</p><p>Presently, all schools in the country are offered a broadband internet connection to promote and facilitate the use of eLearning Technology.  There is a vast array of internet-based digital tools in use in classrooms, including Interactive Whiteboards, laptops, desktop computers, projectors, tablet computers, software packages and apps, visualisation and mapping tools, digital content and resources. </p><p>The decision on which digital tool to use to best support teaching and learning in the implementation of the curriculum is made by each individual school.  The emphasis will now however be on the use of these digital tools to effectively embed ICT in teaching, learning and assessment in line with the Digital Strategy.</p><p>The PDST Technology in Education provides a range of support services for schools on the effective use of digital technologies in teaching, learning and assessment through a variety of means including workshops, blended learning CPD courses, good practice videos, advice on ICT equipment and digital learning tools.  It is part of the national support service, the Professional Development Service for Teachers and operates under the remit of my Department.  It also manages the Department&rsquo;s on-line Education Portal Scoilnet.ie  which is a key source of online high quality digital content made available for all schools and facilitates sharing of digital resources and good classroom practice between teachers.  The website provides in excess of 12,000 + resources aligned with the primary School Curriculum and the Post Primary Subject Syllabus. </p></reply>

To that end I made regulations on 20 October 2016 - the Electoral Regulations 2016 (S.I. No. 537 of 2016) - which provide for ballot paper templates to be provided at polling stations at referendums.  These templates will facilitate visually impaired voters to vote in secret.  My Department is in the process of procuring, on behalf of returning officers, ballot paper templates for use at referendums.  A tendering process for this has been completed in recent weeks with the helpful input of the National Council for the Blind in Ireland and returning officers.  Existing arrangements, where a visually impaired voter may seek the assistance of a companion or a Presiding Officer, at a polling station, remain unchanged.  My Department will, in 2017, continue examination and consideration of arrangements to facilitate visually impaired voters to vote in secret at elections.  This will include re-examining the possible use of ballot paper templates for elections.</p>  <p>  In the meantime my Department is examining the 30 March 2017 judgement of the High Court in advance of the Order of the Court being made.</p></reply>

The output of the consultation phase, together with consideration of the full Census 2016 results in April, will feed into a draft National Planning Framework document, to be published during summer 2017.  </p><p>My Department has also issued guidelines on &lsquo;Quality Housing for Sustainable Communities&rsquo; which are available at the following link: http://www.housing.gov.ie/sites/default/files/migrated-files/en/Publications/DevelopmentandHousing/Housing/FileDownLoad%2C1979%2Cen.pdf.  These guidelines aim to assist in achieving the objectives set out in the Government&rsquo;s statement on housing policy &lsquo;Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities&rsquo; (see ).  The guidelines point out that successful design of good quality sustainable housing projects must take account of the availability of key services and amenities, such as shops, schools, churches, parks and playing fields, community meeting places, recreation and leisure facilities.  </p><p>The Local Government Reform Act 2014 gives legislative effect to the commitments in &lsquo;Putting People First&rsquo;, including the establishment of Local Community Development Committees (LCDCs) in each local authority administrative area.  A key function of each LCDC is to prepare the community elements of a 6-year Local Economic and Community Plan (LECP) and to work with partners in the implementation of the plan.  LECPs are developed as part of an integrated local, regional and national planning process.  This ensures that each Plan will be consistent with County Development Plans, Regional Spatial and Economic Strategies, and Regional Action Plans for Jobs.  The purpose of the Plan is to promote the local and community development of the relevant local authority area through a more coordinated and collaborative approach to planning and service delivery. </p><p>My Department provides funding to support social inclusion and for social cohesion in communities.  The Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme (SICAP) is the largest social inclusion intervention of its kind in the State.  The Programme was rolled out in April 2015, and will run until 31 December 2017.  Its aim is to tackle poverty, social exclusion and long-term unemployment through local engagement and partnership between disadvantaged individuals, community organisations, public sector agencies and other stakeholders.  SICAP is a key intervention for the harder to reach, with delivery in each area (or Lot) overseen and managed by the relevant LCDC in the local authority area. </p><p>The SICAP funding allocation for 2017 nationally is &euro;37.5m, which includes an allocation of &euro;3m under the European Social Fund (ESF) Programme for Employability, Inclusion and Learning (PEIL) 2014-2020. Northside Partnership delivers SICAP in Dublin 3, 5, 13, and 17 (Dublin Northside, Lot 2.3, which encompasses areas such as Fairview, Priorswood, Darndale, Donaghmede, Artane, Killester and Dollymount) on behalf of Dublin City LCDC (with a funding allocation for this area of some &euro;1.1m this year). </p><p>In 2017, SICAP will assist approximately 1,375 individuals with education and employment support.  Approximately 62 community organisations in the Lot area will be supported through SICAP in 2017 in subjects such as capacity building and organisational development, support to leaver funding, governance training and assistance to participate in local and regional decision making structures.  The following organisations are supported through SICAP in the Dublin 5 and Dublin 13 areas; </p><p>- Artane / Coolock Resource Centre,</p><p>- Artane Beaumont Rec. centre,</p><p>- Belmayne Youth and Community Group,</p><p>- Donaghnede Mens Shed, and</p><p>- Clongriffin Residents Association.</p><p>Furthermore, my Department recently launched the national &euro;2 million Communities Facilities Scheme which is under the remit of my colleague, Catherine Byrne T.D. Minister of State for Communities and the National Drugs Strategy.  The Communities Facilities Scheme is targeted at both urban and rural areas.  The scheme will fund projects that seek to enhance communities, address disadvantage and improve social cohesion at a local level.  The Scheme is being managed at a local level by the LCDCs in conjunction with the Municipal Districts, under the remit of the local authorities.</p><p>The Programme for a Partnership Government included a commitment to launch a recast RAPID programme and my Department is currently finalising the necessary arrangements, with the intention of launching it shortly.</p></reply>

In light of this, and the commitment to providing a successor Programme to SICAP when the current Programme comes to an end on 31 December this year, my Department is leading out on a number of actions which will lead to a better understanding of SICAP and its impacts, and which will inform my Department in reshaping the next iteration of SICAP. </p>  <p>  My Department is holding a targeted national consultation process which will assist in the design of the next programme.  The consultation process, which I have been leading, consists of national and regional sessions and a number of focus groups in which feedback is being sought from the key stakeholders involved.  The consultation process offers a platform to consider how the programme can be refined and for solutions to be put forward in order to strengthen the programme from 2018. In addition, the ESRI has begun a qualitative study looking at SICAP goals and its governance structure as part of a wider evaluation project. </p>  <p>  There will also be a qualitative research project looking at a cohort of SICAP participants - young people not in employment, education or training (NEETs) - carried out by an external provider in 2017.  This research will examine how SICAP&rsquo;s Programme Implementers identify and engage with this target group, look at the types of outcomes being achieved for them, and put forward good practice examples to inform the next iteration of the programme.</p></reply>

The legislative framework comprises the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, (the Act) and the Planning and Development Regulations 2001, as amended.  </p>  <p>  With regards to policy guidance, my Department has issued a large number of planning guidelines (available on the Department&rsquo;s website, www.housing.gov.ie) under section 28 of the Act, to which planning authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la are obliged to have regard in the exercise of their planning functions.  The day-to-day operation of the planning system is, however, a matter for the planning authorities.  </p>  <p>  Under planning legislation, enforcement of planning control is a matter for the relevant planning authority which can take action if a development does not have the required permission, or where the terms of a permission have not been met.  Under section 30 of the Act, I am specifically precluded from exercising any power or control in relation to any particular case, including an enforcement issue, with which a planning authority or An Bord Plean&aacute;la is or may be concerned. </p>  <p>  There are extensive enforcement provisions provided for in Part VIII of the Act, with a view to ensuring that works pertaining to permitted developments are carried out in accordance with the planning permission granted and any associated conditions and that no unauthorised development takes place.  If a person is of the view that any development works being undertaken are not in compliance with the permission granted or are unauthorised, s/he may make a written complaint to the relevant planning authority who shall investigate the matter and take any appropriate enforcement action, including, where necessary, the seeking of a Court order requiring that the development is carried out in conformity with the planning permission and any condition pertaining to that permission.  </p>  <p>  If an enforcement notice is not complied with, the planning authority may itself take the specified steps and recover the expense incurred in doing so.  A planning authority may also seek a Court order under section 160 of the Act, requiring any particular action to be done or not to be done.  </p>  <p>  In May 2013, a Ministerial Policy Directive was issued to all planning authorities, reminding them of their statutory obligations under Part VIII of the Act relating to enforcement.  The Directive required that planning authorities ensure that sufficient and appropriate human resources are made available for enforcement purposes. It also required planning authorities to undertake appropriate monitoring of planning enforcement and directed them to prioritise large-scale unauthorised development and enforcement cases.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that planning authorities have sufficient enforcement powers at their disposal under the existing legislation.  Further to the Policy Directive referred to, it is a matter for planning authorities to ensure that they assign appropriate resources for effective planning enforcement.</p></reply>

The overall implementation is being overseen by a dedicated Cabinet Committee on Housing, chaired by An Taoiseach.  This approach provides for a regular, inter-Departmental, review of implementation and analysis of market conditions.  The Cabinet Committee is supported by a Senior Officials Group and specific Rebuilding Ireland-related structures are in place, including an Oversight Group and Project Board with membership from relevant Government Departments, local authorities, approved housing bodies, the construction industry and other stakeholders across the housing spectrum.  In addition, the development of individual policy initiatives involves extensive public consultation and engagement, and housing issues have been the subject of considerable engagement with stakeholders on the National Economic and Social Council.</p>  <p>  This inclusive and informed approach will help to ensure that well planned, high quality, socially integrated and affordable housing is delivered. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that there are appropriate governance arrangements in place and there are no plans to establish a housing advisory council along the lines suggested.</p></reply>

The Strategy is structured around 4 key areas: security, standards, supply and services. The measures under these four headings will be implemented through the 29 actions contained in the Strategy.  </p><p>In terms of rental accommodation supply, the focus in the Strategy for the Rental Sector is on maintaining existing levels of rental stock and encouraging investment in additional supply, reflecting the shortages in the supply of rental accommodation in key locations, particularly in urban areas.  In some of these areas, there is also significant demand for transitory short-term accommodation.  In this context, providing short-term rentals at higher prices may be an attractive option for landlords.  </p><p>However, the implications of the above-mentioned determination by An Bord Plean&aacute;la has raised a number of regulatory and other related issues, such as tax liability, residential tenancy regulation, support for tourism, and planning. The Strategy for the Rental Sector provides for the establishment by my Department of a working group, comprising representatives of relevant stakeholders including local authorities, relevant Departments, public bodies and other interests in the area, with a view to providing more information on the scale and nature of the issue and full clarity regarding the appropriate regulatory approach to be adopted in relation to short-term tourism related lettings.  The working group is due to report in Quarter 2 2017. </p><p>In the meantime, my Department is in active discussions with organisations involved in short-term letting with a view to establishing collaborative agreements within the coming weeks to ensure that those property owners involved in such letting have the required planning permissions.</p></reply>

There have been six enactments relating to commercial rates in the past 30 years.  The following table sets out the enactments and the relevant sections where appropriate.  <table><tr><th>Enactment </th><th>Relevant Sections </th></tr><tr><td>Local Government (Dublin) Act 1993  </td><td>Section 37 </td></tr><tr><td>Local Government Act 1994  </td><td>Sections 45 and 47 </td></tr><tr><td>Urban Renewal Act 1998 </td><td>Section 10 </td></tr><tr><td>Local Government Act 2001 </td><td>Section 103 </td></tr><tr><td>Local Government (Business Improvement Districts) Act 2006 </td><td>Section 7 </td></tr><tr><td>Local Government Reform Act 2014 </td><td>Sections 29 to 34, Schedule 1 Part 2, Schedule 2 Part 6, Schedule 4 paragraphs 14 and 15 </td></tr></table></p><p>With regard to the specific issues raised by the Deputy, section 10 of the Urban Renewal Act 1998 allowed local authorities to remit rates in support of the objectives of an integrated area plan, developed under that Act.  With regard to relief for vacant premises, section 31 of the Local Government Reform Act 2014 introduced changes to the legal provisions in this area.  It provides the elected members of individual local authorities with the power to vary the level of rates refunds that apply in individual local electoral areas within the authority&rsquo;s administrative area.  The Local Government (Financial and Audit Procedures) Regulations 2014 provide that the decision to alter the rate of refund should be taken at the annual budget meeting and that the rate of refund decided in respect of the relevant local electoral area shall apply to eligible persons for the year to which the budget relates.  The absence of a decision to vary the refund means that the existing legislative provisions regarding the rate of refunds apply. A derelict property would not be capable of beneficial occupation and hence would not be liable for rates. </p><p>I have asked my Department to develop proposals for a consolidated Rates Bill to modernise and consolidate the legislation in this area.  Among the measures being considered for inclusion in the General Scheme of the Bill are provisions to allow a local authority to introduce rates alleviation schemes to support local and national policy objectives.  I hope to bring proposals in this regard to Government shortly.</p></reply>

This is in accordance with the requirements of EU Directive 2001/24/EC on the assessment of the effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment, the SEA Directive.  SEA is a process by which environmental considerations are required to be fully integrated into the preparation of plans and programmes which act as frameworks for development consent, prior to their final adoption, with public consultation as part of that process. </p>  <p>  In light of the SEA requirement which will take approximately 9 months, it is likely that while the proposals for revisions to the Guidelines will be available shortly, the Guidelines will not be finalised and come into effect until approximately the end of the year.</p>  <p>  When finalised, the revised Guidelines will be issued under Section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.

This contract covers the qualification of persons providing the service, the scope of the examination provided and the resolution process in event of a dispute or complaint from a customer.</p>  <p>  The HSE, who also supply a large number of devices under their corresponding medical card scheme, has convened a group of stakeholders who are working on developing agreed standards in relation to the provision of hearing aids.  The group has representatives from the Irish Society of Hearing Aid Audiologists (ISHAA), the Irish Academy of Audiology (IAA) and DeafHear (who advocate for the deaf and hard of hearing in Ireland), working along with the HSE on developing standards.  The group are currently finalising best practice guidelines to ensure a code of practice code is in situ for the profession in Ireland.</p>  <p>  The Department welcomes the development of agreed guidelines for the provision of hearing aids; such guidelines will make a significant contribution to the provision of consistent clinical practice and service delivery to the Department&rsquo;s customers.</p></reply>

Applicants who are under age 66 must be in receipt of a qualifying payment in order to qualify for the scheme.  The qualifying payments for those aged under 66 are invalidity pension, blind pension, disability allowance, carer&rsquo;s allowance or an equivalent social security payment from a country covered by EC Regulations or one with which Ireland has a Bilateral Social Security Agreement.  Free travel is provided for people in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance to facilitate their caring role and support their social inclusion.</p>  <p>  Children with disabilities may qualify for the domiciliary care allowance.  This is a monthly payment of &euro;309.50 to the carer of a child with a disability.  The allowance may be used for the additional costs involved in caring for the child and this may include additional transport costs.  On most transport services children under sixteen years of age are charged fares at special concessionary child rates.</p>  <p>  Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme (SWA) the Department of Social Protection may award a travel supplement in any case where the circumstances of the case so warrant.  The supplement is intended to assist with ongoing or recurring travel costs that cannot be met from the client&rsquo;s own resources and are deemed to be necessary.  Every decision is based on consideration of the circumstances of the case, taking account of the nature and extent of the need and of the resources of the person concerned. </p>  <p>  Any decision to extend the free travel scheme to persons who are not in receipt of a primary qualifying payment would have to be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Additional resources have been assigned to both Divisions to cover the issues arising from the UK exit process.</p>  <p>  The European Union Division contains a specific team focused on the EU-UK negotiations.  Within the IUKA Division, there is a Brexit-specific policy co-ordination function now in place and there are teams focused on Northern Ireland and on wider British-Irish Relations whose core duties include Brexit-related issues.  In addition, a number of officers of my Department are seconded to the Department of the Taoiseach and working on EU matters, while two officers are seconded to the International and EU Relations Division of the Department of Finance.</p>  <p>  Many business units of my Department at headquarters in Dublin are involved in some way as part of the response to the UK exit, for example, the Legal Division, the Trade Division and the Policy Planning Unit.  There is also an intra-Departmental senior management group focusing on issues relating to the UK exit, chaired by the Secretary General and comprising senior officials from across all relevant business units of the Department.  Overseas, specific additional posts dedicated to issues relating to the UK exit have been assigned to our Embassies in London, Berlin, and Paris as well as the Permanent Representation of Ireland to the European Union in Brussels, which has a unit dedicated to managing our response to this issue.</p>  <p>  It is clear that these exit negotiations will be complex and intensive.  To support the negotiation process, my Department received an additional &euro;3.2 million as part of the 2017 allocation.  This facilitated the transfer back to my Department from the Department of the Taoiseach of 14 staff to a new, enlarged European Union Division.  Programme funds to support the secondment of Irish staff to the EU institutions and enhanced public communications and debate on the EU issues were also transferred.</p>  <p>  The Department has allocated an additional budget of &euro;2 million from the extra allocation provided as part of the 2018 Budget process.  This budget will be used to increase the number of staff assigned to the management and support of the negotiations and to increase the level of support provided to our colleagues across all Government Departments and agencies.</p>  <p>  It is becoming clearer that there are other implications arising from Brexit that the Department will also need to manage.  There has been a sustained increase in passport applications from Britain and Northern Ireland since last June.  There has also been a substantial and sustained increase in the number of Foreign Birth Registrations, acquiring citizenship through descent, right across the world.  My Department is continually monitoring the additional needs associated with management of this process and engaging with the Department for Public Expenditure and Reform, as necessary.</p></reply>

Periodic and non-periodic employee contributions made by deduction from salary (or from any gratuities payable) formed an integral part of the scheme, as was evident from the title of the scheme.  The scheme was subsequently extended to all female established civil servants in 1981, when a similar approach on its introduction for male civil servants was followed.  The scheme was further amended in 1984, with certain changes made to the benefit and contribution terms, in the Revised Spouses' and Children's Contributory Pension Scheme.

The accounts are a cash-based record of the receipts and payments in the year compared with the amounts provided under the Appropriation Act. The accounts also show prior year figures for comparison purposes. </p>  <p>  In addition to the financial reporting requirements principles and procedures established in legislation and set out in Public Financial Procedures new and updated requirements for the management of grant funding provided from public money issued in the form of a DPER Circular 13/2014 - Management and Accountability for Grants from Exchequer </p>  <p>  Funds. This circular outlines the public financial management principles, procedures, and additional reporting requirements to be followed in the management of grant funding provided from public money.  The fundamental principle is that there should be transparency and accountability in the management of public money, in line with economy, efficiency and effectiveness.  The provisions of the circular apply to the movement of funds from a Vote to an outside body, and to any/all onward movements of that funding.  The objective is to ensure that all Exchequer funds, regardless of the method of distribution, are accounted for and properly managed.  </p>  <p>  In addition, all Government Departments and public bodies in receipt of public funding must comply, as appropriate, with the relevant requirements of the Public Spending Code.  The Public Spending Code sets out the value for money rules and guidance for spending in all public bodies at all stages in the spending lifecycle before, during and after spending. </p>  <p>  The Public Spending Code applies to both capital and current expenditure.  The Code outlines what is required of public service managers at different points of the expenditure lifecycle and offers advice on how to fulfil those requirements.  </p>  <p>  I am, therefore, satisfied that a detailed and comprehensive governing framework has been put in place by my Department as set out above to ensure that there is economical, efficient and effective use of public funds in line with the purpose to which they are allocated.  It is, of course, a matter for each Department and public body concerned to ensure that there are appropriate oversight arrangements and structures in place to ensure that this framework is fully implemented in all cases and where any abuses take place, financial reporting and audit systems to ensure as much as possible that these are detected and are addressed.</p></reply>

I want to ensure that existing GP services are retained and that general practice remains an attractive career option for newly qualified GPs.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Partnership Government commits to increasing the number of GP training places to 259 places annually.  In July 2016, the GP training intake increased from 157 to 172 places and the HSE's 2017 National Service Plan envisages a further increase, to 187 places this year.  I am anxious to achieve further increases in future years in order to ensure that the future manpower needs of general practice can be met.</p>  <p>  Further efforts undertaken in recent years to increase the number of practicing GPs include changes to the entry provisions to the GMS scheme to accommodate more flexible/shared GMS/GP contracts, and to the retirement provisions for GPs under the GMS scheme, allowing GPs to hold GMS contracts until their 72nd birthday, as well as the introduction of an enhanced supports package for rural GP practices.  These steps should help to address the future demand for GPs by enticing GPs who may have ceased practicing for family or other reasons back into the workforce, facilitating GPs to work past the standard retirement age and encouraging more GPs to work in rural areas.</p>  <p>  In addition, I have repeatedly emphasised the need for a new GP services contract which will help modernise our health service and develop a strengthened primary care sector, and health service management have already progressed a number of significant measures through engagement with GP representatives in recent years.  The next phase of engagement on a new GP contract is under way.  I am keen to ensure that future contractual terms for GPs would enjoy the support of the broad community of GPs and in this regard officials from my Department and the HSE are engaging with the relevant GP representative bodies in relation to the wide range of matters which will need to be encompassed by the contract development process.  The GP contracts review process will, among other things, seek to introduce further measures aimed at making general practice a fulfilling and rewarding career option into the future.</p>  <p>  As the issues raised in relation to Tipperary relate to service matters, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the HSE for direct reply.</p></reply>

The HPRA has an enforcement section dedicated to investigation of instances of the illicit sale of medicines and other health products, including the illicit sale of genuine and counterfeit/falsified pregabalin containing medicines.  The HPRA cooperates with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Revenue&rsquo;s Customs Service in the investigation of offences under the Irish Medicines Board Acts 1995 and 2006. </p>  <p>   Pregabalin is the active ingredient in a prescription only medicine that is indicated for treatment of generalised anxiety disorder in adults, pain due to nerve damage and as part of the treatment for epilepsy.  Pregabalin is known to be subject to potential abuse. As for any prescription medicine, the HPRA advises that a pregabalin containing medicine should only be taken following a consultation with a registered medical practitioner and dispensing by a registered pharmacy.  Prescription only medicines purchased from unauthorised sources cannot be relied on for their safety, effectiveness or quality.  They may be falsified and may create a risk to the health of the consumer.  The HPRA is continuing to work with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Revenue&rsquo;s Customs Service and other agencies abroad in order to curtail and, where possible, halt the illicit sale and supply of prescription medicines, including those containing pregabalin.</p>  <p>  The HPRA has informed me that during 2016, a total of 1,174 tablets of Pregabalin containing medicines were detained by the Authority.  These were supplied from the following countries: </p>  <p>  - 940 from India</p>  <p>  - 180 from China</p>  <p>  - 50 from Hong Kong</p>  <p>  - 4 from Singapore.</p></reply>

The Teagasc OHS programme seeks to assist farmers to effectively manage this dimension of operating a farm. All major Teagasc events have an OHS exhibit, and the topic is strongly emphasised in newsletters, media releases and articles in Teagasc publications. Teagasc advisors provide advice on OHS at events (e.g. farm walks, discussion groups) and during farm advisory visits. Research is currently in progress related to farmer OHS adoption and farmers&rsquo; health.  </p>  <p>  I am advised by Teagasc that 38 staff members are trained to provide OHS training to farmers related to the HSA Code of Practice for Preventing Injury and Occupational Ill Health in Agriculture incorporating a Farm Safety, Code of Practice - Risk Assessment Document. The 38 staff have a Quality Qualification Ireland (QQI) Level 5 (or higher) qualification in OHS or meet HSA specifications for delivery training on the Farm Safety, Code of Practice &ndash; Risk Assessment. </p>  <p>  Teagasc does not record farmer age for OHS training, however, previous research indicates that roughly a third of farmers who completed the Farm Safety, Code of Practice - Risk Assessment Document were over 65 years old. I understand that research undertaken by Teagasc among participants in OHS training shows that 98% found the training worthwhile and would recommend it to other farmers. </p>  <p>  Teagasc is funded by my Department to provide research, advisory and training services to the agricultural sector. The grant allocation for 2017 is in excess of &euro;128m. The allocation of funding to particular services is an operational matter for Teagasc. I understand that because Teagasc work in the OHS area is fully integrated in its education and training, advisory and research work, it does not have estimates of the OHS component cost.   </p>  <p>  Teagasc are also contracted to deliver health and safety training under my Department&rsquo;s Knowledge Transfer Programme to approximately 500 approved Knowledge Transfer Facilitators. Approximately 250 of such approved Knowledge Transfer Facilitators are directly employed by Teagasc. This training provides them with the skill to complete the health and safety component of the Farm Improvement Plan with the farmer participants in the programme. </p>  <p>  Additionally all participants of the Teagasc Green Cert programme complete the mandatory Teagasc Farm Safety course workbook and the HSA, Farm Safety, Code of Practice - Risk Assessment Document.</p></reply>

Between 2010 and 2016 my Department provided funding of over &euro;65m, on a competitive basis, to higher education and other public research institutes for food related research through the Food Institutional Research Measure (FIRM). One of the main areas funded is &lsquo;Food Processing Technology and Engineering&rsquo; where funding amounted to c. &euro;20.5m for 35 collaborative inter-institutional research projects during the period.  A further &euro;20m was invested to support research in 38 projects under the areas of &lsquo;Functional Food &amp;amp; Health&rsquo; and &rsquo;Food Product Development, Formulation and Sensory Science&rsquo; and, in addition, another &euro;9.8m was funded in the area of &lsquo;Food Chain Integrity and Safety&rsquo;.</p><p>A key output of FIRM is to train early stage researchers at PhD and postdoctoral level in the specialist skills relevant to the Irish food sector, providing a pipeline of skilled scientists ready to take up RDI positions in the food processing industry.  My Department also funds the Agrifood and Forestry Graduate Development Programme (AFGDP) which equips newly trained researchers with transferable managerial skills needed for smooth entry into the food industry.  My Department also supports agriculture and food themed projects that prove successful in competitive Calls under the Irish Research Council&rsquo;s Employment-Based Post Graduate programme.  These competitive supports are guided by the &lsquo;SHARP&rsquo; strategic research and innovation agenda drawn up by a DAFM-led cross-funder Working Group under the National Research Prioritisation Exercise and assisted by an industry-led broad stakeholder research advisory group hosted by my Department. </p><p>A key recommendation of Food Wise was a greater focus on consumer insights in driving future investment in research, development and innovation. This recommendation has been followed by Bord Bia in establishing &ldquo;The Thinking House&rdquo;, an innovative and industry-focused centre dedicated to bringing insights from consumers, often in distant markets, back to Irish food producers to inform product formulation, development and marketing.  Some 80% of New Product Development fails due to lack of consumer insight.  The team at the Thinking House already work with over 100 manufacturers embedding the principles of design innovation and insight to build business and partnerships with multi-national players.The Thinking House also aims to close the gap between research and consumer needs, leading to better value for money and greater return on investment for R&amp;amp;D centres and promotion of an interdisciplinary approach to solving marketing questions by working with academia to overcome the barriers they face.  </p><p>Innovation and entrepreneurship can be closely linked.  Food Works, an entrepreneurship initiative by Bord Bia, Enterprise Ireland and Teagasc, centres on start-up businesses with the potential to scale up quickly and make an impact internationally. A survey in 2016 found that 60% of Food Works alumni are trading, with 32% involved in exports.</p><p>Enterprise Ireland has supported the innovation agenda with a targeted focus on supporting food and beverage clients to enhance their competitiveness and innovative capability.  My Department funds Enterprise Ireland innovation vouchers and lean competitiveness programmes in relation to food and beverage companies.  Enterprise Ireland also support R&amp;amp;D direct company funding and  technology centres and have developed an Innovation 4 Growth Programme to assist companies to diversity into new products and Innovation Partnership funding (third level and company collaboration) .  A third Innovation4Growth programme is due to commence in the second half of this year. </p><p>The Dairy Processing Technology Centre (DPTC) is a &euro;25m investment supported by the Department of Jobs through Enterprise Ireland and the dairy industry partners and will be hosted by the University of Limerick. </p><p>Teagasc and dairy industry shareholders are investing &euro;10 million in the expansion of the Moorepark Technology Ltd (MTL) pilot plant facility in Fermoy Co. Cork.  This will provide a platform to support the ambitions of the dairy industry to produce value added foods and ingredients for international markets. </p><p>The &ldquo;Meat Technology Centre&rdquo; is a virtual centre hosted in Ashtown, Teagasc.  Composed of 9 leading Irish meat companies and 4 Research Organisations (Teagasc, DIT, UCC and ICBF) it will benefit from an &euro;8m investment over 5 years is &euro;8m made up of contributions from Enterprise Ireland and the meat industry.</p><p>In overall terms, Teagasc annual spend on research is some &euro;68m.  Teagasc, working in conjunction with other national development agencies, provides a comprehensive support service for the food processing industry with a particular focus on supporting small and medium- sized enterprises (SMEs) and start- up food businesses. </p><p>The strategic aims of the Teagasc Food Programme are to increase the level of scientific innovation in Ireland&rsquo;s food processing sector , to support innovation, growth and export capability in food industries, to improve and develop the safe and clean image of Irish food products and to ensure viable technology transfer from Teagasc research programmes to industry.</p><p>Teagasc provides product development supports to all sectors and sizes of food businesses, with a special emphasis on SMEs, high innovation potential early stage and start-up businesses.  A wide range of modern food processing facilities and equipment is available to food businesses at both Teagasc Ashtown and Teagasc Moorepark.  An ultra-modern pilot plant, Moorepark Technology Ltd. (MTL), contains the most up-to-date and versatile pilot scale processing equipment. </p><p>Teagasc is hosting the Meat Technology Centre (MTC), a collaborative entity with industry and resourced by highly qualified researchers who will undertake market focused strategic research programmes for the benefit of the meat industry. The MTC will fuel growth in the Irish beef and sheep meat sector by creating and commercialising a pipeline of science and technology based innovations, leading to enhanced processes and product development.</p><p>In the speciality food area, The Cheese Institute has been designed by Bord Bia and Teagasc and is aimed at both start-ups and current industry operators.  Specifically tailored to the farmhouse and speciality cheese industry, the initiative includes production methods, operational capability,market insight, know-how for transition to larger scale businesses and viewing trends and opportunities.<b></b></p><p>In relation to seafood, in particular, Bord Iascaigh Mhara has a Centre in Clonakilty and is  undertaking a two year study on the sector to better understand the innovation needs of the industry and benchmark it internationally.</p><p>While this represents a considerable programme of work and investment , the challenges facing the agrifood sector following the UK decision to leave the European Union are unique and retaining and diversifying markets will require industry, academia, state bodies and Departments to work closely together to ensure that all continue to focus on innovation, to identify what works best and to succeed in making innovation an integral part of the development of the agrifood sector and of its direct and indirect contribution nationally and regionally.</p></reply>

The most recent Waste Packaging Statistics for Ireland published by the EPA in May 2016 show that Ireland has met and exceeded the overall packaging waste recovery rate and the recycling rate targets since they came into force.In July 2014, the then Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government published a Review of the Producer Responsibility Initiative Model in Ireland. The aim of the review was to assess the nature and level of the challenges which are currently facing the existing Producer Responsibility Agreements, as well as the forthcoming challenges that are expected to arise in the management of various waste streams. A stakeholder consultation process was also conducted. </p><p>As part of this review, a wider examination of issues within the packaging sphere was undertaken and consideration was given to the introduction of a bring back scheme for waste, including plastic bottles. The review was asked to consider, among other matters, an examination of packaging reduction initiatives such as deposit and refund and reverse vending.</p><p>The review report did not recommend the introduction of a Deposit and Refund scheme and concluded that to establish such a scheme was inappropriate, in view of the operation of the existing packaging scheme (operated by Repak), and policies concerning household waste collection, plus the high administrative costs of introducing such a system. It is also conceivable that littering could occur where waste bins might be searched for items attracting a refund under any such scheme.</p><p>The review report is available at the following link:</p><p>. </p></reply>

Ireland is committed to achieving this target through meeting 40% of electricity demand, 12% of heat and 10% of transport from renewable sources of energy, with the latter target also being legally binding. The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) has calculated that 25.3% of electricity, 6.5% of heat and 5.7% of transport energy requirements were met from renewable sources at end 2015. Provisional data for 2016 from SEAI shows that 26.2% of electricity demand was met from renewable sources.The Government has a range of policy measures and schemes to incentivise the use of renewable energy and although good progress towards the target has been made to date, meeting the 16% target remains challenging. My Department is currently developing a proposed new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS), designed to assist in meeting our RES-E targets, out to 2030.</p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">  The first Technology Review public consultation on the proposed new RESS was published in 2015 and following the completion of detailed economic analysis on the viability and cost effectiveness of supporting a range of renewable technologies, including solar and wind, a second public consultation will be published in the first half of this year. Details of the next public consultation will be advertised on the Department's website </font><font color="#0D0D0D"> . </font>The introduction of any new scheme - including the overall costs and technologies to be supported - will be subject to Government approval and State Aid clearance from the European Commission.</p><p>The new RESS will provide pathways for delivering on the 2015 Energy White Paper commitment to ensure communities and citizens are at the centre of the future energy transition in Ireland. Communities are effectively being designed into the fabric of the new scheme with policy measures to incentivise community-led and developer-led community projects being assessed. As part of the design of this new scheme, a national workshop on community participation in renewable energy projects was held in Portlaoise on February 2 2017.</p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">Drafting of a Geothermal Bill by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel is ongoing.</font></p></reply>

Even prior to the referendum result, there was a commitment in the Government's Tourism Policy Statement "People, Place and Policy &ndash; Growing Tourism to 2025"  to prioritising tourism marketing efforts towards those markets providing higher revenue returns.  The Programme for Government commits to implementing the policy objectives in the policy statement and achieving the targets for Irish tourism contained therein.  The triggering of Article 50 does not change this.  A key element of Tourism Ireland's strategy since 2014 has been market diversification.  In 2017, Tourism Ireland will continue to implement its market diversification strategy and intends to maximise holiday revenue through investment in Mainland Europe and North America.  In addition the depreciation of sterling against the euro since the UK referendum means that value for money will be a key message for Tourism Ireland in Britain this year.  Looking to the medium term, Tourism Ireland's plan for the period from 2017-2019 includes the agency's response to marketing Ireland in a more focussed manner in Great Britain to ensure maximum value for marketing spend.  Many factors will influence the impact Brexit has on Ireland&rsquo;s tourism performance in overseas markets, much of which is outside of our control.  However, restoring Ireland&rsquo;s share of voice in the overseas market is within our control and the Tourism Action Plan 2016 -2018 commits to restoring overseas tourism marketing funds to pre-recession levels on a phased basis.</p></reply>

In this regard, one of the proposals that the company has had initial discussions with staff and union representatives is to operate at Category 9 on a flexible basis rather than operate permanently at that level, 24/7, all year 'round.  This would contribute to a more efficient operating model at the airport without any material impact on flight operations.  I understand that this arrangement will arise in any event, at nightimes, for a temporary period of about 26 weeks as a consequence of the resurfacing of the main runway at Shannon which is due to get underway on 25th April next.</p>  <p>  I have forwarded the Question to SAA for direct reply.

Aggravated congestion occurs when the number of vehicles on a part of the network is higher than the network can handle and the point at which serious traffic delays arise.  The first phase of the project, which is currently being finalised estimates the annual value of time lost to road users due to aggravated congestion in the greater Dublin area.  The study uses data from a variety of sources to estimate activity on the network including census travel to work data, NTA GDA surveys, car ownership data and CSO small area population statistics.  The project has been carried out in conjunction with the National Transport Authority, NTA, Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, and Dublin City Council, DCC, with particular support from the NTA's modelling team in producing the modelled outputs.  </p>  <p>  A final project report will be published on my Department's website in the coming weeks.  However, I understand that the analysis undertaken for the report estimates that the cost of time lost due to aggravated congestion is currently &euro;350 million per annum and is forecasted to rise to &euro;2 billion per annum in 2033.

This provided a valuable opportunity to hear from companies and stakeholders about the impact of Brexit on their businesses</p>  <p>  My Department is also funding a number of research projects to:</p>  <p>  - improve our understanding of the impact of different trade and tariff regimes which might be imposed following Brexit;</p>  <p>  - provide data on the extent and concentration of cross border trade, including information on this trade by product and firm types and barriers to trade;</p>  <p>  - examine the implications for the most exposed enterprise sectors - in terms of trading and economic relationships - of the UK being outside of the European Single Market and Customs Union.</p>  <p>  In terms of my Agencies, Enterprise Ireland has been systematically engaging with its 1,500 clients that export to the UK. EI will continue to provide continued supports to its client companies who now directly employ over 201,000 jobs across the country. </p>  <p>  IDA Ireland is constantly engaged with clients across its entire portfolio and in the months leading up to the UK referendum it engaged with clients and prospective clients in relation to the potential impact of Brexit.  The IDA has a Team involved in strategic scenario planning, which continues to work on ensuring that the Agency&rsquo;s strategy is fit for purpose in light of the referendum results in the UK. </p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Offices are a key resource for the micro and small business sector, particularly in the regions.  I have obtained an additional Capital allocation of &euro;4m for Local Enterprise Development in 2017, which will be used to implement a series of Brexit-related measures in the LEOs. </p>  <p>  IDA, EI, and the LEOs are making a significant contribution to employment in Sligo and Leitrim.</p>  <p>  There are currently 27 multinational companies employing over 2,700 people in these counties.</p>  <p>  EI companies currently support 1,546 and 922 jobs in Sligo and Leitrim respectively.  EI job announcements in 2016 in the North West included LotusWorks (50 jobs in Sligo) and VistaMed (200 jobs in Leitrim).</p>  <p>  The Sligo and Leitrim LEOs are fully engaged in supporting the micro-enterprise and small business sectors in their areas to create and sustain jobs.  In 2016, the number of jobs that were created by micro-enterprises that had been supported by LEO Sligo and LEO Leitrim were 38 and 44 respectively. </p>  <p>  The Regional Action Plans for Jobs initiative is a concrete example of the targeted approach we are undertaking to boost regional employment.  While the Regions will benefit from our wider Brexit responses, the implications of the Brexit vote and the challenges and opportunities that the decision pose for specific Regions has been discussed at the meetings of the Implementation Committees for the Regional Action Plan for Jobs that have taken place since the June decision. </p>  <p>  The North East/North West Regional Action Plan for Jobs is stimulating job creation across the region, by facilitating collaborative initiatives between the public and private sector, and through the provision of new competitive funds awarded through Enterprise Ireland, to support regional enterprise projects.  The Plan aims to support the creation of 28,000 jobs across Sligo, Leitrim, Donegal, Cavan, Monaghan and Louth by 2020.  Sectors targeted as part of the plan include traditionally strong sectors for the region like agrifood, manufacturing/engineering and tourism. </p>  <p>  I will continue to visit the regions and meet with stakeholders to ensure that plans are being implemented in every region, including the Border region.</p></reply>

Enterprise Ireland will shortly launch its new Eurozone strategy, with the aim of increasing indigenous exports to the Eurozone by 50% over the period to 2020.  In addition, we are engaging with companies to help them adapt to currency fluctuations and to support product and market diversification.  The Local Enterprise Offices are working with non-EI client companies providing support and advice services as well as bespoke services to foster new business opportunities in local areas. </p>  <p>  IDA continues to identify potential for mobile FDI in key sectors and actively pursue these opportunities including through targeted trade missions and roll-out of advertising campaigns to promote Ireland&rsquo;s offering. </p>  <p>  My Department is currently undertaking research to examine the implications at firm-level for the most exposed enterprise sectors of the UK being outside of the European Single Market and Customs Union.  This research will inform an assessment of the way in which Brexit will affect individual sectors of the economy and our targeted response.  I am also engaging with stakeholders across the country to assess the implications for different regions and sectors.  On 30 January, I hosted a major stakeholder event in  Carrick-on-Shannon to facilitate a dialogue with stakeholders about the impacts, challenges and opportunities arising as a result of the UK decision to leave the EU, across the broad range of policy areas for which the Department is responsible.</p>  <p>  Further, my Department is also funding a project through InterTrade Ireland on the North-South trade implications of Brexit.  This project will provide an understanding of the impact of different trade and tariff regimes which might be imposed following Brexit.</p></reply>

The role it plays in sustaining employment here is well-documented, with approximately one out of every five private sector jobs here directly or indirectly resulting from FDI.  Last year saw the highest ever level of employment in IDA Ireland client companies, with 199,877 people now employed in companies supported by the Agency, including 2,703 jobs across 27 IDA Ireland client companies in Sligo and Leitrim. </p>  <p>  IDA markets Sligo and Leitrim as part of the North West region, along with Donegal.  The main FDI activity clusters that have been developed in the North West are in the life sciences and engineering sectors.  IDA continues to promote the region to prospective investors from both those and other sectors. </p>  <p>  The Regional Action Plan for the North East/North West represents the wider strategy for increasing employment in the region.  This plan aims to support the creation of 28,000 new jobs across Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim, Cavan, Monaghan and Louth by 2020.  Significant progress has been made to date towards that objective, with 5,600 more people in employment across the region since the start of 2015.</p>  <p>  More broadly, the Government is focussed on ensuring that Ireland is best placed to capitalise on whatever foreign direct investment (FDI) opportunities may emerge on account of Brexit.  That is why significant additional funding has been provided to IDA Ireland to help the Agency better respond to the challenges and opportunities Brexit may present for each and every county of Ireland.  I also regularly engage with the IDA about its Brexit-related requirements and other issues in connection with securing new investment for Ireland.</p></reply>

The fact that over 130,000 of those 201,000 jobs are outside of Dublin is significant.  Enterprise Ireland client companies support a total of 1,546 jobs in Sligo and 922 jobs in Leitrim.</p>  <p>  The objective of Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s new &lsquo;Global Ambition&rsquo; Strategy 2017-2020 is to support enterprises across the economy, to grow into strong Irish international companies, developing world-leading products and services and exporting them all around the world.</p>  <p>  There is a vast range of programmes and supports offered to companies to drive this strategy.  These include management capability, leadership and marketing/sales skills as well as promoting innovation and R&amp;D.  Investment in these areas is becoming more important as the demands of the marketplace evolve and become tougher.</p>  <p>  In terms of supporting traditional industry, my view is that manufacturing in Ireland is still, and will always be, an essential part of a well-balanced economy.  Our manufacturers have innovated and moved with the times &ndash; and they will continue to do so.  Advances in ICT, new materials, biotechnology, fuels, and nanotechnology offer scope for continuous innovation in manufacturing.  Together with the opening up of world markets, these advances offer great opportunities for Irish manufacturers.</p>  <p>  Manufacturing today is not just about making things anymore. It&rsquo;s about finding solutions for a more sophisticated and demanding range of customers.  It includes research, design, maintenance, sales and marketing, logistics and distribution too.  The best way to protect and increase manufacturing jobs is to compete with excellent products and services, using high technology, drawing on design, innovation and our strong science base.</p>  <p>  We are placing a particular focus on encouraging startups and small businesses to embrace the culture of innovation that now exists and maximise the benefits of technology.</p>  <p>  My Department also ensures that companies can access the right type of funding, appropriate to their stage of development.  This ranges from microfinance right through to seed and venture capital, development capital and risk-sharing credit guarantees through the banks.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s activity across all sectors of the economy is supporting a total of 400,000 directly and indirectly supported jobs.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, our 8 Regional Action Plans for Jobs are building on the jobs potential of each region. At local level, the LEOs, supported by EI, are supporting indigenous businesses and entrepreneurs in every county.  There has been a number of recent LEO events in Sligo, Leitrim, Donegal and Cavan to highlight the key areas where clients may be exposed and to provide direction in how they might address these.</p>  <p>  I am currently finalising plans for a regional initiative of up to &euro;60m to support collaborative approaches to grow and sustain indigenous enterprise and jobs across the regions.  This will be administered by Enterprise Ireland.</p></reply>

Much will depend on the nature of the future trade deal that will be negotiated between the EU and the UK. These negotiations are likely to be complex and multifaceted. </p>  <p>  Last month, the Government published a new Trade Strategy, Ireland Connected: Trading and Investing in a Dynamic World which supports an extensive programme of ministerial-led trade missions, as part of a major drive towards market diversification - promoting diversified export markets in light of the potential impacts of Brexit is a key priority for my Department.  This includes markets that are growing and have scale as well as markets where we are already well established but with potential for further growth. The programme of trade missions and trade events for 2017 includes a substantive focus on the EU and third country markets.  In 2017, we have 42 Minister led trade missions to existing and emerging markets. These have been orientated to reflect an increased focus on EU markets.  Enterprise Ireland is consistently working with client companies focussing on enhancing their competitiveness, capability and levels of innovation to assist them to diversify into new markets. </p>  <p>  The EU's suite of Free Trade Agreements with third Countries help to open new markets, break down barriers and provide new opportunities for Irish firms.  These existing EU Agreements and new trade deals will continue to be important for Ireland.  With a small domestic market, further expansion in other markets is essential to our continued economic growth. </p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to support the EU's ambitious programme of negotiating new Free Trade Agreements giving Irish firms expanded market access and a predictable trading environment in third countries.  The EU-Canada Free Trade Agreement will create sizeable new market access opportunities in services and investment in many sectors for Irish firms.  My Department is already working with our agencies and Business Groups to ensure that Irish firms take early advantage of the terms of the Agreement.  I will be </p>  <p>  leading a trade mission to Canada in the first half of this year to promote the opportunities provided by the Agreement. </p>  <p>  The EU-South Korea Free Trade Agreement has led to a sizeable increase in Irish exports since it came into effect in 2011.  This is the real evidence that Trade Agreements work for Irish exporters and Irish jobs. </p></reply>

Collaboration between the private and the public sector has been a core element in each plan&rsquo;s development, and will be central to each plan&rsquo;s delivery. The first progress reports on these Plans were published in December showing that good progress is being made in their implementation. </p>  <p>  A key objective of the plans is to have a further 10 to 15 per cent at work in each region by 2020, with the aim of having the unemployment rate of each region within one per cent of the national average. </p>  <p>  The success of the Regional Action Plans for Jobs is crucial to the Government in meeting the ambition to create an additional 200,000 jobs, 135,000 of which are outside the Dublin region, by 2020.  </p>  <p>  Employment has been growing continuously for the past 17 quarters and over the past year employment has grown in all regions.  </p>  <p>  The most recent figures from the CSO also show that 70% of all jobs created in the past year were created outside Dublin.</p>  <p>  The enterprise agencies are making a significant contribution to employment in the regions - 61% of new jobs by Enterprise Ireland firms in 2016 were outside Dublin and 52% of new jobs by IDA firms in 2016 were outside Dublin.</p>  <p>  The North East/North West Regional Action Plan for Jobs is stimulating job creation across the region,  by facilitating collaborative initiatives between the public and private sector, and through the provision of new competitive funds awarded through Enterprise Ireland, to support regional enterprise projects. </p>  <p>  The North East/North West Plan aims to support the creation of 28,000 jobs across Sligo, Leitrim, Donegal, Cavan, Monaghan and Louth by 2020. Sectors targeted as part of the plan include traditionally strong sectors for the region like agrifood, manufacturing/engineering and tourism.</p>  <p>  There has been a substantial improvement in the North East / North West region since the commencement of the National Action Plan for Jobs in 2012, with an additional 23,000 in employment in Q4 2016 compared to Q1 2012. Moreover, there are now almost 6,800 more people in work in the region since the launch of the Regional Action Plan initiative.</p>  <p>  The unemployment rate in the region has fallen from 10.2% in Q1 2015 to 8.0% at present, compared to the national rate of 6.7%.</p>  <p>  IDA, Enterprise Ireland (EI), and the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) are making a significant contribution to employment in Sligo and Leitrim.</p>  <p>  There are currently 27 multinational companies employing over 2,700 people in counties Sligo and Leitrim.</p>  <p>  EI companies currently support 1,546 and 922 jobs in Sligo and Leitrim respectively. EI job announcements in 2016 in the North West included LotusWorks (50 jobs in Sligo) and VistaMed (200 jobs in Leitrim).</p>  <p>  The Sligo and Leitrim LEOs are fully engaged in supporting the micro-enterprise and small business sectors in their areas to create and sustain jobs. In 2016, the number of jobs that were created by micro-enterprises that had been supported by LEO Sligo and LEO Leitrim were 38 and 44 respectively.</p>  <p>  My Department is providing additional funds through the agencies out to 2020. Together with Enterprise Ireland, I am currently finalising plans for a regional initiative of up to &euro;60m to support collaborative approaches to grow and sustain jobs across the regions, and to encourage each county to reach its full potential.</p></reply>

Of these, 5,844 (92%) were in foster care and 341 (5%) were in residential care.  Foster care is the main form of alternative care for children in need of care and protection, and it is the preferred option for children who cannot live with their parent(s)/guardian(s).  Of the 5,844 children in foster care, there were 4,130 (71%) in a general foster care placement and 1,714 (29%) were in care with relatives.  Residential care is the placement of choice for older children who have needs that are best met by this placement type.  In general, residential care is based in domestic style homes, catering for between 1 and 4 or 5 older children. </p>  <p>  All children in care should have an allocated social worker but it is important to note that if a child has not been allocated a social worker, the cases are reviewed regularly by the principal social worker and are managed by duty social work teams to support the child's needs.  At the end of January 2017, 93% of all children in care had an allocated social worker (5,885/6,323) nationally.  </p>  <p>  At the end of 2016, there was a total of 103 children in care in the Sligo/Leitrim/West Cavan area.  Of the 103 children in care, 78 were in general foster care, 16 in foster care with a relative, 8 in a residential care placement and one child was in an other care placement.  At the end of January 2017, there was a total of 101 children in care in the Sligo/Leitrim/West Cavan administrative area and all had an allocated social worker.  Tusla has advised that there are 9 registered residential care centres in the Sligo/Leitrim/West Cavan area.  Children placed in these centres include children from other geographic locations, especially from the greater Dublin area.</p>  <p>  Tusla currently has 1,467 WTE social workers and an end of 2017 target of 1,520 WTE.  This target is short of the target set in Survival to Sustainability by approximately 100 WTE and reflects the constraints of the social work labour supply.  Funding is in place to address the issue of unallocated cases, however, the recruitment environment for social workers is very challenging.  However, Tusla is also focusing on intervening at an early stage of a family difficulty through social care and family supports.  Accordingly, Tusla is prioritising the recruitment of an additional 100 Family Support Practitioners, 166 social care staff and an additional 25 administrative staff to allow social workers to focus on their core work with children and their families. </p></reply>

A range of professionals including teachers, nurses, early years educators, Garda&iacute; and other health professionals, who see children regularly, are in a good position to identify children at risk.  Where someone has reasonable grounds for suspecting a child is being, or has been, abused, they are expected to immediately contact Tusla.  The Children First Act, 2015, once it is fully commenced, will place a statutory obligation on key professionals (mandated persons) to report concerns of harm above a defined threshold to Tusla without delay.  It is my intention that these provisions will be commenced by the end of 2017. </p>  <p>  The latest breakdown of referrals available relate to quarter 3, 2016 and there was a total of 181 referrals received in the Sligo/Leitrim/West Cavan administrative area during that period.  Each referral received by Tusla is assessed and dealt with on an individual basis by the relevant social work team.  Approximately 60% of referrals to Tusla are of a child welfare concern with the remaining 40% related to child protection concerns.  Tusla's policy is to refer child welfare referrals to relevant family and community support services.  At any stage, if a determination is made that there is abuse, whether physical, emotional, sexual or neglect, from which there is an ongoing risk of significant harm, the child protection pathway is followed.  In a minority of cases this may lead to the child being placed on the Child Protection Notification System (CPNS) or the child being received into care.  At the end of 2016, there was a total of 42 children listed as active on the CPNS in the Sligo/Leitrim/West Cavan area. </p>  <p>  At the end of January 2017, there were 101 children in care in the Sligo/Leitrim/West Cavan administrative area.  I am pleased to advise that every child in care in Sligo/Leitrim/West Cavan had an allocated social worker.  Tusla has advised that there are 9 registered residential care centres in the Sligo/Leitrim/West Cavan area.  Children placed in these centres include children from other geographic locations, especially from the greater Dublin area.</p>  <p>  Tusla provides me with information on a monthly and quarterly basis outlining the increasing demands for their services, and how they are dealing with children awaiting services.  This information provides me with the information needed to assess how well we are supporting vulnerable children.  Also, the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA), inspects Tusla child welfare and protection services, statutory children&rsquo;s residential care centres and foster care services while Tusla inspects children&rsquo;s residential centres run by the private and voluntary sectors.  </p>  <p>  This valuable and detailed information continues to inform the Department and Tusla in the business planning needed to maintain and further enhance the range of services for the care and protection of children.  Tusla is currently engaged in the second year of a three year recruitment programme to expand the cohort of social workers, social care workers and business support staff.   I have secured additional funding for Tusla to enable this to happen and the current and capital Exchequer funding provided for Tusla is some &euro;713 million in 2017. </p></reply>

My Department provides funding to Sligo/Leitrim Home Youth Liaison Service Project (&euro;46,421 in 2017), Mohill Community Youth Project (&euro;29,520 in 2017), Leitrim Youth Project (&euro;86,803 in 2017) and Leitrim Traveller Youth Project (&euro;15,103) under the Special Projects for Youth Scheme . In addition, Sligo Youth Information Centre has been allocated &euro;66,921 in 2017.</p>  <p>  The Local Youth Club Grant Scheme supports youth work activities at a local level.  These grants are made available to all youth clubs and groups through the local Education and Training Boards.  The scheme is open to some 1,600 youth groups and clubs, with an estimated 89,000 club members around the country.  The scheme, which is open to new entrants, is advertised locally and applications for funding are invited by the Education and Training Boards from local groups in their respective areas.  Each year, some 600 local youth clubs benefit from the scheme. In 2016, &euro;1.065m was allocated to this scheme, of which &euro;58,568 was allocated to Mayo, Sligo, Leitrim Education and Training Board.

This is being addressed through the Area-Based Childhood programme, the development of a Quality and Capacity Building initiative, and supporting relevant priorities of other Government Departments.  As part of this, the Advisory Council for Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures, which brings together members of the community and voluntary sector as well as independent experts, has worked on a number of priority areas including homelessness and child poverty.  Members of the Council and officials from my Department recently met with representatives from Focus Ireland and St. Vincent de Paul to progress these issues. </p>  <p>  My Department funds the County and City Childcare Committees (CCC) (including Sligo and Leitrim CCCs); and Childcare Committees Ireland, to provide business support to services.  Funding is also provided to Better Start, to provide a quality support service and to Pobal who undertake compliance visits on behalf of this Department, and the Department of Education and Skills who provide education focussed support to childcare providers.</p>  <p>  My Department also administers a range of funding schemes and targeted programmes that support the provision of youth services for young people throughout the country including those from disadvantaged communities.  My Department provides funding to Sligo/Leitrim Home Youth Liaison Service Project (&euro;46,421 in 2017), Mohill Community Youth Project (&euro;29,520 in 2017), Leitrim Youth Project (&euro;86,803 in 2017) and Leitrim Traveller Youth Project (&euro;15,103) under the Special Projects for Youth Scheme.

Officials in my Department have regular contact with the larger national youth organisations and with the sixteen Education and Training Boards, including Mayo Sligo and Leitrim ETB.  I, along with my officials, meet with 30 national youth organisations every six months.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, a number of funding schemes supporting youth services were the subject of a Value for Money and Policy Review in 2014.  Work on the development of a new funding scheme has been prioritised by my Department, and consultations with youth services are continuing, with a view to introducing the new youth funding programme in line with the review.</p>  <p>  My Department is well advanced on an exercise, in conjunction with Pobal, and each Education and Training Board (ETB) Youth Officer, which will map youth service provision across the State.

It is my intention that this mapping exercise will inform future development and investment in youth services.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that my Department provides funding for the Child and Family Agency, Tusla. In 2017, Tusla has been allocated Exchequer funding of &euro;713 million, representing an increase of &euro;37 million on 2016.  Tusla provides a comprehensive range of services and supports for vulnerable children and families.  These include: Child Welfare and Protection Services, including family support services; Educational Welfare Services; Pre-school Inspection services and Domestic, Sexual and Gender Based Violence services.  Tusla works closely with other care providers including the HSE, in respect of access to primary care services, child and adolescent mental health services, disability and other services.  Tusla and the HSE monitor their interagency relationship to ensure that they are working effectively in the best interests of children and families.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently working on legislation to reform the Guardian ad litem service.  Guardians ad litem perform a very important function in child care proceedings.  They are an invaluable source of advice to the Courts and a great support for the children and young people who are involved in these proceedings.  The reform proposals will address significant inadequacies in the existing arrangements and will replace the existing ad hoc system with a high quality, child-centred, cost effective national service. Most importantly, it will extend the Guardian ad litem system to benefit the greatest number of children and young people.</p></reply>

While the vote does not give rise to fundamental strategic issues for Defence Forces operations or for Ireland&rsquo;s continuing engagement within the EU in the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP), it is expected that Brexit will have an impact on future developments in the Defence sphere.</p>  <p>  The structures put in place in the Department of Defence to address the potential challenges arising from Brexit include the assignment of responsibility to a senior official at Assistant Secretary General level in relation to Brexit related matters. The senior official is leading the Department&rsquo;s input to deliberations within the framework established across Government and is supported in their role by a number of branches in the Department. The senior official represents the Department on the Interdepartmental Group on EU-UK Affairs which is chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach and is engaged with the identification of key strategic, operational and policy issues arising from Brexit. In addition, the Management Board is acting as a clearing house for Brexit and maintains oversight on an ongoing basis.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will also be aware, the Government has adopted a contingency framework to deal with all issues arising in respect of the UK vote to leave the EU. Accordingly, any issues arising, including those within the Defence area, whether bilateral, or in respect of developments in CSDP, or regarding our wider international multilateral defence engagements, will be also addressed within that framework.</p>  <p>  As matters relating to Brexit are currently being absorbed and dealt with within already existing Department structures and resources, there is currently no dedicated Brexit funding allocation in the Department of Defence. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware the UK triggered Article 50 on 29 March 2017 and a meeting of Heads of State and Government is scheduled to take place on 29 April to discuss the UK withdrawal. It is expected that formal negotiations will commence in May or June, once the remaining 27 member States reach consensus on the EU's negotiating position. The negotiations themselves can then be expected to take at least two years to complete and all potential consequences in the defence sphere, arising during the negotiations, will remain the subject of ongoing consideration by my Department throughout this process, including whether there will be a future requirement for a dedicated unit to exclusively handle Brexit related matters.</p></reply>
