Following completion of that review in January 2012, a total of 43 projects had been cancelled, while 50 were maintained, to be managed in the same way as other regionally based offices and Departments.  In addition, it was agreed that one project - the Defence Forces in the Curraghshould proceed, on a cost effective basis, as soon as budgetary resources permit.<br/><br/>Up to the date of the cancellation of the programme, about a third of the target numbers of staffover 3,400were decentralised.  Consequently, while the decentralised offices account for less than 10% of serving civil service staff, taken together with the pre-existing regional and district offices of Departments the proportion of civil servants working outside Dublin is now just over 50% which highlights the extent to which the geographic distribution of civil service staff supports economic activity across the State.<br/><br/>While there are no plans to introduce a further programme of decentralisation, the Deputy may wish to note that the recently-published Civil Service Renewal Plan includes a commitment to expand career and mobility opportunities for staff across geographic, organisational and sectoral boundaries.  The delivery of this action will help ensure that the civil service continues to play its part in ensuring balanced regional development. </p></reply>

This has been an important element in reducing public expenditure. </p>  <p>  These cost reductions and the substantial productivity increases, including the additional hours, which the Agreement has facilitated, have allowed the Government the scope to reinvest in key frontline services such as education, health and policing by recruiting additional staff to deliver them.  The recent recruitment of some 100 Gardai is very tangible evidence of the reform dividend that will help sustain the Public Service Reform agenda by re-investing some of the efficiency savings we are delivering into improved services.</p>  <p>  The public service unions have indicated their intention, should the State's financial circumstances permit, to lodge a pay claim.  If such a claim is made the Government will of course have to consider it, in line with the prevailing fiscal position. Any ensuing discussions will encompass the pay and conditions of all public servants in line with the well established public service industrial relations procedures including those relating to An Garda Siochana and their staff representative associations. The legal position concerning the financial emergency legislation, which has underpinned the public service pay and pension reductions to date, will also have to be addressed in that context while ensuring that this country has a sustainable pay arrangement over the longer term . </p></reply>

The purpose of the review is to assess all areas of public capital investment and to refresh the existing investment strategy and multi-annual envelopes.  This is to help ensure that they are in line with emerging Government priorities and that our limited resources are focused on the areas that can best support continued, sustainable and equitable growth.</p>  <p>  As part of the Estimates process, and informed by the capital review, Government has made decisions on the capital allocations for the next three years. These were set out in Budget 2015. The report of the capital review is currently being finalised and I intend to publish it in the coming weeks. The report will include the three year ceilings announced on Budget Day along with new ceilings for the period 2018 to 2020. </p>  <p>  While investment for economic growth is vital at a time when our economy is in recovery, we must ensure that this growth is equitable and sustainable. For this reason, the capital allocations published in the Budget include increased investment for social housing reflecting the Government's prioritisation of investment in this area. They also provide continued investment for Education to meet demographic demands in our schools and for Health to allow the HSE to progress a number of large scale and priority projects. The new investment plan will also ensure the sustainability of our strategic resources through measures to tackle climate change and improve energy efficiency.</p>  <p>  The exchequer will of course continue to invest in our roads and public transport and support jobs and the business sector through our enterprise support agencies.</p></reply>

As the Deputy will be aware this building was not constructed due to the Government decision not to proceed with further decentralisation.  </p>  <p>  To accommodate the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine staff, OPW took seven leases in four buildings to accommodate 254 personnel. The Commissioners of Public Works have been working with Department of Agriculture Food and the Marine to consolidate their accommodation in Portlaoise.  In October 2013, sanction was received from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to proceed with an extension to the existing Government Buildings at Abbeyleix Road to facilitate this but funding was not provided and consequently this project has not been advanced. </p>  <p>  The Department of Agriculture Food and the Marine still consider it a priority that consolidation of various business areas should proceed. In that context, three leases in Gandon Court were surrendered in 2014 and additional centralised space was leased in Portlaoise town. In addition to the consolidation of staff, a rental saving of approximately &euro;100,000 per annum was achieved.</p>  <p>  In order to secure further efficiencies, it is proposed to commence a space audit of the State owned Government Offices on the Abbeyleix Road. This will establish the potential for consolidation of staff through re-configuration of the space with a more modern open plan layout and furniture. The provision of the extension will be reviewed following completion of the space audit.</p>  <p>  The current annual rent in respect of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine's leases in Portlaoise is just short of &euro;634,000.

Given the amounts raised every year, it is therefore a critical component of the public service pay and pension measures adopted as part of our national fiscal consolidation.  </p>  <p>  However, it should be noted that a start has already been made on reducing the impact of PRD on public servants. As legislated for in the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2013, and as provided for in the Haddington Road Agreement, the rate of PRD on the &euro;15,000 to &euro;20,000 band of pay received in a year fell from 5% to 2.5% on 1 January 2014. This cut is worth &euro;125 annually in gross terms to most public servants, with those taxed at the standard rate enjoying the greater gain in terms of take-home pay boost. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the powers granted by the Oireachtas under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (FEMPI) Acts in relation to public service pay and pensions are subject to annual review. The Haddington Road Agreement also reaffirms the commitment made previously in the Croke Park agreement to give priority to public servants with pay rates at &euro;35,000 or less in any review of the pay measures.  Section 2.3 of the HRA confirms that when economic circumstances allow, and the public finances are restored to a sustainable position, the pay measures applied to public servants under the HRA and the FEMPI legislation will be reviewed.   </p>  <p>  I would envisage that the question of further amendments to the PRD will be raised by the unions and associations representing public servants in the context of the discussions which are likely to take place later this year with a view to ensuring a fair and equitable review of pay measures imposed under the FEMPI Acts.</p></reply>

Responsibility for maintenance of the channel rests jointly with Galway County Council and Roscommon County Council. The Councils have heretofore discharged their responsibility through the River Suck Joint Drainage District Committee. The most recent formal report submitted by the Committee to the Office of Public Works (OPW) shows that it expended almost &euro;142,000 in 2011. This expenditure comprised routine maintenance works including the cleaning of drains and river bed, cutting back trees or other obstructions, weed control and, where possible, improving water flow.  The OPW has been advised that the Committee has since expended &euro;136,000 in 2012, &euro;149,310 in 2013 and &euro;150,891 in 2014 on further maintenance works. I am advised that the R. Suck Joint Drainage Committee was disbanded with effect from 1<sup>st</sup>January, 2015 on foot of Ministerial Order. However, as I have indicated, the ongoing maintenance of the channel and the funding of that work remains the joint responsibility of Roscommon County Council and Galway County Council.<br/><br/>Substantial funding has been provided by the Office of Public Works under the Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme to enable Galway and Roscommon County Councils to undertake flood alleviation projects within the River Suck catchment to address localised flood problems. Since the introduction of the Scheme in 2009, nearly &euro;2.1m has been approved to Galway County Council and over &euro;550,000 to Roscommon County Council for this purpose. Details of all the projects for which funding has been approved to local authorities under the Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme are available on the OPW website www.opw.ie.<br/><br/>With regard to the overall position in relation to flood relief works in the River Suck area as part of the larger River Shannon catchment, the OPW's core strategy for addressing flood risk in the Shannon Basin is the River Shannon Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Study. The output of this important project will be an integrated plan of specific measures to address, in a comprehensive and sustainable way, the significant flood risk factors in the Shannon basin. Draft predictive flood maps are currently being produced by engineering consultants undertaking the Shannon CFRAM Study, on behalf of the OPW, in partnership with the relevant local authorities. The draft flood maps will be subject to public consultation during this year, details of which will be advertised locally and on the Study website.<br/><br/>The next phase in the CFRAM Study will then be the identification of appropriate flood risk management options for each significant risk area, following which, Flood Risk Management Plans are scheduled to be prepared in late 2015/early 2016. Updates on the study are available on the Study website.</p></reply>

Kilmainham Gaol is also, as we know, a very significant site associated with key events in Irish history and, in particular, the 1916 Rising.</p>  <p>  The OPW's role at Kilmainham is to maintain the site and present it to the public through a dedicated guide service, explaining its 220 year history and its role in some of the key events in the formation of the State, including the execution of the 1916 Leaders.  The site opens to the public on a fulltime basis 362 days a year and has a strong profile as a "must see" visitor site in Dublin; it is therefore a key location in the marketing strategy of F&aacute;ilte Ireland for Dublin.</p>  <p>  The former Kilmainham Sessions house (Courthouse) occupies a site immediately adjacent to the Gaol to the east.  It has presented a unique opportunity to create additional capacity to deal with visitors and to provide ancillary curatorial, exhibition, research and visitor welfare facilities.</p>  <p>  In the context of the focus currently on marking the centenary of 1916, and where Kilmainham Gaol obviously holds such a particular strong resonance, the Sessions House facilitates the provision of a greatly enhanced visitor experience at Kilmainham to celebrate some of the seminal moments in the history of the formation of the State, recalling in particular the 1916 executions and the events of the Civil War.   </p>  <p>  Mindful of the fact therefore that the Gaol makes a very powerful statement about this period of our history, the Government wishes to particularly mark it as a place where the history of the Rising, and many of the historical artefacts associated with it, can be celebrated and shared with citizens and overseas visitors alike.  The Government has decided to proceed with the development of this project as one of its signature capital developments associated with the commemorations and arrangements are in train to have these works carried out in time for Spring 2016.   </p>  <p>  The second major element of work is the refurbishment and adaptation of the existing Museum within the Gaol.  This was constructed in the mid 1990's and has been the location for all the Interpretation and artefact displays at Kilmainham.  The exhibition is particularly outdated however and needs to be completely redone.   In addition, the building itself is being upgraded and a new entrance is being provided so that it can meet the significantly increased visitor traffic flow from the new Courthouse / Gaol entrance arrangements.</p>  <p>  On completion of the entire project, Kilmainham Gaol and the new Courthouse Visitor facility will host one of the early official events associated with the 1916 Commemorations with a wreath-laying event on Easter Sunday, 27th March 2016.</p></reply>

In that review I concluded that there is a need to continue to apply the relevant provisions of the legislation controlling the cost of remuneration of public servants and the other measures controlling the cost of the public service pay and pensions bill. It is worth restating that the expenditure proposals as set out in Budget 2015 are based, in part, on the reduced public service pay rates, as well as on the revenue accruing from the Pension Related Deduction and Public Service Pension Reduction as provided for under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts.</p>  <p>  As well as the statutory requirement for an annual report to be made by me as Minister to the Oireachtas on the operation of the Acts, the legislation is maintained under constant review to ensure only those measures absolutely necessary are maintained on the statute book.  The legal position concerning the financial emergency legislation, which has underpinned the reductions to date, will also have to be addressed as part of putting in place more normal pay setting arrangements in the public service for the future. </p>  <p>  As the pay setting environment normalises across the economy, it is important that the Government give consideration as to how, over the medium term, pay policy needs to develop in the public service, to help ensure that overall fiscal targets including achieving a deficit of less than 3% of GDP by the end of 2015, will be met.  In addition, the public service unions have indicated their intention, should the State's financial circumstances permit, to lodge a pay claim next year.  If such a claim is made, the Government will of course have to consider it, in line with the prevailing fiscal position.   </p></reply>

The purpose of this exercise was to establish the Government's expenditure priorities for the coming years, and to then allocate expenditure ceilings across Government Departments accordingly. This process, which involved engagement with the public and other Government Departments, culminated in the publication of the Comprehensive Expenditure Report on Budget day setting out the multi-annual current and capital expenditure ceilings for all Vote Groups over the period 2015 to 2017.<br/><br/>The publication of multi-annual expenditure ceilings sets the parameters for Government expenditure over a rolling three-year period, and facilitates a whole of year approach towards the budgetary process that allows for constructive discussion on how resources should be prioritised over the medium term. Decisions in relation to specific new budgetary measures would then fall to be considered in the context of the annual Budget in light of the most up to date fiscal and economic data.<br/><br/>This Spring, in addition to the usual publication of the Stability Programme Update in line with our European commitments, it is proposed that the Government publish a Spring Economic Statement. Such a publication would help to develop the domestic whole of year budgetary framework by providing a clear separate point in the year for a statement of national fiscal policy.<br/><br/>As Ireland is set to leave the Excessive Deficit Procedure at the end of 2015 and enter the preventive arm of the <font color="#2F2F2F">Stability and Growth Pact</font>, the Spring Economic Statement would provide the opportunity to set out how<font color="#2F2F2F">Ireland's fiscal policy post EDP will progress the Government's key economic and social objectives, while at the same time living within the parameters as set out under the revised framework of EU fiscal rules.</font></p></reply>

As a policy device it was very successful, reducing public service numbers by some 10%, with savings of over &euro;3 billion.  This made a very important contribution to the stabilising of the public finances. The Moratorium was not, however, a blanket ban on recruitment.  During its operation, provision was made for targeted recruitment in the sectors to which the Deputy refers - Health and Education, and also in the Justice sector.  <br/><br/>Most recently, in Budget 2015, I made provision:<br/><br/>-for some 1,700 teachers, SNA and resource teachers; and<br/><br/>-  for a further 100 Garda recruits in 2015, on top of an additional 200 in late 2014;<br/><br/>In addition, targeted recruitment into the Civil Service which began in 2014, is continuing this year in the grades of Clerical Officer, Executive Officer, Administrative Officer, Assistant Principal Officer and Principal Officer. <br/><br/>The Deputy may also be aware, as I announced on Budget day, that arrangements are currently being put in place to replace the Moratorium with a framework whereby management of public service staffing will be delegated to Departments and frontline managers.  <br/><br/>The new framework will, subject to binding overall pay ceilings, and commitment to ongoing reform and efficiency objectives, give front-line managers greater flexibility to manage staffing in response to service needs as they arise. My officials are currently finalising the details of the new framework with the other Government Departments.</p></reply>

Given the amounts raised every year, it is therefore a critical component of the public service pay and pension measures adopted as part of our national fiscal consolidation.  However, it should be noted that a start has already been made on ameliorating the impact of PRD on public servants. As legislated for in the the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2013, and as provided for in the Haddington Road Agreement, the rate of PRD on the &euro;15,000 to &euro;20,000 band of pay received in a year fell from 5% to 2.5% on 1 January 2014. This cut is worth &euro;125 annually in gross terms to most public servants, with those taxed at the standard rate enjoying the greater gain in terms of take-home pay boost. I would envisage that further amendments to the PRD will be raised by the unions and associations representing public servants in the context of the discussions which are likely to take place later this year.</p></reply>

A public consultation on draft predictive flood risk mapping for these locations is currently being rolled out throughout the Shannon region.  Further details on the public consultation and on the Shannon CFRAM Study are available on the Study website .

The scheme allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age, or incapacitated people, to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being calculated for pension purposes. The effect of this is to reduce the number of years by which the person&rsquo;s contributions are divided, thereby increasing their yearly average, making it easier for them to qualify for a maximum rate SPC. It does not, therefore, involve the award of credits.</p>  <p>  To be eligible for the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme, a person must: </p>  <p>  - Permanently live in the State (exception may be made where EU regulations apply),</p>  <p>  - Be aged under 66, </p>  <p>  - Have started insurable employment or self-employment before the age of 56, </p>  <p>  - Not work full-time, although for the purposes of this scheme, a person can work and earn less than &euro;38 gross per week, </p>  <p>  - Care for a child (under 12) or an incapacitated person on a full-time basis. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme will not, of itself, qualify a person for a SPC. The standard qualifying conditions for the SPC must also be satisfied.  These require a person to enter insurable employment at least ten years before pension age, pay a minimum of 520 contributions at the correct rate (credited contributions do not satisfy this condition) and achieve a yearly average of at least 10 contributions paid or credited on their record. </p>  <p>  Where someone age 66 or over does not satisfy the conditions to qualify for a SPC, or qualifies for less than the maximum rate, they may instead qualify for one the following: </p>  <p>  - The means-tested State pension (non-contributory). The maximum personal rate of this pension is &euro;219, which may be payable if their means are no more than &euro;30 per week. A reduced rate may be payable if their means are no more than &euro;245 per week. A living alone allowance may also be paid, where applicable. </p>  <p>  - If a spouse receives the SPC, the other spouse may receive a payment, known as an increase for qualified adult (IQA), which may be up to &euro;206.30 per week. </p>  <p>  - If widowed, they may qualify for a widow's contributory pension, which they may claim either based on their spouse&rsquo;s or their own social insurance record. The qualifying conditions for this require fewer contributions paid (260) than the SPC, and the maximum personal rate for those aged 66 or over is &euro;230.30. </p>  <p>  Where a person qualifies for more than one of the above payments, they are paid under the pension that is most advantageous to them. </p>  <p>  The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme was introduced from 1994, and as with most schemes, this was without retrospective effect. Costs in relation to this scheme, under the current rules, are expected to increase in the coming years due to the increase in female employment rates since 1994. The cost of backdating was considered in the context of the Green Paper on Pensions in 2007.  At that time, very tentative estimates suggested that the cost of backdating to 1953 would be approximately &euro;160 million annually.  These additional costs would be very significant and consequently, the Government has no plans to backdate this scheme prior to 1994.

In the context of such a large clientele, the amount of complaints received concerning the office is minimal. The most recent statistics available show that in the last 3 months there has been less than 10 complaints received via the complaints procedure on the Department&rsquo;s website in relation to the office. Additionally an even smaller number of individual complaints have been made in writing. </p>  <p>  In relation to the nature of the complaints, only 2 of these concerned difficulties that clients experienced with regard to the manner in which they were dealt with in the office. These are being handled by directly contacting the clients concerned. The other issues raised, which include calculation of overpayments and reasons for decisions made, are also being handled currently or have been resolved. </p>  <p>  There are currently 12 clients required to attend the office to sign on a daily basis. The option to request a client to sign daily can be taken in certain circumstances. Such circumstances can be when a client has a record of persistently signing late, an  officer has formed the opinion that there a strong likelihood that a client may be currently in employment in the black economy, or a Deciding Officer is of the opinion that a client is not making sufficient efforts to seek employment or to avail of training opportunities. In most cases daily signing is supplemented by frequent interviews monitoring a client&rsquo;s progress in seeking employment and/or training. The success rate of this approach is high; the majority of clients required to sign daily will avail of one of the Department&rsquo;s Labour Activation measures within a short timeframe.</p></reply>

In order to qualify for the tax relief currently, a minimum donation of &euro;250 per annum must be made to the body concerned.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, changes were made to the scheme of tax relief for donations to approved bodies in Finance Act 2013 as follows:</p>  <p>  - Donations from all individual donors under the scheme are treated in the same manner, with the tax relief in all cases being repaid to the charity. </p>  <p>  - A blended rate of relief of 31% applies to all taxpayers regardless of their marginal tax rate. All donations are grossed up as was previously done for donations from individuals within the PAYE collection system. </p>  <p>  - The charitable donations scheme has been removed from the scope of the high earners' restriction in recognition of the fact that donors will no longer benefit from the tax relief associated with their donations. </p>  <p>  - An annual donation limit of &euro;1 million per individual, for which a refund of income tax can be claimed by approved bodies, has been applied. </p>  <p>  These changes were made following a process of engagement between officials at the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners with representatives of the charities sector from the Irish Charities Tax Reform Group (ICTR). </p>  <p>  The objectives of that process were threefold: (i) to simplify the operation of the regime, (ii) to reduce the administrative overheads on charities and on the Revenue Commissioners incurred in the operation of the scheme, and (iii) to ensure that any change would be Revenue neutral from the Exchequer perspective. The proposals for the changes were also recommended in the Report of the Forum on Philanthropy and Fundraising.</p>  <p>  The &euro;250 threshold has not changed since it was introduced in 2002. Normal inflation levels effectively have reduced the value of the threshold over time. In addition, the donations scheme was introduced to encourage the donation of large sums of money to charities and certain other bodies. It was never envisaged that the scheme should subsidise smaller donations, which in all likelihood, would be made in any event.</p>  <p>  The tax relief available for donations is already very generous and donations can be cumulative, such that a donation of just &euro;5 per week over the course of a year would qualify. However, tax relief is no longer provided to individual donors and is refunded directly to the approved bodies. It is therefore questionable as to whether reducing the &euro;250 limit would result in additional donations.</p></reply>

The complexities of estimating the increased yield from income taxation would require, among other information, details of (i) the number of hours worked by the relevant individuals, (ii) whether they are singly or jointly assessed, and (iii) how tax credits are assigned between spouses. <br/><br/>Furthermore, increases in the minimum wage would be an additional cost for employers and thus would presumably have a negative effect on profits, leading to a reduction in Schedule D Income Tax and Corporation Tax receipts. In cases where employers could not afford the new minimum wage rates, it is possible that job losses could be experienced further reducing the potential yield from such a measure.<br/><br/>Notwithstanding the above however, for illustrative purposes, estimated examples of the increases in Income Tax / USC that could arise for individuals, as a result of the increases specified by the Deputy, are set out in the table below. For the purposes of the illustration, it is assumed that the taxpayer is single, working 39 hours per week, and taxed at the standard rate of tax. Rounding may affect totals.<table><tr><th>Minimum Wage</th><th>Additional Income Tax per annum</th><th>Additional USC per annum</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>&euro;/ph</td><td>&euro;</td><td>&euro;</td><td>&euro;</td></tr><tr><td>9.65</td><td>604</td><td>197</td><td>800</td></tr><tr><td>10.65</td><td>1,068</td><td>254</td><td>1,322</td></tr><tr><td>11.45</td><td>1,793</td><td>653</td><td>2,446</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The allocations provided in the Revised Estimates Volume 2015 across Government Departments for 2015, and the multi-annual expenditure ceilings published in the Comprehensive Expenditure Report 2015   2017 will assist with ensuring the ongoing provision of vital public services at an affordable cost while also serving to further support the nascent but strengthening economic recovery. </p>  <p>  It is the responsibility of Ministers and their Departments to manage within their 2015 expenditure allocations to ensure that our key deficit target for 2015 is achieved.  My Department will monitor and report on expenditure trends to Government and engage with Departments in relation to managing expenditure within profile. </p>  <p>  Economic growth requries sound and sustainable management of the public finances. Added to this, the growth-friendly environment and policies, as well as the significant public service reforms undertaken, provide the foundations for sustained economic growth.</p>  <p>  Reforms to the way in which the public service operates will provide Irish citizens with high-quality public services that are delivered in an efficient and cost-effective manner. The increased focus on evaluation of expenditure policies and programmes has also contributed to our ability to effectively manage and allocate resources across all areas of public policy. The forthcoming Capital Review will set out multi-annual capital expenditure ceilings for Departments, reflecting the Government's identification of the infrastructure investment which will best underpin future growth and help address pressing social requirements.</p></reply>

The purpose of the review is to refresh the Government's existing investment strategy and set a new multi-annual capital envelope which addresses critical infrastructure needs and is in line with emerging Government priorities.<br/><br/>As part of the Estimates process, and informed by the capital review, Government has made decisions on the capital allocations for the period 2015 to 2017. These were set out in Budget 2015 with some technical adjustments and minor revisions made in the Revised Estimates for Public Services 2015 (REV 2015). The new ceilings include increased expenditure for Social Housing, Transport, Education and Health in order to address infrastructure requirements in those areas.<br/><br/>It is a matter for individual Ministers and their Departments to decide the specific projects and programmes that will be delivered from within these allocations. <br/><br/>The report of the capital review is currently being finalised and I intend to publish it in the coming weeks. It will include the three year ceilings already announced along with new ceilings for the period 2018 to 2020.</p></reply>

My Department is currently engaging with all Government Departments in ensuring that the necessary structures and controls are in place to allow for the new framework to be rolled out. Where agreement is reached that such structures and controls are in place, formal delegated sanction will then be issued.  <br/><br/>Once the sanction is issued, it will be a matter for Departments to manage their staffing resources, including recruitment and promotion to key services, subject to overall pay limits. <br/><br/>I would point out to the Deputy that there is ongoing recruitment in the Public Service.  Most recently in Budget 2015, in Education, I made provision for more than 1,700 additional teachers, Special Needs Assistants and resource teachers. I similarly made provision for additional front line staff in the Health and Justice Sectors. <br/><br/>There are no specific guidelines agreed with the Troika with regard to recruitment into the Public Service.</p></reply>

The additional Returning Officer costs arise as Returning Officers get an additional 20% of their fee where there is more than one poll and Presiding Officers and Count Supervisors get an additional 10%. In total the incremenatal costs of a second poll are estimated at &euro;1.7m or 13% more than the cost of a single poll.

As property is one of the key considerations for clients when choosing a location, the availability of suitable premises in Athlone will provide an additional positive element in the Midlands.</p>  <p>  IDA Ireland promotes Westmeath as part of its Midlands Region, which also includes Counties Longford, Laois and Offaly.  There are 35 multinational companies employing 4,032 within the Region. The Region is marketed as having a strong cluster in Medical Technology and Life Sciences and is home to many key clients, one such example being Covidien in Athlone.</p>  <p>  Growing both Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and indigenous enterprise is key to Ireland&rsquo;s economic recovery. I am glad to inform the Deputy that 2014 was a record year for both IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland in terms of investment wins and job creation, with 7,131 net new jobs being created in IDA Ireland client companies and 8,476 net new jobs being created in Enterprise Ireland client companies.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Action Plan for Jobs 2015 was launched on 29th  January last.  This is the fourth annual plan in a multi-year process, which began in 2012.  When the First Action Plan for Jobs was launched, unemployment stood at 15.1%.   Today it stands at 10.6% and we are on track to exceed our target of 100,000 additional jobs by 2016. We are now setting a goal to bring employment to 2.1 million by 2018 &ndash; 2 years ahead of our original target.</p>  <p>  We are determined to ensure that every region will benefit from the recovery.  Yesterday, along with the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste, I announced the details of a comprehensive new strategy to support enterprise growth and job creation at regional level.   The Regional Action Plan for Jobs initiative seeks to build on the success of the annual Action Plan for Jobs process by developing locally driven plans that can build on the strengths and opportunities identified in each region.</p>  <p>  The strategy will provide up to &euro;250 million over five years in additional funding to support regional enterprise development.  This includes the roll out of a five year, &euro;150 million property investment programme by the IDA to attract foreign direct investment into the regions.   This programme will build on the recent investment by the IDA in a number of advance manufacturing facilities in regional locations.  A further sum of up to &euro;100 million will be available to Enterprise Ireland to support enterprises in the regions to start-up, grow and export, thereby creating more jobs in regional locations.</p></reply>

There are currently 117 such centres across the country. The last scheme rolled out was in 2012 and 2013 when Enterprise Ireland provided funding of &euro;2 million to support the recruitment of a total of 46 Business Development Managers.<br/><br/>On the wider issue of the performance of the Centres, the success levels, occupancy levels and sustainability of jobs at the Centres varies and therefore I asked Enterprise Ireland to review the operations of the Community Enterprise Centres in the context of Regional Enterprise Development and how the Community Enterprise Centres, the Local Enterprise Offices and other Regional entities might work more closely in support of business start-ups, before giving further consideration to the matter.<br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F">Earlier today the Government announced details of its 5-year, &euro;250million Regional Strategy, aimed at accelerating the jobs recovery in every part of the country. Action Plan for Jobs &ndash; Regional - is based on the principle that the best way to support job-creation in towns and villages across the country is to support agencies and organisations within 8 regions, to build on the particular strengths and assets of their area and drive new job-creation strategies and projects.  </font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F">The Strategy is based on the successful Action Plan for Jobs model of setting out lists of actions with timelines and responsibility allocated, and then monitoring implementation. </font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F">As Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, I will lead the initiative. Each of the 8 regions will develop its own Action Plan. It is my intention that all Regional Plans will be published or in development by July 2015. </font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F">Under the Strategy, Enterprise Ireland will launch a series of new competitive funding initiatives in the areas of entrepreneurship, innovation, enterprise infrastructure and job creation. The objective is to bring forward fresh collaborative initiatives to boost enterprise and job creation in the region. An initial fund of &euro;50 million is to be made available for three competitive calls. </font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F">The first of these competitive calls, with a budget of &euro;5 million, will focus on community-driven enterprise initiatives and how all the local players, public and private, can work together to maximise job creation.</font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F">The Community Enterprise Initiatives Fund call will be open to existing Community Enterprise Centres (CECs) and also to any other organisation or groups of organisations with innovative ideas to create jobs, promote entrepreneurship, boost innovation or enhance exports. It should be open to any credible and novel approach rather than simply replicating what has been done before.</font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F">The criteria in any such competition will be announced by Enterprise Ireland, but the typical criteria will include:</font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F">-Promoting a culture of entrepreneurship locally and regionally;</font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F">-Developing capacity to start up and scale companies; filling gaps in enterprise facilities;</font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F">-Building on existing strengths or opportunities, e.g. developing a sectoral opportunity where there is a competitive advantage</font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F">-Devising a credible plan to deliver added value in jobs and start-ups and increased level of exporting / potential exporters</font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F">-Commitment of matching finance</font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F">-Bringing originality in approach, objectives, leverage of other stakeholders</font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F">-Leveraging off other enterprise support (Mentoring, funding, networks)</font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F">-Promoting public and private partnership, e.g. alignment/collaboration with others players (e.g. LEO, ETB, HEIs, Chambers etc.)</font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F">I believe this is a significant challenge and a significant opportunity for the Community Enterprise Centres, in collaboration with others, to deliver new businesses and jobs in their locality.</font></p></reply>

The EMFF funds are allocated by the Commission in accordance with the five envelopes identified in article 13 of the EMFF Regulation.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has sanctioned in total &euro;93.9 million in Exchequer co-funding for the Programme and this was similarly allocated on the basis of those five envelopes.  Funding for aquaculture is not separately identified in that process.</p>  <p>  The sustainable development of aquaculture is part of the Common Fisheries Policy and the EMFF is specifically intended to support that policy.  When I publish the consultation draft of the Programme shortly, my proposals on how the funds should be best used in the national interest and in the interests of the seafood industry as a whole will become clear.  I will welcome all views at that point on the extent to which our resources should be directed towards aquaculture development.

At recent meetings with the E.U. Commission it was made clear that it is incumbent on Member States to ensure that payments are for actions above the baseline and that clear evidence of same must be shown in order to secure approval for the Rural Development Programme.</p>  <p>  There has been extensive consultation with the stakeholders concerned and I am well aware of the issues arising. However, there is general agreement that the key to managing these valuable habitats is a single Commonage Management Plan (CMP), covering all participating GLAS shareholders.</p>  <p>  I have recently met with various hill-farmer representatives and I am very confident that we can deliver a successful implementation strategy for these commonages. In this regard, I have stressed that reaching the 50% participation rate is an important target but it will not be a barrier to entry. My focus now is to secure Commission approval to the Rural Development Programme at the earliest possible date so that I can open GLAS to applications.</p></reply>

The regulations require that advisors are suitably qualified and regularly trained. In addition, in order to be approved as a GLAS Advisor, an advisor must also be an approved FAS advisor.  In determining the level of educational qualifications required to be a FAS/GLAS advisor, my Department must ensure that such qualifications are of an appropriate standard to meet the objectives and the requirements of the various schemes, and the associated governing legislation, on which advice is being provided. Advisors must be qualified to interpret soil tests, understand the requirements of all schemes and understand constraints of land management imposed by various land designations. Furthermore, advisors must be in a position to translate this knowledge into detailed management plans and advice for farmers not only on the schemes requirements but also on their farm operations.<br/><br/>In order to ensure that advisors meet the requirements outlined above, my Department requires that all advisors must have attained a HETAC Level 8 Bachelor Degree in Agricultural Science/Land Management in Agriculture and must have taken soil science and an animal or crop production subject to a level 8 (NFQ) degree standard. <br/><br/>My Department recently carried out a review of the educational qualification requirements for FAS/GLAS advisors following the receipt of an appeal from Mountbellew Agricultural College/GMIT in relation to the level 7 BSc in Agriculture and Environment Management with the add-on level 8 BSc in Rural Enterprise and Environment Management, which had been deemed as not meeting the required standard. The review was undertaken by an officer independent of the original decision making process. <br/><br/>This review, which incorporated a detailed examination of all documentation submitted as part of the appeal, identified that this course did not meet the standard of educational qualifications required as some of the core subjects of soil science and animal and crop production were assessed only as part of the level 7 degree. The required standard to be approved as a FAS/GLAS advisor is, and has been for some years, that these core subjects must have been taken/assessed as part of a level 8 (NFQ) degree programme.<br/><br/><i>In order to address the concerns on this issue, I am now arranging for officials from my Department to meet with relevant institutions in the near future to discuss in detail the educational qualification requirements for FAS Advisors, the feasibility of adapting existing courses to meet this standard in the future and to identify options to facilitate past graduates in achieving the required standard of qualifications.</i></p></reply>

In July 2014 the alleged perpetrator, Mr. Mahmoud Bazzi, was arrested by the United States of America&rsquo;s Immigration and Customs Enforcement&rsquo;s Agency for administrative immigration violations. During his immigration court hearing in Detroit, on 11 August, Mr. Bazzi admitted that he entered the United States in 1994 without proper documentation. The Judge ruled that Mr. Bazzi be deported to Lebanon.  Mr. Bazzi was finally deported from the United States to his native Lebanon on 30 January 2015. On arrival in Beirut, Mr. Bazzi was arrested and detained by the Lebanese authorities where he remains in custody. It is now a matter for the Lebanese authorities to investigate the case. The Irish Ambassador in the region is continuing to monitor developments in the case and is in contact with the Department of Defence.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately, there are no provisions in Irish law, which provide a basis for Ireland to pursue a prosecution against the alleged perpetrator. Lebanon is the country with primary jurisdiction in this case. The Irish Government have requested the support of the Lebanese Government in seeking justice for the murdered Irish UNIFIL peacekeepers, should such action be feasible. During my visit to the Lebanon last December, I met with the Lebanese authorities at the most senior levels of Government and highlighted the Irish Government&rsquo;s continued commitment and interest in progressing this case.</p>  <p>  I am not in a position to state whether the alleged perpetrator will go free but I can state that we are committed to continuing to do everything possible to pursue justice for both men who lost their lives in the line of peacekeeping duty, and stand ready to provide whatever assistance possible to the Lebanese authorities in progressing this issue. However, it is a matter for the Lebanese authorities to investigate the case and to determine any future action in accordance with their National Legislation and judicial procedures.</p></reply>

With the exception of premises forming part of licensed premises prior to 28 July 1926, section 17(2) of the Licensing Act 1872 prohibits the carrying on of betting activities on licensed premises. </p></reply>

The aim of the legislation is to seek to effectively eliminate, in so far as is possible, the need for judges to commit anyone to prison for the non-payment of a fine. As well as introducing an option for persons to pay fines by instalment, there are also changes in the way those who fail to pay fines are dealt with, with a range of options available to judges including recovery orders, attachment of earnings, community service and ultimately imprisonment.<br/><br/>Work is ongoing in preparing for the implementation of the Act. The area most directly affected by the changes is the Courts and the Courts Service is working on a number of developments which will ensure that the implementation of the legislation, and the new procedures which will operate under it, are as efficient as possible.<br/><br/>In relation to the introduction of payment of fines by instalment, a decision was taken to outsource all aspects of the recovery of fines to an external provider. The Courts Service is introducing new arrangements for the payment of fines which will allow payments to be made in a range of outlets across the country, and not just through Courts Service offices. There are significant changes in information technology required to ensure that the instalment payment system operates effectively and that the necessary accounting procedures are in place for the recording of payments. Changes are also required in the way that information is transferred between the Courts Service and An Garda Siochana to ensure that both organisations have fully up to date information on the cases and their current status.<br/><br/>It is expected that all the preparations for the new system will be completed by the third quarter of 2015. While it is desirable that the Act be commenced as soon as possible, it is important that these preparations are done correctly to ensure that the significant changes being implemented in the fines system as a result of this legislation are implemented smoothly and effectively from the start.</p></reply>

The Programme is a targeted intervention aimed at school communities identified through the Department of Education and Skills&rsquo; DEIS Action Plan for Educational Inclusion. It provides targeted supports annually to approximately 36,000 children.</p>  <p>  The School Completion Programme was subject to a Comprehensive Review of Expenditure in 2011, requiring an annual reduction in budget of 6.5% in the period 2012-2014, from &euro;30.258m in 2011 to the 2014 allocation of &euro;24.756m. Since 1st January 2014, the Child and Family Agency has operational responsibility for the School Completion Programme, including the allocation of funds to local projects. The Agency has approved local projects' school retention plans for the 2014/2015 academic year. The first instalment of 2014/15 funding issued to local projects last September. Further payments totalling approximately &euro;9.5m have issued over the past month, with a third instalment planned for payment in May 2015.   </p>  <p>  The estimate for the Child and Family Agency for 2015 is &euro;631 million, a 4.3% increase on its 2014 allocation. My Department has recently issued a Performance Statement to the Agency under Section 45 of the Child and Family Agency Act, 2013. This includes my priorities for consideration in the development of the Agency's 2015 Business Plan. The Business Plan will set out the Agency's proposed activities, programmes and priorities for 2015, including provision for the School Completion Programme, in the light of the monies available.</p>  <p>  A review of the School Completion Programme has commenced. It is being carried out by the ESRI following a procurement process managed by the Agency. The programme has been in operation since 2002 and I believe that it is timely that a review be carried out.  The Review is an important initiative to plan for the future development of this Programme.  It is envisaged that the review will be completed during the 2014/2015 academic year. </p></reply>

I am aware that the Health Service Executive does, where possible, assist children with special needs who may require additional support to enable them to avail of pre-school services in mainstream settings.  <br/><br/>To ensure that the ECCE programme is more accessible to children with special needs, a number of additional provisions have been added.  These include an exemption from the upper age limit for qualification under the programme where a child is developmentally delayed and would benefit from starting primary school at a later age.  In addition, children with special needs can apply to have the pre-school year split over two years on a pro-rata basis, for example availing of the programme for 2 days a week in the first year and for 3 days a week in the second year.  <br/><br/>The free pre-school programme is designed to be delivered for three hours per day, five days per week, over 38 weeks (183 days per year), and capitation fees are paid to participating services on the basis of this provision.  The provision is based on the primary school model, under which primary schools are required to open on 193 days per year (equivalent to 38.6 weeks).  There are no plans to increase the current provision within the pre-school year or to extend the age range for eligibility.  <br/><br/>A total of some &euro;175 million is spent on the ECCE scheme annually in which some 67,000 children receive free pre-school care and education. The Government succeeded in maintaining the pre-school year on a universal and free basis despite the difficult budgetary situation that prevailed in recent years.While considerable progress has been made in correcting the overall budgetary situation, the funding available to my Department following the completion of budgetary process this year does not allow for an increase in the capitation paid to childcare providers. As the economy improves and the public finances recover, I would hope that the capitation rates for all childcare programmes could be improved.<br/><br/>To ensure that all the benefits of childcare investments are fully realised, future public investment in childcare must be evidence-based and strategically coordinated.  I am establishing a cross-Departmental group to look at the provision right across the 0 to 6 age group as well as to consider the after-school needs of older school-going children. It is crucial that we develop a coherent whole-of-Government approach to investment in childcare services.<b></b>This new group will include representatives of the Departments of Education and Skills, Social Protection, Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Public Expenditure and Reform, Finance and the Department of the Taoiseach and will be led and supported by my Department.  </p></reply>

A further 8,451 children did not have an allocated social worker.  <br/><br/>Of the 8,451 cases, 2,844 were deemed to be high priority.  These cases represent a mix of new referrals that need further assessment and social work input, as well as children known to the Agency who need a continuing social work service.  I am assured by the Agency that emergency cases are dealt with immediately, for instance a child who has been abandoned or is in immediate physical danger or at immediate risk of sexual abuse and that high priority cases are kept under review.<br/><br/>The Child and Family Agency is undertaking a number of manpower related initiatives designed to increase the workforce capacity of the organisation and to ensure that unallocated cases are dealt with expeditiously.  These include:<br/><br/>- Continuing recruitment, with 164 social workers recruited since the Agency was established, and a further 219 posts currently in the recruitment process;<br/><br/>- The introduction of a pilot Maternity Leave Scheme whereby temporary staff can be offered a 12 month contract to cover maternity leave;<br/><br/>- In recognition of the challenging nature of this work, new entrants and graduates have a reduced workload for their first year, with opportunities for regular supervision with experienced practitioners;<br/><br/>- The roll out of a caseload management system to ensure caseloads are manageable and prioritised appropriately.</p></reply>

This is a first step in a programme to extend the availability of diagnostics to support the management of patients in general practice.  &euro;0.7 million is being made available for this purpose in 2015.<br/><br/>The pilot will provide GPs direct access to ultrasound, at approximately eight primary care sites, across the South and West, from early 2015.  This will be an outsourced initiative that will run for an initial 12 month period.  The tender evaluation process is near conclusion.  It is due to be awarded in February and the sites will be rolled out over a 3-12 week period thereafter.<br/><br/>The initial prioritised areas were identified as those of greatest need from the HSE's and Irish College of General Practitioners' Radiology Reports.  Subject to the procurement exercise, the following numbers of ultrasounds are targeted:<br/><br/>Cork &ndash; 4,250<br/><br/>Kerry &ndash; 1,500<br/><br/>Galway &ndash; 2,250<br/><br/>Mayo &ndash; 1,750<br/><br/>Roscommon &ndash; 750<br/><br/>Sligo/Leitrim &ndash; 1,250<br/><br/>Donegal &ndash; 2,250<br/><br/>Limerick &ndash; 2,000.<br/><br/>GPs will be able to electronically refer patients, to the preferred provider. The preferred provider will see urgent patients within 5 working days and non-urgent patients within 10 working days. An ultrasonographer will conduct the ultrasound and a radiologist will report on each examination. The pilot will aim to clear any existing hospital waiting lists for GP referrals to ultrasound.<br/><br/>The pilot will help inform the HSE&rsquo;s future planning in the context of the provision of ultrasound scans in Primary Care.</p></reply>

Under these provisions, persons who are insured with (covered by) the healthcare system of one EU member state are entitled to receive healthcare in the public system of another member state in certain circumstances, at the cost of the member state in which they are insured.  Such persons may include:<br/><br/>-people who are employed in one member state and resident in another and their dependants,<br/><br/>-pensioners of one member state who reside in another and their dependants,<br/><br/>-visitors to one member state from another, and<br/><br/>-persons referred for treatment to another member state.<br/><br/>The EU Regulations provide for the costs to be reimbursed between member states. The Regulations also allow for two or more states to agree alternative arrangements for reimbursement other than those laid down in the Regulations, or to mutually waive reimbursement altogether.  <br/><br/>Ireland's primary interaction has been and continues to be with the United Kingdom with whom it operates a bilateral healthcare reimbursement agreement, covering such persons as temporary visitors between the two countries, pensioners of one country and their dependants residing in the other country, and the dependant families of persons employed in the other country. Under the terms of the agreement net liability between the two countries is calculated on a lump sum basis rather than an individual basis.  The amount payable is the net difference between the costs to the Irish health services of providing care to those with only UK entitlements and the cost to the UK health services of providing services to those with only Irish entitlements.  The amount payable is agreed following compilation of the necessary data and discussions between the two administrations.  Payments are made in advance and are subject to final settlement once all necessary statistical and financial information is complete. Total payments in any one year can as a consequence relate to both final settlements in respect of previous years' liabilities and advance payments in respect of the current and/or previous years. The net payment received by Ireland from the United Kingdom was &euro;100m in 2008; &euro;286m in 2009, &euro;320m in 2010; &euro;270m in 2011; &euro;220m in 2012; &euro;220m in 2013 and &euro;172m in 2014.  These amounts represent the actual payments made in cash in these years and do not correspond to the full liability for that particular year.<br/><br/>As explained below, only a small portion of the above payments relates to UK visitors to Ireland and Irish visitors to the UK.  By far the largest part of the payment received from the UK authorities on an annual basis relates to the provision of healthcare to UK pensioners and their dependants residing in Ireland. Entirely separate arrangements apply to patient referrals for scheduled treatment in the other jurisdiction whereby the costs arising are reimbursed on an actual costs basis. These arrangements are administered by the Health Service Executive.<br/><br/>The amount payable in any one year attributable to temporary visitors between Ireland and the UK (i.e. EHIC type costs) is determined by the estimated number of visitor days and an estimate of the average cost of providing healthcare treatment.  The finalisation of accounts is normally some years in arrears to facilitate collation of relevant statistics and for the approval of the average cost prepared by each country for the year concerned at EU level.  The last accounts finalised were in respect of the year 2008 in respect of which Ireland&rsquo;s liability to the United Kingdom was calculated at Stg&pound;10,161,467 (&euro;12,269,340 approximately) for 22,945,700 visitor days (Ireland to UK) and the United Kingdom&rsquo;s liability to Ireland was &euro;17,735,993 for 19,095,600 visitor days (UK to Ireland).  Accounts for subsequent years have not yet been finalised. However visitor days for the years 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013 have been estimated respectively as follows:<br/><br/><b>Estimated Visitor Days in 000's</b><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>2008</th><th>2009</th><th>2010</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th><th>2014</th></tr><tr><td>Visitor days Ireland to UK</td><td>22,946</td><td>23,083</td><td>21,614</td><td>19,017</td><td>17,754</td><td>15,790</td><td>not available</td></tr><tr><td>Visitor days UK to Ireland</td><td>19,096</td><td>17,057</td><td>14,377</td><td>14,174</td><td>13,107</td><td>14,134</td><td>not available</td></tr></table><br/><br/>There are no proposals to change these arrangements.</p></reply>

In October 2013, during the universal periodic review of Israel&rsquo;s human rights record, Ireland expressed this concern and urged Israel to fully implement the recommendations of the February 2013 UNICEF report, entitled &quot;Children in Israeli Military Detention&quot;.  <br /><br />We recommended that Israel end urgently night arrests of Palestinian children, the admissibility in evidence in military courts of written confessions in Hebrew signed by Palestinian children, the use of solitary confinement and the denial of access to family members or to legal representation.<br /><br />Bilaterally, our concerns regarding the detention of Palestinian minors have been raised as part of our ongoing dialogue with the Israeli authorities on the overall situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and Israel&rsquo;s treatment of the Palestinian population, both with the Israeli Embassy here and through our own Embassy in Tel Aviv.<br /><br />We cannot attempt to follow each specific case in which these issues arise.  The case cited by the Deputy has not previously come to the attention of my Department, although it is a clear example of the reasons why these practices are of such concern.<br /><br />In my view, Palestinian children should be afforded the same rights and protections under the law which Israel rightly considers to be appropriate for Israeli children living alongside them.<br /><br />The overall human rights situation in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including the treatment of children in detention, remains a matter of concern and will continue to be raised in the relevant multilateral fora, and to feature in the EU's broader concerns about human rights in the area. <br /><br />Similar concerns would exist in relation to the detention of children in many other states in the region.</blockquote></p></reply>

The vast majority of providers of education and training to international students in the State operate to a high standard and are motivated by the desire to enable learners to reach their potential.  However, it is evident that a minority of providers do not operate to the same standards, with serious implications for students and the reputation of the wider sector. <br/><br/>  For this reason, I announced robust regulatory reforms to the international education sector together with the Minister for Justice and Equality on 2nd September 2014.  These reforms are designed to provide certainty and clarity for international students coming to Ireland, to prioritise education over work, to give effect to an enhanced inspection and compliance regime and to safeguard the strong international reputation of high-quality Irish education providers. <br/><br/>  A key pillar of these reforms is a strengthened and more integrated inspection regime, including an enhanced inspection function for the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) and the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), which will be linked to Revenue, the Department of Social Protection and the National Employment Rights Authority.  Officials from my Department and the Department of Justice and Equality are co-operating closely on the arrangements for the implementation of the reforms and when finalised, these will be brought to Government for approval.<br/><br/>  Another key pillar of the regulatory reforms for international education is the International Education Mark and related Code of Practice.  The Code of Practice, which is currently being finalised by QQI, includes requirements relating to the protection of enrolled learners, treatment of fees and tax compliance, and will also address other 'non-academic' issues such as recruitment, marketing and accommodation.  Providers will have to demonstrate compliance with the Code before being authorised to use the Mark.<br/><br/>  The Mark will be used both as a driver of quality within institutions and as a marketing tool to underpin the promotional activities of Enterprise Ireland in seeking to attract international learners to Ireland.  In addition, the Mark will be used for immigration purposes.  From 2016 it will become a requirement that providers wishing to recruit students from outside the EEA have authorisation to use the Mark.  Providers authorised to use the Mark will also be subject to ongoing monitoring and review.</p></reply>

Subsequently a three phased approach was put in place to provide a comprehensive programme of support for teachers in primary and post primary schools in the area of anti-bullying.  The Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST) took a lead role in this collaboration.  This complied with the second recommendation of the Anti Bullying Working Group calling for a review of existing provision and putting in place a comprehensive programme of continuing professional development (CPD) to support schools in this area.</p>  <p>  The subsequent publication of my Department's "Anti Bullying Procedures for Primary and Post Primary Schools" in September 2013 further informed the programme of CPD.</p>  <p>  Phase 1 concentrated on the development of policies and procedures and was completed in the 2013/2014 school year.  It involved the design of a webcast on policies and procedures made available to all schools, the development of a policy template and a toolkit resource for schools.</p>  <p>  Phase 2 was a follow on which included local workshops and working with pilot schools  with a view to harnessing good practice and in school support was provided where necessary.</p>  <p>  Phase 3 concentrated on raising awareness, prevention and intervention strategies.  National seminars have been designed and delivered along with a suite of website materials , with follow up school support available where appropriate.</p></reply>

Further, an appeal mechanism was put in place in 2006 to address the concerns  of schools that did not qualify for inclusion in DEIS but regarded themselves  as having a level of disadvantage which was of a scale sufficient to warrant  their inclusion in the programme.  The school referred to by the Deputy did not  apply for an appeal of their DEIS ranking.</p>  <p>  Many representations have been made to my Department and to my predecessors, by  and on behalf of this school, seeking its inclusion in DEIS.

Over 3 billion euro of taxpayers money is spent annually on funding our primary school system.  The vast majority of this funding is allocated to schools on the basis of reported pupil numbers.  It is more than prudent from an audit and financial accountability point of view that we validate the data underlying these payments and ensure that payment is made only once in relation to each pupil.</p></reply>

The Strategy builds on the provisions contained in Budget 2015 and sets out clear, measurable actions and targets to increase the supply of social housing, reform delivery arrangements and meet the housing needs of all households on the housing list.The strategy t argets the provision of over 110,000 social housing units, through the delivery of 35,000 new social housing units and meeting the housing needs of some 75,000 households through the Housing Assistance Payment and Rental Accommodation Scheme. This level of ambition will address the needs of the 90,000 households on the housing waiting list in full, with flexibility to meet potential future demand. In committing to provide these 35,000 new social housing units, at a projected cost of &euro;3.8 billion, the strategy marks a fresh start for social housing in Ireland.<br/><br/>Over the 6 years of the strategy, I anticipate that the 35,000 units will be delivered as follows: some 22,300 units to be built and acquired utilising both current and capital monies; 11,000 units to be leased; and 2,300 units to be supplied through the refurbishment and bringing back into use of vacant local authority stock.<br/><br/>The process of setting delivery targets on a local authority by local authority basis has commenced and the allocation of funding to local authorities, in the context of the increased funding now available, will be based on the targets that are set and the plans of individual authorities to deliver on those targets.<br/><br/>In relation to homeless households, on 27 January, I issued a Ministerial Direction to each of the four Dublin local authorities and to each of the housing authorities in Galway, Cork, Limerick and Waterford, on prioritising homeless households and other vulnerable groups for housing in their respective areas. In the case of the Dublin authorities, this action will see at least 50% of the dwellings available for allocation, over the six-month period from 27 January to 26 July 2015, to such households that had qualified for social housing support on or before 1 December 2014. In the case of the other authorities, at least 30% of available dwellings must be so allocated. I expect that this intervention will deliver at least 500 homes for homeless households in the Dublin region and a similar amount for the other authorities combined. </p></reply>

The tender process, which is being led by Pobal, is almost complete. Following on from this, a panel of regional suppliers will be contracted to provide the equipment within specific regional areas. As the market for the equipment is well established, it was neither necessary nor appropriate to engage in consultations with the market on the matter prior to the tender process.</p>  <p>  This new approach will reduce the administrative burden for the many hundreds of community and voluntary groups registered under the Scheme, who provide an excellent service for the elderly. It will enable the groups to concentrate on the main purpose of the Scheme, namely to support and interact with the elderly in the local community. </p></reply>

The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that Irish Water shall collect charges from its customers in receipt of water services provided by it. The Act also provides that responsibility for the independent economic regulation of the water sector is assigned to the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and the CER has been given statutory responsibility for protecting the interests of customers. </p>  <p>In its decision on Irish Water&rsquo;s Water Charges Plan, published in October 2014, the CER stated that, until it made a decision on Irish Water&rsquo;s new connection charges, Irish Water should continue to apply rates equivalent to the water and wastewater related development levies which were applied by the local authorities at 31 December 2013. The CER intends to hold a public consultation on a new connection charging policy for customers of Irish Water. The relevant charges are available from Irish Water.</p>  <p>  If the Deputy has individual queries about the levy charged in relation to a particular county, Irish Water has established a dedicated team to deal with representations and queries from public representatives. The team can be contacted via email to oireachtasmembers@water.ie or by telephone on a dedicated number, 1890 578 578.</p></reply>

Without such contributions, this servicing would not proceed or the full cost would have to be borne by the taxpayer. Under the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, income from development levies must be ring-fenced to pay for facilities servicing new development, for example, for roads, footpaths, public lighting and open spaces.</p>  <p>  Development contributions are levied by planning authorities on the basis of a development contribution scheme approved by the elected members which sets out how contributions are to be applied in their respective functional areas. The level of contribution, and the types of development to which development contributions should apply, is therefore determined at local authority level in accordance with the powers vested in elected members in this connection. </p>  <p>  My Department issued statutory guidelines on development contributions to all planning authorities in January 2013. These guidelines emphasise the importance of promoting development through the application, where feasible, of reduced development contributions to facilitate development and promote economic activity and job creation in local areas. Further to the 2013 guidelines, 18 of the 31 local authorities have responded positively by adopting revised development contribution schemes - encompassing reduced charges &ndash; which have been notified to my Department subsequent to their adoption. </p></reply>

The total targeted provision of over 110,000 social housing units, through the delivery of 35,000 new social housing units and meeting the housing needs of some 75,000 households through the Housing Assistance Payment and Rental Accommodation Scheme, will address the needs of the 90,000 households on the housing waiting list in full, with flexibility to meet potential future demand.

This will be achieved through a combination of commercial investments and a State led intervention in areas where commercial services will not be provided.The commercial telecommunications sector is currently investing approximately &euro;2.5 billion in network upgrades. Approximately 1.6 million of the 2.3 million premises in Ireland are expected to have access to commercial high speed broadband services over the next two years. These very significant investments represent a step-change in the quality of broadband services available.<br/><br/>On the 24 November last, a public consultation on a national high speed coverage map 2016 was launched. The map can be accessed at . The areas on the map marked Blue will all have access to high speed broadband services of at least 30mbps from the commercial sector by end of 2016. The areas marked Amber will require the intervention of the State. It is anticipated that speeds of at least 30Mbps will also be delivered through the Government&rsquo;s intervention.<br/><br/>The map allows all members of the public, be they business or residential, to see whether their premises / home will have access to commercial high speed broadband services by end 2016 or whether they will be included in the Government's proposed intervention. It also provides detailed information on over 50,000 townlands in every county in Ireland.<br/><br/>In tandem with the mapping consultation, intensive design and planning work is underway in my Department to produce a detailed intervention strategy. The strategy will address a range of issues in relation to the intervention including the optimum procurement model, ownership model for the infrastructure, intervention cost and likely market impact. <br/><br/>My Department has engaged external advisors to provide legal, economic, technical and financial advice on the various aspects of the Plan over the next two years. The next steps in this process will see a further public consultation on a detailed intervention strategy in mid-2015. The Intervention Strategy will be notified to the European Commission for State Aid clearance. <br/><br/>Following the public consultation, a detailed procurement process will be undertaken towards the end of this year in order to select a preferred bidder or bidders. The Department will design a tender in a way that maximises efficiencies and keeps the cost of the network build as low as possible. It is expected that the physical build of this network will commence from 2016.  It will then be incrementally rolled out over a period of three to five years.<br/><br/>This complex and ambitious project is a key priority for Government. It aims to conclusively address current connectivity challenges in Ireland.  </p></reply>

The construction, improvement and maintenance of individual national roads, such as the Naas Bypass widening, is a matter for the National Roads Authority under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2007, in conjunction with the local authorities concerned. The assessment and prioritisation of individual national road projects is a matter for the NRA within its capital budget and in accordance with section 19 of the Roads Act.     </p>  <p>  With regard to the Osberstown interchange and the Sallins bypass the improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads is the statutory responsibility of each local authority, in accordance with the provisions of section 13 of the Roads Act 1993. Works on those roads are funded from local authorities' own resources, supplemented by State road grants. The selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is, therefore, a matter for the local authority.</p>  <p>  Owing to the national financial position, there have been very large reductions in roads expenditure in recent years. The reality is that the available funds do not match the amount of work that needs to be done to maintain existing road infrastructure or address demands for new road improvement projects. Funding in 2008 was &euro;2.3 billion while funding this year is around &euro;730 million for the national, regional and local road network.  Unfortunately, the current financial realities are such that the budgets proposed for my Department for 2016 and 2017 indicate that capital funding will continue to be very tight, and my ability to progress new projects and PPPs is limited.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge it is important to restore over time capital funding for the transport sector to ensure that infrastructure is maintained but, as of now, I am not in a position to give a commitment in regard to funding of the projects in question, although I acknowledge their national and local importance.</p></reply>
