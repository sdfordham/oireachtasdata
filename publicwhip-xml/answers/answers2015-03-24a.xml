The details of the Defence Forces average end of month overseas strengths are as follows.  In 2012 there were 122 Officers and 310 Enlisted Personnel; in 2013 there were 127 Officers and 310 Enlisted Personnel; in 2014 there were 131 Officers and 288 Enlisted Personnel; and in 2015 there were 134 Officers and 296 Enlisted Personnel. </p>  <p>  Officers on overseas deployments are assigned to command and staff roles and duties commensurate with their rank and with the requirements of the appointment.   </p>  <p>  The ranks for appointments to overseas Mission Headquarters are designated either by UN or the Mission's Operations Commander.  Situations may arise where the requirements of the Mission change.  In 2014, for example, UNDOF Mission HQ stopped employing Enlisted Personnel from Troop Contributing Nations.  Ireland assigned an Officer to the Mission HQ in this particular case.      </p>  <p>  I also understand that in a small number of instances Enlisted Personnel have not deployed as the overseas package available for the particular deployment was considered unsatisfactory.  Given the voluntary nature of overseas appointments it is considered inappropriate by military authorities to mandate military personnel to deploy in such circumstances.</p></reply>

Against this background, the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) provides a framework for developing and furthering bilateral co-operation and relations between the Department of Defence and the UK Ministry of Defence.</p>  <p>  The signing of the Memorandum of Understanding places already existing cooperation arrangements in the Defence area between Ireland and the UK on a more formal and transparent footing, while fully respecting the differing policy positions and security arrangements of both States. </p>  <p>  The approach to developing the Action Plan has been agreed with the UK.  The Action Plan will contain a detailed programme of bilateral co-operation activities for the forthcoming year and set the objectives for the following two years. Discussions in this regard are ongoing.   </p>  <p>  The MoU and the associated Action Plan will support the development of a greater mutual understanding of the policy considerations underlying our respective actions and engagement in multilateral arrangements including with the EU and the UN.  It will also support training exchanges and staff exchanges involving both civil and military personnel.  Finally it will provide opportunities for more joint and collaborative work in support of international peace and security including possible contributions to UN peacekeeping operations.</p></reply>

Following on from this CRE submission and subsequent bilateral discussions, an overall financial envelope for the 2015-2017 period was outlined, and the 2015 Revised Estimates Volume (REV) provided an allocation of some &euro;677m for the Defence Vote.</p>  <p>  This allocation provides some &euro;496m towards the pay and allowances of up to 9,500 Permanent Defence Force (PDF) personnel, 625 civilian employees, 350 civil servants, 18 chaplains and 14 army nurses.  It also provides &euro;181m for non-pay costs relating to the replacement and maintenance of essential equipment and operational costs. </p>  <p>  Decisions on resource allocation are made on a prioritised basis in accordance with any assessed operational need.  However, I am confident that the 2015 Defence allocation is adequate to deliver effective services across all of the roles assigned by Government.   </p>  <p>  Work continues on the development of a new White Paper on Defence.  Working groups comprising civil and military representatives from the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces are considering future operational demands and the defence capabilities required to meet these demands.  I anticipate that the final draft of the White Paper will be submitted to Government for approval by the end of July.  Subject to Government approval, the White Paper on Defence will then be published.</p></reply>

During this inspection, it became apparent that the servicing and repair of the aircraft would have involved a significantly higher level of investment than was anticipated. <font color="#1F497D"> </font>Given the number of flying hours achieved and the age of the craft it was decided that the aircraft would be withdrawn from service and would not be returned back to Ireland.</p><p>The Department concluded the sale for the aircraft on an as seen basis with a US based company in December 2014.  Meanwhile, the Ministerial Air Transport Service (MATS) is being provided by the Learjet 45 aircraft.</p><p>An inter-Departmental MATS Review Group has been established to examine options for the future provision of a service that will continue to provide the President, members of the Government and accompanying officials with an independent means of international air transport.  When the Group has completed its deliberations and made its recommendations, I will bring a Report to Government with recommendations on how best to provide a MATS service into the future.</p></reply>

The capabilities being researched and developed by the Defence Forces in cooperation with research companies and institutions are wide ranging.  They cover capabilities such as Maritime Surveillance; Energy Conservation; Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) research including CBRN Protection, and Improvised Explosives Devices (IED) detection and destruction.  Such capabilities may be used at home and also abroad on crisis management missions and operations including humanitarian and peace-keeping missions.</p>  <p>  Projects proposed by institutes and companies are firstly considered and cleared by Enterprise Ireland and then submitted to the Defence Enterprise Committee for consideration.  The Committee consists of personnel from the Department of Defence, the Defence Forces and Enterprise Ireland.  All capabilities to be researched are vetted and agreed at the highest level in the Defence Organisation to ensure compatibility with the roles assigned to the Defence Forces by the Government.   </p>  <p>  In addition to the Enterprise Ireland supported projects, the Defence Forces, through the Naval Service as a partner, are also engaged in the Irish Maritime and Energy Cluster (IMERC) located in the National Maritime College of Ireland which aims to unlock Ireland's maritime and energy potential in support of the Government's policy of Harnessing our Ocean Wealth.  The Naval Service engagement in this regard focuses on value creating partnerships by linking researchers, technology developers and industry partners in the development of dual use technologies for use principally in the maritime environment.  The current schedule of companies and projects is currently being updated and my Department will provide it directly to the Deputy once it is finalised.</p></reply>

They are based in the mission headquarters in Kabul.  These personnel are employed in training and advisory roles in Operations, Training and Support appointments.

The role of the Air Corps as set out in the White Paper is to provide a range of military and non-military air services.  The Air Corps has traditionally discharged a mix of functions based on a need to supply a range of services such as air ambulance, fishery protection, and support to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in addition to their military roles.</p>  <p>  The White Paper provides that for the Air Corps to exceed this  capability would require a level of investment in personnel, equipment and infrastructure which could not be justified.  Accordingly the Air Corps is not tasked, or equipped, to monitor or respond to unauthorised aircraft overflying Irish Airspace. </p>  <p>  Work is continuing apace on the development of a new White Paper on Defence.  A key part of the development of the new White Paper is consideration of the current security environment and challenges that may emerge into the future.  Working groups comprising civil and military representatives from the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces are considering likely future operational demands and the defence capabilities required to meet these demands.  This work will inform recommendations regarding defence provision.</p></reply>

This highlighted continued volatility in the African nation two years after France helped retake territory from al Qaeda-linked militants.  No Irish personnel were involved in the incident.</p>  <p>  Ireland is currently contributing ten (10) personnel to the EU Training Mission in Mali (EUTM Mali).  Six (6) Defence Forces personnel are deployed to the joint UK/Irish infantry Training Team.  One Lieutenant Colonel is serving as Executive Officer to the Training Task Force based in Koulikoro, and three Irish personnel occupy staff appointments in the mission Headquarters in Bamako.</p>  <p>  The training of the Malian Defence and Security Forces is specifically provided for in relevant United Nations Security Council Resolutions, the most recent one being 2164 (2014); this commends the role of the European Union Training Mission (EUTM Mali) in Mali to provide training and advice for the Malian Defence and Security Forces towards contributing to the strengthening civilian authority and respect for human rights.     </p>  <p>  During my visit to Mali last week, I had the opportunity of meeting the EUTM Mali Mission Commander, Brigadier General Garcia Vaquero, and the Irish troops serving with the mission.  The visit also afforded me an opportunity to see, at first hand, the dedication and professionalism of military personnel and the tremendous work done by them to train and mentor the Malian Armed Forces to improve their military capacity. I conveyed to the troops our deep appreciation for the outstanding manner in which they continue to perform their duties on overseas service.   </p>  <p>  The security situation in Mali continues to be kept under review by the Defence Forces who actively monitor developments in the region.

During the meeting, EU Foreign Ministers reiterated their support for the ongoing UN-facilitated talks on Libya, and the efforts of United Nations Special Representative Bernadino Le&oacute;n to achieve a sustainable ceasefire between the parties and a political solution to the crisis.</p>  <p>  EU Foreign Ministers also agreed during the Council meeting that the EU stands ready to enhance its support to Libya as soon as any agreement on a Government of National Unity is reached and related security arrangements are in place.  In this context, the Council invited the High Representative and Vice President of the European Commission to present proposals of possible Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) activities, as part of a wider set of policy options, to support the potential outcome of the talks.     </p>  <p>  A wide range of possible options is being examined including CSDP activities, rule of law, economic actions etc.  Any initiative will be undertaken in close coordination with the UN which is leading the negotiations. </p>  <p>  With regard to a possible deployment of Defence Forces personnel to a future EU mission in Libya, Ireland is hopeful that the promise of a political resolution to the crisis in Libya can be fulfilled.  In the event that the EU was to launch a CSDP mission in Libya, this would require a request from a Libyan Government of National Unity. Furthermore, no mission could be launched by the EU without unanimity amongst all 28 Member States.  Any question of Defence Forces personnel participation will be examined at that stage.</p></reply>

This was introduced as a measure of solidarity with other workers.  Those whose income is less than &euro;100 per week do not pay PRSI and return their income under PRSI class M.  All public office holders are liable to pay the contribution regardless of age. </p>  <p>  All workers pay PRSI on their earnings from employment or self-employment.  In the case of individuals who have more than one income source, PRSI is generally paid on all forms of income.  </p>  <p>  Up to 2013 certain exemptions applied to specific groups.  The removal of the exemption in relation to modified rate contributors with income from a trade or profession was introduced in the Social Welfare and Pensions (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2013 and the removal of the exemption in respect of employed contributors and occupational pensioners under age 66 years whose only additional income is unearned income was introduced in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2013.  </p>  <p>  This means that, with effect from 1 January 2014, unearned income such as rental income, investment income, dividends and interest on deposits and savings of the individuals who were previously exempt, is liable to PRSI at 4% provided the person is a chargeable person in accordance with the Revenue definition.  </p>  <p>  A chargeable person does not include a PAYE taxpayer (i) who does not have other income or (ii) who has an element of other insignificant income that is fully taxed through the Office of the Revenue Commissioners PAYE system (Revenue regard amounts not exceeding &euro;3,174 as insignificant).  Individuals with income exceeding &euro;3,174 must pay and file under Revenue's self-assessing system. </p>  <p>  This income is chargeable at the class K PRSI rate of 4%.  This PRSI charge does not give rise to any additional social insurance benefits.  Individuals may however qualify separately for social insurance entitlements based on PRSI paid on other sources of income i.e. PRSI paid on income from their employment.</p>  <p>  Self-employed persons are liable for PRSI at the class S rate of 4% which entitles them to access long-term benefits such as State pension (contributory) and widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner's pension (contributory) as well as guardians payment (contributory), maternity benefit and adoptive benefit.  Ordinary employees who have access to the full range of social insurance benefits pay class A PRSI at the rate of 4%.  In addition, their employers make a PRSI contribution of 10.75% in respect of their employees, resulting in the payment of a combined 14.75% rate per employee under full-rate PRSI class A.  (For employees earning less than &euro;356 per week, the rate of employer's PRSI is 8.5%).</p>  <p>  Self-employed workers who find themselves out of business and become unemployed or ill may access social welfare supports by establishing eligibility to assistance-based payments such as jobseeker's allowance and disability allowance.  In the case of jobseeker's allowance they can apply for the means-tested jobseeker's allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.  As in the case of a non-self-employed claimant for jobseeker's allowance or disability allowance, the means of husband/wife, civil partner or co-habitant will be taken into account in deciding on entitlement to a payment.</p>  <p>  If income from self-employment falls below &euro;5,000 in a contribution year or a person is unable to work, he or she may opt to pay voluntary contributions. </p>  <p>  To become a voluntary contributor a person must:</p>  <p>  -  have paid at least 468 weeks PRSI (since 6 April 2014) in either employment or self-employment,</p>  <p>  -  apply within 12 months of the end of the tax year during which he/she last paid compulsory insurance or were last awarded a credited contribution,</p>  <p>  -  agree to pay voluntary contributions from the start of the contribution week that follows the week in which he/she leaves compulsory insurance.</p>  <p>  To become a voluntary contributor on or after 6 April 2015 a person must have previously paid 520 weeks PRSI.</p>  <p>  My Department undertakes advertising and awareness activities to ensure that all members of the public are made aware of their rights and entitlements and that they are kept informed of significant changes and improvements in schemes and services as they occur.</p>  <p>  Information on the full range of social welfare schemes and services is available from the Department's INTREO/local office network and the nationwide network of Citizens Information Centres.  In addition, many people access information on the Department's and Citizen Information Board's websites.</p></reply>

The service, which differentiates between mortgage information and mortgage advice, has three elements:</p><p>-  The website which was developed as the key online access portal for general mortgage information and advice and launched in June 2012.  To date there has been over 337,000 visits to the site.</p><p>-  The Mortgage Arrears Information Helpline (phone 0761 074050) established in August 2012, provides general mortgage arrears information and signposting in relation to the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears and other supports available for those in mortgage arrears or pre-arrears. To date the helpline has dealt with almost 13,000 calls.</p><p>-  The service to provide independent financial advice to mortgage holders who are being presented with long term mortgage resolution proposals by their lenders was launched in September 2012.  The advice is provided by a panel of accountants drawn from members of the main accountancy institutes in Ireland.  A county by county panel with over 1,500 participating accountants is in place and their contact details are available on .  Borrowers are free to choose their own advisor from this panel and the lender will pay &euro;250 to the accountant of the borrower's choice for the provision of this independent financial advice. </p><p>The Central Bank collates the information relating to the number of borrowers who have availed of the independent financial advice service on a quarterly basis, commencing in quarter 1 2013.  The data supplied does not relate exactly to the reporting period as there will be delays between the time the lender makes the long-term resolution offer to the borrower, the meeting with the accountant and the receipt by the lender of the invoice.  At the end of Q4 2014, 1,207 borrowers have availed of the independent financial advice service.</p></reply>

This claim was subject to periodical review.  At the time of the most recent review in August 2014, the amount of rent payable by the person concerned, as stated in his review form, was &euro;1000 per calendar month.  Prior to him making a telephone call to the  Rents Unit on 9<sup>th</sup>March 2015 in which he advised that he and his family had already moved out of their rented accommodation, the Department was unaware that his rent had further increased, or that he and his family had left their accommodation.  Consequently his claim for rent supplement was then closed.  In addition the person concerned stated that he did not wish to make a new application for rent supplement or have an information pack sent to him.</p><p>Had the Department been aware earlier of their circumstances this family would have been referred to the housing charity Threshold under the Interim Tenancy Sustainment Protocol.  This would have enabled the family's housing needs to be addressed prior to them moving from their accommodation, and a recommendation would have been made to the Department with regard to their claim for rent supplement.</p><p>The person concerned and his family are being provided with emergency temporary accommodation by the local authority who are presumably looking, via a Housing Action Team (HAT), for more suitable long-term accommodation.  If this is to be in the private rented sector then he should contact the Department, directly or via the HAT, to claim rent supplement payment.</p></reply>

Budget 2014 further extended the reduced rates of jobseeker's allowance to recipients under 26 years of age. This is a targeted measure aimed at protecting young people from welfare dependency. It aims to incentivise young jobseeker's allowance recipients to avail of education and training opportunities.  If a jobseeker in receipt of the reduced jobseeker's allowance rate participates on an education or training programme they will receive a higher weekly payment of &euro;160. Any change to provision in this area would be a matter for Government to consider in a Budgetary context.</p>  <p>  Based on data from February, 2015 the additional full year cost of providing a weekly rate of &euro;188 for all jobseeker's allowance recipients aged 25 and under is some &euro;143m.</p>  <p>  To guard against the development of welfare dependency I believe that it is necessary to provide young jobseekers with a strong financial incentive to engage in education or training or to take up employment.  If they do not improve their skills, it will be much more difficult for them to avail of job opportunities as the economy recovers and they are at risk of becoming long term unemployed from a young age.</p>  <p>  The Government's primary strategy to tackle youth unemployment is through policies to create the environment for a strong economic recovery by promoting competitiveness and productivity. Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth and the availability of productive employment for young people.  This strategy has been succeeding, with an increase of over 80,000 in employment over the last two years.</p>  <p>  Reflecting the improvement in the labour market, youth unemployment continues to fall. For example the youth unemployment rate in Ireland as estimated by Eurostat was 21.6% in December 2014 as compared to 30.8% in December 2011. However, the Government recognises that as the recovery takes hold, there is a need for additional measures to ensure that as many as possible of the jobs created are taken up by jobseekers and young jobseekers in particular. This is the rationale behind the Government's Pathways to Work strategy and the Youth Guarantee Implementation Plan.</p></reply>

Parental income is calculated as gross income less tax, PRSI, Universal Social Charge, superannuation and union dues. Rent or mortgage repayments are then disregarded, where appropriate, and, finally, a parental allowance of &euro;600 per week per couple plus &euro;50 per week in respect of other dependent children are also disregarded. The balance is assessed at 34% and this constitutes the weekly value of benefit and privilege to the claimant.</p>  <p>  There are two exceptions to this rule. No assessment is made where a son or daughter and his or her spouse/civil partner/partner is living with his/her parents.  In addition, where a person returns to the parental home having had an independent life elsewhere in Ireland or abroad for an appreciable length of time e.g. at least three years, the assessment in this case is &euro;7 per week.</p>  <p>  Social welfare payments such as illness benefit and disability allowance are included in the means assessment as they contribute to the total available income in a household. There are currently no plans to alter these arrangements for the jobseeker's allowance scheme.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that once a person reaches 25 years of age, the value of any benefit and privilege is no longer be regarded as means.</p></reply>

The cost of paying those interns an extra &euro;50 per week would amount to circa &euro;11.76m over a nine month period of an internship. </p><p>A total of 11,606 internships commenced between 30<sup>th</sup>December, 2013 and 18<sup>th</sup>December, 2014.  A contribution of &euro;500 in respect of each of these internships would amount to &euro;5,803,000 in respect of 2014.</p><p>The &euro;50 weekly top-up paid to interns is in acknowledgement of extra expenses that may be incurred over and above those of the normal job search. It is not related to training and development expenses.  There is nothing to prevent a Host Organisations reimbursing an Intern for expenses incurred as part of the internship.  However, expenses should not be provided for normal activities such as travel to and from the main location of the internship.</p><p>The purpose of JobBridge is to help unemployed jobseekers break the cycle whereby they cannot find a job without appropriate experience but cannot find appropriate experience without a job. To date it has been very successful in delivering on this objective with this success being partly attributable to the wide variety of internship opportunities that it supports.</p><p>Given that unemployed jobseekers are drawn from many walks of life and have varying levels of work experience and educational qualifications it is essential that Internship opportunities cover many occupations/disciplines from high skill specialist placements to lower skilled general placements.  Therefore JobBridge opportunities are not confined to the type internships that were, and continue to be a feature of, some 'white collar' professions.</p><p>Pathways to Work 2015 includes a commitment to evaluate a range of activation processes and programmes, including JobBridge.  A high level evaluation work plan has been agreed and endorsed by the Labour Market Council. The Department is currently in the process of implementing the work plan, which will consist of a number of separate evaluations across a number of programmes including JobBridge. These evaluations will assess the impacts of programmes in terms of employment outcomes for participants. It is expected that the evaluation of JobBridge will commence later in 2015 with results anticipated by Q1 2016.</p><p>I have no plans at present to restrict internships in sectors with low levels of progression into employment. JobBridge interns gain marketable skills and work experience that can take them into employment in organisations and sectors other than those with which they participate in JobBridge.  An independent evaluation of JobBridge found only minimal levels of displacement. The Department takes any complaints of abuse of the JobBridge Scheme seriously.  All such complaints are investigated thoroughly, and necessary action is taken, if required.  The Department also operates a monitoring system to ensure that all internships are of a high quality. If any individual knows of specific instances of abuse of JobBridge details should be provided to the Department for investigation.</p><p>Host Organisations are also subject to conditions, including cooling-off periods, to limit any abuse of the scheme. If an internship finishes and the Intern concerned is unsuccessful in gaining employment the Host Organisation is subject to a six month cooling off period before they can re-advertise an internship in the same filed of work.  In circumstances where an intern moves into employment with either the host organisation or another organisation the cooling off period of six months is waived. The Department does not routinely keep records of the number of times the cooling-off period is waived.</p><p>With regard to levels of dissatisfaction interns and host organisation can contact the dedicated JobBridge team, the established Departmental complaints system and the staff at the local Intreo centres to register any concerns that they might have. </p><p>A charter is already in place in the form of a standard agreement that must be signed by the intern and the host organisation. It is not in the form of a statutory obligation as JobBridge is an administrative (i.e., non-statutory) scheme. </p><p>Each host organisation are required to nominate an individual to support and/or mentor the Intern during the placement. This person will have responsibility to ensure that the Intern receives a proper induction, ensure that the work experience as described in the standard agreement is progressing, and that monthly compliance checks are being completed (to ensure the Internship allowance continues to be paid by DSP). If an organisation has a formal mentoring programme, they include the Intern in this programme. The Department provides a range of resources and toolkits to support the mentoring of interns.  Host organisations are instructed to read these carefully before offering an internship.</p><p>First Steps is a new under which employers are being asked to sponsor work experience places of four days duration per week for very disadvantaged young people. All participants will be selected by the Department of Social Protection (not as under JobBridge by the host organisation), will be allocated a dedicated case officer throughout their placement and will receive pre-placement training.  The Department of Social Protection will only select clients who are available for, and whom it believes will benefit from, a First Steps placement.  In such circumstances the Department believes clients should have a very strong reason not to participate and in the absence of such a reason participation should be mandatory.  The short preparation course for participants will be provided by Education and Training Boards and will consist of basic workplace skills and etiquette, timekeeping and communication skills and will last approximately one week.  A total of &euro;57.111m has been allocated for First Steps up to the end of 2017.  As of 19<sup>th</sup>March, 89 places have been committed by host organisations for the First Steps programme.</p><p><b>JobBridge Interns under 25 by County</b><table><tr><th>County</th><th>Finished</th><th>Current</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>DUBLIN</td><td>2,948</td><td>413</td><td>3,361</td></tr><tr><td>CORK</td><td>753</td><td>104</td><td>857</td></tr><tr><td>GALWAY  </td><td>550</td><td>84</td><td>634</td></tr><tr><td>LIMERICK</td><td>454</td><td>88</td><td>542</td></tr><tr><td>DONEGAL</td><td>340</td><td>70</td><td>410</td></tr><tr><td>KILDARE </td><td>343</td><td>56</td><td>399</td></tr><tr><td>TIPPERARY </td><td>319</td><td>63</td><td>382</td></tr><tr><td>WEXFORD</td><td>299</td><td>52</td><td>351</td></tr><tr><td>LOUTH</td><td>289</td><td>52</td><td>341</td></tr><tr><td>WATERFORD</td><td>267</td><td>65</td><td>332</td></tr><tr><td>WESTMEATH</td><td>250</td><td>50</td><td>300</td></tr><tr><td>MEATH</td><td>241</td><td>49</td><td>290</td></tr><tr><td>MAYO</td><td>239</td><td>50</td><td>289</td></tr><tr><td>KERRY</td><td>226</td><td>52</td><td>278</td></tr><tr><td>WICKLOW </td><td>203</td><td>33</td><td>236</td></tr><tr><td>MONAGHAN </td><td>177</td><td>25</td><td>202</td></tr><tr><td>SLIGO  </td><td>171</td><td>29</td><td>200</td></tr><tr><td>CLARE</td><td>163</td><td>31</td><td>194</td></tr><tr><td>LAOIS</td><td>143</td><td>33</td><td>176</td></tr><tr><td>KILKENNY</td><td>144</td><td>23</td><td>167</td></tr><tr><td>OFFALY</td><td>127</td><td>28</td><td>155</td></tr><tr><td>CAVAN</td><td>125</td><td>29</td><td>154</td></tr><tr><td>CARLOW</td><td>119</td><td>17</td><td>136</td></tr><tr><td>ROSCOMMON  </td><td>75</td><td>22</td><td>97</td></tr><tr><td>LONGFORD</td><td>69</td><td>9</td><td>78</td></tr><tr><td>LEITRIM  </td><td>50</td><td>6</td><td>56</td></tr><tr><td>Grand Total</td><td>9,084</td><td>1,533</td><td>10,617</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The theme for this year's forum is &ldquo;Social Innovation for Social Inclusion&rdquo;. The forum is organised by the Department of Social Protection in conjunction with the Community Workers Co-operative and the European Anti-Poverty Network Ireland.</p>  <p>  The forum will incorporate a consultation on updating the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion (NAPinclusion) for the extended period 2015 to 2017. In addition, there will be workshops on social housing, migrant integration, children's services &ndash; prevention and early intervention, and youth exclusion. The forum will also showcase projects involved with the UN Day for the Eradication of Poverty and other social inclusion initiatives.</p>  <p>  Approximately 200 delegates are registered to attend from community and voluntary groups across the country, including people experiencing poverty and social exclusion. Officials from government departments and agencies will also be in attendance.</p>  <p>  The Social Inclusion Monitor 2013 will be published to coincide with the forum. The purpose of the monitor is to report officially on progress towards the national social target for poverty reduction, including the sub-target on child poverty and Ireland's contribution to the Europe 2020 poverty target.</p>  <p>  The forum is an important part of the Government structures to monitor and evaluate the implementation of NAPinclusion. It provides an opportunity for consultation and discussion on social inclusion policies and ensures that the community and voluntary sector has a voice in the development and implementation of policies that affect people in poverty.</p>  <p>  A report on the proceedings at the forum will be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas in due course.</p></reply>

This objective is to be achieved over time by enhancing and prioritising the Intreo engagement with newly unemployed young people, and by maintaining and developing the current range of education, training and employment interventions for young people.</p>  <p>  While the resources under the Youth Guarantee are targeted more towards those with the highest risk of becoming long-term unemployed, all young people signing on enter the engagement process (via Group Engagement sessions) within the first two weeks of signing on. Effectively, therefore, all persons under the age of 25 who become unemployed (the target group at whom policies developed under the Guarantee are aimed) are engaged with by the State's public employment services at an early stage of their period of unemployment.</p>  <p>  The Youth Guarantee Implementation Plan provided for over 28,000 programme opportunities for unemployed young people in 2014.  This figure excludes some 24,000 places provided for young people through PLC courses and apprenticeships.  These PLC and apprenticeship places, together with the wide range of vocational third-level courses provided for the young, although not reserved for unemployed jobseekers, nevertheless contribute to the spirit of the guarantee.</p>  <p>  Approximately 25,000 of these places had been taken up at the end of December 2014.  The estimated full year costs for 28,000 places (excluding PLC and apprenticeships) is &euro;336m. Full data on the actual spend to the end of 2014 is not yet available.</p></reply>

The first is the statutory urban school meals scheme, operated by local authorities and part-financed by the Department.  The second is the school meals local projects scheme through which funding is provided directly to participating schools and local and voluntary community groups who run their own school meals projects.  Despite pressure on the social protection budget, the Government allocated an additional &euro;2 million for the school meals programme in 2015, providing a total allocation of &euro;39 million.</p>  <p>  The additional &euro;2 million allocated to the school meals programme will be used to increase payments to existing schools which are part of the Department of Education and Skill's initiative for disadvantaged schools 'Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools', (DEIS), with a focus on the provision of breakfast clubs. The Department is currently considering options regarding the allocation of the additional funding.</p>  <p>  The school referred to by the Deputy, is a DEIS school, and has received over &euro;239,725 in total funding under the school meals local projects scheme since 2005 and was allocated funding of &euro;18,146 for a lunch club for the current academic year. The Department is reviewing the allocation for the current year and has been in contact with the school directly regarding this matter.</p></reply>

Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives. This is particularly important given the challenge that increased longevity is posing for the future sustainability of the State pension.  Therefore, when assessing whether an individual is entitled to a State pension, and to ensure that they can maximise such entitlement, all contributions (paid or credited) from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account. </p>  <p>  The State already assists those with caring roles to qualify for a State pension (contributory). The homemaker's scheme makes qualification for State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme, which was introduced in 1994, allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age or incapacitated people to be disregarded when a person's social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes.  The effect of this is to reduce the number of years by which their contributions are divided, thereby increasing their yearly average contribution.  Given the valuable nature of the State pension (contributory), those who qualify under the homemaker's scheme still need to fulfil the eligibility requirements for that scheme, and have at least 520 paid contributions over the course of their working lives. </p>  <p>  For those with insufficient contributions to meet the requirements for a State pension (contributory), the State pension system provides alternative methods of support.  If someone has been a carer for nearly all of their adult life and has paid little or no PRSI, they may qualify for a means tested State pension (non-contributory), the maximum personal rate for which is &euro;219, which amounts to just over 95% of the maximum rate of the State pension (contributory).  Alternatively, if their spouse or civil partner is in receipt of a State pension (contributory) they may instead qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult of up to &euro;206.30, which is just under 90% of the maximum personal rate of the State pension (contributory). </p>  <p>  It is expected that a total contributions approach to pension qualification will replace the current average contributions test for State pension (contributory) from 2020, although that date is subject to change.  Issues such as equality of outcomes for women and men, including those who spend some years outside the labour market on caring duties, will be considered carefully in the context of that reform. </p></reply>

The initiative provides employers with two levels of payment - &euro;7,500 or &euro;10,000 over two years - paid in monthly instalments provided the employment is maintained. Employment must be of a full-time nature of at least 30 hours per week over four days.  The rate of payment depends on the length of time the person is unemployed.

The widowed or surviving civil partner grant is a once-off payment of &euro;6,000 where there is a dependent child. A number of social welfare payments, including State pension and carer's allowance, continue in payment for six weeks following a death.

Ordinary employees who have access to the full range of social insurance benefits pay class A PRSI at the rate of 4%.  In addition, their employers make a PRSI contribution of 10.75% in respect of their employees, resulting in the payment of a combined 14.75% rate per employee under full-rate PRSI class A.  (For employees earning less than &euro;356 per week, the rate of employer's PRSI is 8.5%).</p>  <p>  Self-employed workers who find themselves out of business and become unemployed or ill may access social welfare supports by establishing eligibility to assistance-based payments such as jobseeker's allowance and disability allowance.  In the case of jobseeker's allowance they can apply for the means-tested jobseeker's allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.  As in the case of a non-self-employed claimant for jobseeker's allowance or disability allowance, the means of husband/wife, civil partner or co-habitant will be taken into account in deciding on entitlement to a payment.</p>  <p>  Self-employed people in receipt of jobseeker's allowance have access to the full range of activation measures available through the State.  Given the scale of unemployment levels, the key objective of activation policy and labour market initiatives is to offer assistance to those most in need of support in securing work and achieving financial self-sufficiency.  This policy objective prioritises scarce resources to those in receipt of qualifying welfare payments.  Accordingly the employment services and schemes provided by the Department are focused in the first instance on this cohort of unemployed people.  However, many services are available to the formerly self-employed who are not in receipt of a social welfare payment.</p>  <p>  Some employment services, such as assistance with job-search activities and the use of online job search tools, are available to people if they register with the Department's employment services offices, regardless of their social welfare status.  Unemployed persons, including the previously self-employed, not in receipt of payments may also be eligible to avail of up-skilling opportunities but are not eligible to receive a training allowance while undertaking the course.  Springboard courses are open to people who were previously self-employed, regardless of their social welfare status.</p>  <p>  In September 2013, I published the report of the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare on Extending Social Insurance Coverage for the self-employed.  The Group was asked to examine and report on issues involved in extending social insurance coverage for self-employed people in order to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable, with the requirement that any proposals for change must be cost neutral.</p>  <p>  The Group found that the current system of means tested jobseeker's allowance payments adequately provides cover to self-employed people for the risks associated with unemployment.  In this context, the Group noted that almost 9 out of every 10 self-employed people who claimed the means tested jobseeker's allowance during the three-year period from 2009 to 2011 received payment.  Consequently, the Group was not convinced that there was a need for the extension of social insurance for the self-employed to provide cover for jobseeker's benefit.</p>  <p>  The Group found that extending social insurance for the self-employed was warranted in cases related to long term sickness or injuries.  To this end, the Group recommended that class S benefits should be extended to provide cover for people who are permanently incapable of work, because of a long-term illness or incapacity, through the invalidity pension and the partial capacity benefit schemes.  The Group further recommended that the extension of social insurance in this regard should be on a compulsory basis and that the rate of contribution for class S should be increased by at least 1.5 percentage points.</p>  <p>  This recommendation will require further consideration in conjunction with the findings of the most recent Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund which indicated that the self-employed achieve better value for money compared to the employed when the comparison includes both employer and employee contributions in respect of the employed person.  The Actuarial Review found that the effective annual rate of contribution needed to provide the full rate State pension (contributory), currently available to self-employed contributors, is approximately 15%. </p>  <p>  My colleagues in Government and I will continue to reflect on the findings of the Advisory Group on this issue and will further consider the recommendations contained in the report taking into account future developments in terms of the budgetary and fiscal situation.</p></reply>

Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth and the availability of productive employment for young people. This strategy has been succeeding, with an increase of over 80,000 in employment over the last 2 years. </p><p>However, the Government recognises that as the recovery takes hold, there is a need for additional measures to ensure that as many as possible of the jobs created are taken up by jobseekers and young jobseekers in particular. This is the rationale behind the Government's Pathways to Work strategy and the Youth Guarantee Implementation Plan.</p><p>Within this framework, the Youth Guarantee sets a medium-term objective of ensuring that young people receive an offer of employment within four months of becoming unemployed. The main plank of the guarantee is assistance to young people in finding and securing sustainable jobs. For those who do not find employment, additional offers are provided for. Most such offers (over 70%) are in further education or training. Others are in community-based employment programmes such as CE, Gateway and Tus, or through the JobsPlus employment subsidy for private employment. </p><p>Overall, the Youth Guarantee provided nearly 25,000 places for young people in 2014. This figure excludes some 24,000 places provided for young people through PLC courses and apprenticeships. These PLC and apprenticeship places, together with the wide range of vocational third-level courses provided for the young, although not reserved for unemployed jobseekers, nevertheless contribute to the spirit of the guarantee. </p><p>Pathways to Work 2014 targets with respect to the Youth Guarantee have largely been achieved. Models for the engagement of young people through Intreo have been agreed and will form the basis of the national roll-out of the Youth Guarantee in 2015. Potential refinement of these models may be considered on the basis of outcomes and learning from the Ballymun Youth Guarantee Pilot Project. In addition it is expected the following targets in Pathways to Work 2015 will be met:</p><p>-  The First Steps developmental internships programme for 1500 &ndash; 2000 young people was launched in February 2015. It aims to offer young people you are particularly distant from the labour market a work experience opportunity with sponsor employers.</p><p>-  JobsPlus for Youth was also launched in February; it offers employers who recruit a young person under 25 years of age who was unemployed for four months or more a subsidy of up to &euro;416 per month. The duration unemployed threshold for other age cohorts is 12 months.</p><p>-  Allocate 1,000 places on the T&uacute;s scheme to young people.</p><p>-  Introduce a pilot programme to support young unemployed people to take up opportunities under schemes such as Your First EURES Job.</p><p>-  Ring-fence a minimum of 2,000 training places for under-25s by the Department of Education and Skills, under a follow-up to the Momentum programme.</p><p>-  The Department of Jobs Enterprise and Innovation will make &euro;2.5m available to young entrepreneurs via Micro finance Ireland and other business start-up schemes.</p><p><b>Youth Guarantee Progress YTD: End December 2014</b><table><tr><th>Programme</th><th>Expected full-year intake</th><th>2014</th></tr><tr><td>Youthreach/CTC</td><td>3,300</td><td>3578</td></tr><tr><td>JobBridge (including developmental internship)</td><td>5,000</td><td>3138</td></tr><tr><td>T&uacute;s</td><td>1,000</td><td>1410</td></tr><tr><td>JobsPlus</td><td>1,500</td><td>639</td></tr><tr><td>Momentum</td><td>2,000</td><td>631</td></tr><tr><td>BTEA (excl Momentum)</td><td>3,300</td><td>5301</td></tr><tr><td>BTWEA</td><td>200</td><td>139</td></tr><tr><td>VTOS</td><td>500</td><td>672</td></tr><tr><td>FAS/Solas</td><td>9,500</td><td>8659</td></tr><tr><td>CEB youth Entrepreneurship </td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Training and Mentoring supports</td><td>700</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>CEB/MFI micro-loans for young people</td><td>150</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>International Work Experience and Training</td><td>250</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Gateway</td><td>450</td><td>192</td></tr><tr><td>Community Employment</td><td>500</td><td>600</td></tr><tr><td>Total </td><td>28,350</td><td>24,969</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The Government has consistently stated its commitment to maintaining the post office network as set out in the Programme for Government.  In this regard, the Department of Social Protection will pay over &euro;50m to An Post under a contract for cash payment services to welfare customers this year.   </p>  <p>  The recent issuance of letters to randomly selected recipients of State Pension (Contributory and Non-Contributory), was a trial.  It was being done to determine the best means of communicating with people about payment options.  It was a very small trial in that letters were sent to just under 1% of customers. </p>  <p>  Customer engagement with the trial was entirely voluntary.  There are no negative consequences for customers who chose not to engage.  All payment options (cash, cheque, EFT) continue to be fully available to customers (where relevant).  The Department has not introduced changes nor does it intend to.  </p>  <p>  The move to electronic payments in our society undeniably creates a challenge for the current business model of An Post. In this context I am pleased to note that An Post has tendered for the provision of a new transaction account.  I look forward to that becoming available in the not too distant future as it will provide alternative payment opportunities for this Department's customers.</p></reply>

An Attachment of Earnings Order can be sought if the person is in employment, on a social welfare payment or on a private pension, resulting in the maintenance being deducted at the source.  Under the Family Law Act 1995, it is possible to apply for this attachment at the initial maintenance hearing, if the person applying to court fears that there will be a default.</p>  <p>  This Department complies with all such Family Law Maintenance Orders received by deducting the amount specified on the court order from a social welfare payment which, in turn, may result in a reduction of the One-Parent Family payment.</p></reply>

For persons with average weekly earnings of &euro;90 or less, the full rate of OFP may be paid. Earnings above this limit are assessed at 50% &ndash; up to a maximum average of &euro;425 per week. In addition, to OFP where a lone parent is working a minimum of 19 hours per week they may be entitled to the Family Income Supplement (FIS). The rate of FIS payment will depend on the earnings and the amount of OFP they receive. </p>  <p>  The after school child care (ASCC) scheme, which was introduced in Budget 2013, is a joint initiative between my Department and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs (D/CYA) to provide subsidised after-school child care places to low-income and unemployed persons who make the transition into employment.</p>  <p>  The purpose of the ASCC scheme is to help to offset some of the after-school child care costs that are associated with availing of an employment opportunity in a bid to encourage more individuals to take up employment. The scheme supports those who are unemployed as well as OFP recipients who lose their entitlement to the OFP payment. It applies to persons who take up a job, who increase their days of employment, or who take up a place on a Departmental employment programme. The parental contribution is &euro;15 per week per child and remains at this level if the pick-up service is added and during school holidays when full day childcare is required.</p>  <p>  The ASCC scheme builds on the existing range of approximately 25,000 subsidised childcare places that are available for low income parents. These places are provided by the D/CYA. </p></reply>

To be entitled to CA the applicant must be providing full-time care and attention to a person in need of care who does not normally live in an institution.  These conditions apply whether the carer is or is not resident with the relevant person.</p>  <p>  It is a role of a deciding officer (DO) to determine if an applicant for CA is providing full-time care to the care recipient.  While no specific number of hours per day or per week is defined in legislation, Regulations further define full-time care and attention as continual supervision and frequent assistance throughout the day in connection with normal bodily functions or continual supervision in order to avoid danger to himself or herself i.e. the care recipient.  The DO operates appropriate discretion when assessing whether full-time care and attention is being provided, taking into consideration the circumstances of both the applicant and the person receiving care. </p>  <p>  In certain cases, the DO may request that a local social welfare inspector investigate and report on the relevant circumstances in order to assist the DO in making a fair decision.</p>  <p>  Where a decision is made by a DO that full-time care and attention is not being provided, the applicant may request a review of that decision with or without the provision of additional information or evidence.

As a consequence of this information his claim for rent supplement was reassessed on 10<sup>th</sup>March 2015, based on his combined current income from his widow's contributory pension and his private pension.

He was therefore also overpaid rent supplement for those weeks.</p><p>The person concerned has been informed of his new rate of entitlement and also that he needs to inform the Rents Unit as to how he intends to repay the overpayment.

The telephone allowance was introduced at a time when telephones were expensive and uncommon and a landline service was the only option available to the client. The market has changed considerably since the introduction of the allowance, with several companies providing a range of services and rates with bundled services including television, telephone, broadband and pay-as-you-go mobiles. In addition, the cost of the telephone allowance scheme has risen each year with the number of eligible clients also increasing significantly. In 2007 there were some 316,000 people receiving the telephone allowance compared with almost 396,000 at the end of September 2013, an increase of 25%. Each year almost 10,000 extra clients became eligible for the allowance because of the increased number of pension recipients.</p>  <p>  The overall concern of the Government in recent budgets has been to protect the primary weekly social welfare rates. Maintaining the rate of the State pension and other core payments is key in protecting people from poverty. To allow us to preserve these core payments, we have had to look very carefully at other additional payments. Accordingly, the telephone allowance was discontinued from 1 January 2014.  This decision provided annual savings of &euro;48 million and meant that the Department was able to retain the other elements of the household benefits package such as the electricity and gas allowance and the television licence. The fuel allowance scheme and the free travel pass were also protected for older people and people with disabilities.  These are valuable supports for recipients.</p>  <p>  I am keenly aware of the impact on the Department's clients and particularly those who are living alone. As the Deputy is aware, in Budget 2015, we partially restored the Christmas Bonus and increased the living alone allowance to &euro;9.00 per week.  In these circumstances, I have no plans to restore the telephone allowance. Any decision to increase the household benefits package would have budgetary consequences and would have to be considered in the context of budget negotiations.</p></reply>

To date it has been very successful in delivering on this objective with this success being partly attributable to the wide variety of internship opportunities that it supports.</p>  <p>  Given that unemployed jobseekers are drawn from many walks of life and have varying levels of work experience and educational qualifications it is essential that Internship opportunities cover many occupations/disciplines from high skill specialist placements to lower skilled general placements.  Therefore JobBridge opportunities are not confined to the type internships that were, and continue to be a feature of, some 'white collar' professions. I am satisfied that the positions referred to can offer valuable work experience to some jobseekers and can, subject to all other conditions of the JobBridge scheme being satisfied, form the basis of a JobBridge internship.</p>  <p>  I would also point out that JobBridge is a voluntary scheme. There is no obligation on a Jobseeker to participate in the scheme or to take up any particular internship. Interns choose to participate and choose the host organisation they wish to work for.  </p></reply>

Neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland, as regulator, interfere in the pricing of insurance products.  The provision of insurance cover and the price at which it is offered is a commercial matter for insurance companies and is based on a proper assessment of the risks they are accepting and the making of adequate provisioning to meet these risks. </p>  <p>  The EU framework for insurance expressly prohibits Member States adopting provisions requiring the prior approval or systematic notification of certain matters including general and special policy conditions and scales of premiums. Furthermore, in the context of non-life insurance, the EU framework provides non-life insurers with the freedom to set premiums, as has been acknowledged in case law by the European Court of Justice (Case C-518/06).</p>  <p>  While price competition is to be welcomed in a functioning competitive market, it is important that it is based on a sustainable business model and is not at the expense of the prudential soundness of insurance companies nor at the expense of consumer protection.  It is the role of the Central Bank, as regulator, to ensure that this is the case.  This includes the power to insist on adequate reserves.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank is responsible for the authorisation and prudential supervision of insurance undertakings authorised in Ireland.  The Central Bank of Ireland also has responsibilities in relation to:</p>  <p>  -  Branch establishments of European Economic Area (EEA) authorised Non-Life Insurance undertakings</p>  <p>  -  EEA authorised Non-Life Insurance undertakings conducting business by way of services</p>  <p>  -  Third country branch establishments i.e. a branch of an insurance undertaking whose head office is locates outside the EEA </p>  <p>  The powers of the Central Bank of Ireland have been enhanced significantly in recent years to ensure that it can bring certainty to the financial position of any firms of concern and to undertake any early intervention measures it considers appropriate.</p></reply>

In this regard, VAT in Ireland is not purely treated as a revenue collecting mechanism. Ireland's VAT rate structure has clear social (e.g. 0% on food etc.) and economic (e.g. 9% on tourism related activities) goals which are in line with the EU VAT Directive.</p><p>The cost associated with abolishing exemptions and reduced rates of VAT would depend on the level at which the standard rate is fixed. At present the standard rate is 23%. However, it would in theory be possible to significantly reduce the VAT policy gap on a revenue neutral basis - e.g. the Tax Strategy Group paper on VAT prepared in advance of Budget 2015 (available on the Department's website at ) estimated that a standard rate of 15% (the lowest level permitted under the VAT Directive) could be achieved on a broadly revenue neutral basis by merging the zero, 9%, 13.5% and 23% rates. However, this would involve applying VAT to food, children's clothes and oral medicines as well as raising the VAT rate on a range of other areas of consumption such as fuel and hospitality services.</p><p>The cost of maintaining zero and reduced rates in the context of leaving the standard rate at its current level of 23% is set out below. This is a straight line calculation and takes no account of changes to spending behaviours.  Zero rate items -  &euro;2 billion; 9%  -  &euro;1.8 billion; 13.5%  -  &euro;2.3 billion.</p><p>Costings related to exempted services such as transport, education and charities are not available.</p></reply>

I have no statutory function in relation to the banking decisions made by individual lending institutions at any particular time and these are taken by the board and management of the relevant institution. </p><p>Notwithstanding the State's shareholdings in the banks, I must ensure that the banks are run on a commercial, cost effective and independent basis to ensure their value as an asset to the State. A Relationship Framework has been specified that defines the nature of the relationship between the Minister for Finance and each bank. These Frameworks were published on 30 March 2012 and can be found at .  </p><p>However from a general policy perspective, the approach of the Government is to support people in genuine mortgage arrears and where feasible, to put in place a sustainable restructure to address and resolve such a difficulty. This is clearly set out in the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears where it requires a lender in respect of a cooperating borrower to explore all of the options for an alternative repayment arrangement offered by that lender and that a lender must document its consideration of each option examined and the reasons why the options offered/not offered to the borrower are/are not appropriate and sustainable. </p><p>If a solution cannot be agreed between borrower and lender, or if it is agreed that a mortgage restructure is not a sustainable solution, there are alternative mechanisms available to allow a debtor remain in the house in appropriate cases. For example, the Mortgage to Rent scheme is available in cases where the house and household would be appropriate and eligible for social housing. Where the borrower and lender cannot agree on a sustainable mortgage restructure, the debtor has the option to formulate and propose a PIA to his/her secured and other creditor(s). This initiative rests solely with the debtor and in formulating a PIA, a personal insolvency practitioner is under an onus, insofar as is reasonably practicable, to formulate the proposal on terms that will not require the debtor to dispose of an interest in or cease to occupy a principal private residence.</p><p>I also note, BOI's focus on the resolution of Irish mortgage and business related loans, by agreeing suitable and sustainable solutions, and the progress the bank has made in this regard. In its 2014 annual report, BOI has stated that more than nine out of ten of its challenged owner occupied mortgage customers in Ireland with restructuring arrangements are meeting the agreed repayments. It is also worth noting that BOI met the targets set by the CBI in relation to addressing mortgage arrears.</p><p>At the time of announcing its 2014 full-year results, Bank of Ireland management stated that it was prioritising the capital it was generating to facilitate the de-recognition of the 2009 preference shares. The remaining 2009 preference shares stand at &euro;1.3bn. Furthermore, management has stated that following de-recognition of the preference shares its ambition is to progress to payment of dividends.</p><p>Notwithstanding the fact that management has indicated that the accelerated pace of the bank's capital build has ensured that it is firmly on track to de-recognise the 2009 preference shares in 2016, it will be some time before there is clarity around the robustness of the bank's capital position which would allow such a de-recognition to take place and subsequently the commencement of dividends. In addition the SSM, as regulator, would have to satisfy itself, at the appropriate time, as to the bank's dividend capacity in the context of its overall capital position. Accordingly, I am not willing to speculate on how any plan the bank has in relation to dividends might evolve.</p></reply>

In this regard, in Budget 2012, I fulfilled the commitment in the Programme for Government to increase the rate of mortgage interest relief to 30 per cent for first time buyers who took out their first mortgage in that period. This was the period during which house prices peaked.</p>  <p>  A mortgage holder will qualify for the increased rate if they made their first mortgage interest payment in the period 2004 to 2008 or if they drew down their mortgage in that period. In addition, the increased rate of tax relief for first time buyers who took out their first mortgage in that period will continue up to and including the 2017 tax year.</p>  <p>  Individuals that purchased their home within this specified date range are entitled to a 30% rate of relief on interest paid up to an interest ceiling of &euro;20,000 if married/widowed and &euro;10,000 if single, for the first seven years. Thereafter, the ceiling reduces for the remaining years to a maximum of &euro;6,000 if married/widowed and &euro;3,000 if single. The ceilings reduce in recognition of the fact that interest makes up a larger proportion of the mortgage payable in the earlier years of the mortgage period, and that capital makes up a larger proportion of the mortgage payable thereafter.</p>  <p>  Regarding the Deputy's question concerning the month during which the mortgage is first taken out, Mortgage Interest Relief is granted up to the full appropriate ceiling for that year, and each subsequent year up to 2017, regardless of which month the mortgage payments actually commence. </p>  <p>  Regarding the Deputy's question concerning individuals who built their family home at the end of 2004, it is not clear from the question which particular circumstance the Deputy has concerns about. However, I would point out that the look back period for tax relief purposes in respect of the tax years 2004 and 2005 has now passed.</p>  <p>  Regarding the issue of mortgage difficulties, the latest publication from my Department shows the continued improvement in Principal Dwelling House (PDH) mortgage arrears since August 2013. The number of mortgage accounts in arrears of greater than 90 days has declined by almost 25%, while those accounts in arrears of less than 90 days fell by almost 28%. Total PDH mortgage accounts in arrears show a decline of almost 26% over the same time period from 118,438 in September 2013 to 87,818 at end January 2015.</p>  <p>  Total Mortgage accounts that have been restructured now stand at 106,275. The number of mortgage accounts in arrears of greater than 90 days continues to fall, decreasing by 1,398 accounts to 60,868.  Engagement between consumers and lenders has resulted in an increase of 2,764 permanent mortgage restructures in January.</p>  <p>  Given that the next Budget is almost seven months away it would be inappropriate for me to become involved in speculation on this matter. However, I will say that as part of the normal budgetary preparations, my officials continue to monitor the situation and will be examining potential options for changes to the tax system for my consideration as part of the overall Budget package. However, given that Mortgage Interest Relief has effectively been abolished since 2013 for new mortgages, I am not predisposed to reopen it to further amendment to provide additional benefits to existing claimants.</p></reply>

The primary focus of this strategy is to support those homeowners in difficulty with their mortgage repayments and, insofar as possible, to avoid repossession of the family home.  The Deputy will be aware that the Government's mortgage arrears strategy must be viewed as part of the overarching Government Housing Policy, the implementation of which is overseen by the Construction 2020, Housing Planning and Mortgage Arrears Cabinet sub-Committee, which is chaired by An Taoiseach.  The overall strategic objective of the Government's housing strategy, which comes under the responsibility of the Minister for the Environment, Alan Kelly TD, is to enable all households access good quality housing appropriate to household circumstances and in their particular community of choice.</p></reply>

The Deputy will appreciate that tax reliefs and exemptions have costs which have to be paid for and their introduction must be considered only where there is a clear economic and social policy need to be addressed.  </p>  <p>  It should be noted in relation to local property tax (LPT), that where a person downsizes their residential property, assuming they stay in a similar location to the property they are selling, their LPT liability will, most likely, be less than the amount they would have been liable for on their original property. </p>  <p>  In relation to what might also be regarded as property-related taxes, Stamp Duties are payable on the acquisition of residential property.   The current rates are 1% on values up to &euro;1 million and 2% on any balance over that. I do not consider that a rate of 1% on the purchase of a property would represent a serious disincentive to any property owner considering trading down. </p>  <p>  In relation to Capital Gains Tax (CGT), an exemption is in place on the disposal of a person's principal private residence.   The exemption applies to any gain made on the disposal of an individual's dwelling house together with land occupied up to an area of one acre, excluding the site of the house.  Full CGT relief applies where the period of occupation matches the period of ownership, and partial relief applies where the house has not been occupied by the individual for the full period of ownership. </p></reply>

I have no statutory role in relation to regulated financial institutions passing on the European Central Bank interest rate change or to the mortgage interest rates charged.  It is a commercial matter for each institution concerned.  It is not appropriate for me, as Minister for Finance, to comment on or become involved in the detailed mortgage position of mortgage holders.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank has responsibility for the regulation and supervision of financial institutions in terms of consumer protection and prudential requirements and for ensuring ongoing compliance with applicable statutory obligations. The Central Bank has no statutory role in the setting of interest rates by financial institutions, apart from the interest rate cap imposed on the credit union sector in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Union Act, 1997 and the requirement to be notified of penalty or surcharge interest imposed in respect of arrears. As I stated in previous Parliamentary Questions, a previous Deputy Governor indicated that, within its existing powers and through the use of persuasion, the Central Bank would continue to engage with specific lenders which appear to have standard variable rates set disproportionate to their cost of funds and this is a course of action I expect the Central Bank to continually appraise.The Deputy should be aware that the Governor of the Central Bank, Mr Patrick Honohan in his opening statement to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform last November stated that, as in most advanced economies, including Ireland, it has long been understood that tight administrative control over the rates charged by banks would be counterproductive in ensuring a sufficient flow of properly priced credit on a lasting basis. Such control would strongly discourage new entrants. In this regard, ongoing competition in the banking sector will be crucial in ensuring that the economy is provided with efficient and cost effective banking services. In this regard, there has been some movements on mortgage interest rates of late by a number of institutions which suggest that the market may well be entering a new and more competitive phase. The mortgage interest rates that financial institutions operating in Ireland charge to customers are determined as a result of a commercial decision by the institutions concerned. This interest rate is determined taking into account a broad range of factors including European Central Bank base rates, deposit rates, market funding costs, the competitive environment and an institution's overall funding.However, as part of the Central Bank's work on mortgage arrears, lenders were asked to consider all avenues to help customers in arrears, including interest rate reductions. </p></reply>

Where it is of the opinion that the state of the ICF is such that financial support should be provided for it, it is allowed determine an appropriate contribution to be paid to the ICF by each insurer or insurer authorised in another EEA Member State.  This is calculated as a percentage determined by the Central Bank, not exceeding 2%, of the aggregate of the gross premiums paid to the insurer or insurer authorised in another EEA Member State in respect of policies issued in respect of risks in Ireland.  </p>  <p>  The Insurance Compensation Fund levy has been applied on two occasions and a total of &euro;376.6 million has been collected:</p>  <p>  -  A levy of 2% of gross premium income was introduced on 1 January 1984 following the collapse of PMPA in October of the preceding year.  The levy was paid by all non-life insurers at this rate until 31 December 1991 and a reduced levy of 1% applied for the period 1 January 1992 to 31 December 1992, when it was discontinued. During these 12 years &euro;186.3 million was collected.</p>  <p>  -  In 1 January 2012 the levy was once again introduced at a rate of 2%.  Since the introduction of the levy a total of &euro;190.3 million has been collected. </p>  <p>In the case of the insolvency of the Insurance Corporation of Ireland a levy was not applied.  ICI, a subsidiary of Allied Irish Bank, collapsed in 1985.  No levy was placed on the industry then as compensation to meet the company's liabilities was provided by a combination of AIB funding, commercial loans and State loans which have since been repaid. </p>  <p>  The management and administration of the Insurance Compensation Fund is under the control of the President of the High Court acting through the Office of the Accountant of the Courts of Justice. All amounts paid out of the fund are subject to approval of the High Court. </p>  <p>  The Fund has been used to fund the administration of three insurance companies.</p>  <p>  -  A balance of &euro;164,386,901 was paid from the Fund in relation to the Insurance Corporation of Ireland.</p>  <p>  -  A balance of &euro;139,013,808 was paid from the Fund in relation to PMPA.</p>  <p>  -  To date a total of &euro;1,158,000,000 has been paid from the Fund in relation to Quinn Insurance Limited. </p>  <p>  With regard to insurer liquidations, there has been a total of &euro;29,166 paid out of the fund in relation to sums due under policies issued by Lemma Europe Insurance Company Limited (In Liquidation) in respect of risks in the Irish State. </p></reply>

The USC rates cited in Option 4 are applied to both PAYE and self-employed income. I am also informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, consistent with the Option 4 proposal, the aforementioned estimates do not make any provision for exemptions currently available  to either medical card holders or individuals aged 70 or over  on income less than &euro;60,000.</p>  <p>  All figures above are estimates from the Revenue tax forecasting model for 2015, using the actual data for the year 2012 (the latest year for which data are available) adjusted as necessary for income, self-employment and employment trends in the interim. They are provisional and may be revised.</p>  <p>  It should be acknowledged that since the Review was published there have been major changes to the USC. As a result of the Review the Government decided in Budget 2012 to increase the entry point to the Universal Social Charge from &euro;4,004 to &euro;10,036 per annum. It is estimated that this removed almost 330,000 individuals from the charge.  In Budget 2015 I extended this exemption threshold to &euro;12,012 to apply from 1 January 2015 onwards. This exempted a further 87,000 individuals from the charge. This means that 28% of all income earners are not paying any Universal Social Charge at all. Furthermore, I also reduced the two lower rates at which USC is charged and extended the threshold before the 7% rate becomes chargeable. These measures, together with the introduction of a new 8% rate on income over &euro;70,044, as well as a rate increase from 10% to 11% on self-assessed income over &euro;100,000, further enhanced the existing progressive nature of the USC. </p>  <p>  However, as a result of the changes to income tax and USC in Budget 2015, all those who currently pay income tax and/or USC have seen a reduction in their tax bill this year compared to 2014 and the Government have committed to continue to reform the tax system in this manner in the coming years, contingent on having the fiscal space to do so.</p></reply>

The purchaser should also satisfy himself/herself that the LPT valuation declared by the vendor (as at 1 May 2013) appears accurate. </p>  <p>  To facilitate this process, the vendor (or his/her solicitor) is obliged to provide the purchaser with details of the valuation of the property and the LPT/HHC liabilities paid. The required information can be accessed through an online system, which Revenue has developed to assist the sale process. In this regard the vendor can either provide the purchaser with online access to the LPT property records using secure identification codes or alternatively simply provide printed copies.</p>  <p>   Specifically in regard to HHC, the vendor should confirm payment to the purchaser by way of receipts or other appropriate documentation or, where the property is exempt provide a certificate of exemption or waiver.  </p>  <p>  In the case to which the Deputy refers, it is acknowledged that the person in question purchased the property in 2014. However, there is no record that the outstanding HHC liability on the property was paid, either prior to, or as part of the sale and it seems that there was no agreement on the issue between the person's legal representative and the vendor. For that reason the amount due is recorded as a charge against the property.</p>  <p>  Revenue has confirmed to me that the person made contact with the LPT team on foot of a compliance notification that issued to him on 21 February 2015. The LPT agent confirmed to the person that the liability is correctly due and that Revenue has no discretion in regard to the outstanding amount and must apply the law as set down in the legislation. </p></reply>

In this fiscal context, the Government is now considering options, including a Spring Economic Statement and National Economic Dialogue, to further develop the whole-of-year budgetary cycle.</p>  <p>  A National Economic Dialogue could facilitate a broad inclusive societal discussion of fiscal policy parameters and priorities for resource allocation over the coming years.  My Department is working with the Department of Finance on developing proposals for such a dialogue. It is envisaged that it would be held mid-year in a format that would facilitate an open and transparent public discussion about fiscal policy options and priorities.</p>  <p>  With a dialogue held in mid-year, the outcome of such a dialogue could then inform the work of Government and the Oireachtas in their considerations of the Budget later in the year.</p></reply>

This application was not approved by the OPW and the delegation requested that this decision be re-considered. I understand that no application for funding has been submitted by the Council in respect of the project at East Bridge to date as the proposal involves work on a protected structure and therefore will first require the approval of the National Monuments Section of the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.</p>  <p>  I explained to the delegation that the current requests for funding must be considered in the context of the very significant funding totalling &euro;1.9 million which has been provided to date by the OPW to Galway County Council under the OPW's Minor Works Scheme in respect of flood relief works in Ballinasloe.  This funding has allowed substantial works to be undertaken which will have reduced the flood risk considerable in the town. I indicated that the OPW's core strategy for addressing flood risk in the Shannon Basin is the River Shannon Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Study and that Ballinsaloe is one of the areas, known as Areas for Further Assessment, being looked at in detail under this study. The Shannon CFRAM study is one of six such studies being undertaken nationally and the output of this important project will be an integrated plan of specific measures to address, in a comprehensive and sustainable way, the significant flood risk factors in the Shannon basin.  The recommendations for structural flood measures that will emerge from all the separate CFRAM projects will be prioritised on a national basis and I informed the delegation that it would not be appropriate to give preference to Ballinasloe by committing further significant funding for flood relief works in that AFA pending the outcome of the overall CFRAM work and the national priorities that will emanate from that.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the CFRAM strategy, which is line with national and EU policy on management of flood risk, is the best way to address comprehensively any remaining flood risk in Ballinasloe.  I am cognisant of the great effort and work that the Flood Alleviation Ballinasloe community group has undertaken to date and I indicated at the recent meeting with them that, in light of their presentation on what they consider to be a significant remaining risk in the town, but having regard also to my stated position above in relation to the CFRAM strategy, the application for additional funding would be considered again.</p></reply>

The scheme includes flood alleviation measures in the areas referred to by the Deputy.</p>  <p>  In order to comply with the requirements of SI 469 and SI 470 of 2012, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (DPER) engaged experts to carry out an independent review as part of its assessment of the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) of the Scheme proposals. The report of the independent review was recently received by DPER and this raises a number of matters for clarification and some additional information requirements necessary to enable the adequacy of the EIS to be fully assessed.  The OPW and its environmental consultants are currently considering the report and will be in a position to respond to DPER shortly.</p>  <p>  Pending completion of DPER's assessment and approval of the Scheme by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, it is not possible to say when construction works will commence. </p>  <p>  I wish to re-affirm that the OPW remains committed to carrying out the scheme, subject to the Minister's sanction, and has provided for its cost in its multi-annual capital expenditure profiles to 2017.</p>  <p>  The total estimated budget for the Claregalway Scheme inclusive of provision for professional fees, environmental mitigation measures and maintenance is in the region of &euro;7.1 million and not the amount referred to by the Deputy, which includes the advance works already completed at Claregalway and Crusheeny Bridge at a cost of approximately &euro;2.5 million.

NERA operates a system of risk based inspections in sectors where there are identifiable risks. Inspections are also carried out in response to complaints received and routine inspections are undertaken as a control measure.</p>  <p>  It is a condition of any contract entered into by a public authority with a private sector entity (other than for operations that may reasonably be considered as small scale) that the entity is required to provide access to certain information.  This information may assist the authority to assess compliance with employment legislation consistent with the requirements of EU and national law.  </p></reply>

While OPW representatives sit on the Project Steering Group which oversees the project, responsibility for the day to day running and management of the scheme, including Health and Safety matters, site supervision and public liaison, rests with WCC.</p>  <p>  In relation to Deputy's question on the Castle Street junction with the Dargle road, I am informed by WCC that, in its view, the junction and road condition is not in a very unsafe condition. While the footpaths and road lining in the area require further work, the area cannot be finally re-surfaced until the piled river wall is complete and the boardwalk is installed.  If footpaths and road lining at this location were re-laid now it would have to be ripped up and re-done at a later date to facilitate the boardwalk. </p>  <p>  With regard to your query on the prevention of unsafe access to the flood relief construction site, I am advised by WCC that two security companies using cameras and night time patrols are employed  by WCC for site security. The monitoring of site safety hazards and the repair and strengthening of security fencing is carried out on an ongoing basis by WCC and its agents. The statutory safety file is being maintained, in line with statutory requirements and best practice, by the consultants hired by WCC. As the OPW is not the contracting authority for the project it is not required to approve the Safety Statement.  I am further informed by WCC that regular safety inspections are being carried out by the construction team and consultants, as required by law and best practice.</p>  <p>  In relation to the People's Park, I understand that a substantial part of it was handed back for public use in November last year and that WCC plans to hand back the remaining, relatively small areas, which are currently being used for works compounds in September 2016. </p>  <p>  As the OPW is not the Contracting Authority on the project it is not responsible for conducting traffic audits.  Satisfactory management of construction traffic will be required of the successful contractors as part of their methodology for undertaking the works. WCC will arrange regular inspection of traffic safety measures as part of its management of the works construction.</p>  <p>  I am further advised by WCC that works to the river bank at La Vallee were emergency works, arranged because of the imminent danger of collapse of the river bank adjacent to apartment and office blocks. The landscaping works being carried out at the apartment blocks at present are re-instatement works and regular and detailed consultation with the apartment owners is ongoing. The opposite bank will be planted in the near future to further stabilise the bank. This planting will be undertaken in accordance with the general principles of the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), and as this bank was envisaged by the EIS to be excavated, it will be planted to the standard envisaged by the EIS, or better.</p></reply>

I am aware of the concerns raised regarding the imposition of the Public Service Pension Reduction (PSPR) and the application of the Universal Social Charge (USC) to pensions.  I have indicated to ARPS that it is my intention, as a matter of priority, to move towards reducing the burden of PSPR, with the initial focus on retired public servants in receipt of low pensions, at the earliest date economic progress permits.  My most recent meeting with ARPS representatives took place on 4 March 2015 and I expect that officials of my Department will continue to engage with ARPS representatives over the coming months.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy states, there is a requirement to review the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (FEMPI) Acts 2009-2013 annually and to consider whether the various measures, including the PSPR, continue to be necessary, having regard to the purposes of the legislation.  The next review will be carried out by me on or before the 30 June next.</p>  <p>  I have previously indicated that consideration must be given as to how, over the medium term, public service pay and pensions policy currently underpinned by the Financial Emergency Measures legislation needs to develop in the public service, while ensuring that overall fiscal targets will be met.  The continued application of the PSPR to public service pensioners will form part of my considerations in this regard.  Any proposals to amend the FEMPI Acts, including any changes to the PSPR, will require primary legislation to be brought before the Oireachtas.</p>  <p>  The impacts of USC was considered collectively by Government in the context of Budget 2015 whereby  the USC exemption limit was raised to just over &euro;12,000, while the 2% rate was reduced to 1.5% and the 4% rate reduced to 3.5%.  These changes provided a modest amelioration of the impact of USC on public service pensioners also.</p></reply>

As property is one of the key considerations for clients when choosing a location, the availability of these suitable premises will provide an additional positive element in the Midlands.</p>  <p>  IDA Ireland promotes Westmeath as part of its Midlands Region, which also includes Counties Longford, Laois and Offaly.  There are 35 multinational companies employing 4,032 within the region.  The region is marketed as having a strong cluster in medical technology and life sciences and is home to many key clients, one such example being Covidien in Athlone.</p>  <p>  A digital marketing campaign is in place to market the Midlands Region for potential investors and this is used overseas by IDA Ireland executives, to showcase potential locations within the Midlands Region including Westmeath.</p>  <p>  IDA Ireland has regular engagement with the Chief Executives of the local authorities Longford, Westmeath, Laois and Offaly to ensure that there is a continuous line of communication open and a mutually supportive approach taken, considering the role that local authorities now have for economic development.</p>  <p>  Growing both Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and indigenous enterprise is key to Ireland&rsquo;s economic recovery. 2014 was a record year for both IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland in terms of investment wins and job creation, with 7,131 net new jobs being created in IDA Ireland client companies and 8,476 net new jobs being created in Enterprise Ireland client companies.</p>  <p>  We are now in the fourth year of the Action Plan for Jobs, which was launched on 29th January last.  When the Action Plan for Jobs was first launched, unemployment stood at 15.1%.  It now stands at 10.6% and we are on track to exceed our target of 100,000 additional jobs by 2016. We are now setting a goal to bring employment to 2.1 million by 2018 &ndash; 2 years ahead of our original target.</p>  <p>  The Regional Strategy, as part of the Action Plan for Jobs, will provide up to &euro;250 million over five years in additional funding to support regional enterprise development.  This includes the roll out of a five year, &euro;150 million property investment programme by the IDA to attract foreign direct investment into the regions.  This programme will build on the recent investment by the IDA in a number of advance manufacturing facilities in regional locations.  A further sum of up to &euro;100 million will be available to Enterprise Ireland to support enterprises in the regions to start-up, grow and export, thereby creating more jobs in regional locations.</p>  <p>  I also recently launched IDA Ireland&rsquo;s new strategy for the 5 year period 2015 to 2019.  In that Strategy the Agency set itself a target of winning 900 investments over the 5 year period and of increasing increase the level of investments won into in each region by between 30% and 40% during the lifetime of the Strategy.</p></reply>

In November 2014, a survey published by IBEC indicated that the level of absenteeism in business fell to 2.35% (5.5 days per year) across all industry sectors, down from 2.58% in 2009.  IBEC estimate that absenteeism has fallen by over two days per year (from 3.38% or 7.8 days per employee in 2004) in the last 10 years.</p>  <p>  Absenteeism can result in high costs for employers and can impact on overall productivity for businesses.  These are issues which employers manage on an ongoing basis with their employees and I am aware of the many proactive and supportive approaches and policies employers have in place to manage such absences.</p>  <p>  In general terms, Irish labour costs increased in 2012 (+2.2%) and 2013 (+0.7%).  In the first two quarters of 2014, labour costs grew by 1%.  These rates are less than the euro area average.  Irish unit labour costs (ULCs) which measure the average cost of labour per unit of output (and thus capture both cost and productivity changes) increased by 1% in 2013, after several years of improvements.  Nominal ULCs grew at a slower rate than in the euro area, representing a slight improvement in Irish competitiveness.  This trend is expected to continue in 2015 and 2016.</p></reply>

Indeed, the first of the five strands set out in Pathways to Work is to ensure better engagement with unemployed people and jobless households.  To that end the Department of Social Protection committed to preparing a report on jobless households to assess the factors influencing the level of jobless households and develop a range of recommendations to allow Government to take tangible steps to assist these households to return to work.  In June 2014, the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, published the report "Jobless Households: An Exploration of the Issues".  The report notes the sharp increase in jobless households in Ireland following the economic crash in 2008 and that Ireland has a high level of household joblessness compared to other European countries, with nearly one-quarter, 23 per cent of households in Ireland described as jobless (in 2010).  NESC refer to the responses made to address the problem of unemployment, if not specifically household joblessness namely, Action Plan for Jobs (APJ), Pathways to Work as well as the work of the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare.  Notable reforms, according to NESC, include the transformation of the public employment and education and training services, as well as reconfiguration of the One Parent Family Payment. </p>  <p>  For my Department the focus continues to be on creating the conditions to support export-led, broadly-based economic growth and job creation via the Action Plan for Jobs.  The latest APJ was published in January and contains 382 actions broken down into quarterly steps and owners.  The objectives and actions set out in the Plan are designed to achieve specific impacts such as in terms of jobs, exports and startups, market penetration and innovation, efficiency of public interaction with business, finance and access to talent.  In terms of employment, almost 90,000 more people are at work since the launch of the first Action Plan for Jobs in 2012.  In terms of unemployment, last year over 141,000 people left the live register to take up work.  Unemployment is still at 10.4 per cent and many people and firms around the country are yet to feel the full benefits of the recovery.  The Government has pulled in by two years our full-employment target of 2.1 million at work from 2020 to 2018, and the Action Plan for Jobs and related strategies are in place to ensure that the unemployment problem and the associated issue of household joblessness is addressed.  It is also worth noting the role that budgetary policy has in this area, and a recent social impact assessment of the main welfare and tax measures in the Budget for 2015 finds that for the first time since the economic crisis, budgetary policy will result in an increase in average household incomes of 0.7 per cent.  Welfare increases favour lower income households, and there is a marked contrast between the impact of the 2015 and 2014 budgetary measures as gains replace losses, with the most significant improvements for the poorest and richest households.</p></reply>

While this figure continues a downward trend in the over-quota position, coming down from 7.15% in October, indications are that Ireland will still end the milk quota year in the region of 5% over quota which equates to a super levy bill of about &euro;80m.</p><p>As the Deputy is aware I have, on numerous occasions, called on the Commission to take action to mitigate the impact of super levy fines, e.g. via utilisation of an adjustment to the butterfat coefficient, as this would not have required an amendment to existing regulations.  Unfortunately, there was no realistic prospect of any movement on the super levy or on the butterfat adjustment at EU level given the level of opposition of MS who did not share our views on this matter.  </p><p>However, in recent weeks the Commission has acceded to a request from Ireland and other Member States for an instalment facility to pay the super levy.  The Commission has come forward with a Regulation which introduces an instalment facility over a three year period, for farmers who are facing a super levy liability.  Ireland voted in favour of the proposal when it came before the Management Committee earlier this month.  The Department will be required to pay the super levy in full to the European Commission by the standard deadline of 31 November 2015, with the terms of the scheme requiring farmers here to repay a minimum of one-third of the payment this year and two thirds by next, with the remainder payable in 2017.  My officials are working out the practicalities of implementing this scheme in consultation with the relevant stakeholders.</p><p>I welcome the Commission's initiative on the basis that it <i>can help to reduce the burden on dairy farmers entering the post-quota era in full readiness for the opportunity which awaits.  We are now in the final few days of the quota regime before they are gone forever and the Irish dairy sector can start to realise its full potential.</i></p></reply>

Within GLAS, which is a completely voluntary scheme, all such lands must be farmed to a prescription which preserves the bird habitat.  However, this in no way changes the status of the lands one way or another, nor does it mean that additional lands are now formally designated.</p></reply>

The same provisions apply to all land declared for payment under the Scheme irrespective of whether the land is designated or not.

The eligibility inspection involved the inspection of lands declared in counties Clare, Limerick, Roscommon and Tipperary.  This inspection identified discrepancies between the area declared and area found, resulting in an intentional over-declaration in area of greater than 20% in respect of the Single Payment Scheme. Based on the Terms and Conditions of this Scheme this resulted in no payment in respect of the 2012 scheme and the application of an administrative fine to be offset against any future EU payments.  The person named was notified of this decision on 19 November 2012.</p>  <p>  The cross compliance inspection identified breaches relating to requirements applying to Special Areas of Conservation and sheep identification and registration requirements, resulting in a 5% penalty.  The person named was also notified of this decision on 19 November 2012.  The person named sought a review of both inspection decisions.  As part of this review process the person named was afforded the opportunity to provide any new evidence and supporting documentation for consideration by the reviewing officer.  The outcome of this review was to uphold the original inspection decisions and the person named was notified of this decision on 12 February 2013.</p>  <p>  During the course of this review the application of the administrative fine was also examined.  Following a review of the applicable EU legislation and the receipt of legal advice from my Department's Legal Services Division, it was determined that the application of the administrative fine was incorrect given that the area of the intentional non-compliance was less than 3%.  Following this determination, arrangements were immediately put in place to refund the value of the administrative fine applied and the relevant amounts issued to the person named on 20 December 2013.</p>  <p>  The person named appealed the inspection decisions to the independent Agriculture Appeals Office.  As part of the appeal process an oral hearing took place on 18 September 2013 where the person named was afforded the opportunity to seek clarification on any issues relating to how the inspections were carried out and their findings and also to present any additional information in support of the appeal. While the decision of the Appeals Office was to partially allow the appeal in relation to the eligibility over-declaration, this had no monetary impact as the overall over-declaration was still greater than 20% and less than 50%.  The Appeals Office upheld the decision in relation to the Cross Compliance penalty of 5%. The person named was notified of the Appeals Office decision on 7 February 2014.  The person named was also advised of their right to pursue the matter further with the Office of the Ombudsman. </p>  <p>  At the request of the person named, officials from my Department, independent to those officers involved in the inspection process, met with the applicant and agreed to undertake a review of the procedures applied during the inspection process.  One of the areas of concern was that the eligibility inspection was carried out without notification.  EU regulations governing inspections provide that an inspection may be carried out on an unannounced basis where it is considered that the inspection may be jeopardised by giving notice.  The outcome of this review was that there were no grounds to overturn the inspection findings and the consequential financial penalty.  The person named was notified of this decision by letter dated 14 December 2014.</p>  <p>  The person named has availed of the option of internal reviews by officials within my Department, including a review by official's independent to the original inspection process.  In addition, the person named has availed of the right to appeal the inspection decisions to the independent Agriculture Appeals Office.  The person named was advised of their right to raise the matter further with the Office of the Ombudsman and my Department understands that this option has not been availed of to date.  In addition, I understand that the person named has been in contact with the Director of the Independent Appeals Office with what he states is new information concerning this case and this is currently being considered.</p></reply>

These meetings will finish at the end of this week and I expect that negotiations will resume shortly thereafter.</p>  <p>  The aim of the Review Group is to agree standards and delivery targets for the schemes and services provided by my Department to all its clients including farmers.  These standards and targets form the basis of the Farmers Charter.  The relevant national and EU legislation are the legal instruments governing the various schemes and services.  The Charter is effectively an agreement drawn up between the parties but has no force of law and accordingly has no legal status.  </p>  <p>  Once a new Farmers' Charter is finalised, a Charter Monitoring Committee will be established under an independent chair to monitor agreed targets and standards.</p></reply>

No payment was due under the Single Farm Payment Scheme as the person named does not hold any payment entitlements under that Scheme.</p>  <p>  A review of the land parcels declared by the person named under the 2013 Single Payment Scheme revealed that a number of the land parcels declared by the person named contained ineligible features and the person named was notified accordingly.  Following the review of my Department's decision, sought by the person named, a visit by a Department official to verify the position on the ground was necessary.  This verification check established that the level of over-declaration under the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme was greater than 20%.  Under the governing EU Regulations, where an over-declaration greater than 20% is established, no payment was due to the person named under the 2013 Disadvantaged Area Scheme.  As a result of this determination, the amount already paid to the person named under the 2013 Scheme must be recouped from future payments made by my Department.</p>  <p>  A letter detailing the outcome of the verification check was issued to the person named on the 19 July 2014.  This letter advised that in the event that the person named was dissatisfied with the outcome of the verification check the decision could be appealed to the independent LPIS Appeals Committee, within 3 months of the notification letter. </p>  <p>  By letter dated 17 September 2014, the person named opted to avail of his right to appeal to the independently-chaired LPIS Appeal Committee and the LPIS Appeals Committee have partially allowed his appeal allowing a small area eligible as forage area for 2013.  However, when this revision is taken into account the level of over-declaration is still greater than 20%, which means that no payment is still due to the person named.  The person named was notified of the outcome on 24 February 2015.  The person named can appeal this decision to the Office of the Ombudsman if he so wishes.</p></reply>

Its aim is to deliver environmental benefits which will protect and enhance our biodiversity and water quality and which will raise awareness of and encourage actions which mitigate the effects of climate change. The scheme as now presented contains actions which will deliver the expected environmental dividends and is the result of widespread consultation with stakeholders and of protracted negotiations with the Commission.</p>  <p>  GLAS offers a wide range of actions to farmers, some of which require reduced inputs such as Low Input Permanent Pasture. Farmers taking these actions are paid on the basis of income foregone as a result of complying with the specification. In the case of Low Input Permanent Pasture, for instance, this payment is &euro;314 per hectare and if the specification was to be reduced to allow more fertiliser to be applied, that payment would also now have to be reduced.</p>  <p>  However, there is a wide range of actions to choose from in GLAS, most of which do not require reduced fertiliser application. I have provided for 50,000 farmers to join the Scheme and there is scope within that number for participants from all types of farming systems, including those with small holdings.</p></reply>

The principal support will be an annual area-based payment per hectare over a 5 year contract period.  This rate is comprised of a higher payment for farmers converting land to organic farming for the first time, payable for the initial two year conversion period, with a greatly increased maintenance payment thereafter.</p>  <p>  In recognition of the high cost of feed in the organic sector I have proposed the inclusion of an additional top-up payment of &euro;30/ha to incentivise the growing of red clover as a source of high-protein, high dry-matter organic fodder and for its environmental benefits as a natural nitrogen-fixer.</p>  <p>  The increased payment rates which are proposed for the different organic sectors are designed to compensate for additional costs incurred and income foregone by organic farmers. In addition to the Organic Farming Scheme, I am proposing a dedicated Capital Grant Scheme specifically for organic farmers.  This will be based on the model developed under the last Programme which proved very effective in enabling organic farmers to purchase the specialist equipment they required. My Department has no plans to incorporate a fodder production system into the proposed list of grant aided equipment under this new scheme at this time.</p></reply>

Their professional expertise and experience are vital to the preparation of reliable GLAS applications that fully comply with regulatory and scheme requirements. That is why I have made it mandatory for all GLAS applications to be submitted by an approved GLAS Advisor.</p>  <p>  The negotiations with the European Commission in relation to the details of the Scheme were long and protracted, which is why the earliest date I could open it was 23rd February, 2015. I appreciate that the deadline of 30th April for submission of applications under GLAS is tight but there was no real opportunity to extend this without impinging upon the regulatory deadline for direct payment applications generally, which has been fixed for many years now as 15 May. With this in mind, I have been working closely with colleagues in Europe to see can this regulatory deadline be extended and I am delighted to say that we have achieved some flexibility on this front, with the European Commission extending the overall deadline up until 15th June, 2015.  In deciding whether to now extend the GLAS deadline, I will take account of the feedback from farmers and advisors, the need for the efficient management of the different Departmental on-line systems and the effect, if any, on commencement dates in GLAS.</p>  <p>  As regards the question of the training of Advisors for GLAS, training days were held in several locations throughout the country in November and February and were very well attended. In terms of the GLAS on-line system, this system has been custom-built to allow Advisors to access their clients' lands, with pre-determined assets and characteristics on those farms identified in order to aid the Advisor in choosing the correct actions. The system is designed to streamline the application process, with built-in validations to assist in the preparation of the application. From the feedback received the system is relatively easy to navigate, once the user follows the user manual provided. In addition there is a dedicated GLAS e-mail address and Lo Call phone number which deals with any queries farmers or Advisors may have in relation to the Scheme or in relation to the on-line application system. My officials are dealing with these queries promptly and any issues arising are examined and acted upon if necessary. Furthermore, information sessions on GLAS and the BPS Scheme which commenced on 16th February, 2015 are being rolled out across the country and are open to all to attend and my officials are available for question and answer sessions at these meetings.</p>  <p>  The issue of Commonage Management Plans is one which my officials have dealt with at Commonage Information meetings held at various regional locations in September and October of last year. A dedicated and separate session was held for Advisors in most locations, at which it was outlined that in order for these plans to realise an environmental return on these hills, one cohesive plan for all participating GLAS shareholders was needed. This, of necessity, means one Master Commonage Advisor, who has responsibility for deciding, along with shareholders, the activities and stocking densities suitable to the entire commonage. It is not feasible for all GLAS Advisors to draw up an individual Commonage Management Plan for their clients and it would not be acceptable on environmental grounds.</p>  <p>  My officials will be in direct contact with the Advisor who raised these issues to answer the specific technical questions addressed directly to them in relation to the operation of GLAS.</p></reply>

EU Regulation No 1305/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council on support for Rural Development by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) sets out the breakdown of EU support for rural development for each Member State for the years 2014 &ndash; 2020. Ireland's total EAFRD allocation for rural development is some &euro;2.19 billion (or some &euro;313 million per annum), as agreed at the EU Multi-annual Financial Framework (MFF) negotiations in 2013. EU funding amounts are combined with national co-funding to provide for each Member State's RDP.</p>  <p>  The MFF is subject to a formal amendment process at EU level for RDPs approved in 2015. However, the average amount of EU support per annum remains the same. It has been agreed that a letter of comfort will issue to Member States who have informally agreed their RDP with the Commission in 2015 but where formal adoption of the RDP will be delayed by amendments to the MFF.</p>  <p>  The main headings of expenditure in Ireland's draft RDP are &euro;1.3bn in respect of Areas of Natural Constraint, &euro;1.4bn in respect of Agri-Environment Schemes (including transitional expenditure), &euro;112m in respect of a range of knowledge transfer measures, &euro;295m in respect of the Beef Data and Genomics Programme, &euro;395m in respect of support for on farm capital investment, &euro;56m in respect of support for organic farming, &euro;3m in support for collaborative farming arrangements, &euro;250m for LEADER funding, and &euro;6m in respect of technical assistance to support the implementation of the RDP. The standard co-financing rate applied to these measures in the draft RDP is 53%, with higher rates of 56% applied to expenditure under Measure 10 (Agri-Environment and Climate) and 65% applied to Measure 19 (LEADER). The actual rate of drawdown over the period may vary as the financial plan is subject to ongoing management and review.</p>  <p>  Detailed discussions and intensive negotiations have been ongoing between my Department and the Commission in recent months in order to secure agreement on the new RDP. Ireland's RDP has now been formally resubmitted to the EU Commission where it has entered the Commission's final round of inter-services consultation. When this process is complete, the schemes and supports contained in Ireland's RDP will be rolled out in line with the annual budgetary process.</p></reply>

Furthermore, the person named included a commonage parcel on this application, declaring 117/565 shares, and later confirmed in writing that he was only entitled to declare 23/565 shares.</p>  <p>  Per the Terms and Conditions of the 2012 Scheme, as the overclaim on the application exceeded 50%, no payment was due under the 2012 Single Payment Scheme and an administrative fine amounting to the value of the Single Payment on the number of hectares over-declared was also to be offset against any EU payment due to the person named during the course of the three subsequent calendar years. This accounts for both the debt and the overpayment reduction referred to by the Deputy. My Department wrote to the person named on 26 September 2013, informing him of the position and of his right to have the decision reviewed.</p>  <p>  My Department has reviewed the case indicated in the reply to Parliamentary Question 5122/15. Following that review the administrative fine aspects of the original decision have been waived. This will result in the removal of the administrative element of the penalty. However, the decision not to allow payment under the 2012 Scheme remains unchanged.  Any monies due to the person named, on foot of this review decision, will issue as soon as possible to the nominated bank account of the person named.</p></reply>

The reforms introduced were facilitated by the legislative amendments made by this Government in 2012 which represented the most wide ranging and fundamental set of changes to have occurred since the establishment of the Society in 1939.</p>  <p>  However, the independence of the Society notwithstanding, I am aware that despite this clear progress there is nevertheless some concern that other aspects of governance have not moved as quickly and that this is an issue of ongoing debate within the Society. I am also aware that the Society is now entering a time of change in terms of its Board, Officers and Management and it is important that the incoming administration finds the right balance between the pace of reform and the obligation to manage the Society in a way that meets the expectations of all its stakeholders.</p>  <p>  The payment of my Department's annual grant to the Society is kept under review on an ongoing basis.

Only if my Department is satisfied that the grant has been used appropriately will the instalment due from 1 April next be paid. I will continue to keep this matter under review.</p></reply>

Members of the PDF attend a wide range of courses in the UK and members of the UK Forces have attended courses in Ireland, including in the UN School and on the Command and Staff Courses. </p><p>Members of the Defence Forces currently participate as part of a joint Ireland/UK contingent in the EU training mission in Mali. Defence Forces personnel have also recently deployed in support of the work of the UK Armed Forces in the fight against Ebola in Sierra Leone. </p><p>The conditions under which the Defence Forces may participate on overseas peace support operations have been made very clear by the Government. In this regard, the conditions, which have been referred to as the &ldquo;triple lock&rdquo; must be satisfied, i.e. the operation must be authorised/mandated by the United Nations; it must be approved by the Government, and it must be approved by way of a resolution of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, where the size of a Defence Forces contribution is more than twelve personnel. </p><p>There is no requirement for D&aacute;il approval for the dispatch of contingents of the Permanent Defence Force for service overseas as part of an International Force where that Force is unarmed or where the size of the Permanent Defence Force contingent does not exceed twelve members. </p><p>Outside of such contingent deployments, members of the Permanent Defence Force may also be deployed outside the State on a range of other duties including training, humanitarian operations, fact finding missions, ceremonial duties, etc under the authority of the Government in accordance with the provisions of the Defence (Amendment) Act, 2006, which formalised arrangements in this regard. The range of such duties is set out in Section 3 of the Defence (Amendment) Act 2006.</p><p>The MoU specifically states that any co-operation under the MoU will be carried out in accordance with the respective national legislation of the Participants and international law and subject to common agreement.

However, as with the formulation of any policy, best practice and lessons learnt in other jurisdictions will always inform such policy formulation to ensure that it is robust, coherent and meets the needs of Ireland. </p>  <p>  The response to acts of terrorism within the borders of the EU falls outside the remit of the EUs Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP). This is an issue for the national security authorities of each member State and the EU does not deploy military assets under CSDP within the borders of the EU. </p>  <p>  Ireland joined the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council (EAPC) and Partnership for Peace (PfP) on 1 December 1999. The EAPC is a multi-lateral body, made up of the 28 members of NATO and the 24 members of PfP, for political and security-related dialogue and consultation between its members. The primary aim of our PfP participation is to enhance the Defence Forces' interoperability with other professional military forces for the purpose of engaging in UN authorised peacekeeping and peace support operations led by the UN, EU or NATO. Participation in PfP is fundamental to Ireland being able to meet its obligations in providing trained peacekeepers for international crisis management and peacekeeping operations mandated by the UN. Membership of PfP has allowed the Defence Forces to gain access to NATO standards &ndash; which are internationally-recognised as representing best practice for the development of military capabilities. </p>  <p>  The preparation of a new White Paper on Defence is a priority and drafting of the document is well underway.  A key part of the development of the White Paper is the consideration of potential challenges to our defence and security environment that may emerge into the future. As recent events have highlighted, the defence and security environment can be volatile and unpredictable.  In the course of deliberations on the White Paper the views of international organisations have been sought with a particular focus on likely future trends in international peace support operations.  This work will underpin recommendations regarding future defence provision. </p></reply>

All Member States are represented at these meetings. However, Denmark does not participate in the decision making process under its general opt-out on decisions with defence or military implications. In addition, EU organisations including the European External Action Service, the Council Secretariat, the European Commission, the European Defence Agency, the Chairman of the EU Military Staff and the Chairman of the EU Military Committee also attend.

As a result, the public service recruitment embargo had a limited impact on the Defence Force's recruitment processes.

General Service recruitment into the Defence Forces is a continuous process with the aim of attaining the agreed strength level of 9,500. </p>  <p>  Females make up 6.1% of the Permanent Defence Force strength. This figure has remained steady in recent years with the five year average also calculated at 6.1%.

It is the function of the State Competent Authority to ensure that entities such as TCSPs are compliant with anti-money laundering measures specified in legislation; this function is discharged through a compliance monitoring regime and the taking of measures that are reasonably necessary for the purpose of securing such compliance. To give effect to the role of the Competent Authority under the Act, the Anti-Money Laundering Compliance Unit was established in my Department on the enactment of the Act and Authorised Officers have been appointed under Section 72 of the Act.  Authorised Officers have wide-ranging powers under the Act to determine the position with regard to the compliance standing of entities authorised to carry on business as TCSPs.</p>  <p>  In the specific case referred to by the Deputy I can confirm that this entity was granted authorisation in 2012 for a period of 3 years with a request for a renewal of that authorisation currently pending.  During that 3 year period the entity was subject to an inspection by an Authorised Officer of the Anti-Money Laundering Compliance Unit in my Department.  The Officer was satisfied that the entity was fully compliant with the provisions of the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010 as amended by the Criminal Justice Act 2013.</p></reply>

The Courts Service has confirmed that the capacity of the courtrooms is limited and the facilities for court users are not satisfactory. The Courts Service has assured me that it is committed to providing improved court facilities in Roscommon town which is one of a small number of county towns where a new or refurbished courthouse remains to be provided.</p>  <p>  I am informed that, with the departure of Roscommon Council from the building later this year, the Courts Service has considered the potential for the development of the courthouse.  It is understood that the initial assessment is that the courthouse could be suitably redeveloped within the historic structure if the Courts Service had all of that building available to it along with some additional space adjoining it.  As the Deputy will appreciate, the cost of acquiring the additional space would be a major factor in deciding whether to redevelop the historic courthouse or to provide a new building on a new site. While the Courts Service currently does not have funding to undertake work in Roscommon, they have assured me that the development of courthouse facilities in Roscommon town is part of its plans for the future. </p></reply>

This new funding will support efforts by my Department and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to reduce youth crime.  There is &euro;2.8 million available to the Irish Youth Justice Service Community Programmes to support a number of proposals, including the establishment of ten new Garda Youth Diversion Projects (GYDPs) at additional locations around the country, an additional sixteen youth justice workers for existing GYDPs in areas with high levels of youth crime and the roll-out of mentoring supports for GYDPs participants and to assist Garda Juvenile Liaison Officers operating in areas without access to a GYDP. The locations for new projects and for the additional youth justice workers have been selected following a detailed examination by IYJS and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of national youth crime and population statistics, including a detailed analysis of youth crime by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Analysis Service. This examination took into account existing youth justice supports and identified the areas which have the most urgent need for additional crime reduction projects. My formal announcement of the locations selected will be made shortly, following the completion of some technical procedures linked to the Dormant Accounts Scheme.</p></reply>

I also committed to consider the family's request on the basis of information which they furnished to me.  The case at hand was one of those inquired into by the late Mr. Justice Henry Barron and examined subsequently by a sub-committee of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights.</p>  <p>  I have had a review of the material which the family provided to me and other available material regarding this murder carried out and I wrote to the family recently setting out my conclusion that I could not recommend the establishment of a Commission of Investigation in this case and detailing my reasoning in this regard.  I understand that the Deputy has a copy of the letter and is aware of the details.</p>  <p>  In summary, in the circumstances where an independent judicial inquiry had already been carried out which focused in great detail on the Garda investigation and found that it could not advance the issues to a conclusive outcome; where an Oireachtas committee had carried out an examination of these same issues, including public hearings, and found also that it could not conclusively address questions relating to the investigation; and where a public apology for identified failings in the investigation was made to the family by former Garda Commissioners and a former Justice Minister, I could not conclude that the issues relating to the Garda investigation could be addressed any more conclusively now than they have been already.</p>  <p>  I would note in addition that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na carried out a full review of the original investigation and the original evidence and submitted a file to the Director of Public Prosecutions who directed that no prosecution should be brought.</p>  <p>  I regret that my decision in this case is, inevitably, a disappointment for the family.  There can be no doubt that the brutal murder of this innocent man by a gunman caused untold grief to his family and friends, and I convey my sympathy once again to them on their loss.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that dealing with the legacy of the troubles on this island is difficult.  The Stormont House Agreement sets out a series of useful measures to put in place an overarching framework to deal with the past.  The Government is fully committed to playing its part in implementing those measures and I hope they may provide an opportunity for the families of persons killed during the troubles to access further information.  </p></reply>

There is a constitutional presumption in favour of bail because, in the eyes of the law, a person is innocent until proven guilty.  The provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights also restrict the extent to which the right to bail can be limited.</p>  <p>  Prior to the Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution, bail could be refused essentially only on the grounds that the accused person would be likely to abscond or interfere with witnesses or evidence.  Section 2 of the Bail Act 1997, which gave effect to the Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution, permits the courts to refuse bail to a person charged with a serious offence where refusal of bail is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person.  A &ldquo;serious offence&rdquo; is an offence listed in the Schedule to the Bail Act that is punishable by at least five years imprisonment.  </p>  <p>  Section 11 of the Criminal Justice 1984 as amended by section 22 of the Criminal Justice Act 2007 provides that any sentence of imprisonment for an offence committed while on bail shall be consecutive but if imposed in the District Court the aggregate term of imprisonment shall not exceed two years.</p>  <p>  As regards reform of the bail laws, I can inform the Deputy that the drafting of the General Scheme of a Bail Bill to modernise the law on bail is at an advanced stage in my Department.  I intend to bring proposals to Government on the matter in the near future.</p>  <p>  I am conscious of public concern about the extent to which offences are committed by persons on bail.  I share that concern and believe that bail law must be continually reviewed to ensure that all possible avenues are taken to protect the public against the commission of crime, particularly serious crime, by persons on bail.  While the primary aim of the proposed Bail Bill is to consolidate and update bail law, I am taking the opportunity in this legislation to seek, as far as is possible, within the constraints of the Constitution and the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights, to restructure the law so that it has a focus on the protection of the individual and of the public.  The intention is that the new proposals will provide better guidance to the courts on how such protection might be provided.</p></reply>

There has been no reduction in services available to prisoners and in fact the spend on Prisoner Related Variable Costs increased over the same period. The decrease in costs actually resulted from a combination of a reduced overall expenditure bill and an increase in the provision of available bed spaces.</p>  <p>  This period saw an addition of 815 available staffed spaces due to an general increase to the prison estate, for example, the building of new wings at Wheatfield and Midlands Prisons. Overall expenditure fell by &euro;44.71 million during these years largely because payroll costs decreased by  &euro;40.14 million. This was on foot of the introduction of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest.</p>  <p>  Between 2008 - 2013, the spend on Prisoner Related Variable costs increased from &euro;22.98 million annually in 2008 to &euro;25.76 million annually in 2013, an increase of &euro;2.78 million. Examples of Prisoner Related Variable costs include catering, healthcare, prisoner gratuities, work training, clothing, educational materials and recreational facilities.</p></reply>

Prison education includes a core element of basic education incorporating reading, writing, numeracy and IT literacy. The aim of the Education Service is to deliver a high quality, broad, flexible programme of education that helps prisoners cope with their sentence, achieve personal development, prepare for life after release and establish an appetite and capacity for life-long learning. Programmes   are adapted to take account of the diversity of the prisoner population and the complex nature of prison life, including segregation requirements and high levels of prisoner turnover.</p>  <p>  Educational services are available at all institutions and are provided in partnership with the Education and Training Board  s (ETBs) and a range of other educational agencies.  The Department of Education and Skills provides an allocation of whole-time teacher equivalents to the prisons through the ETBs (220 in the academic year 2015/16).  Organisations who provide in-reach education roles include Open University, the Samaritans, the Red Cross, Grow, Toe by Toe, Writers and Artists in prison etc. Other courses run through the education centres include pre-release programmes, parenting, hairdressing, Alternatives to Violence etc.</p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that in January 2015, the latest month for which figures are available, 46.1% of the total prisoner population attended education classes during this time. </p>  <p>  The Irish Prison Service has also been expanding the number of accredited courses and opportunities available to prisoners in Work Training in recent years. Enhanced partnership arrangements with accrediting bodies such as City and Guilds, the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA), and the Guild of Launders and Cleaners and the centralising of coordination and quality assurance arrangements have enabled us to extend the number of available courses and activities with certification.</p>  <p>  Prisoners involved in work and training activities may do so with a view to gaining accreditation in a particular area or in order to keep busy during their sentence. Engagement in vocational training can have added benefits in the form of boosting self-confidence, imparting useful practical skills and improving social skills. On any given day, prisoners work in areas such as the laundry, kitchens, horticultural or gardening, industrial cleaning, waste management and picture framing shops where the labour they provide can be of benefit to the effective running of the prison and for which they may or may not receive accreditation.</p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that in January 2015, the latest month for which figures are available for prisoner participation in work and training (accredited and non-accredited), 30% of the total prisoner population attended workshop sessions.</p>  <p>  The restriction of a prisoner's regime can occur due to a number of factors including, the protection of vulnerable prisoners.  This is provided for under Rule 63 of the Prison Rules 2007.  A prisoner may, either at his/her own request or when the Governor considers it necessary, in so far as is practicable and subject to the maintenance and good order and safe and secure custody, be kept separate from other prisoners who are reasonably likely to cause significant harm to him/her.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Governor may decide, for the maintenance of good order in the prison, to remove a prisoner from general association or structured activity to reduce the negative effect that a prisoner or prisoners may have on the general population.  This is provided for under Rule 62 of the Prison Rules 2007.  There may also be a smaller number of prisoners who would be restricted for medical (Rule 64) or discipline reasons (Rule 67).</p>  <p>  The fact that prisoners seeking protection are immediately separated from the general population or from specific prisoners identified as presenting a threat, clearly demonstrates the commitment of the Irish Prison Service to ensure their safety and security.  The status of each prisoner on restricted regime within the prison system is regularly reviewed.  If possible, prisoners can be transferred to other institutions where a restricted regime would not be necessary.</p>  <p>  Education is available to prisoners seeking protection in all Dublin prisons with the exception of Cloverhill prison. Protection prisoners in Cloverhill had access to education from 2007/08 to 2012/13 academic year for 6.25 hours weekly. To facilitate this non-protection prisoners did not have access to education at those times. In those five years the numbers of prisoners on protection who availed of education was less that 5% of the numbers on protection at those times. In the academic year 2013 - 2014 a decision was taken to revert access times for protection prisoners only back to non protection prisoners so that already limited resources could be used more effectively and efficiently.</p>  <p>  Access to training for prisoners seeking protection is only available in Mountjoy and Cloverhill.  Access in Cloverhill is limited to the computer workshop.</p></reply>

All such Organisations aim to offer a service to offenders who would otherwise not be in a position to avail of a mainstream service opportunity.  </p>  <p>  Since 2008, the Probation Service has agreed a range of reductions in grant allocations to these organisations.  This was undertaken to ensure value for money and the need to reduce public expenditure generally in light of the economic difficulties then facing the State.  Despite the overall reduction in public funds, the community organisations were able to maintain the level of services by streamlining their cost structure.  Indeed, funding was also set aside within the funding allocations in both 2014 and 2015 for new developments and the expansion of some existing services.</p>  <p>  The Irish Prison Service and the Probation Service work closely through their joint strategy to provide community support schemes.  Community support is now operational in Dublin, Cork, and Limerick and includes all female offenders in this category.  In 2014, Care After Prison, which is in receipt of funding from the Irish Prison Service and employs ex-offenders as support workers, was able to extend the community support scheme in Dublin.  These programmes are aimed at prisoners who are serving sentences of between 3 and 12 months. </p>  <p>  I might add that rehabilitation and reintegration are at the centre of our penal policy and are significant factors in reducing crime and offending behaviour. The Community Return Scheme is considered to be a most effective support model to reduce recidivism rates for those prisoners with longer sentences.</p></reply>

On foot of that meeting, the group noted that both parties affirmed their commitment to the agreement they reached in the Haddington Road Agreement (Appendix 1) to secure savings of &euro;12.42 million, and to work together with the priority of delivering measures which will secure those savings. In addition, the group requested that all parties should take all steps necessary to maintain industrial peace and normal working until all procedures on the matters under discussion have been exhausted.</p>  <p>  In this context, I wish to advise the Deputy that both IPS management and the Prison Officers Association both accepted an invitation to attend talks at the Labour Relations Commission and these talks are currently ongoing. As a consequence, the Prison Officers Association have advised that they have suspended their intention to commence a 'Work to Rule' scheduled to begin on 26 March 2015.</p>  <p>  I believe that constructive engagement between the parties is the way forward and I would strongly urge the Prison Officer's Association to continue to work in a collaborative manner within the industrial relations machinery to resolve any issues of dispute in order to ensure that the Service continues to deliver on its mission of providing safe and secure custody, dignity of care and rehabilitation to prisoners for safer communities.</p>  <p>  I am advised by my officials that a high level Contingency Group within the IPS continues to formulate contingencies in the event of all-out industrial action. The Deputy will appreciate that for obvious security reasons I cannot go into detail as to what those contingencies might entail, however I can confirm that talks between my officials and senior management in both an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Permanent Defence Forces are ongoing in order to ensure that the security of the prison estate is maintained in the event of industrial action.</p>  <p>  Finally, I can further advise the Deputy that training of relevant staff in an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces has commenced and is ongoing, including familiarisation visits to prisons and also training in prison process and procedures and security matters.</p></reply>

The specific policing strategies which are deployed in relation to these of types of crimes are of course a matter for the Garda Commissioner to determine. In this regard I am advised that local Garda management closely monitor the incidence of burglary and related property crimes in the area in question and put appropriate policing responses in place </p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is responding to the incidence of burglary in the Dublin area through Operation Acer, which is in force throughout the Dublin Metropolitan Region. This includes a particular focus on identifying and targeting criminal groups involved in this criminality. Burglary Response Units attached to each Division take the lead in Operation Acer and are assisted by other units as required. In addition, a further and related operation, Operation Creeper, assists in the surveillance of Acer targets by monitoring their movements and this Operation has been tasked solely with targeting burglary suspects which has resulted in the successful arrests of Acer targets. These Operations are all coordinated under Operation Fiacla, which is the national operation targeting burglary using an intelligence and analysis-led approach.   </p>  <p>  Since Operation Acer commenced in early 2012, I am advised that there has been 5,389 arrests, 2,746 charges and 1,087 convictions for burglary in the Dublin area, up to 3 February 2015.</p>  <p>  I can also advise the Deputy that in addition to these policing responses, I am currently carrying out a broader and urgent review of the criminal justice system's response to the problem of burglaries.  In this regard I am working closely with the Garda Commissioner and other relevant criminal justice agencies to ensure that an effective, whole of system response is in place in relation to burglary. This includes a focus on interagency measures in relation to the management of prolific offenders, visible policing, crime prevention support for communities, and an examination of legislative issues.  Burglary is a persistent and highly damaging crime, and I am committed to tackling it on a number of fronts, and through a partnership approach between criminal justice agencies and the community. </p>  <p>  I have requested a report from the Garda authorities in relation to incidents occurring in the area referred to by the Deputy and I will contact him directly as soon as the report is to hand.</p></reply>

However, before the Bill could be taken at Report Stage, a 2013 UK Court of Appeal judgment necessitated a review of the disclosure provisions in both the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 and the Spent Convictions Bill.  </p>  <p>  Pending the amendment of both the Spent Convictions Bill, and the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012, an Administrative Filter for Garda Vetting Disclosures has now been introduced. In accordance with the provisions of this filter over 80% of district court convictions now become spent after 7 years and are no longer  being disclosed in Garda Vetting Disclosures. It is proposed to amend the Bill to mirror the provisions contained in the administrative filter and have a common standard for minor convictions becoming spent after 7 years. Under the current provisions of the Bill a circuit court conviction which results in a penalty of up to 12 months imprisonment could become spent. It is proposed to retain a provision in the Bill which will allow one such circuit court conviction to become spent after 7 years.</p>  <p>  The amendments to the Bill are being finalised at present and I intend to bring these  before the Oireachtas as soon as possible in order that the Bill will be enacted before the summer.</p></reply>

There are currently approximately 4,300 asylum seekers in 34 centres around the State. </p>  <p>  Aside from full board accommodation services provided by RIA, services to residents of direct provision centres are main streamed i.e. they receive a range of State services - education, health, community welfare supports and so on - in the same way as the general population.</p>  <p>  Given the main streamed nature of health care provision, persons requiring medical treatment would be treated by the HSE in the same manner as a person living in the community. Whether the treatment arose from self harm or otherwise is a matter for determination by HSE. RIA has no role in the provision of health care and as such would not have any statistics of the nature sought.  As a general comment, RIA has not been informed by the HSE that there is an issue of concern surrounding self harm in accommodations centres.  It is also necessary to note that only one death of a resident in RIA centres since the inception of the direct provision system in 2000 can with certainty be said to be a suicide and that involved a newly arrived asylum seeker taking his own life in 2008 while in hospital.  </p></reply>

In enforcing the law in this respect, Ireland is no different from other countries who also remove individuals who have no lawful right to remain within their territory.<b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p><p>The legal provisions governing the refusal of permission to land are set-out in Section 4(3) of the Immigration Act, 2004.  This provision sets out the eleven grounds on which a non-national may be refused permission to enter or be in the State. A person who is refused such a permission is informed of the decision in writing. The written notice specifies the ground(s) on which the person was refused.</p><p>A person refused a permission to enter the State may be removed from the State. Removals are essentially operational matters for the Garda National Immigration Bureau who work closely with officials of my Department in arranging the necessary travel documents and other papers required. Section 5 of the Immigration Act, 2003 contains the main provisions dealing with the removal from the State of persons refused leave to land and specifies that a person to whom this section applies may be arrested by an immigration officer or a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and detained in a prescribed place of detention for the purpose of facilitating their removal from the State.  <i></i></p><p>It should be noted by virtue of Section 5(3) of the Immigration Act, 2003, the State has a positive duty to remove a person as soon as practicable. The detention of a person cannot exceed eight weeks in aggregate in accordance with the provisions of Section 5(3)(a) of the Immigration Act, 2003 which states &ldquo;  <i>A person arrested and detained under this section may, subject to subsection (4), be detained only until such time (being as soon as practicable) as he or she is removed from the State in accordance with this section but, in any event, may not be detained for a period exceeding 8 weeks in aggregate&rdquo;.</i></p><p>In general it is the practice to remove persons from the State on the next available flight or ship. In keeping with standard practice in other jurisdictions, some individuals are escorted to their country of origin or to a connecting hub. In the case of persons refused permission to enter the State at ports of entry, scheduled commercial aircraft and ferries are used to effect removals.</p><p>Persons may be refused permission to land in the State and subsequently permitted to enter the State in circumstances where they have made an application pursuant to the Refugee Act,1996. Where a person applies for Refugee status at a port of entry, section 8 of the Refugee Act, 1996 makes clear that the person  shall be interviewed by an immigration officer as soon as practicable after arrival and that he or she may apply to the Minister for a declaration of refugee status.  The immigration officer concerned is required to inform the person that he or she may apply for a declaration and that he or she is entitled to consult a solicitor and the representative in Ireland of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. The interview undertaken by the immigration officer shall, where necessary and possible, be conducted with the assistance of an interpreter and a record of the interview is kept by the immigration officer conducting the interview and a copy given to the person making the application, the Irish based representative of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and the Refugee Applications Commissioner. The Minister having considered the relevant provisions of the Refugee Act, 1996 will formally refer such applications to the Refugee Applications Commissioner for determination.</p></reply>

Ireland, like other EU member states, uses deportation of illegal immigrants and failed asylum seekers as the policy of last resort. The process leading to a deportation is extensive with many avenues of appeal, including judicial review in the High Court, open to persons subject to Deportation Orders. It should also be noted that a Deportation Order requires a person to remove themselves from the State and it is only where they fail to do so that the State is forced to remove them and enforce the rule of law. </p>  <p>  I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service of my Department that it will not be possible to provide the statistics in the manner requested by the Deputy. Attempting to provide this information would mean matching and cross-matching a large number of data sources in such a way that the veracity and reliability of the resulting statistics could not be guaranteed. In addition, carrying out such an exercise would have a significant impact on the ability of a number of processing units to carry out their day to day work and would divert resources away from the processing of individual cases, which is my priority.</p></reply>

While it is in the nature of it difficult to assess the scale of such illegal acts, it is well known that the Provisional IRA was styled along military lines and that it sought to exercise authority and control over its members and, indeed, over communities by a variety of means.  It is also well known that it exercised extra-judicial punishments, including by the use of intimidation and violence, up to and including killing.</p>  <p>  I am sure the Deputy will agree that there is not now nor has there ever been a justification for the types of illegal activity that the Provisional IRA engaged in over the course of its campaign of violence.  No such group has the right to place itself in the role of judge, jury and executioner, above and beyond the law.  There is and there can be only one justice system in this State and that is the one set out in the Constitution and provided for in law.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately, despite the great progress that has been made in securing peace in Northern Ireland since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement, there remain so-called 'dissident' groups who reject peace and who continue to use crime and violence to achieve their aims.  The Garda Authorities are alert to the possibility of persons or organisations taking actions in respect of victims of crime that may constitute offences and any activities of this nature that come to light will be investigated fully.  The Garda authorities continue to work to disrupt and counteract the activities of those paramilitary groups who still pose a real threat on this island.  In doing so the Garda&iacute; co-operate very closely with their counterparts in Northern Ireland on an ongoing basis.</p></reply>

The report of this Working Group was published on 13 November 2014 and submissions on the report were sought from stakeholders and the public by 31 January 2015. The consultation process gave individuals and groups an opportunity to contribute to the development of firearms policy and legislation and will enable consideration to be given to the future direction of such legislation.</p>  <p>  The submissions received are currently being examined and incorporated into a report for me.

This presents opportunities to streamline both registration and visa re-entry services and INIS will be introducing on-line services as part of this process. In relation to the processing of applications for re-entry visas for long-term residents who are visa-required, I am informed that development work on an on-line appointments system is at an advanced stage and it is planned to have the system operational in the coming weeks in time for the summer peak demand period.<b><font color="#000080">  </font></b>In common with the re-entry system, the immigration service is also planning to introduce an on-line booking system for appointments as part of the plan to transfer the registration function from the Garda National Immigration Bureau to INIS.  </p><p>In the case of the registration process, and as occurs in the operation of immigration functions in other States, immigrants seeking to register are required to present in person at the offices of the Minister. This is necessary for establishment of identity and as an anti-fraud measure. Accordingly, systems will be developed that meet the needs of our customers while at the same time maintaining appropriate checks and balances within the system. </p><p>I should point out that within existing arrangements every effort is made to provide a customer friendly service. The GNIB Public Office is open from 8am to 9pm each Monday to Thursday and 8am to 6pm each Friday (excluding bank holidays). The Offices also remains open through lunchtime.  Priority is given in the early morning period for particular categories including those coming here to work or conduct business with tickets for persons registering their presence in Ireland for study related purposes being allocated after 9am (special arrangements are in place for students during the period September &ndash; Mid November to cover the return to studies period). This is to minimise the amount of time persons at work are required to be away from their jobs. It is worth noting that the public immigration offices receive in the region of 130,000 persons annually making it one of the busiest public offices in the State. </p></reply>

It is an offence under the Official Secrets Act 1963 for a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as for any public official, to disclose official information without lawful authority.  It is also, quite separately, a distinct offence under section 62 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 for a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to make an unauthorised disclose of information obtained in the course of duty if the member knows that such disclosure is likely to have a harmful effect.  The section  sets out a list of instances of harmful effect covered by this offence, which includes for example disclosures which result in the publication of personal information constituting an unwarranted and serious infringement of a person's right to privacy.  The penalty for such an offence, upon conviction on indictment, is a term of imprisonment for up to 5 years and/or a maximum fine of &euro;50,000.</p>  <p>  Any member of the public who believes that he or she has been the subject of unauthorised disclosure of information by a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may make a complaint to the independent Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, which has extensive powers of investigation. </p></reply>

The services being provided are precisely those recommended by Judge Quirke.</p>  <p>  Judge Quirke made no comment, one way or another, on 'Complementary therapies'. Complementary and alternative medicine includes a group of diverse medical and healthcare systems, practices and products that are not generally considered part of conventional medicine, and they are not part of the routine system of provision in the public health system.  In the absence of clear evidence on the efficacy or safety of these treatments, my colleague, the Minister for Health, has reservations about such therapies being provided and funded through the health service and, for that reason, they were not included in the Bill.</p>  <p>  On a personal level, I am open to the benefits that may be brought to people by such 'complementary therapies'.  For that reason, I have asked my officials to look at the question of providing some funding to the women concerned so that they may avail of such 'Complementary therapies'.  This would be a separate scheme run on an administrative rather than a statutory basis.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will also be aware, the provision of medical services is just one of a wider package of supports for these women.  The women also receive lump sum payments of between &euro;11,500 and &euro;100,000 depending on their length of stay in a relevant institution.  So far, 512 women have received their lump sums payments at a cost of over &euro;18.7m.  The women also receive top up pension type payments from the Department of Social Protection.</p></reply>

As the Deputy will be aware a Dedicated Unit was set up in my Department to process applications and to make lump sum payments.  Officials in the Dedicated Unit also provide assistance and advice to the applicants on any aspect of the Scheme in a helpful and sensitive manner.</p>  <p>  Priority has been given to processing applications, providing cash payments and other benefits to the women.  To date, a decision has been made on 88% of the applications received and 512 women have been paid their lump sums at a cost of over &euro;18.7m.</p>  <p>  The women are also receiving top up pension type payments which are being paid by the Department of Social Protection.

I understand that once the Bill is commenced, there will also be designated contact people in the HSE to advise the women concerned.</p>  <p>  With regard to advocacy, it is important to point out that Judge Quirke makes a very clear distinction between what is required for most women and what is required for those lacking full mental capacity including those women that are in institutional settings.</p>  <p>  I can advise the Deputy that women who were in the Magdalen laundries are already covered under section 21 of the Nursing Home Support Scheme Act 2009 which makes provision for persons to act as care representatives in respect of any person applying for support under that Act.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Bill 2014 is awaiting committee stage in the D&aacute;il.  This provides for a range of options including decision making assistants, co-decision makers, decision making representatives and the public guardian, which are well suited to look after the best interests of the women who were in Magdalen laundries and have capacity issues.</p>  <p>  My Department is looking at options with regard to the provision of advocacy and my officials are  currently in discussion with the Citizens Information Board and will have further discussions with the Department of Social Protection on this issue.  The advocacy services provided by the National Advocacy Service of the Citizens Information Board is provided for in the Citizen's Information Act 2007.  It is important to note that a personal advocate has very limited powers with regard to a person who lacks capacity.  A personal advocate does not have power of attorney, to make decision or otherwise to manage the affairs of the person.  That is why the provisions of Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Bill 2014 will be so important.</p>  <p>  My officials are careful to ensure that applicants do have the necessary capacity to understand the scheme and sign the relevant legal documentation and they cross check with other Departments to establish if there any issues.  A medical assessment is sought if there is any indication that an applicant under our scheme has capacity issues. We have identified about 40 such women to date and are delaying payment until proper safeguards are in place.</p>  <p>  With regard to women who do not lack capacity, the Government has provided a grant to the Irish Women Survivors Support Network to provide advice and support to the women who are residing in the UK.  My officials will be looking at how to develop the idea of an ongoing dedicated unit to assist the women and advocate on their behalf now that the dedicated unit in my Department has almost completed its primary task of processing applications and paying out cash benefits.  I do not see my Department carrying out this role.</p></reply>

The legislation will put in place a comprehensive regulatory framework that will cover all forms of gambling and afford the greatest protections to those that need it most.</p>  <p>  However, it also needs to be recognised that gambling forms part of the daily life of many Irish people.  The approach that will be taken in the legislation will be to identify the activities that are currently available and to regulate them accordingly.</p>  <p>  The Bill will, upon its enactment, repeal existing betting and gaming legislation.  The new legislation will cover both under the term &ldquo;gambling&rdquo;, and will deal with both on-line and terrestrial versions.  While not explicitly provided for in the General Scheme, it is the Government's position that the activities of the Tote will be covered under the published Bill.</p></reply>

These Inspectors act as a direct point of contact for any individuals (or for representatives acting on their behalf) in responding to intimidation being reported.

This new Plan seeks to build on progress made to date in this area and address issues raised in independent international evaluations of Ireland's response to this important issue.</p><p>The new National Action Plan will outline both the Government's strategic approach to this issue as well as setting out a clear work programme for the relevant state authorities to collaborate with civil society in advancing the fight against trafficking and enhancing the protection of victims. Among the key priorities of Ireland's Anti-Trafficking Strategy are to:</p><p>-  Prevent trafficking in human beings,</p><p>-  Identify, assist and protect victims of trafficking in human beings,</p><p>-  Ensure an effective criminal justice response,</p><p>-  Ensure effective co-ordination and co-operation between key actors, both nationally and internationally,</p><p>-  Increase the level of knowledge of emerging trends in the trafficking of human beings, and</p><p>-  Continue to ensure an effective response to child trafficking.</p><p>These key priorities will be reflected in the new Plan and the approach to its implementation will, first and foremost, be victim-centred.  Allied to that will be the aim of ensuring an effective criminal justice response to the perpetrators of this evil crime. The partnership structure, which was put in place under the first National Action Plan, will continue to be supported.</p><p>I have, since my appointment as Minister for Justice &amp;amp; Equality, met with a number of stakeholders, including civil society organisations, to discuss the issue of human trafficking and have received submissions in relation to their views on the matter which will be further considered in the formal consultation process which will be commenced with the issuing of the draft Plan. This consultation process will encompass both an invitation for comment as well as formal meetings with key stakeholder groups through standing working group structures.</p><p>The drafting of the new National Action Plan provides an opportunity to address in detail the full range of support and protection policies in place; the issue of independent oversight in this area will also be considered in this context.</p></reply>

The second is the more serious offence of purchasing a sexual service from a trafficked person and carries a potential penalty of up to 5 years imprisonment and/or a fine.  In both cases, the person selling the sexual service will not be subject to an offence.</p>  <p>  These new offences are comparable to those introduced in section 15 of the Human Trafficking and Exploitation (Criminal Justice and Support for Victims) Act (Northern Ireland) 2015 which the Deputy correctly states will come into force on 1 June.</p>  <p>  As an additional means of combating the exploitation which is associated with prostitution, these offences will target the demand side of prostitution.  However, there is already significant legislative provisions addressing the trafficking of persons for the purposes of exploitation (including sexual exploitation) which can attract significant penalties.  I would draw the Deputy's attention to the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008 which prohibits trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation.  Any person found guilty of such an offence shall be liable to imprisonment for life or a lesser term, and at the discretion of the court, to a fine.  It is also an offence for a person to solicit or importune a trafficked person for the purposes of prostitution with a potential penalty of imprisonment for up to 5 years and/or a fine.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that there are also extensive legislative provisions to address the more exploitative aspects of prostitution.  For example, under the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 it is an offence to organise prostitution, coerce or compel a person to be a prostitute, to knowingly live on the earnings of a prostitute, or to keep or manage a brothel.  In addition, public order legislation prohibits the advertising of brothels and prostitution.</p>  <p>  Taken as a whole, the existing and new offences that I am introducing in the forthcoming Bill, will achieve a comprehensive approach to combatting trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation.</p>  <p>  The Bill is priority legislation and is currently being drafted.  It is my intention to publish the Bill in the current parliamentary session.</p></reply>

The aim is to seek to effectively eliminate, in so far as is possible the need for a judge to commit anyone to prison for the non-payment of a fine.  As well as introducing an option for persons to pay by instalment, there are also changes in the way in which those who fail to pay fines are dealt with, with a range of options available to judges which are recovery orders, attachment to earnings and community service.  Such change has implications for agencies across the Justice sector, including the Courts and the Courts Service, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Probation Service and the Irish Prison Service.  Changes of the scale proposed in the Fines (Payments and Recovery) Act 2014 require a major overhaul of IT systems and of administrative systems.</p>  <p>  Work is ongoing in preparing for the implementation of the Act.  The area most directly affected by the changes is the Courts and the Courts Service is working on a number of developments which will ensure that the implementation of the legislation, and the new procedures which will operate under it, are as efficient as possible.</p>  <p>  This has required work to upgrade the IT systems to ensure that the instalment payment system operates effectively and that the necessary accounting procedures are in place for the recording of payments. Changes are also required in the way that information is transferred between the Courts Service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to ensure that both organisations have fully up to date information on the cases and their current status.</p>  <p>  Good progress is being made in the preparatory work.  All aspects of the recovery of fines are being outsourced to an external provider and the procurement process is nearing conclusion.  The successful tender has been decided upon and the contract will be signed shortly.  It is important that preparations are done correctly to ensure that the significant changes being implemented in the fines system as a result of the legislation are implemented smoothly and effectively from the start.  It is envisaged that preparations will be completed in the 3rd quarter of 2015.</p></reply>

Full vetting checks are conducted by the Garda Central Vetting Unit (GCVU) for each new vetting application received to ensure that the most recent data available is taken into account.</p>  <p>  The current procedures for Garda vetting ensure the integrity of the system.  This is because once there has been any significant lapse of time between one employment and another, the original Garda Vetting Disclosure would not include information regarding any recent criminal convictions, and the second employer could not safely rely on it.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, under the Data Protection Acts, any sensitive personal data which employers use in regard to their employees must be current, accurate and up-to-date and employers would be exposed to civil liability if they knowingly recruited staff based on out-of-date criminal records information where the person in fact had a more recent criminal conviction.  Effectively, the non-transferability and contemporaneous nature of the current process protects against the risk of fraud or forgery and is a guarantee of the integrity of the vetting service and such procedures are in line with best practice internationally.</p>  <p>  There are, however, certain limited circumstances where organisations can share a single vetting disclosure where this is agreed to by the vetting applicant.  For example, persons involved in voluntary work may be doing work with more than one voluntary organisation at the same time, and may agree with the vetting applicant to share a single vetting disclosure.  Similar arrangements arise in the health sector in regard to persons working as locums, agency nurses or other temporary employees in a number of different organisations, or in the education sector where substitute teachers are on panels for substitute teaching in more than one school.</p>  <p>  Finally, the current average processing time for vetting applications is four weeks.  Any vetting process will take a certain minimum amount of time to complete and, taking into account  the need to protect children and vulnerable adults while providing an effective and efficient service, I do not think that this time period is unreasonable.</p></reply>

This principle is also to be applied in a non-discriminatory manner in accordance with their obligations under the European Convention of Human Rights.  In carrying out their duties, members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na shall, as far as practicable and in so far as the circumstances dictate, consider non-physical means prior to resorting to the use of force.</p><p>A detailed manual on Garda policy and procedures in relation to the use of incapacitant spray can be viewed on the Garda website (<i>www.garda.ie/Documents/User/Incapacitant%20Spray%20-%20Policy%20and%20Procedures.pdf</i>). The manual sets out the detailed considerations which must always be taken into account by a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na before using incapacitant spray.  Any use of incapacitant spray, as with any use of force in general, must be in accordance with law, in particular the law on the use of force set out in the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997.  In effect, the use of incapacitant spray must be  necessary and must be reasonable in the circumstances.</p><p>Garda members are trained in the lawful use of incapacitant spray and, as the manual makes clear, are individually responsible and answerable for their actions in its use.  It is also the case that every incident where incapacitant spray is deployed is notified to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, which can investigate any question of misuse.</p><p>I believe, therefore, that comprehensive policy and procedures in relation to the use of incapacitant spray, and appropriate safeguards to ensure compliance with those standards, are in place within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></reply>

The Bill provides for the replacement of the adult Wards of Court system with a less intrusive system which offers a continuum of options to support people in maximising their decision-making capability.  Its enactment will be a key step forward in enabling Ireland to ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD).</p>  <p>  My Department is currently preparing amendments for the D&aacute;il Committee Stage of the Bill to respond to issues raised in submissions to my Department and to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality.  The aim is to strengthen the safeguards contained in this legislation so that persons with capacity difficulties can exercise decision-making autonomy to the greatest extent possible.  My aim is that the Bill will be enacted this year.</p>  <p>  Jurisdiction in Wards of Court matters is vested in the High Court.  The Courts are, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions and, therefore, it is not open to me as Minister to comment in any way.  Section 4(3) of the Courts Service Act 1998 provides that the Courts Service is independent in the performance of its functions, which are specified in section 5 and includes the management of the Courts.  Court funds which are held for the benefit of Wards of Court are private funds under the control of the High Court and managed by the Courts Service on behalf of the Court.</p></reply>

It is not the case that there has been no follow up and in fact the National Disability Authority (NDA) facilitated consultations with the Deaf Community in Ireland at my Department's request in relation to actions that could make improvements in the lives of deaf people.  Submissions received as part of that process informed the National Disability Strategy Implementation Plan which was published in July 2013.</p>  <p>  As part of the follow-up to that initiative, the first special themed meeting of the National Disability Strategy Implementation Group (NDSIG) focussed on the issue of Irish Sign Language on 28 November 2013 to which the Deputy refers. This meeting brought together representatives of relevant Departments, the NDA, the Deaf Community and other relevant stakeholders with a view to further progressing the inclusion of actions for the Strategy in this regard.</p>  <p>  The meeting reviewed the current situation across Government Departments and their Agencies with regard to promoting recognition of Irish Sign Language, including in service provision, and provided the Deaf Community with the opportunity of presenting their experience of interaction with the Public Sector.  It also provided a useful opportunity to examine mechanisms which could promote the further use and recognition of Irish Sign Language and understand practical implications for service users.  Further to this meeting, the Deaf Community prepared a report to reflect their views on key actions and priorities. This report was submitted to my predecessor for consideration in May 2014 and was then circulated to Departments in November 2014 for their observations. The intention now is that the recommendations from this report will be reflected as appropriate in the next Implementation Plan to take effect as from 1 January 2016, through the incorporation of new actions and related performance indicators and timelines.  Progress on all relevant actions will then be monitored as part of the Implementation Plan monitoring process.  The focus therefore remains on the identification of mechanisms for the further promotion and recognition of Irish Sign Language with a view to promoting and supporting its use, thereby improving service delivery on the ground.</p></reply>

Moreover, Part 8 (Chapter 1) of the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009 has updated the law concerning the acquisition of easements, including rights of way, based on earlier recommendations of the Law Reform Commission. Section 35 of the 2009 Act, which entered into operation on 1 December 2009, contains specific provisions in respect of easements acquired by prescription, i.e. acquired on the basis of long enjoyment of the easement concerned. It originally provided that such an easement would be acquired at law only on registration in the Land Registry or the Registry of Deeds of a court order under that section.</p><p>  Parts 12 and 13 of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011 contain amendments to the 2009 Act and the Registration of Title Act 1964 which simplify the procedures for acquiring easements based on prescription. These amendments permit the Property Registration Authority to register such easements without a court order under section 35 of the 2009 Act where the Authority is satisfied that there is an entitlement to it. However, where the Authority is not satisfied that there is such an entitlement, e.g. where there is disagreement as to its existence between the parties concerned, a court order under section 35 of the 2009 will continue to be required. This is similar to the procedure which applies in respect of applications for registration of title based on adverse possession of the land. </p><p>  The updated rules applicable to the new arrangements are set out in the Land Registration Rules which are available on the Authority's web site (<i>www.prai.ie</i>).</p></reply>

The non-enforceable relationship between the original parties is preserved by use of the term &quot;subject to contract&quot;.</p><p>The problems associated with gazumping were examined in detail by the Law Reform Commission in its 1999 &quot;Report on Gazumping&quot; (LRC 59-1999). The Commission noted that delays arising between the conclusion of negotiations and completion of the formal contract were usually for the benefit of the intending purchaser, e.g. to ensure the availability of funding for that property, or to ascertain if there were any legal difficulties in relation to the title. The Commission concluded that the only practicable reforms were to improve the information available to intending purchasers and to regulate the terms according to which booking deposits are paid and accepted. It did not recommend any specific legislative reforms to the legal framework within which gazumping occurs.</p><p>The issue was subsequently considered by the Auctioneering/Estate Agency Review Group in its 2005 Report to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The Review Group noted that intending vendors retain the right to raise or lower their asking price or to withdraw their property from sale, and purchasers can also reduce their offers or withdraw from an intended purchase at any time before the contracts are signed by both parties. The Group endorsed the conclusion of the  Law Reform Commission that &quot;the only practicable reforms are to take steps to inform buyers and, in that way, to protect them&quot;.</p><p>The Property Services Regulatory Authority, which has been established under the Property Services (Regulation) Act 2011, has published a detailed &ldquo;Guide for Users of Property Services Providers in Ireland&quot; which explains the legal position in relation to gazumping and related matters such as payment of deposits and signing of contracts. The Guide is available on the Authority's web site (<i>www.psr.ie</i>).</p></reply>

Section 116  of the 2009 Act provides that a creditor who has obtained a judgment against a person may apply to the Property Registration Authority to register a judgment mortgage against that person's estate or interest in land. The effect of registration of a judgment mortgage is to charge the judgment debtor's estate of interest in the land with the judgment debt and entitles the judgment mortgagee to apply to court for a well-charging order or other order for enforcement of the judgment mortgage.</p>  <p>  While there is no requirement to re-register a judgment mortgage in order to maintain its validity or enforceability against the land or a purchaser of the land, the application of relevant provisions in the Statute of Limitations 1957 means that court proceedings may not be commenced following expiry of a limitation period of twelve years from the date on which the right of action accrued. In the case of a judgment mortgage, the right of action accrues from the date on which the judgment becomes enforceable and not the date on which it is registered as a judgment mortgage. As regards a reduction in the current limitation period, the risk is that any such reduction might simply trigger earlier commencement of court proceedings since the commencement of such proceedings operates to suspend application of limitation periods under the Statute of Limitations. While I have no current plans to amend the law in this area, the matter is being kept under review by my Department.</p></reply>

This was one of the actions agreed by Government as a response to the Guerin report.  A panel consisting of two Senior and five Junior Counsel, all selected on the basis of their experience of the criminal justice system, was established for the purpose.</p>  <p>  The independent review is now underway, and is currently examining 318 cases which have been referred to them.  The volume and complexity of cases has led to the review taking somewhat longer than originally anticipated, but it is important that counsel take the time necessary to consider each case fully and carefully.  Counsel are making every effort to conclude their work as soon as reasonably practicable.</p>  <p>  Counsel have been asked to make a recommendation to me on what action, if any, might be appropriate in each case. It is open to the review mechanism to make recommendations as they see fit in relation to each case. In making a recommendation they would, however, have to take account of the doctrine of the separation of powers which prevents me, as a Minister of the Government, from intervening in a matter which is either before the Courts, whether criminal or civil, or which has been the subject of a decision by the Courts.</p></reply>

Prior to this, the HSE had statutory responsibility for this service. These concerns can either relate to a child's welfare or where there is a concern of child abuse, that is, physical abuse, emotional abuse, sexual abuse or neglect, As the Deputy may be aware the respective roles of State agencies in the area of child protection are set out in Children First: National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children.  I am not aware of specific cases the Deputy may have in mind.  I have asked the Agency to comment and I will revert to the Deputy at that time.</p>  <p>  Reporting a child abuse concern should, whether it is ongoing or historical, be reported to the Child  and Family Agency and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in line with the Children First Guidance.  Under Section 3.6 of the Children First (2011) guidelines, when a retrospective disclosure of abuse is made, an assessment must be taken to ensure there is no current risk to any child that may be in contact with the alleged abuser. Should risk be identified, the information should be passed to the Agency immediately who will work with other agencies, including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, for investigative purposes. </p>  <p>  While child protection and welfare services of the HSE were transferred to the Child and Family Agency on 1 January 2014, other services for children and adolescents remain with providers such as the HSE, including disability services and the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS).  As the Agency carries out its child protection functions, the onus remains on the service provider to ensure that adequate safeguards are in place and to examine its own role in respect of abuse disclosures.  The HSE, as a service provider, could be expected to carry out investigations into its service provision, separate from those of the Agency or An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></reply>

My Department has been working closely with the DSP to streamline the implementation of a number of labour activation measures which support parents returning to the work force or availing of education or training opportunities.</p><p>The introduction of the After-School Childcare (ASCC) programme is designed to support low-income and unemployed people to take up employment.  This programme is a particularly important support for one-parent families, who might not be able to access support within the family unit, by providing after-school care for primary school children of eligible parents for a period of 52 weeks.  The programme contributes &euro;40 per week for an after school place or &euro;80 per week in situations where a pick-up service is provided to take the child from school to the childcare provider. The programme also provides a full day care rate of &euro;105 per week, for a maximum of 10 weeks, to cater for school holiday periods. In all cases, the maximum fee payable by parents is &euro;15 per week per child.</p><p>Under the Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programme, childcare services are contracted to provide childcare places to qualifying Solas or Education and Training Board (ETB) trainees or students for the duration of their courses.  This programme also provides part time and after school places. Under the programme, &euro;145 per week is provided towards the cost of a full day childcare place and the service is permitted to charge the parent up to a further &euro;25 per week towards the cost of the place.  The Programme has a budget of &euro;17 million per year and in the region of 8,000 children are catered for annually. The programme has a funding allocation of &euro;1.32 million in 2015, which will provide between 300 to 500 places.</p><p>The Community Employment Childcare (CEC) programme is targeted specifically at participants in the Community Employment (CE) schemes operated by the Department of Social Protection.  Under the programme, &euro;80 per week is provided for pre-school places for children up to the age of 5 and &euro;40 per week for afterschool places for primary school children up to the age of 13, with a set charge of &euro;15 per week to the parent in either case.  The programme also provides a part time day care rate of &euro;80 per week, for a maximum of 10 weeks, to cater for school holiday periods.  Places are approved for 50 weeks.  The CEC programme<b></b>has an annual budget of &euro;7.5 million to provide 2,000 places. </p><p>These programmes are in addition to the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme which provides a free pre-school year to all children in the age category 3 years and 2 months to 4 years and 7 months and the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme that provides funding to community childcare services to support disadvantaged or low income families.  The programmes represent an overall annual investment of &euro;260 million and supports more than 100,000 children each year.</p><p>The funding to support these childcare programmes has been maintained despite the difficult budgetary position.  I am now looking at the question of appropriate supports for child care in a wider context.  To ensure that all the benefits of our full range of childcare investments are fully realised, future public investment in childcare must be evidence-based and strategically coordinated.  It is crucial that we develop a coherent whole-of-Government approach to investment in childcare services and I have established an Inter-Departmental Group to look at the provision right across the 0 to 6 age group as well as to consider the after-school needs of older school-going children.  I have asked the Group to report to me by the Summer. </p></reply>

As the Deputy is aware, the Child and Family Agency was established on 1 January, 2014 and brought together nearly 4,000 staff from three separate organisations, the Health Service Executive (HSE), the Family Support Agency and the National Educational Welfare Board. This represented one of the most ambitious and far reaching public sector reforms undertaken by the Government.  The Agency places a strong emphasis on prevention, early intervention, family support, therapeutic and care interventions, all of which are key to the provision of integrated, multidisciplinary services for vulnerable children and families but it cannot do this alone and relies on other sectors including health and education.  This is entirely appropriate as children's health needs will be met by the HSE and their educational needs by schools.  For example, some children have specialist needs that need to be met by child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS - which remains part of the HSE) as referenced in the Deputy's question.  </p>  <p>  The Agency and the HSE have a Memorandum of Understanding and a Joint Protocol for inter-agency collaboration in place which underpins service provision for those children attending services provided by both agencies.  The Memorandum of Understanding sets a partnership agreement between the HSE and the Agency whereby pre-establishment levels of service are maintained across both organisations. The objective of the Joint Protocol is to specify a pathway and associated responsibilities for children and families whose needs cross between the HSE and the Agency.  </p>  <p>  Both the Memorandum of Understanding and the Joint Protocol are subject to regular monitoring and review to ensure that they are working effectively in the best interests of children and families.  Additionally, the Agency and the HSE are working to finalise a service level agreement to underpin the provision of psychological services by the HSE which will assist the Agency in fulfilling its statutory obligations.  The service level agreement with the HSE will determine the quantum of service needed to meet the Agency's requirements and will be an interim arrangement pending the Agency providing the service directly.  </p></reply>

Through its Educational Welfare Service, the Agency responds to instances where children are not attending school regularly, leading to concerns for their educational welfare. </p>  <p>  Under the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000, schools are obliged to record and monitor daily attendance and to report absences to the Agency in specific circumstances; such as where a child is absent for 20 days or more, where a child is expelled or suspended for six days or more cumulatively, or where the principal of a school has concerns about the educational welfare of a child.  </p>  <p>  While Educational Welfare Officers have a number of statutory powers in relation to school attendance, much of their work involves early prevention and targeted intervention with children and families, in collaboration with schools and other support services. Where school attendance problems arise for a child, the Agency concentrates on finding solutions within a collaborative intervention framework involving children and their families, schools and other relevant agencies. This work of the Educational Welfare Service falls into two key categories, namely the provision of a brief intervention designed to resolve a school attendance issue with a child before it escalates or the provision of intensive intervention, where problems of poor school attendance are manifestation of more complex and deep rooted issues for the child and his or her family which require significant time and on-going support from the Educational Welfare Officer to ensure progress. </p>  <p>  The information sought by the Deputy has been requested from the Child and Family Agency and I will respond directly to the Deputy when the information is received.</p></reply>

The Programme is a targeted intervention aimed at school communities identified through the Department of Education and Skills' DEIS Action Plan for Educational Inclusion. It involves 124 locally managed projects and related initiatives operating across 470 primary and 224 post-primary schools to provide targeted supports to approximately 36,000 children and young people.<b></b>Each project involves a cluster of schools working collectively to provide a range of supports and interventions designed to support individual children identified locally as being at risk of early school leaving within those school communities</p><p>As with all programmes involving significant expenditure, the School Completion Programme budget was subject to examination under the terms of the 2011 Comprehensive Review of Expenditure. This process identified a requirement for savings of 6.5% per annum across the programme over the period 2012 to 2014, amounting to &euro;5.5m. In 2014, the allocation to the programme was &euro;24.756m. </p><p>Since 1<sup>st</sup>January 2014, the Child and Family Agency has operational responsibility for the School Completion Programme, including the allocation of funds to local projects. The first and second instalments of 2014/15 funding has issued to local projects and a third instalment is planned for payment in May 2015.</p><p>The estimate for the Child and Family Agency for 2015 is &euro;631 million, a 4.3% increase on its 2014 allocation. My Department has recently issued a Performance Statement to the Agency under Section 45 of the Child and Family Agency Act, 2013. This includes my priorities for consideration in the development of the Agency's 2015 Business Plan. The Business Plan will set out the Agency's proposed activities, programmes and priorities for 2015, including provision for the School Completion Programme, in light of the monies available. </p><p>A review of the School Completion Programme by the ESRI is almost complete. The review will assist in identifying the reforms necessary to consolidate the programme on a sustainable footing for the future and to ensure that it is line with the aims of Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures: the national policy framework for children and young people (2014-2020). </p><p>The aim is to ensure that available funds are targeted to those services that provide the greatest contribution to good educational outcomes for children and young people at risk of educational disadvantage. The review has an important contribution to make to these aims and the future development of the school completion programme. It is envisaged that the review will be completed shortly.</p><p>The information sought by the Deputy in relation to School Completion Programme clusters in Galway and Mayo has been requested from the Child and Family Agency and I will respond directly to the Deputy when the information is received.</p></reply>

The Department is seeking a solution which would best meet the aim of supporting people with severe disabilities who require additional income to contribute towards the costs of their mobility needs, while remaining within the available budget and satisfying all legal and equality concerns.  In the meantime, the Motorised Transport Grant remains closed and monthly payments have continued to be made by the Health Service Executive to 4,700 people who were in receipt of the Mobility Allowance at the time that the scheme was closed.</p>  <p>  Work is ongoing on the policy proposals to be brought to Government for the drafting of primary legislation for a new scheme.

The committee's recommendations are informed by public health advice and international best practice. </p>  <p>  Immunisation is regarded as one of the safest and most cost-effective of health care interventions.  International studies and scientific assessments suggest that the best way to prevent most disease due to human papillomavirus (HPV) is to vaccinate as many girls and women as possible. </p>  <p>  In Ireland, the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) is the regulatory authority for medicines in Ireland.  Gardasil vaccine is a medicinal product authorised by the European Commission on 20 September 2006 following a positive opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) at the European Medicines Agency (EMA).  With this authorisation, the vaccine can be marketed in all EU Member States.  Since first authorisation the HPRA has continuously monitored the safety of Gardasil.  This monitoring includes a review of global safety data in addition to national experience with use of the vaccine.  The EMA is responsible for the scientific evaluation of medicines developed by pharmaceutical companies for use in the European Union.  </p>  <p>  The HPRA continues to ensure that the quality, safety &amp;amp; efficacy of all vaccinations licensed in Ireland including HPV meet the required standards.

This reduction is indeed welcomed.</p>  <p>  A National Clinical Care Programme for Stroke was started in 2010; its aim is to improve patient healthcare and outcomes and it can point to some very positive achievements. Emergency clot-busting thrombolysis therapy is provided now to patients in all regions of the country by improved hospital and ambulance protocols, health professional training and the appointment of new physicians. There is National 24/7 access to safe stroke thrombolysis, the rate of which has increased from 1% in 2006 to a current rate of 11%. This exceeds the national target of 9% and is amongst the best in national rates worldwide. </p>  <p>  Access to stroke unit care has been shown to improve stroke patient outcomes through reduced rates of death, dependency and shorter lengths of stay.  Since the commencement of the National Clinical Programme for Stroke, nine new stroke units have been opened. This brings the total number of stroke units in acute hospitals to twenty-four. It is a major improvement from the first national stroke care audit report in 2006 which reported one stroke unit in the country.</p>  <p>  Meanwhile, less stroke patients are dying in hospital; the rate has dropped from 16.1% in 2009 to 15.1% in 2013; this represents an average of three fewer deaths per month in 2012. There are less stroke patients being discharged to nursing homes &ndash; an indication of improved disability outcomes; more stroke patients are being discharged home directly from acute hospitals; and the average acute hospital length of stay for stroke has fallen from 10 days in 2009 to 9 days in 2013.</p>  <p>  Of course the risk factors for stroke and other diseases are smoking, alcohol, poor diet leading to overweight and obesity, and physical inactivity. Prevention of stroke is therefore key. The work of my Department's Special Action Group on Obesity and Healthy Ireland on, among other priorities, its physical activity strategy this year, along with legislation on smoking and reducing alcohol consumption, are all intended to help prevent disease - including stroke.</p></reply>

Under community rating, everybody is charged the same premium for a particular health insurance plan, irrespective of age, gender and the current or likely future state of their health. This means that the level of risk that a particular consumer poses to an insurer does not directly affect the premium paid. It also means that premiums for younger or healthier lives are typically higher than their expected claims would require, whereas for older or less healthy lives, premiums are typically lower than the expected claims would require. </p>  <p>  The policy objective of introducing Lifetime Community Rating (LCR) is to encourage people to purchase health insurance at a younger age, as community-rated markets depend on a continuing influx of younger people to keeps premiums down for everybody. LCR, which is being introduced from 1 May 2015, modifies community rating so that the premium that individuals pay for health insurance increases with the age at which they enter the private health insurance market. The premium does not vary in relation to their current age. For example, under LCR a 50 year old who has held insurance since he or she was 30 will continue to pay the same as a 30 year old, but a 50 year old who purchases insurance for the first time will pay more than a 30 year old. If you take out private health insurance earlier in life, and retain it, you will pay lower premiums compared to someone who joins when they are older. </p>  <p>  The introduction of LCR will encourage more people to join the market at younger ages, thus helping to spread the costs of older and less healthy people across the market and helping to support affordable community-rated premiums for everyone.</p></reply>

This included quality standards in terms of governance &amp;amp; accountability, person centred care, complaints management, training and qualifications.

They are supervised through regular operational meetings and care plan reviews.</p><p><i>Government for National Recovery, 2011-2016 </i>commits to developing and implementing national standards for home support services which will be subject to HIQA inspection.

Develop a list of priority actions to prevent and manage overweight and obesity in Ireland for the period 2015 to 2025 based on the best available evidence. </p><p>2. Develop a plan to progress those actions and to foster cross-sectoral engagement, ownership and accountability.</p><p>3. Integrate the action plan within Healthy Ireland and the national policy framework for children and young people.</p><p>4. Ensure appropriate integration of the proposed National Physical Activity Plan and other relevant aspects of government policy such as those relating to disease/disability and the physical environment.</p><p>The Action Plan will consist of a 50 page document focusing on the areas of supply and availability of Food including pricing and marketing; prevention of overweight and obesity including screening and education; management of overweight and obesity; and information and research.  Key stakeholders - including healthcare professionals, industry, relevant government departments, NGOs and children - will be formally consulted as part of the consultation process.  The consultation report of this process will feed into the drafting of the Obesity Action Plan which will be finalised during 2015. </p><p>I hope the answer above is of help to the Deputy.</p></reply>

It is licensed in Ireland for treatment of herpes simplex keratitis.</p>  <p>  There has been a shortage in Ireland and in other countries of the product since late last year due to a number of batches of the active ingredient (aciclovir) having small metal particles larger than allowed. As a result, a number of batches across the globe were recalled in November 2014. </p>  <p>  While none of the affected batches had been distributed in Ireland, supplies of unaffected batches have been available in only very limited quantities in Ireland since then.</p>  <p>  There are no generic versions of Zovirax&reg; Eye Ointment authorised in Ireland but Zovirax&reg; tablets have remained available.  A small number of unauthorised alternative products (other anti-viral eye preparations) have been available for pharmacies to order since the shortage began.  These include eye products such as Virupos&reg; ointment, or Virgan&reg; eye gel.  Limited supplies of the Zovirax&reg; Eye Ointment product from other countries have been available for ordering in Ireland, as an unauthorised product.</p>  <p>  On 4 November 2014 the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA- the medicines regulator in Ireland) informed doctors and pharmacists that GSK was rationing product supplies in light of the global shortage.  Information on alternative products was provided. GSK issued a letter providing similar information on 5 November 2014 (and was posted on the HPRA's website.)</p>  <p>  On March 19th, 2015, GSK informed the HPRA that stocks of Zovirax &reg;Eye Ointment in Ireland would be exhausted completely by April 2015, and that the expected resupply date was the first quarter of 2016.  The HPRA is currently working with GSK to communicate this information to doctors and pharmacists.  The unauthorised anti-viral eye products have continued to be imported into Ireland in recent months.  The advice issued in November 2014 to doctors and pharmacists in relation to prescribing alternative medications remains valid.</p></reply>

In this context, the implementation of the recommendations of the Strategic Review of Medical Training and Career Structure is a priority for my Department.</p>  <p>  In July 2013, a Working Group, chaired by Prof. Brian MacCraith, President, Dublin City University, was established to carry out the Strategic Review. The Working Group was tasked with examining and making high-level recommendations relating to training and career pathways for doctors with a view to:</p>  <p>  -  Improving graduate retention in the public health system; </p>  <p>  -  Planning for future service needs;</p>  <p>  -  Realising maximum benefit from investment in medical education and training.</p>  <p>  The Working Group completed its work in June 2014 and, in all, submitted three reports and made 25 recommendations. The reports address a range of barriers and issues relating to the recruitment and retention of doctors in the Irish public health system. </p>  <p>  The Strategic Review recommendations are being implemented through a range of structures and processes across the health system. Each recommendation has an identified business owner and progress updates are sought by my Department on a regular basis.  To support implementation of the recommendations, my Department has also established an Implementation Monitoring Group, comprising key stakeholders including trainee doctors. This will help drive implementation across the system and embed the recommendations in the day-to-day business practice of the health system. </p>  <p>  The first six-monthly progress report on the implementation of the recommendations was published on 5th March last on my Department'  s website. The next report will be finalised and published this summer so that all stakeholders, in particular trainee doctors, can assess the progress being made across the range of Strategic Review recommendations. </p></reply>

Encouraging more people to join the market at younger ages helps spread the costs of older and less healthy people across the market, helping to support affordable premiums for all. There is a nine month grace period, which expires on 30 April 2015, during which time as many people as want to can take out health insurance without incurring loadings. From 1 May 2015, late entry loadings will be applied to those who join the private health insurance market at age 35 or over. </p>  <p>  There are exemptions available for people who previously had health insurance but cancelled it. A credited period can apply for any periods of inpatient cover from age 23 years where a full adult premium rate has been paid. The responsibility rests with the individual to prove to the insurer their credited period. When a full adult premium is paid in respect of anyone, including spouses and dependent students, such periods of cover are taken into account for the purposes of Lifetime Community Rating. In such cases, the level of loading will then be reduced by the relevant credited period(s). </p>  <p>  These credited periods apply for periods of health insurance cover purchased with registered health insurers in this country. However, anybody who lives outside the State on 1 May 2015, and who moves to take up residence in Ireland, will have a grace period of 9 months to purchase private health insurance without incurring loadings.</p></reply>

Persons with full eligibility (medical card holders) are entitled to a range of services including general practitioner services, prescribed drugs and medicines, all in-patient public hospital services in public wards including consultant services, all out-patient public hospital services including consultant services, dental, ophthalmic and aural services and appliances and maternity and infant care services. People with limited eligibility (non-medical card holders) are entitled, subject to certain charges, to all in-patient public hospital services in public wards including consultant services and out-patient pubic hospital services including consultant services.</p>  <p>  Separate to the public health system, my Department oversees the maintenance of a competitive and sustainable private health insurance market, under the provisions of the Health Insurance Acts 1994 to 2014, and monitors developments on an ongoing basis to ensure that the market is regulated appropriately. The policy objective of introducing Lifetime Community Rating (LCR) to the health insurance market is to encourage people to purchase health insurance at a younger age, as community-rated markets depend on a continuing influx of younger people to help spread the costs of older and less healthy people across the market and helping to support affordable community-rated premiums for everyone who wishes to purchase insurance. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that the purchase of private health insurance is optional. The regulatory framework governing health insurance, such as late entry loadings under LCR and the application of waiting periods for new health insurance customers, applies to all persons choosing to purchase health insurance and is not related to a persons eligibility, or previous eligibility, for public health services. Therefore, I do not consider there to be any anomaly in treatment. </p>  <p>  On the issue of waiting periods specifically, I recently signed amending Regulations to standardise the waiting periods for everyone taking out private health insurance. The revised maximum waiting periods to be served for all persons, irrespective of age, will be 26 weeks for the initial waiting period and  5 years for pre-existing conditions. The Regulations will apply to all health insurance contracts entered into on or after 1 May 2015 and will include contracts that are 'renewed' after this date.</p></reply>

Brain injury health services are provided across a range of settings, by different organisations and by many health professionals and carers.  The Health Service Executive  provides for the health needs of those affected by brain injury through a range of measures.  The HSE Clinical Strategy and Programmes Directorate have a number of clinical programmes that are working in the area of neurology, including Neurology, Epilepsy, Stroke and Rehabilitation Medicine.  The clinical programmes are focusing on reducing waiting times/lists, addressing disease specific pathways and models of care with a view to developing a national framework for the management of long-term neurological conditions.  The HSE also provide services for those with brain injury through Primary Care Teams with community based therapy services and personal social services, often funded through partner agencies in the non-statutory sector.  The National Neuro-Rehabilitation Strategy made a number of recommendations for services for people with rehabilitation needs.  An implementation framework for the Neuro-Rehabilitation Strategy is being developed by both the HSE Rehabilitation Medicine Clinical Programme and the HSE Disability Services Division.  The HSE also provides substantial funding to a number of organisations such as Acquired Brain Injury Ireland, Headway Ireland, Enable Ireland, Spina Bifida Hydrocephalus Ireland among others, to provide supports and services to people with a neurological condition.</p>  <p>  The Government recognises that neurological illness or injury has significant implications for the individual and their family and impacts on their health, social, educational, vocational and recreational participation.  It is important that the continuum of services and supports required are made available by the health system and by those other State agencies to provide specific services, consistent with their statutory remit.  On the health side, waiting times, access, treatment and quality of care are priorities for reform for this Government, despite budgetary constraints. </p></reply>

This review placed significant emphasis on international best practice and the application of these practices to existing service provision in Ireland. </p>  <p>  The major deliverable of the review was a detailed report  based on three key components: capacity and data, work practices, admission polices &amp;amp; related clinical issues. The report recommended that the number of critical care beds should increase from 289 to 579 over the period 2010 to 2020.  It also recommended a model for the delivery of adult critical care that is underpinned by a network approach, whereby 'hub', 'spoke', and 'local' hospitals  work together to provide the patient with safe and high quality critical care, in a timely manner. At the time of the 2008 report adult critical care services were provided in 37 hospitals (52 units) across the country including in a number of the smaller hospitals where beds were described as critical care beds but in practice treated low volumes of critical care patients. </p>  <p>  The report recommendations have  informed the work of the HSE critical care clinical programme which was subsequently established. In 2014 the National Clinical Programme for Critical Care designed and launched a  'hub-and-spoke' Model of Care for Adult Critical Care, which is a centralised critical care delivery model, designed to meet the complex needs of critically ill patients across the acute healthcare system. The Annual National Clinical Programme for Critical Care Capacity Census records adult critical care capacity i.e. the commissioned and actual critical care bed stock and critical care staff provided in critical care services in hospitals, and available to care for critically ill adult patients.  There is now a  more  a co-ordinated approach to the planning and delivery of critical care, within and across hospital groups, with a focus on small hospitals  managing  routine  urgent or planned care locally and more complex critical care managed in the larger hub  hospitals where the relevant clinical critical care expertise can be provided. </p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query regarding the implementation of the report recommendations, as this is a service matter, I have asked  the HSE to respond to you directly. If you have not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days please contact my Private Office and my officials will follow the matter up.</p></reply>

The Policy is designed to ensure an open, consistent approach to communicating with patients and their families when things go wrong in the provision of their healthcare.  It is important that the patients and their families are kept informed and that feedback is forthcoming on investigations.  It is vital that we establish the steps that need to be taken to prevent a recurrence of adverse events. The HSE has now begun implementing the Policy across all health and social services.  </p>  <p>  In addition, I intend to bring legislation forward to give effect to recommendations made by the Commission on Patient Safety and Quality Assurance to facilitate open disclosure of adverse events to patients.  The Commission recommended that legislation be enacted to provide legal protection for open disclosure and said that such legislation should ensure that open disclosure, which is undertaken in good faith in compliance with national standards, cannot be used in litigation against the person making the disclosure.  These provisions will be in the Health Information Bill.  Because of changes to the Bill since the general scheme was approved by Government, I will be bringing a revised general scheme to Government in the coming months, with a view to publishing the Bill this year.</p></reply>

Under the Scheme, nursing home residents contribute towards the cost of their nursing home care based on their means, and the HSE pays the balance. In 2015 a total amount of &euro;948m is available for the Scheme. As of the end of January 2015 (latest figures available) 22,324 people were being supported by the Scheme. </p>  <p>  Participants in the Scheme contribute up to 80% of their assessable income (which includes any rental income) and a maximum of 7.5% per annum of the value of assets held. The first &euro;36,000 of an individual's assets, or &euro;72,000 in the case of a couple, is not counted at all in the financial assessment. The capital value of an individual's principal private residence is only included in the financial assessment for the first three years of their time in care.</p>  <p>  The Nursing Homes Support Scheme has incorporated a number of safeguards to ensure that: </p>  <p>  -  Nobody will pay more than the actual cost of care</p>  <p>  -  An applicant will keep a personal allowance of 20% of their income or 20% of the maximum rate of the State Pension (non-Contributory), whichever is the greater</p>  <p>  -  If an applicant has a spouse/partner remaining at home, he/she will be left with 50% of the couple's income or the maximum rate of the State Pension (non-Contributory), whichever is the greater</p>  <p>  -  If both members of a couple enter nursing home care, they each retain at least 20% of their income, or 20% of the maximum rate of the State Pension (Non-Contributory), whichever is the greater.</p>  <p>  In addition to the safeguards, an applicant has the option to opt for the loan element of the Scheme known as Ancillary State Support. An applicant can opt for this loan where their assets include land and property held in the State. By availing of the loan, the portion of the contribution based on an applicant's assets may be deferred and collected from their estate. A nursing home resident can apply for the loan at any stage.</p>  <p>  The Nursing Homes Support Scheme (Allowable Deductions) Regulations 2014, which came into effect on the 1st September 2014, expanded the definition of "Allowable Deductions" in the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009 to allow the HSE to make allowance for dependent children. </p>  <p>  The Regulations are not arbitrary but are based on rates applied elsewhere by the Department of Social Protection. Under the Regulations, the HSE may deduct from the means assessed for the Scheme the equivalent of Child Benefit, plus the full rate of the Increase for a Qualified Child in respect of each dependent child. (Individuals in receipt of certain Social Welfare payments may claim an Increase for a Qualified Child for each qualified child under the age of 18 who lives with, and is being maintained by, the claimant. The increase may also be paid in respect of a child between 18-22 if s/he is in full-time education at a recognised school/college. The full rate of the Increase for a Qualified Child is &euro;29.80 per week (&euro;119.20 ever 4 weeks).)</p>  <p>  The costs of caring for children, where it is relevant, will also be taken into account by deducting a fixed amount from declared means equivalent to the amounts allowed for dependent children for the purposes of medical card income assessments.</p></reply>

There is a nine month grace period, which expires on 30 April 2015, during which time as many people as want to can take out health insurance without incurring loadings. From 1 May 2015, late entry loadings will be applied to those who join the private health insurance market at age 35 or over, set at 2% per year for each year over the age of 34, up to a maximum loading of 70% at age 69 and over.</p>  <p>  There are exemptions available for people who previously had health insurance but cancelled it. A credited period can apply for any periods of inpatient cover from age 23 years where a full adult premium rate has been paid. In relation to the specific scenario raised, I can confirm that an 'insured person' under a health insurance contract means any person who is party to or named in an inpatient indemnity health insurance contract. Therefore, where a person was named on a health insurance contract and the spouse died, all prior cover is recognised under LCR. Loadings can be avoided where the individual maintains their health insurance cover or has a break in cover of less than 13 weeks.</p></reply>

This means that they are not subject to the workplace smoking ban.</p><p>However, while there is no legislation at present banning the use of e-cigarettes in the workplace, it is open to a company/agency to introduce workplace policy which does not permit their use, if they so wish. The Health Service Executive, for example, prohibited the use of e-cigarettes in all of its facilities and campuses from 1 May 2014 under its Tobacco Free Campus policy. Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann also introduced a ban on the use of e-cigarettes in the workplace in 2014.</p><p>The Government recognises that while e-cigarettes do not contain tobacco, they do contain nicotine, a highly addictive substance.  In order to ensure that e-cigarettes and other non-medicinal nicotine delivery systems are sold in a responsible manner in this country, Government has approved the drafting of legislation to introduce a licensing system for these products.  The legislation will also prohibit the sale of these products to, and by, persons under 18 year of age. Work on the legislation is ongoing in my Department and it is expected that the General Scheme of a Bill will be published this year.

The project will deliver a modern, state-of-the-art hospital for mothers and babies.  Co-location at St Vincent's, allows for optimal care for mothers, and particularly those at high-risk, by ensuring access to the range of medical and surgical specialties that they may require.</p>  <p>  The project is progressing well.  Design Stage 1 (preliminary design) was completed in December 2014 and the project has now proceeded to Stage 2a &ndash; Scheme Design.  Thus the formal detailed design of the development is now underway.  It is anticipated that a Strategic Infrastructure Development planning application will be submitted to An Bord Plean&aacute;la in Q4 2015.  Assuming no planning difficulties, building is tentatively expected to commence in 2016.  The development will be built on a phased basis and will, it is hoped, be substantially complete by late 2019.</p></reply>

However, the study did not include environmental impacts, or differentiate costs attributable directly to smoking and indirectly to passive smoking.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health has commissioned research to be carried out to assess the economic costs of smoking in Ireland.

The Government's continued commitment to this policy was most recently re-confirmed in its recently published Foreign Policy Review &ldquo;The Global Island&rdquo; which clearly stated that &ldquo;Our policy of military neutrality remains a core element of Irish foreign policy&rdquo;.  </p>  <p>  The policy of military neutrality is not set out in legislation.  However, the deployment of Irish military personnel outside the State is governed by legislation, namely the Defence Acts of 1960 and 2006.  The legislation provides for a 'Triple Lock' under which operations must be mandated by the United Nations, participation in operations must be approved by the Government and with certain limited exceptions must be approved by way of a resolutions of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.     </p>  <p>  Legal safeguards are also in place to ensure that Ireland's neutrality is not affected by our EU membership.  Ireland's participation in a European common defence is prohibited by Article 29.4.9 of the Constitution.  Any change in that position could take place only with the approval of the people in a referendum to amend the Constitution.  Moreover, the Protocol on the concerns of the Irish people on the Treaty of Lisbon, which is annexed to the Treaty on European Union, states quite clearly that the Treaty &ldquo;does not affect or prejudice Ireland's traditional policy of military neutrality.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the Government's continuing commitment and the legal provisions which I have outlined provide a strong framework for our policy of military neutrality.</p></reply>

This must mean an end to attacks from Gaza on Israel, but also an end to the unjust blockade which has endured now for seven years.  This should begin with a real opening of supplies of materials needed for reconstruction, including of essential infrastructure such as water, sewage and power.  Every effort must be made to ensure that humanitarian goods and personnel are guaranteed safe and unimpeded access to Gaza.  But it must then continue to the end of senseless restrictions on ordinary economic and human life.  The only way to reduce support for militarism among people in Gaza is to allow them to work and export their produce, to find jobs, to feel part of the wider Palestinian people and the wider world.&rdquo;</p><p>During my recent visit to Gaza I saw the huge scale of the humanitarian needs there.  I saw that some reconstruction has begun, but that much more is needed.</p><p>It was also clear, unfortunately, that there had been no real progress on addressing the wider issues which had underlain the previous conflict.  Like many others, I have warned that without such progress, Gaza and Israel will remain trapped in a cycle of uneasy truces punctuated by recurring, increasingly violent but ultimately inconclusive conflicts.  Sadly, the BBC report referred to by the Deputy confirmed that warning, reporting the views of figures on both sides who saw renewed conflict as inevitable and were planning for such an eventuality.</p><p>It is difficult for us to assess security in Gaza.  I did not of course meet there with any officials from Hamas or other militant groups.  The general view is that the ability of Hamas to control the actions of smaller and more militant groups such as Islamic Jihad may be weakening, and that this may affect the stability both of the current truce with Israel and the situation inside Gaza itself.</p><p>The supply of construction materials into Gaza is controlled by the Israeli security forces, under agreements between Israel and relevant agencies such as UNRWA and the Red Cross.  This has allowed some repair and reconstruction to begin, but the quantities allowed need to be significantly increased.  I have discussed this issue with representatives of the UN and the International Committee of the Red Cross, and others.  There are divergent views about the degree to which materials are being diverted for the building of tunnels.  While it is not possible to police the end use of every bag of cement, there has been no evidence put forward of any significant diversion of these materials. </p><p>The construction of tunnels and military works by groups in Gaza is indeed a problem.  It impacts upon Israeli communities living near Gaza; I met such a community when I visited.  However, it is worth noting that tunnel construction has taken place at all periods, even when no construction materials were being officially allowed into Gaza at all, and indeed even when the Strip remained under direct Israeli military control.  These activities therefore cannot justify denying the entire population of 1.8 million people, many of whose homes have been destroyed, access to basic construction materials. </p><p>Finally, the nature of pledges made at the Cairo conference, including through what agency such funds would be channelled, varied widely among donors.  Ireland's contribution is being directed essentially through UNRWA and other UN agencies, and is spent directly by them.  There was no role for the former <i>de facto</i>(Hamas) authorities in Gaza.  These have now in theory been dissolved, and control returned to the Palestinian government, but in practice there is a vacuum of real authority in Gaza, which is a matter of real concern.</p><p>Many other donors have made similar arrangements.  I hope that all pledges made in Cairo will be made available in due course.</p></reply>

While a small number of these staff remain in schools, the schemes are being phased out and have been superseded by a more extensive grant scheme. The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools in the Free Education Scheme now receive capitation grant assistance to provide for caretaking and/or secretarial services. Within the capitation grant schemes, it is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs and the Department does not stipulate how caretaking and/or secretarial services are to be obtained. Where a school uses the grant funding to employ a caretaker and/or secretary, such staff are employees of individual schools. My Department therefore does not have any role in determining the pay and conditions under which they are engaged. These are matters to be agreed between the staff concerned and the school authorities. </p><p>  Caretakers and secretaries employed by schools using grant funding are not regarded as public servants except for the purposes of the pay reduction under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No.2) Act 2009, due to the definition of &quot;public servant&quot; used in that Act. The fact that such staff come within the definition of &quot;public servant&quot; solely for the purposes of the Act does not alter their employment status in any other respect.</p><p>  Caretaking and administrative staff employed in Education and Training Boards (ETBs) are employees of the relevant ETB.  Any queries in respect of such staff should be directed to the relevant employer.</p></reply>

Circular 0005/2015 which sets out the staffing arrangements for the 2015/16 school year is now available on the website.</p><p>  As the teaching allocation to schools, including legacy posts, is enrolment based, it is this which determines whether schools gain or lose teaching posts from year to year. The school referred to by the Deputy will have its legacy post subsumed into its mainstream staffing from September 2015 as it saw an increase in enrolment sufficient to warrant an additional mainstream classroom teaching post for the 2015/16 school year.</p></reply>

The objective of this differentiation is to ensure that resources provided to schools to support children who have additional learning needs are targeted to ensure that those children most in need benefit from these resources.</p><p>  The rationale for the differing ratios is based on international literature on the incidence of disability as well as international and national surveys of literacy and numeracy which indicate that there is a greater incidence of disability/learning difficulty in boys than girls. </p><p>  The NCSE has published a report 'A study of the Prevalence of Special Educational Needs' which is available at www.ncse.ie and which contains details regarding the prevalence of special needs among the pupil population including noting gender differentials. </p><p>  It should be noted that schools in Delivering Equality of Opportunity in School Band 1 category also receive an additional base allocation of 0.4 of a post if the school has 200 or more pupils or an additional 0.2 of a post if the school has less than 200 pupils. </p><p>  Details of the GAM allocation process for schools for the coming 2015/16 school year are set out in Circular 05/2015, which is available on my Department's website at www.education.ie. </p><p>  Finally, the recently published NCSE Report Delivery for Students with Special Educational Needs, which is also available at www.ncse.ie, recommended that a new resource teaching allocation model be devised for schools taking into account the profiled need of schools and the educational profile of a school. In doing so, the NCSE report recommended that gender should continue to be a factor in deciding on school profile for resource allocation purposes.</p></reply>

A template anti-bullying policy which must be used by all schools for this purpose is included in the procedures.</p>  <p>  The procedures outline key principles of best practice for both preventing and tackling bullying and require all schools to commit to these principles in their anti-bullying policy.  In particular, they emphasise that a cornerstone in the prevention of bullying is a positive school culture.</p>  <p>  The procedures require that the prevention of bullying must be an integral part of a school's anti-bullying policy.  The education and prevention strategies that the school will implement must be documented in the anti-bullying policy and must explicitly deal with the issue of cyber-bullying and identity-based bullying including, in particular, homophobic and transphobic bullying.</p>  <p>  A school's anti-bullying policy must also set out the school's procedures for investigating and dealing with bullying and the school's procedures for the formal noting and recording of bullying behaviour.  These must be consistent with the Anti-Bullying Procedures for Primary and Post Primary Schools.</p>  <p>  The school's anti-bullying policy must be made available to school personnel, published on the school website (or where none exists, be otherwise readily accessible to parents and pupils on request) and provided to the Parents' Association.</p>  <p>  The Board is also required, under the Department's procedures, to undertake an annual review of the school's anti-bullying policy and its implementation by the school.  Written confirmation that the review has been completed must be made available to the Parents' Association and published on the school website.</p>  <p>  The Anti-Bullying Procedures for Primary and Post-Primary schools are available on my Department's website www.education.ie.</p></reply>

These posts continue to be replaced in the normal manner. The impact of the moratorium was therefore limited to the Assistant Principal and Special Duties posts of responsibility.</p>  <p>  The alleviation arrangements set out in Circular 0004/2014 provide a floor by which schools acutely affected at AP level by the impact of the moratorium can fill their AP vacancies as they arise to the level of the thresholds set out in that circular.</p>  <p>  It continues to be a matter for each individual school authority to re-organise and prioritise the appropriate duties for post of responsibility holders in the context of implementing the moratorium.  I am not aware of any arrangements such as referred to by the Deputy operating in schools.</p>  <p>  Economic constraints and the moratorium on recruitment, albeit alleviated to some extent for schools, have presented challenges within the education sector.  They also provide an opportunity to review the role of the principal so that our principals are leaders of learning, and to reconfigure the middle management structure to support principals in their role, ensuring ownership of responsibility rather than tasks, thereby building expertise and supporting a career path within the profession.</p>  <p>  The Department, in consultation with the representative bodies has commenced an exploration of the opportunities to support and thereby advance our understanding of the needs of school leaders and how they might be addressed.</p></reply>

The HEA allocates this funding to the institutions and the internal disbursement of funding is then a matter for the individual institution.  In addition to this funding, the HEA also provides a separate subsidy to institutions delivering undergraduate medicine courses for the cost of training an additional EU student intake of approximately 145 students per year, arising from the implementation of the Fottrell Report on undergraduate medical education and training to increase EU student intake.</p>  <p>  The average EU tuition fee rate for an undergraduate medical course is &euro;8,850.  Where a student meets the eligibility criteria of the Free Fees Initiative, the State covers the majority of this cost.  Student who qualify for free fees funding are liable to pay the Student Contribution, the cost of which for the current academic year is &euro;2,750.  The Contribution is paid on behalf of those students who qualify under my Department's Student Grant Scheme.  Some 50% of students who qualify for free fees funding have the contribution paid on their behalf by the State.</p>  <p>  In addition, students who qualify for entry to the Graduate Entry Medicine (GEM) programme, are liable for the cost of their tuition fees as they already hold an undergraduate qualification.  These fees are partly subsidised by the Irish State through the HEA.  The cost of GEM programmes for the current academic year range from &euro;14,580 to &euro;16,080, and is payable by students, with the assistance of the HEA subsidy of &euro;9,500 per student.</p>  <p>  It should also be noted that the Department of Health and/or the HSE meets the cost of the provision of clinical training placements and internships in the health sector.</p></reply>

My Department's policy is to promote a child-centred approach to education of children with special educational needs.  Children should have access to a range of different approaches to meet their individual needs.  The approach towards each child's education should be based on the individual educational needs of the child and should have regard to the child's individual education plan and supporting professional reports, and requires the interaction of all school personnel involved in the provision of education to the child.</p>  <p>  Teachers in some primary schools use play across the curriculum in junior and senior infant classrooms.</p>  <p>  Resources for teachers have been made available by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) in this regard, and give suggestions for planning and organising the classroom, showing examples of teaching and learning through play.  These are available on the NCCA website, www.ncca.ie.</p>  <p>  I wish to advise the Deputy, however, that the availability and provision of health-related therapy services, including play therapy supports, is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive (HSE).</p>  <p>  Specific queries about the provision of play therapy supports and the way in which this can be accessed should therefore be directed to HSE, as the body which has responsibility for the provision of such services.</p></reply>

Under this scheme schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.</p>  <p>  In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service.  The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring.  Psychologists use a problem solving and solution focused consultative approach to maximize positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties.  Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process.  Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment.</p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.  It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention.</p>  <p>  I have made enquiries in the matter raised by the Deputy and am informed that, while the assigned NEPS Psychologist is currently not available to the school due to maternity leave, a provision has been made under the above described SCPA scheme to answer the immediate assessment needs of the school in question.  I would advise that if the school have any questions on the matter that the Principal should contact the NEPS Regional Office (Tel: 0761- 108635) for clarification.</p></reply>

My Department is working closely with the schools concerned so that this permanent accommodation will be in place by September 2016. In that regard, I understand from the Patron that parents of the children in the ASD Unit recently visited the school to review the arrangements being put in place for the coming school year.</p><p>  I also am aware that one of the school's, in question, has an arrangement with a privately operated Montessori school that rents spare rooms in the school concerned. Subject to the provision of sufficient accommodation to meet the demands of the primary schools, any future arrangement will be a local matter between the schools and the private operator concerned. Other local arrangements at school level will also be a matter for the schools concerned.</p><p>  In the meantime, the schools are undertaking conversion works to facilitate the co-education arrangement from next September and funding is also being provided to the schools concerned for these works. </p></reply>

Water which is wholesome and clean is defined as water which is free from any micro-organisms and parasites and from any substances which, in numbers or concentrations, constitute a potential danger to human health and which meets the quality standards specified in the Schedule to the Regulations.  Maximum microbiological, chemical and indicator parametric values are set out in tabular form in the Regulations including 26 chemical parameters. However, this does not mean that the same chemicals are used in the treatment of drinking water. Many of the chemicals listed in the Regulations are elementary substances and as such are part of the natural environment and can be expected to be present in drinking water in small quantities, with no risk to human health as long as parameter values are not exceeded.</p><p>Regulation 13 of the Regulations requires all water suppliers to ensure that substances used in the preparation or distribution of water intended for human consumption, or impurities associated with such substances, do not, either directly or indirectly, reduce the protection of human health provided for in the Regulations. Regulation 13 also provides that water suppliers must take all measures necessary to ensure that the efficiency of disinfection treatment is verified and that any contamination from disinfection by-products is kept as low as possible without compromising the disinfection. </p><p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is the supervisory authority with responsibility for monitoring Irish Water's compliance with the regulations.  The EPA has published a manual to assist Irish Water and private water suppliers in designing and operating water treatment systems to provide rigorous disinfection, whilst maintaining compliance with other water quality parameters, particularly in relation to disinfection by-products.

The Non Principal Private Residence (NPPR) Charge is set at &euro;200 and liability for it falls, in the main, on owners of rental, holiday and vacant or additional properties that are not an individual's principal private residence. The NPPR Charge, which has since been discontinued, applied in the years 2009 to 2013 to any residential property in which the owner did not reside as their normal place of residence. It is a matter for an owner to determine if he or she has a liability and, if so, to declare that liability and pay the Charge and any late payment fees applicable.</p>  <p>  Under the 2009 Act &ldquo;residential property&rdquo; is defined as a &ldquo;&hellip;building that is situated in the State and that is occupied, or suitable for occupation, as a separate dwelling.&rdquo; There are a number of indicators as to what makes a property suitable for occupation for the purposes of determining liability to the Charge. The indicators include the structure of the property, whether or not it has a roof, whether or not it is so affected by dampness as to render it unsuitable for habitation, and whether or not it has sanitary facilities, including a water closet and water supply. Under the 2009 Act, there is no specific exemption for residential properties affected by pyrite. A property that is not suitable for occupation should not be regarded as a residential property within the meaning of the 2009 Act and would not therefore be liable for the Charge.  </p>  <p>  It is a function of a local authority to collect non-principal private residence charges and late payment fees due to it, and all charges and late payment fees imposed and payable to a local authority are under the care and management of the local authority concerned.

Applications for a new round of funding, which commenced on 1 July 2014, were subject to an appraisal process. 55 applications were approved for funding for the two-year period from 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2016. A number of previously funded organisations were not funded on this occasion.  </p><p>Pobal were asked to undertake the management of the scheme and, in that context, put in place a dedicated team to deal with any inquiries from applicants and to provide detailed feedback. Furthermore, an appeals process was put in place, on foot of which Pobal submitted a report, which is currently being considered.  </p><p>On 18 July 2014, it was announced that bridging funding of &euro;1.4million would be allocated for a twelve month period to a number of previously funded health, disability and other organisations that were not approved for funding under the new scheme, pending the carrying out of a review of the public funding of national organisations in the health and disability sector. This bridging funding in 2014/2015 will enable organisations to plan for their future, whether with or without State support, such as that provided under the SSNO. Details of the bridging funding provided to the various organisations referred to by the Deputies are set out in the table below. </p><p>It should be noted that t he review process is well underway and is being advanced in consultation with the Department of Health. The review is designed to rationalise the funding of these organisations to ensure efficiency in the use of public money and avoidance of duplication, while providing appropriate support to organisations working in the sector. The Health Service Executive and Pobal are also participating in the review. All organisations in receipt of bridging funding have been contacted to make submissions as part of the review process. I intend to complete and publish the outcome of the review in the coming months.  <table><tr><th>-</th><th>Bridging Funding Provided 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2015  </th></tr><tr><td>Arthritis Ireland </td><td>53,882 </td></tr><tr><td>Asperger Syndrome Association of Ireland Ltd </td><td>41,448 </td></tr><tr><td>Asthma Society of Ireland </td><td>41,448 </td></tr><tr><td>Breaking Through Limited </td><td>58,028 </td></tr><tr><td>Chronic Pain Ireland Limited </td><td>37,304 </td></tr><tr><td>Dyslexia Association of Ireland </td><td>62,172 </td></tr><tr><td>Genetic and Inherited Disorders Organisation Ltd </td><td>16,580 </td></tr><tr><td>GROW in Ireland </td><td>16,580 </td></tr><tr><td>Huntington's Disease Association of Ireland Limited </td><td>19,066 </td></tr><tr><td>Irish Deaf Society The National Association of the Deaf Limited </td><td>62,172 </td></tr><tr><td>Irish Heart Foundation </td><td>41,448 </td></tr><tr><td>Irish Mountain Rescue Association </td><td>58,028 </td></tr><tr><td>Irish National Council of Attention Deficit Disorder Support (INCADDS) </td><td>33,158 </td></tr><tr><td>Irish Stammering Association </td><td>24,868 </td></tr><tr><td>Migraine Association of Ireland Ltd </td><td>29,014 </td></tr><tr><td>Motor Neuron disease Association </td><td>24,868 </td></tr><tr><td>MOVE Ireland </td><td>41,448 </td></tr><tr><td>Muintir na T&iacute;re </td><td>70,462 </td></tr><tr><td>Muscular Dystrophy Ireland </td><td>37,304 </td></tr><tr><td>National Association for Spina Bifida and Hydrocephalus Ireland Limited </td><td>37,304 </td></tr><tr><td>National Association for Youth Drama Ltd </td><td>29,014 </td></tr><tr><td>New Communities Partnership (NCP) Ltd </td><td>74,606 </td></tr><tr><td>Peter Bradley Foundation Limited </td><td>41,448 </td></tr><tr><td>Post Polio Support Group Limited </td><td>24,868 </td></tr><tr><td>Safe Ireland </td><td>74,606 </td></tr><tr><td>Show Racism The Red Card Limited </td><td>29,014 </td></tr><tr><td>Suas Educational Development </td><td>37,304 </td></tr><tr><td>The Alzheimer Society of Ireland </td><td>62,172 </td></tr><tr><td>The Carers Association Limited </td><td>62,172 </td></tr><tr><td>The Multiple Sclerosis Society of Ireland </td><td>49,738 </td></tr><tr><td>The Neurological Alliance of Ireland </td><td>49,738 </td></tr><tr><td>The Union of Voluntary Organisations of People with Disabilities </td><td>45,592 </td></tr></table></p></reply>

The Regulations include maximum net income limits for each housing authority in different bands according to the area, with income being defined and assessed according to a standard Household Means Policy.</p>  <p>  The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of income needed to provide for a household's basic need plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country. The income limit of &euro;35,000 refers to the maximum income threshold for a single person household in the local authority areas listed in the 2011 Regulations. </p>  <p>  The limits also reflect a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced by this Government prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn and thereby promote sustainable communities. </p>  <p>  Under the Household Means Policy, which applies in all housing authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, PRSI and the universal social charge. Most payments received from the Department of Social Protection are assessable. The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and housing authorities also have discretion to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once off.  </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the current income limits generally provide for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households unable to provide accommodation from their own resources.

The report must give the Chief Executive's reasons and the considerations for the evaluation.

The Strategy builds on the provisions contained in Budget 2015 and sets out clear, measurable actions and targets to increase the supply of social housing, reform delivery arrangements and meet the housing needs of all households on the housing list.</p><p>The total targeted provision of over 110,000 social housing units, through the delivery of 35,000 new social housing units and meeting the housing needs of some 75,000 households through the Housing Assistance Payment and Rental Accommodation Scheme, will address the needs of the 90,000 households on the housing waiting list in full, with flexibility to meet potential future demand. In committing to provide these 35,000 new social housing units, at a projected cost of &euro;3.8 billion, the strategy marks a fresh start for social housing in Ireland.</p><p>The <i>funding that is provided by my Department to local authorities for social housing supports the development of new social housing units and also the purchase of units that may be privately owned. A similar approach applies to funding sanctioned by local authorities to approved housing bodies, which can be for either new building or the acquisition of existing housing units. There are some instances where funding for social housing developments is linked to job stimulus programmes and, in those cases, it is a requirement that funding is used for new housing developments. In general, it is a matter for each local authority, as the housing authority for its area, to identify the social housing need and to respond as required</i>.  <i>Where acquisitions are undertaken for social housing purposes, I expect local authorities to do so in a way that is sensitive to issues such as tenure mix and impact on the local housing market. </i></p><p>The Government is committed to resolving the legacy of unfinished housing developments. Since 2010, the number of unfinished housing developments has decreased by approximately two-thirds, from nearly 3,000 in 2010 to 992 in 2014. It is expected that with the aid of the &euro;10m Special Resolution Fund (SRF) announced in Budget 2014, a further 74 developments should be resolved in the months ahead. Completing these developments brings direct benefits to the community, as well as to the local property market by making new properties available for purchase, and can also mean that a relevant obligation to deliver social housing units under Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2002 can be discharged. Such obligations apply to planning permissions in respect of proposed developments consisting of the provision of 5 or more houses or for housing on land of an area greater than 0.1 hectare.</p></reply>

Accordingly, my Department is conducting a two stage process. The first stage, which is an Expressions of Interest (EOI) stage, was launched on 23 March 2015 and any entity wishing to be considered as a Local Action Group for their area has until 15 May 2015 to submit an EOI. Further details are available on my Department's website on </p><p>Entities successful in the first stage of the process will be invited and supported in Stage Two of the process, which is the design of a Local Development Strategy for their area. I expect that some Local Development Strategies will be operational and funding available by late Autumn 2015. </p><p>&euro;220 million of the LEADER Programme allocation of &euro;250 million has been allocated by my Department to the 28 sub-regional areas. &euro;15 million from the remainder of the fund is allocated for the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine Artisan Foods Initiative, &euro;5m for the REDZ Initiative and &euro;10 million for cooperation projects. </p><p>EU Regulation 1303/2013 which governs the Rural Development Programme states that it is the responsibility of the Member State to &ldquo;<i>define criteria for the selection of community led local development strategies</i>&rdquo;. In this context it was decided to determine county allocations in advance of beginning Stage One of the selection process. This will allow any entity that wishes to make an application to deliver the Programme to tailor their strategy for their area accordingly. I believe that this process will support the design and development of more robust and implementable strategies. </p><p>In determining the county allocations three objective criteria were used, namely, minimum allocation, population density and a Resource Allocation Model (RAM). Each Sub-Regional area was given a minimum allocation of &euro;3 million to ensure that each county received a viable allocation in line with European Commission guidelines. Cork was allocated &euro;6 million as a minimum in order to ensure a viable allocation to each of the three administrative districts within the county. The fact that the population in Cork, outside the city, is almost twice that of any other county and more than three times many, was also taken into consideration. Nationally, these minimum allocations total &euro;81 million.</p><p>A measure of population density (county population divided by km<sup>2</sup>) was used to distribute one half of the remaining fund (&euro;69.5m). An 'average amount' based on 26 counties was calculated. Each county's population density was then compared to the average population density for the country. For those counties where the density was above or below average the average amount was adjusted upwards (below average) or downwards (above average) based on the percentage deviation from the average to determine an allocation to each county. </p><p>The second half of the remaining fund (&euro;69.5m) was allocated to each county using a Resource Allocation Model (RAM). The model was developed by Trutz Haase using information from the 2011 census and the Trutz Haase deprivation index as a measure of deprivation. The underlying variables of the model include consideration of demographic decline, social class deprivation and labour market deprivation. The model also used CSO area classification to measure the urban-rural spectrum. These calculations were weighted towards rural areas and considered areas with low and medium deprivation. </p><p>The final allocations for each county determined using the methodology outlined above is set out in Table 1.</p><p><b>Table 1: LEADER Allocations 2014-2020</b><table><tr><th>County </th><th>Programme Allocation </th></tr><tr><td>Rural Dublin </td><td>&euro;6,370,438.43 </td></tr><tr><td>Kildare </td><td>&euro;5,261,600.01 </td></tr><tr><td>Meath </td><td>&euro;6,903,123.57 </td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow </td><td>&euro;6,336,549.00 </td></tr><tr><td>Carlow </td><td>&euro;6,416,803.43 </td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny </td><td>&euro;7,791,572.91 </td></tr><tr><td>Wexford </td><td>&euro;9,840,140.56 </td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary </td><td>&euro;10,103,443.28 </td></tr><tr><td>County Waterford </td><td>&euro;7,522,796.18 </td></tr><tr><td>County Cork </td><td>&euro;13,938,823.22 </td></tr><tr><td>Kerry </td><td>&euro;10,219,868.29 </td></tr><tr><td>Clare </td><td>&euro;8,920,224.65 </td></tr><tr><td>County Limerick </td><td>&euro;9,276,593.96 </td></tr><tr><td>County Galway </td><td>&euro;12,195,883.61 </td></tr><tr><td>Mayo </td><td>&euro;11,121,431.88 </td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon </td><td>&euro;8,852,659.22 </td></tr><tr><td>Louth </td><td>&euro;6,101,862.01 </td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim </td><td>&euro;5,998,474.74 </td></tr><tr><td>Sligo </td><td>&euro;7,655,647.81 </td></tr><tr><td>Cavan </td><td>&euro;8,522,285.84 </td></tr><tr><td>Donegal </td><td>&euro;12,913,877.86 </td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan </td><td>&euro;7,592,719.51 </td></tr><tr><td>Laois </td><td>&euro;7,124,586.86 </td></tr><tr><td>Longford </td><td>&euro;7,597,623.07 </td></tr><tr><td>Offaly </td><td>&euro;8,036,763.90 </td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath </td><td>&euro;7,384,206.22 </td></tr><tr><td>Total </td><td>&euro;220,000,000.00 </td></tr></table></p></reply>

The HAP scheme will bring all social housing supports provided by the State under the aegis of local authorities. The scheme will remove a barrier to employment by allowing recipients to remain in the scheme if they gain full-time employment. HAP will also improve regulation of the rented accommodation being supported and provide certainty for landlords as regards their rental income.</p><p>Further to the enactment of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014 on 28 July 2014, the first phase of the HAP statutory pilot commenced with effect from 15 September 2014 in Limerick City and County Council, Waterford City and County Council and Cork County Council. HAP commenced in Louth, Kilkenny, South Dublin and Monaghan County Councils from 1 October 2014. Subsequently, on 18 December 2014, Dublin City Council became part of the statutory HAP pilot, with a specific focus on accommodating homeless households. Dublin City Council is implementing the HAP pilot for homeless households in the Dublin region on behalf of all four Dublin local authorities, including D&uacute;n Laoghaire Rathdown County Council.</p><p>There are now more than 1,2 00 householdsbeing supported by HAP across the local authority areas taking part in the statutory pilot scheme. The first phase of the pilot hasallowed for significant learning that will be applied to the next phase of the pilot.</p><p>While I cannot comment on individual cases, I can confirm that all valid and complete HAP applications are processed in a timely and efficient manner by the shared services HAP transaction centre operated by Limerick City and County Council.  Subject to certain conditions, a payment to a landlord, net of the tenant contribution for the relevant period, can now be backdated to the date of receipt of a valid and complete HAP application by a local authority.

The activities of companies operating with an IED licence are monitored and inspected by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to ensure that the terms of their licences are respected, including in relation to emissions.  The emission limits are set to ensure an appropriate balance which allows the operation of industry applying good practice, and protection of human health and the environment.  Under the EPA Acts 1992 to 2011, I am precluded from exercising any power or control in relation to the performance by the EPA of its licensing functions in specific cases.   </p>  <p>  The EEA report referenced in the question does not indicate whether the emissions of a given installation are consistent with its legal IED requirements. All seven industrial plants are IED licensed installations and monitoring undertaken by the EPA has shown that emissions from all seven plant are substantively in compliance with the emission levels prescribed in their IED licenses.  Any minor infractions have been subject to oversight by the EPA and follow-up corrective action by the operator.</p></reply>

In this regard, the <i>Climate Action and Low-Carbon Development Bill 2015</i>, which was published in January 2015 sets out proposed statutory provisions for the development of a National Mitigation Plan, the primary objective of which will be to track implementation of mitigation measures already underway and to identify additional measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and progress the overall national low carbon transition agenda to 2050.  In anticipation of enactment of the planned legislation, work is already underway on developing the National Mitigation Plan.</p></reply>

Water which is wholesome and clean is defined as water which is free from any micro-organisms and parasites and from any substances which, in numbers or concentrations, constitute a potential danger to human health and which meets the quality standards specified in the Schedule to the Regulations.  Hard water is not included as a parameter in the quality standard tables included in the Schedule to the Regulations as neither it, or associated substances such as lime, calcium and magnesium, pose a threat to human health.</p>  <p>  The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that Irish Water can collect charges from each customer in receipt of water services provided by it.  The Act also provides that responsibility for the independent economic regulation of the water sector is assigned to the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and the CER has been given statutory responsibility for protecting the interests of customers.  The Water Charges Policy Direction issued to the CER in July 2014 referred to a number of matters relating to domestic water charges, including where the quality of water services provided by Irish Water to its customers is impaired or where services are reduced or restricted.  Where customers are subject to a drinking water restriction notice, affected customers will receive a 100% discount to the water supply portion of their bill for the duration of the restriction.  However, as hard water does not require the restriction of a supply, discounts would not apply in such cases.  There are no plans to introduce any scheme of financial support in respect of water-softening technologies.</p></reply>

The Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) was established under the Act to operate a national tenancy registration system and to facilitate the resolution of disputes between landlords and tenants in this sector.</p>  <p>  Receipt of a determination order is the official notification to parties of the final outcome of a dispute resolution case.  A determination order sets out the terms to be complied with, including any payments owing and the length of time given to comply.  In making determination orders, the PRTB-appointed adjudicators, mediators or Tribunal members as the case may be, can make provision to allow for payment of awards in instalments to facilitate recovery of the award, based on the circumstances of the case.</p>  <p>  A party who fails to comply with one or more terms of a determination order is open to having legal proceedings taken against him or her in the Courts.  Under the Act, enforcement of PRTB orders is a discretionary power and the Board exercises this power taking account of the circumstances pertaining to each case.  However, while there is no legal obligation on the PRTB to enforce, the Board takes the issue of non-compliance with determination orders very seriously.  During 2013, it referred 394 cases to its legal advisors for enforcement proceedings.  It is also open to parties to pursue enforcement independently through the Courts, including the seeking of a garnishee order.  </p>  <p>  It should be noted that going to Court does not of itself ensure successful enforcement and more particularly, recoupment of an award.  In many cases the best option, and one which the PRTB facilitates, is for the parties to agree a schedule of payments.</p></reply>

As part of the process of preparing the National Housing Survey 2011, published by my Department in October 2011, local authorities provided details of all unfinished housing developments in their areas.  Unfinished housing developments were divided into one of four categories, as follows:</p><p>-Category one, where the development is still being actively completed by the developer, or where no serious public safety issues exist;</p><p>-Category two, where a receiver has been appointed;</p><p>-Category three, where a receiver has not been appointed and the developer is still in place but effectively inactive; and</p><p>-Category four, where the development has been effectively abandoned and is posing serious public safety issues for residents.</p><p>Only households in developments in categories three and four are eligible for the waiver from payment of the household charge.  The development in question was categorised by Cork County Council as a category one development and as such was not eligible for a waiver from the household charge. The list of developments in which households are eligible for the waiver is set out under the Local Government (Household Charge)(Amendment) Regulations 2013.</p><p>An exemption from the Local Property Tax (LPT) applies to developments listed in the Schedule to the Finance (Local Property Tax) Regulations 2013. The list of unfinished housing developments eligible for the exemption was compiled by local authorities based on data from the National Housing Survey 2012, which was carried out over the course of summer 2012 by my Department in conjunction with local authorities and the Housing Agency.  A similar approach to that which applied to the waiver of the Household Charge was followed but using the revised methodology used in the 2012 Survey which included a new criterion identifying developments in a &ldquo;seriously problematic condition&rdquo; and to which the LPT waiver was applied. </p><p>The administration of issues relating to unfinished housing developments is a matter for individual local authorities.

There are a number of statutory consultees with whom I am obliged to consult on foreshore consent applications.  Among these are the public bodies that generally participate in the Marine Licence Vetting Committee (MLVC); the Marine Institute, Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport (Marine Survey Office), Department of Arts, Heritage &amp;amp; the Gaeltacht (Underwater Archaeology and Nature Conservation), Sea Fisheries Protection Authority and Inland Fisheries Ireland. </p><p>The MLVC is an <i>ad hoc</i>mechanism used to bring together key stakeholders in the foreshore consent process and is not comparable to either An Bord Plean&aacute;la or the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.

Information on the qualifications and experience of employees of other organisations is not held by my Department.  Those representatives of my Department that participate in the MLVC have the appropriate professional qualifications and experience commensurate with my Department's role in foreshore consenting.  The names of the individuals that participated in the MLVC as part of the consideration of the application concerned will be compiled and forwarded separately.</p><p>In 2005, when the lease for an offshore wind-farm was granted to Codling Windpark Ltd, the then Minister with responsibility was the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.  The offshore grid elements of the Codling I project, including cable routes and an offshore sub-station, were considered as part of the environmental impact assessment carried out as part of the decision-making process.  The requirement for Ministerial consent to commence operations is dealt with under Section 6 of the executed lease document, where by the Minister is not obliged to grant consent pursuant to clause 6, unless and until the lessee has obtained and provided to the Minister in respect of the relevant works, activities or operations copies of all necessary consents including, the appropriate licences to generate and supply electricity.  The foreshore lease explicitly prohibits any work from commencing in the leasehold area until such time as the necessary authorisations and licences are in place.</p></reply>

This was intended to support communities by restoring roads, coastal protection, amenities/facilities and other public infrastructure which had been damaged.  It was agreed that the funding would be made available via the Votes of the appropriate Departments, viz Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport; Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine; the Office of Public Works and my own Department.</p>  <p>  In the case of funding requirements which fall under the remit of my Department, viz, tourism infrastructure funded by the local authorities, certain piers, harbours and other facilities in the charge of the local authorities, current costs totalling &euro;4million and capital costs totalling &euro;13.1million were estimated initially for the first phase of severe weather.  For the second phase of severe weather, from 27 January to 17 February 2014, local authorities estimated current costs of &euro;3.5million and &euro;8.5million in capital costs.  Some additional works beyond the original &euro;7.5m initially estimated were identified under the current costs heading covering clean-up and necessary immediate repairs and by the end of 2014 &euro;7.859m was disbursed by my Department. </p>  <p>  Current costs of &euro;0.481m were identified by Galway County Council of which &euro;0.478m was drawn down in 2014.  With regard to capital costs, a total of &euro;5.994million was paid by my Department in 2014. In the case of Galway County Council, it identified capital costs totalling &euro;3.012m under the expenditure headings listed above, covering both phases of severe weather, of which &euro;0.338m was drawn down in 2014. </p>  <p>  Provision has been made in my Department's Vote for a further &euro;10million in respect of capital costs to be incurred by local authorities in 2015 on repair and remediation projects, including those projects to be progressed by Galway County Council, under the expenditure headings that fall under the remit of my Department as indicated above.  While it is a matter for individual local authorities to decide which projects are to be progressed and in which timescales, local authorities have been advised to give priority to works that are significant for economic activity and support the tourism industry in particular. </p>  <p>  My Department intends writing to local authorities shortly, including Galway County Council, inviting the submission of further claims for recoupment.  As was previously the case, recoupment of funding will be based on the submission of certification by the local authority that expenditure has been incurred within the overall expenditure ceilings indicated.  The 2015 funding position will be kept under review by my Department over the course of the year.</p></reply>

The Expert Advisory Council is to comprise a chairperson and between 8 and 10 ordinary members, four of whom shall be <i>ex officio</i>members comprising the heads of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, Teagasc and the Economic and Social Research Institute. In terms of appointing a chairperson and the remaining ordinary members, it is important to note the Expert Advisory Council is not a stakeholder/representative entity and that the Government will consider the range of qualifications, expertise and experience necessary for effective performance of the advisory body.  The inclusion of the <i>ex officio</i>members will help underpin this much-needed expertise and experience on these matters, as well as providing a link with relevant agencies working in the field to ensure effective implementation.  Within this context, it should also be noted that it is intended to put in place appropriate arrangements so that the Expert Advisory Council can operate effectively in performing its functions. </p><p>With regard to a mitigation target for the year 2050, the Bill explicitly commits the State to compliance with both current and future EU and international obligations in respect of climate change.  Ireland already has greenhouse gas mitigation targets up to the year 2020, and discussions are ongoing with respect to targets up to the year 2030.  This target-setting process will undoubtedly continue in relation to the periods up to the years 2040 and 2050. Putting in place our own statutory GHG mitigation targets would cut across and interfere with this EU target-setting process.  Given that Ireland will likely be subject to binding greenhouse gas emission reduction targets up to the year 2050 as part of the EU process in any event and that a long-term vision of low-carbon transition is already set out in the National Climate Policy Position, published in April 2014, I do not consider it either appropriate or necessary to include a national 2050 target in legislation.</p><p>Finally, with respect to climate justice, one of the most effective ways of lessening the effects of climate change in developing countries is for developed countries such as Ireland to engage in developing further their national mitigation measures in respect of greenhouse gas emissions, and the Bill provides for just such action.  Ensuring that all citizens have the option and means to access information and participate in the development of climate policies and actions that affect them is a further crucial action to ensure that climate change and our response to it protects and promotes the rights of all and again the Bill provides for that participation. </p><p>Furthermore, it should be noted that Ireland, through the EU, is active in the international negotiations that aim to deliver a legally binding global agreement on combatting climate change at the next Conference of the Parties in Paris in December 2015.  The Bill recognises the importance of these international discussions in terms of having regard to existing obligations under international agreements. </p><p>By providing support to those countries that need it to respond and adapt to climate change, we can ensure that Ireland's transition is part of a global transition to a more climate-resilient world.  It would be important to note in this context that despite difficult economic circumstances, Ireland has maintained significant support, primarily through public finance, for climate action on adaptation in developing countries.  While the vast majority of Ireland's annual climate finance comes from Irish Aid, Ireland's overseas development programme which falls under the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, it should also be noted that my own Department also made a contribution of &euro;33 million over two years during the Fast-Start Finance period (2010-2012), supporting the Global Climate Change Alliance and the Least Developed Countries Fund.  Ireland has maintained significant support, reporting &euro;34 million in 2013 in climate finance, mostly for adaptation projects in Ireland's key partner countries in sub-Saharan Africa.

In developing the National Mitigation Plan, it will be necessary however to ensure that the Plan will comply with the principles and requirements of EU Directive 2001/42/EC and the European Communities (Environmental Assessment of Certain Plans and Programmes) Regulations 2004 to 2011 and the Appropriate Assessment provisions of the Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC) and the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011.  The development of the Plan will be an iterative process and will be informed by the outcome of various stages of the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) and Appropriate Assessment (AA) processes.  Both of these processes will also involve a number of statutory consultative phases at different stages of the development of the Plan.</p>  <p>  In addition to the statutory consultations required under the SEA and AA legislation, the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill provides for a consultation process on the draft National Mitigation Plan.  I propose to allow a significant period of time for the public and stakeholders to express their views and provide input to the continued development of the Plan.  For these reasons, it is considered that a maximum of a two-year period will be required to develop the Plan. </p>  <p>  In developing this National Mitigation Plan, I intend to continue my commitment to openness and inclusiveness.  Building on the opportunities already provided to the general public and stakeholders to submit views on the sectoral elements of the Plan through previous public participatory pro cesses over the last year or so, I will shortly be inviting the views of the public and stakeholders on the preparation of the overall National Mitigation Plan currently being developed.  I am particularly looking forward to receiving input from all interested parties on how we might address the specific challenges ahead and what economic opportunities might arise in moving towards a low-carbon sustainable economic future.</p></reply>

At the commencement of the Programme &euro;400 million was allocated to the LAGs.  The original allocations are set out in Table 1.</p><p>In late 2011, the European Commission offered Member States that were part of the Financial Stabilisation Mechanism an opportunity to avail of an increased co-financing rate from 55% up to 85%.  The increased rate was to apply to 2012 and 2013 expenditure only.  This reduced the Programme value to approximately &euro;370 million and was based on the co-financing rate returning to 55% for 2014 and 2015.  In addition, &euro;5 million was provided for an agri-food measure.  Accordingly, in 2013 my Department revised the LAG allocations to meet the reduced value of the Programme.  The revised allocations are set out in Table 2. </p><p>Overall expenditure under the Programme is currently at &euro;342 million, with &euro;265 million spent on projects, &euro;12 million on animation expenses and &euro;65 million on administration.

Irish Water is providing landlords with the opportunity to prove that they are not the occupier by providing the tenant's name.  This will allow Irish Water to contact the tenant to complete the registration and to bill the tenant.

In transposing the Directive, the European Communities Environmental Objectives (Groundwater) Regulations 2010, as amended, give legal effect to measures for the protection of groundwater.</p>  <p>  Local Authorities are charged with the protection of water quality, including groundwater quality, within their remit.  The protection of drinking water sources, however, is a matter for Irish Water.</p>  <p>  In relation to the protection of groundwater, the Water Framework Directive classification assessments have identified that the main pressures impacting on groundwater quality include the input of nutrients from diffuse sources and, to a lesser degree, historical pollution from industrial activities.  Local pollution is considered to be caused primarily by farming activities and the inputs from domestic wastewater treatment systems.  Pollution from agricultural sources has been targeted through significant investment by farmers and the State under the Farm Waste Management Scheme and by the implementation of the European Communities (Good Agricultural Practice for Protection of Waters) Regulations 2014, as amended.  Pollution from domestic waste water systems is being addressed by the requirements of the Water Services (Amendment) Act 2012. </p>  <p>  The Waste Water Discharge (Authorisation) Regulations 2007 - 2010 provide for an authorisation system for all wastewater discharges to waters from treatment plants or collection systems owned or controlled by local authorities.  The purpose of the authorisation system is to prevent and reduce pollution of waters by waste water discharges.  As part of the authorisation process, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) can place conditions on the operation of individual plants and systems and it can set emission limit values for the discharges.  In December 2011, the EPA published guidance on the technical assessments that are needed to authorise discharges to groundwater, as a means of satisfying the requirements of the European Communities Environmental Objectives (Groundwater) Regulations 2010, as amended.    </p>  <p>  In relation to Cape Clear Island, I am advised by Cork County Council that a ground water protection scheme has been in place for the entire county (including Cape Clear Island) since 2013.</p></reply>

The other scheme provides for an Approved Housing Body (AHB) to acquire ownership of a property with an unsustainable private mortgage, which also enables the household to remain in their home as a social housing tenant (AHB-mortgage-to-rent). Both schemes assist families with income difficulties whose mortgages are unsustainable, and where there is little or no prospect of a significant change in circumstances in the foreseeable future. </p><p>To be eligible for the AHB-mortgage-to-rent scheme a household must have had their mortgage position deemed unsustainable under the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process, agree to the voluntary surrender of their home, be in negative equity, and be deemed eligible for social housing in accordance with section 20 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2009.  Where a property is in positive equity other options are open to the household. </p><p>In order for a property to be considered under the AHB-mortgage to rent scheme it must be purchased by an Approved Housing Body for less than &euro;220,000 (per property) in the Greater Dublin Area and &euro;180,000 (per property) in the rest of the country.  These limits were determined by a working group taking account of available market data including the current social housing acquisition limits.  These limits are considered to be reasonable in respect of the income bracket that is targeted by the scheme. </p><p>A total of 2,762 cases had been submitted to date under the AHB-mortgage-to-rent scheme.  Of these 1,897 were deemed ineligible or terminated during the process, of which 277 cases were not progressed because the household in question was deemed to be over or under-accommodated. </p><p>Of the remaining 865 cases submitted, agreement on the sale could not be agreed in 42 cases, 88 have been completed, 169 are currently with the lenders and the remaining 566 are still being actively progressed.</p><p>My Department has issued funding approval in respect of 122 cases.  There has been an increase in cases being progressed through the scheme this year since a revised protocol was put in place.  The operation of the Scheme is closely monitored on an on-going basis by my Department and the Housing Agency who are in regular contact with AHBs and financial institutions. </p><p>The LA - mortgage-to-rent (LAMTR) scheme, which was rolled out nationally in February 2014, allows local authorities to offer the mortgage to rent scheme to local authority mortgage holders with unsustainable mortgages.  To date, 81 households in distress with local authority mortgage arrears have been assisted through the scheme.  My Department has invited the submission of the first tranche of 2015 LAMTR claims from local authorities by 30 April 2015.</p><p>A breakdown of MTR by Local Authority area is shown in the table.<table><tr><th>Local Authority</th><th>AHB-MTR</th><th>LA-MTR</th></tr><tr><td>Carlow County Council</td><td>4</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan County Council</td><td>1</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Clare County Council</td><td>2</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Cork City Council</td><td>4</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Cork County Council</td><td>3</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Donegal County Council</td><td></td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin City Council</td><td>14</td><td>42</td></tr><tr><td>Dun Laoghaire/Rathdown County Council</td><td>1</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Fingal County Council</td><td>4</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Galway City Council</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Galway County Council</td><td>1</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Kerry County Council</td><td>1</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Kildare County Council</td><td>6</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny County Council</td><td>3</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Laois County Council</td><td>1</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim County Council</td><td>1</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Limerick City and County Council</td><td>4</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Longford County Council</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Louth County Council</td><td>9</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo County Council</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Meath County Council</td><td>7</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan Town council</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Offaly County Council</td><td>2</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon County Council</td><td></td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo County Council</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>South Dublin County Council</td><td>5</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary County Council</td><td>3</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Waterford County Council</td><td>6</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath County Council</td><td>2</td><td>24</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford County Council</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow County Council</td><td>3</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Grand Total</td><td>88</td><td>81</td></tr></table></p></reply>

A similar approach applies to funding sanctioned by local authorities to approved housing bodies, which can be for either new build or the acquisition of existing housing units.</p>  <p>  There are some instances where funding for social housing developments is linked to job stimulus programmes and, in those cases, it is a requirement that funding is used for new social housing developments.   </p>  <p>  However, in general, it is a matter for each local authority, as the housing authority for its area, to identify the social housing need and to respond as required.  There can be opportunities to achieve good value for money through acquiring built units and that is why the flexibility to do so is available to local authorities.  Where acquisitions are undertaken for social housing purposes, I expect local authorities to do so in a way that is sensitive to issues such as tenure mix and impact on the local housing market.</p></reply>

The following towns in County Donegal are now served by modern fire stations with full facilities: Millford (1998); Buncrana (2000); Letterkenny (HQ) and An Fal Carrach (both in 2003); Carndonagh and Donegal Town (both in 2004); Killybegs (2005); An Clochan Liath, Glenties and Moville (all in 2007); and most recently Gaoth Dobhair and Stranorlar (2009).  My Department has channelled significant investment to fire authorities over the last number of years and as a consequence, the high quality of Ireland's fire service infrastructure is now widely acknowledged.</p>  <p>  With regard to the provision of a new fire station in Ballyshannon, while this issue has been the subject of discussions with the Local Authority for a number of years, my Department awaits receipt of a fully updated proposal, taking into account, among other issues, site suitability, fire cover requirements and prioritisation of projects.</p>  <p>  In further considering any proposal, my Department must have regard to national priorities for funding in this area and the totality of requests from fire authorities countrywide.  The priorities of Donegal County Council, the extent of current and previous investment in Donegal Fire services and the status of existing facilities having regard to area risk categorisation, will also fall to be considered.</p></reply>

Regulation 13 also provides that water suppliers must take all measures necessary to ensure that the efficiency of disinfection treatment is verified and that any contamination from disinfection by-products, including trihalomethanes (THMs), is kept as low as possible without compromising the disinfection.</p>  <p>  Under the above Regulations, suppliers of drinking water are required to ensure that the water supplied is wholesome and clean.  Water which is wholesome and clean is defined as water which is free from any micro-organisms and parasites and from any substances which in numbers or concentrations constitute a potential danger to human health and which meets the quality standards specified in the Regulations.</p>  <p>  The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that Irish Water can collect charges from each customer in receipt of water services provided by it.  The Act also provides that responsibility for the independent economic regulation of the water sector is assigned to the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and the CER has been given statutory responsibility for protecting the interests of customers.  The Water Charges Policy Direction issued to the CER in July 2014 referred to a number of matters relating to domestic water charges, including where the quality of water services provided by Irish Water to its customers is impaired or where services are reduced or restricted.  Where customers are subject to a drinking water restriction notice, including where this is due to non-compliance with THM standards, affected customers will receive a 100% discount to the water supply portion of their bill for the duration of the restriction.</p>  <p>  Irish Water has put in place measures to minimise potential THM breaches.  These include the development of a THM formation potential monitoring programme, to evaluate the effects of critical individual parameters on THM formation, their interaction, correlation and variability, in order to identify high THM formation potential sources.  This in turn will inform mitigation measures for the proposed modification/augmentation of treatment processes up stream of disinfection.</p></reply>

Measures available include draught proofing, attic insulation, lagging jackets for hot water tanks, low energy light bulbs and cavity wall insulation.  These energy efficient upgrades are provided free of charge to the customer.  Since the commencement of the scheme, over 112,000 homes in energy poverty have received these upgrades with a total Government investment of nearly &euro;137m.</p>  <p>  In 2012 the eligibility criteria for the Better Energy Warmer Homes scheme were broadened in an attempt to include more households at risk of energy poverty.  To be eligible for the Better Energy Warmer Homes scheme a person must be in receipt of one of the following: a fuel allowance under the National Fuel Scheme; Job Seekers Allowance for more than six months (and having children under 7); or Family Income Support.</p>  <p>  Households in receipt of either Invalidity or Disability Allowance may qualify for a fuel allowance payment from the Department of Social Protection.

The company recently sold the Whiddy Island oil storage facilities in Bantry to Zenith Energy Ireland Limited but continue to operate the refinery at Whitegate.  The company has confirmed that no decision has yet been taken in respect of its future.</p><p>In July 2013, a report on the strategic case for oil refining on the island of Ireland, commissioned by my Department, was published.  The study found that the existing oil import facilities on the island of Ireland taken as a whole offer a robust infrastructure that could provide comfortable alternatives in the event of a serious disruption at any one of the six principal oil ports.  The oil ports could supply the total oil demand, regardless of any future decisions on the operation of Whitegate as either a refinery or terminal.  The development of the Irish motorway network has been significant in improving oil security of supply in recent years, facilitating the transport of oil from key ports throughout the island.  Work with counterparts in Northern Ireland is ongoing with a view to enhancing contingency planning in both jurisdictions.</p><p>Following publication of the report, the Government's primary conclusion on the strategic case for oil refining is that the presence of an operational refinery on the island provides flexibility, enhancing the options available to the State in the event of an oil supply disruption, by providing an alternative source of product thus mitigating a complete reliance on product imports. </p><p>In light of that conclusion, the Government had agreed that my Department should liaise with the Irish oil industry and appropriate public bodies to determine any policy options that might facilitate the commercial future of refining in Ireland. I expect to be in a position to brief Government on the available policy options shortly.</p><p>The Irish oil industry is fully privatised, liberalised and deregulated and there is no price control on petroleum products in Ireland.  The retail price of LPG is therefore not a matter in which I have any role or function. While the regulation of natural gas tariffs is a function of the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), the CER has no function in regard to the setting of the retail price of LPG, which is a by-product of oil.  While the CER has responsibility for the regulation of the natural gas market and has a safety responsibility for LPG distribution pipelines, it does not have any function or responsibility as regards commercial arrangements between LPG suppliers and their customers.</p></reply>

The delivery of the internal energy market is crucial to achieving the key goals of energy policy - energy security, competitiveness and environmental sustainability.  The methodology for harmonisation and integration of cross border electricity markets is set out in the 2009 "Third Energy Package" - a package of EU Regulations and Directives. Significant progress with the implementation of the package has been achieved.  Some of the detailed rules are still being developed and negotiated through the development of network codes and guidelines, particularly with regard to the European electricity markets.</p>  <p>  Ireland is not implementing the codes and guidelines differently from other Member States.  The network codes and guidelines, once agreed by Member States and the European Commission, will become legally binding European Regulations.</p>  <p>  There are significant differences between the all-island wholesale electricity market and other European wholesale markets.  Consequently, Ireland and Northern Ireland have secured an extension to the deadline for the implementation of one of the guidelines, the Capacity Allocation and Congestion Management (CACM) Guideline.  Ireland must be compliant with all aspects of CACM by 31 December 2017, whereas other Member States will introduce the provisions of this guideline after it comes into force, expected later in 2015.</p></reply>

In 2013, 7.8% of Ireland's overall energy requirements were met from renewable sources, with energy from biomass accounting for 3.2%.</p>  <p>  To date wind energy has proved to be the most commercial renewable energy technology in the Irish electricity market.  In 2013, 16.5% of Ireland's electricity demand was met by wind generation.  Nevertheless, diversification of the renewable generation portfolio in the longer term will be important for creating a sustainable, carbon free, electricity system. In this regard, biomass will have a role to play.  Electricity generated from biomass is already supported through the three REFIT schemes and, depending on electricity demand, the full implementation of current policies could mean that up to 5% of electricity may be generated from biomass in 2020.  Biomass is likely, however, to have a more significant role to play in the heat and transport sectors where fewer alternative technologies exist. </p>  <p>  In this regard, the analysis underpinning the recently published Draft Bioenergy Plan is that an additional bioenergy focussed measure in the heat sector would represent the most cost effective means of meeting a number of different policy goals, including reducing the emerging gap to meeting 12% renewable energy in the heat sector.  Accordingly, the draft plan recommends the introduction of a Renewable Heat Incentive to incentivise larger heat users in the industrial and commercial sector to change to heating solutions that produce heat from renewable sources. </p>  <p>  The design of the Renewable Heat Incentive scheme will commence this year and will include public consultation, the first stage of which will be launched shortly.  Once designed, it will require State Aid clearance from the European Commission and further Government approval. Subject to these approvals, it is proposed to have the scheme in place in 2016.</p></reply>

I have no role with regard to the independent process through which applications for planning permissions for renewable energy installations are considered or enforced.</p>  <p>  Wind Energy Planning Guidelines were published by the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government in 2006.  The document is currently being revised. Sections 5.14 and 7.19 give guidance in relation to decommissioning and reinstatement of wind farms. </p>  <p>  I understand that plans for decommissioning should be outlined at the planning stage, and decommissioning of a wind energy development must be assessed once electricity ceases to be generated. Issues to be addressed include restorative measures, the removal of above ground structures and equipment, and landscaping. </p>  <p>  I understand decommissioning and reinstatement conditions requiring the lodgment of financial bonds have been used in the past to try to ensure that decommissioning will take place in a responsible manner.  However, the Wind Energy Planning Guidelines (2006) recognise that the use of long-term bonds to secure satisfactory reinstatement of sites, upon cessation of projects, put unreasonable burdens on developers given the long life spans involved in wind energy developments.  I am advised that the recycling value of turbine components, particularly copper and steel, should more than adequately cover the financial costs of the decommissioning.  Accordingly, the Guidelines do not recommend the use of long-term bonds.</p>  <p>  Finally, a planning authority may condition a developer to agree a final plan, including decommissioning provisions, prior to commencement of construction in order to comply with planning.  Some planning authorities require a Decommissioning and Rehabilitation Plan to be submitted with the planning application, and notice may need to be given to the local authority in advance of decommissioning work.</p></reply>

These schemes were introduced to incentivise the development of the renewable electricity generation capacity necessary to allow Ireland to meet its renewable energy targets, including a target of 40% of electricity demand from renewable generation by 2020. This target must be achieved in order for Ireland to meet its binding obligation of 16% of total energy demand to be from renewable sources by 2020.</p><p>The existing feed-in tariff schemes are a very cost effective tool to support renewable energy development relative to other EU Member States.  Ireland's approach was confirmed as one of the most cost effective within the EU by a report published by the Council of European Energy Regulators in January this year.</p><p>The schemes are supported by the electricity consumer through the Public Service Obligation (PSO) levy.  The PSO levy for each year is determined in the annual PSO decision published by the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) on its website.  The figures for each year include a projection for the forthcoming PSO period and a reconciliation of costs against the projection for the PSO period two years previously.  In other words, the figure for 2014/15 projects the amount required to be paid to generators for that period and includes any reconciliation associated with the 2012/13 PSO period.</p><p>While the majority of projects supported under these schemes are for wind generation, the subsidies are not currently broken down by technology.

Wood Mackenzie furnished their Final Report to my predecessor at end May 2014.</p>  <p>  In June 2014 Government approval was received to revise Ireland's oil and gas fiscal terms along the lines recommended by Wood Mackenzie.</p>  <p>  A key recommendation of Wood Mackenzie was that the fiscal terms applying in respect of new petroleum authorisations (which include licensing options and exploration licences) should be revised to ensure a higher share for the State from the most profitable fields should commercial discoveries of oil or gas be made at some point in the future.  The level of profits arising from a field depend on a combination of factors including, the volume of recoverable gas or oil, the cost of developing and operating the infrastructure, the price of gas or oil over the life of the field, together with the timing and profile of production.</p>  <p>  To achieve this higher share Wood Mackenzie recommended an increase in the marginal tax take from 40% to 55% (comprising corporation tax and a proposed petroleum production tax). </p>  <p>  In addition Wood Mackenzie recommended that the revised fiscal terms should include a minimum payment (petroleum production tax) at a rate of 5% which would function like a royalty and would result in the State receiving a share of revenue in every year that a field is selling production.</p>  <p>  It is intended to give operational effect to this approach in the Finance Bill 2015 with the revised fiscal terms applying to petroleum authorisations issued after June 2014.</p>  <p>  The Wood Mackenzie Report and recommendations, and the Government response to same, were debated in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on the 3rd of July 2014.</p>  <p>  Application of the revised oil and gas fiscal terms as proposed for the Finance Bill 2015 will, on enactment, be a matter for the Revenue Commissioners.</p>  <p>  I am informed that the Revenue Commissioners have a statutory obligation to observe confidentiality for taxpayers' information.  However, mindful of this obligation, the Revenue Commissioners publish net tax receipts aggregated at a sectoral level in their statistical publications.  Taxes relating to oil and gas production activities are usually recorded in such statistics within the category 'Mining and Quarrying'.</p>  <p>  I am also advised that the Revenue Commissioners have a system of risk rating, and that all taxpayers, including petroleum exploration and development companies, are risk rated to ensure full compliance with the tax code.</p></reply>

It also requires an Authorisation to Construct or Reconstruct a Generating Station and a Licence to Generate from the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER).</p><p>The issue of planning permission is a matter between the developer of a wind farm and the relevant planning authority, subject to the Planning Acts, which include requirements for public consultation.  Each planning authority must maintain a detailed register of all planning applications and decisions made under Section 7 of the Planning and Development Act. An Bord Plean&aacute;la also maintain a register of cases determined by the Board which is available at .</p><p>Applications for Authorisations to Construct or Reconstruct a Generating Station and Licences to Generate are assessed by the CER ahead of the granting or refusing of an application for planning permission.  The conditions imposed in the Authorisation and the Licence must be met by the generator, and compliance is monitored by the CER on an ongoing basis.  I do not have a role with regard to the permitting or monitoring of individual wind farms. </p><p>All applicants seeking support under the REFIT schemes must provide evidence of having valid planning permission for the project seeking support.</p><p>Ireland currently has approximately has 2,500MW of renewable electricity generation of which 2,200MW is wind generation.  It is estimated that between 3,500MW and 4,000MW of renewable electricity generation will be required to achieve the target of 40% renewable electricity by 2020. </p><p>Work is being advanced by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, in conjunction with my Department and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, on the review of the 2006 Wind Energy Guidelines.  It is proposed to update the relevant sections of the existing Guidelines as appropriate.  There will also be a number of technical appendices developed to assist planning authorities in relation to noise assessment, monitoring and the setting of planning conditions.  Draft guidelines were published in December 2013 for public consultation.  Submissions were received from 7,500 organisations and members of the public during the public consultation period.  Following consideration of the submissions, the revisions to the Guidelines will be finalised and issued to planning authorities under Section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended). </p><p>I should also highlight that my Department is preparing a Renewable Electricity Policy and Development Framework, which is to be underpinned by a Strategic Environmental Assessment and an Appropriate Assessment.  The proposed Framework will be completed in 2015, and will be a high level strategic policy, which is intended for the guidance of persons seeking development consent primarily in relation to large scale renewable electricity projects, as well as for the guidance of planning authorities, statutory authorities and the public.  The next stage of public consultation will commence shortly with the publication of the scoping report.</p></reply>

I have not received any further correspondence on the matter to date. </p><p>The purpose of the Local Improvement Scheme is to provide funding for roads and laneways that Councils have not taken in charge; that is, private roads and laneways.  However, the maintenance and improvement of these is, in the first instance, a matter for the relevant landowner.</p><p>At present, local authorities may use up to 15% of their initial Discretionary Grant towards the Local Improvement Scheme should they wish to do so.  The local contribution for these schemes is 20% of the total cost of the project.  Furthermore, it is open to local authorities to supplement the percentage of their Discretionary Grant that they can use for the LIS with their own resources.</p><p>Some local authorities want a ring-fenced LIS allocation for private roads while others prefer to put the funding into public roads.  I remain of the view that this decision is best made at a local level.</p><p>Local authorities were notified of their allocations in Circular RW 2/2015.  Details of the 2015 regional and local road grant allocations to each council are available in the D&aacute;il library.</p></reply>

The form itself was subsequently prescribed by SI 541 of 2011.  </p>  <p>  So that there is no misunderstanding I should clarify that, as the section makes clear, one of the 2 identical statements is to be signed by the individual and retained by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, while the other is retained by the individual.  In this way, both the Guards and the individual retain identical records of the test results.  It is not the case that reports are provided in both English and Irish and it would not be appropriate to delete the section. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied following consultation with the Garda&iacute; that there is no requirement to change the Road Traffic Act 2010 to make amendments of the kind suggested by the Deputy.</p></reply>

SCP funding is focused on community sports where the maximum number of people can participate.  The Department may deem any organisation that places restrictions on membership or usage as a private organisation and therefore not eligible for SCP funding.  In general, if applications for membership need to be approved by a membership committee or new members must be nominated by several current members then these run the risk of being considered a private club.  In considering if an applicant might be commercial the fee structure for members is examined, along with responses to the questions on page 13 of the application form:  what groups will use the facility? and how do you plan to encourage disadvantaged groups and people to use the proposed facility?  Simply charging for use of a facility does not indicate that an organisation is commercial but the charges should not be prohibitively high. If an organisation is concerned that its application may be considered private or commercial it should contact the Department for advice.</p>  <p>  I do not propose to ring-fence funding for particular sports in advance of the allocations. </p>  <p>  I would advise all those who are interested to ensure that they are registered on the online system before 5pm on Friday 10th April 2015 (if not already registered) and to submit their online applications well in advance of the deadline of 5pm on Friday 24 April 2015.</p></reply>

In accordance with the legislation, certain types of accommodation, such as hotels and guesthouses are statutorily obliged to register, whereas other accommodation segments, such as B&amp;Bs are not.  In addition to the statutory regulation, F&aacute;ilte Ireland also offers a quality assurance approval and listing system for the non-statutory tourist accommodation segment.  This is voluntary and includes, among others, smaller self-catering schemes, Irish home B&amp;Bs and historic houses with accommodation.  There are no plans at present to amend the current systems.</p>  <p>  Were the mandatory registration scheme to be extended to cover other forms of accommodation, it would have to be self-financing.  Given that such a system would require substantial administration and policing to be effective, the value of putting this in place is questionable.  For small, seasonal businesses in particular, the potential administrative burden and associated costs of a mandatory registration scheme could adversely impact on their viability.</p>  <p>  F&aacute;ilte Ireland has previously considered the matter of mandatory registration for B&amp;Bs in particular.  Although Northern Ireland operates a system of mandatory registration for B&amp;Bs, research and international benchmarking by F&aacute;ilte Ireland has established that the registration of B&amp;Bs is not standard practice internationally.  Countries that are recognised for having a quality B&amp;B product, such as England, Scotland, Wales, France and New Zealand, do not require mandatory registration. </p>  <p>  On balance, I believe that the current approach is in keeping with best practice internationally and meets the needs of both the industry and the consumer.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-03-24a.2467.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/973" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015032400113#WRKKK02700"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1011 to 1015, inclusive, and 1018 together. </p><p>Compensation has been paid under a number of schemes administered by my Department in respect of raised bog habitat nominated for designation as special areas of conservation under the EU Habitats Directive. </p><p>In 1999, a voluntary bog purchase scheme was introduced under which domestic turf cutters could sell their plots at agreed rates. These rates were subsequently increased in 2004, following agreement with the farming organisations under the Partnership talks. In May 2010, the then Government announced the closure of the voluntary bog purchase scheme to new applicants. While my Department is continuing to process applications in respect of special areas of conservation received before this date, it has received no applications from Ardgraigue Bog under this scheme.</p><p>In May 2010, an interim compensation payment scheme was established. This provided interim funding to those who had been cutting turf on raised bog special areas of conservation nominated for designation between 1997 and 1999. As Ardgraigue Bog was not one of these sites, this scheme did not apply to that bog. Consequently, no applications under the scheme were received for the site.  </p><p>This scheme has been replaced by the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme, established in 2011.</p><p>The qualifying criteria for the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme, administered by my Department, are that: <blockquote>- The claimant must have a legal interest in one of the raised bog special areas of conservation &ndash; ownership or turbary right;<br /><br />- The claimant must have been the owner or entitled to exercise turbary rights on the land in question on 25 May 2010;<br /><br />- The turbary on the site must not be exhausted;<br /><br />- The claimant must have been cutting turf on the land in question during the relevant five year period; and<br /><br />- No turf cutting or associated activity is ongoing on the property.</blockquote>The cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme has applied to Ardgraigue Bog special area of conservation since 2012 and 25 applications under the scheme for this site have been received and acknowledged by my Department. A total of 60 payments have been made in respect of the applications received. In addition, 13 once-off incentive payments of &euro;500 have been made to applicants who have signed and returned legal agreements under the scheme to my Department. </p><p>This equates to some 21 individual applicants having received payments under the scheme thus far. </p><p>Table 1 below shows the number of applications received in respect of Ardgraigue Bog broken down by year. Table 2 below shows the number of payments made in respect of Ardgraigue Bog broken down by year.</p><p>In one case relating to Ardgraigue Bog special area of conservation, compensation has been paid under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme to the land owner/turbary right holder and to two other applicants who had been cutting turf on the same bog plot. </p><p>Details of the amounts paid in each case in respect of year 1 (2012), year 2 (2013), and year 3 (2014) of the scheme are set out in Table 3 below.</p><p>I am advised that, at this stage, no applicant from this site has been informed by my Department that he/she does not fulfil the qualifying criteria of the scheme. While it may be anticipated that there will be instances where applicants will be informed that they do not fulfil the qualifying criteria, current priority is being given to providing compensation to those who clearly appear to fulfil the criteria on the basis of the information they have provided. In addition, establishing ownership rights is particularly complex and my Department is working with owners of land and turbary right holders to assist them in this regard.</p><p>My Department has not to date sought repayment of any compensation paid to applicants from this site.</p><p>Table 1 - Number of applications by year received under the Cessation of Turf Cutting Compensation Scheme in respect of Ardgraigue Bog <table><tr><th bgcolor="#FFFFFF"></th><th bgcolor="#FFFFFF">2012</th><th bgcolor="#FFFFFF">2013</th><th bgcolor="#FFFFFF">2014</th></tr><tr><td>Applications Received</td><td>19</td><td>4</td><td>2</td></tr></table></p><p>Table 2 - Number of turf deliveries and payments made to date under the Cessation of Turf Cutting Compensation Scheme for Ardgraigue Bog <table><tr><th bgcolor="#FFFFFF" rowspan="2">Total Number of Applications Received</th><th bgcolor="#FFFFFF" colspan="3">Turf Deliveries</th><th bgcolor="#FFFFFF" colspan="3">Payments (Total of 60)</th><th bgcolor="#FFFFFF" rowspan="2">Legal Agreement Payments </th></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF">Year 2012</td><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF">Year 2013</td><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF">Year 2014</td><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF">Year 2012</td><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF">Year 2013</td><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF">Year 2014</td></tr><tr><td>25</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>16</td><td>18</td><td>26</td><td>13</td></tr></table></p><p>Table 3 &ndash; Cessation of Turf Cutting Compensation Scheme &ndash; Ardgraigue Bog </p><p>Compensation made to Land Owner or Turbary Right Holder Applicant and to Other Applicants on the same bog plot for 2012 to 2014<table><tr><th>Case Number</th><th>Paid for 2012</th><th>Paid for 2013</th><th>Paid for 2014</th><th>Legal Agreement Payments </th></tr><tr><td>Case 1 (Owner/Turbary Right Holder)</td><td>&euro;1,500</td><td>&euro;1,518</td><td>&euro;1,521</td><td>&euro;500</td></tr><tr><td>Case 2 (Cutting on Case 1's plot)</td><td>&euro;1,500</td><td>&euro;1,518</td><td>&euro;1,521</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Case 3 (Cutting on Case 1's plot)</td><td>&euro;1,500</td><td>&euro;1,518</td><td>&euro;1,521</td><td>0</td></tr></table></p></reply>
