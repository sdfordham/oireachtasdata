The details of the Defence Forces average end of month overseas strengths are as follows.  In 2012 there were 122 Officers and 310 Enlisted Personnel; in 2013 there were 127 Officers and 310 Enlisted Personnel; in 2014 there were 131 Officers and 288 Enlisted Personnel; and in 2015 there were 134 Officers and 296 Enlisted Personnel. </p>  <p>  Officers on overseas deployments are assigned to command and staff roles and duties commensurate with their rank and with the requirements of the appointment.   </p>  <p>  The ranks for appointments to overseas Mission Headquarters are designated either by UN or the Mission's Operations Commander.  Situations may arise where the requirements of the Mission change.  In 2014, for example, UNDOF Mission HQ stopped employing Enlisted Personnel from Troop Contributing Nations.  Ireland assigned an Officer to the Mission HQ in this particular case.      </p>  <p>  I also understand that in a small number of instances Enlisted Personnel have not deployed as the overseas package available for the particular deployment was considered unsatisfactory.  Given the voluntary nature of overseas appointments it is considered inappropriate by military authorities to mandate military personnel to deploy in such circumstances.</p></reply>

Against this background, the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) provides a framework for developing and furthering bilateral co-operation and relations between the Department of Defence and the UK Ministry of Defence.</p>  <p>  The signing of the Memorandum of Understanding places already existing cooperation arrangements in the Defence area between Ireland and the UK on a more formal and transparent footing, while fully respecting the differing policy positions and security arrangements of both States. </p>  <p>  The approach to developing the Action Plan has been agreed with the UK.  The Action Plan will contain a detailed programme of bilateral co-operation activities for the forthcoming year and set the objectives for the following two years. Discussions in this regard are ongoing.   </p>  <p>  The MoU and the associated Action Plan will support the development of a greater mutual understanding of the policy considerations underlying our respective actions and engagement in multilateral arrangements including with the EU and the UN.  It will also support training exchanges and staff exchanges involving both civil and military personnel.  Finally it will provide opportunities for more joint and collaborative work in support of international peace and security including possible contributions to UN peacekeeping operations.</p></reply>

Following on from this CRE submission and subsequent bilateral discussions, an overall financial envelope for the 2015-2017 period was outlined, and the 2015 Revised Estimates Volume (REV) provided an allocation of some &euro;677m for the Defence Vote.</p>  <p>  This allocation provides some &euro;496m towards the pay and allowances of up to 9,500 Permanent Defence Force (PDF) personnel, 625 civilian employees, 350 civil servants, 18 chaplains and 14 army nurses.  It also provides &euro;181m for non-pay costs relating to the replacement and maintenance of essential equipment and operational costs. </p>  <p>  Decisions on resource allocation are made on a prioritised basis in accordance with any assessed operational need.  However, I am confident that the 2015 Defence allocation is adequate to deliver effective services across all of the roles assigned by Government.   </p>  <p>  Work continues on the development of a new White Paper on Defence.  Working groups comprising civil and military representatives from the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces are considering future operational demands and the defence capabilities required to meet these demands.  I anticipate that the final draft of the White Paper will be submitted to Government for approval by the end of July.  Subject to Government approval, the White Paper on Defence will then be published.</p></reply>

During this inspection, it became apparent that the servicing and repair of the aircraft would have involved a significantly higher level of investment than was anticipated. <font color="#1F497D"> </font>Given the number of flying hours achieved and the age of the craft it was decided that the aircraft would be withdrawn from service and would not be returned back to Ireland.</p><p>The Department concluded the sale for the aircraft on an as seen basis with a US based company in December 2014.  Meanwhile, the Ministerial Air Transport Service (MATS) is being provided by the Learjet 45 aircraft.</p><p>An inter-Departmental MATS Review Group has been established to examine options for the future provision of a service that will continue to provide the President, members of the Government and accompanying officials with an independent means of international air transport.  When the Group has completed its deliberations and made its recommendations, I will bring a Report to Government with recommendations on how best to provide a MATS service into the future.</p></reply>

The capabilities being researched and developed by the Defence Forces in cooperation with research companies and institutions are wide ranging.  They cover capabilities such as Maritime Surveillance; Energy Conservation; Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) research including CBRN Protection, and Improvised Explosives Devices (IED) detection and destruction.  Such capabilities may be used at home and also abroad on crisis management missions and operations including humanitarian and peace-keeping missions.</p>  <p>  Projects proposed by institutes and companies are firstly considered and cleared by Enterprise Ireland and then submitted to the Defence Enterprise Committee for consideration.  The Committee consists of personnel from the Department of Defence, the Defence Forces and Enterprise Ireland.  All capabilities to be researched are vetted and agreed at the highest level in the Defence Organisation to ensure compatibility with the roles assigned to the Defence Forces by the Government.   </p>  <p>  In addition to the Enterprise Ireland supported projects, the Defence Forces, through the Naval Service as a partner, are also engaged in the Irish Maritime and Energy Cluster (IMERC) located in the National Maritime College of Ireland which aims to unlock Ireland's maritime and energy potential in support of the Government's policy of Harnessing our Ocean Wealth.  The Naval Service engagement in this regard focuses on value creating partnerships by linking researchers, technology developers and industry partners in the development of dual use technologies for use principally in the maritime environment.  The current schedule of companies and projects is currently being updated and my Department will provide it directly to the Deputy once it is finalised.</p></reply>

They are based in the mission headquarters in Kabul.  These personnel are employed in training and advisory roles in Operations, Training and Support appointments.

The role of the Air Corps as set out in the White Paper is to provide a range of military and non-military air services.  The Air Corps has traditionally discharged a mix of functions based on a need to supply a range of services such as air ambulance, fishery protection, and support to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in addition to their military roles.</p>  <p>  The White Paper provides that for the Air Corps to exceed this  capability would require a level of investment in personnel, equipment and infrastructure which could not be justified.  Accordingly the Air Corps is not tasked, or equipped, to monitor or respond to unauthorised aircraft overflying Irish Airspace. </p>  <p>  Work is continuing apace on the development of a new White Paper on Defence.  A key part of the development of the new White Paper is consideration of the current security environment and challenges that may emerge into the future.  Working groups comprising civil and military representatives from the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces are considering likely future operational demands and the defence capabilities required to meet these demands.  This work will inform recommendations regarding defence provision.</p></reply>

This highlighted continued volatility in the African nation two years after France helped retake territory from al Qaeda-linked militants.  No Irish personnel were involved in the incident.</p>  <p>  Ireland is currently contributing ten (10) personnel to the EU Training Mission in Mali (EUTM Mali).  Six (6) Defence Forces personnel are deployed to the joint UK/Irish infantry Training Team.  One Lieutenant Colonel is serving as Executive Officer to the Training Task Force based in Koulikoro, and three Irish personnel occupy staff appointments in the mission Headquarters in Bamako.</p>  <p>  The training of the Malian Defence and Security Forces is specifically provided for in relevant United Nations Security Council Resolutions, the most recent one being 2164 (2014); this commends the role of the European Union Training Mission (EUTM Mali) in Mali to provide training and advice for the Malian Defence and Security Forces towards contributing to the strengthening civilian authority and respect for human rights.     </p>  <p>  During my visit to Mali last week, I had the opportunity of meeting the EUTM Mali Mission Commander, Brigadier General Garcia Vaquero, and the Irish troops serving with the mission.  The visit also afforded me an opportunity to see, at first hand, the dedication and professionalism of military personnel and the tremendous work done by them to train and mentor the Malian Armed Forces to improve their military capacity. I conveyed to the troops our deep appreciation for the outstanding manner in which they continue to perform their duties on overseas service.   </p>  <p>  The security situation in Mali continues to be kept under review by the Defence Forces who actively monitor developments in the region.

During the meeting, EU Foreign Ministers reiterated their support for the ongoing UN-facilitated talks on Libya, and the efforts of United Nations Special Representative Bernadino Le&oacute;n to achieve a sustainable ceasefire between the parties and a political solution to the crisis.</p>  <p>  EU Foreign Ministers also agreed during the Council meeting that the EU stands ready to enhance its support to Libya as soon as any agreement on a Government of National Unity is reached and related security arrangements are in place.  In this context, the Council invited the High Representative and Vice President of the European Commission to present proposals of possible Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) activities, as part of a wider set of policy options, to support the potential outcome of the talks.     </p>  <p>  A wide range of possible options is being examined including CSDP activities, rule of law, economic actions etc.  Any initiative will be undertaken in close coordination with the UN which is leading the negotiations. </p>  <p>  With regard to a possible deployment of Defence Forces personnel to a future EU mission in Libya, Ireland is hopeful that the promise of a political resolution to the crisis in Libya can be fulfilled.  In the event that the EU was to launch a CSDP mission in Libya, this would require a request from a Libyan Government of National Unity. Furthermore, no mission could be launched by the EU without unanimity amongst all 28 Member States.  Any question of Defence Forces personnel participation will be examined at that stage.</p></reply>

This was introduced as a measure of solidarity with other workers.  Those whose income is less than &euro;100 per week do not pay PRSI and return their income under PRSI class M.  All public office holders are liable to pay the contribution regardless of age. </p>  <p>  All workers pay PRSI on their earnings from employment or self-employment.  In the case of individuals who have more than one income source, PRSI is generally paid on all forms of income.  </p>  <p>  Up to 2013 certain exemptions applied to specific groups.  The removal of the exemption in relation to modified rate contributors with income from a trade or profession was introduced in the Social Welfare and Pensions (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2013 and the removal of the exemption in respect of employed contributors and occupational pensioners under age 66 years whose only additional income is unearned income was introduced in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2013.  </p>  <p>  This means that, with effect from 1 January 2014, unearned income such as rental income, investment income, dividends and interest on deposits and savings of the individuals who were previously exempt, is liable to PRSI at 4% provided the person is a chargeable person in accordance with the Revenue definition.  </p>  <p>  A chargeable person does not include a PAYE taxpayer (i) who does not have other income or (ii) who has an element of other insignificant income that is fully taxed through the Office of the Revenue Commissioners PAYE system (Revenue regard amounts not exceeding &euro;3,174 as insignificant).  Individuals with income exceeding &euro;3,174 must pay and file under Revenue's self-assessing system. </p>  <p>  This income is chargeable at the class K PRSI rate of 4%.  This PRSI charge does not give rise to any additional social insurance benefits.  Individuals may however qualify separately for social insurance entitlements based on PRSI paid on other sources of income i.e. PRSI paid on income from their employment.</p>  <p>  Self-employed persons are liable for PRSI at the class S rate of 4% which entitles them to access long-term benefits such as State pension (contributory) and widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner's pension (contributory) as well as guardians payment (contributory), maternity benefit and adoptive benefit.  Ordinary employees who have access to the full range of social insurance benefits pay class A PRSI at the rate of 4%.  In addition, their employers make a PRSI contribution of 10.75% in respect of their employees, resulting in the payment of a combined 14.75% rate per employee under full-rate PRSI class A.  (For employees earning less than &euro;356 per week, the rate of employer's PRSI is 8.5%).</p>  <p>  Self-employed workers who find themselves out of business and become unemployed or ill may access social welfare supports by establishing eligibility to assistance-based payments such as jobseeker's allowance and disability allowance.  In the case of jobseeker's allowance they can apply for the means-tested jobseeker's allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.  As in the case of a non-self-employed claimant for jobseeker's allowance or disability allowance, the means of husband/wife, civil partner or co-habitant will be taken into account in deciding on entitlement to a payment.</p>  <p>  If income from self-employment falls below &euro;5,000 in a contribution year or a person is unable to work, he or she may opt to pay voluntary contributions. </p>  <p>  To become a voluntary contributor a person must:</p>  <p>  -  have paid at least 468 weeks PRSI (since 6 April 2014) in either employment or self-employment,</p>  <p>  -  apply within 12 months of the end of the tax year during which he/she last paid compulsory insurance or were last awarded a credited contribution,</p>  <p>  -  agree to pay voluntary contributions from the start of the contribution week that follows the week in which he/she leaves compulsory insurance.</p>  <p>  To become a voluntary contributor on or after 6 April 2015 a person must have previously paid 520 weeks PRSI.</p>  <p>  My Department undertakes advertising and awareness activities to ensure that all members of the public are made aware of their rights and entitlements and that they are kept informed of significant changes and improvements in schemes and services as they occur.</p>  <p>  Information on the full range of social welfare schemes and services is available from the Department's INTREO/local office network and the nationwide network of Citizens Information Centres.  In addition, many people access information on the Department's and Citizen Information Board's websites.</p></reply>

The service, which differentiates between mortgage information and mortgage advice, has three elements:</p><p>-  The website which was developed as the key online access portal for general mortgage information and advice and launched in June 2012.  To date there has been over 337,000 visits to the site.</p><p>-  The Mortgage Arrears Information Helpline (phone 0761 074050) established in August 2012, provides general mortgage arrears information and signposting in relation to the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears and other supports available for those in mortgage arrears or pre-arrears. To date the helpline has dealt with almost 13,000 calls.</p><p>-  The service to provide independent financial advice to mortgage holders who are being presented with long term mortgage resolution proposals by their lenders was launched in September 2012.  The advice is provided by a panel of accountants drawn from members of the main accountancy institutes in Ireland.  A county by county panel with over 1,500 participating accountants is in place and their contact details are available on .  Borrowers are free to choose their own advisor from this panel and the lender will pay &euro;250 to the accountant of the borrower's choice for the provision of this independent financial advice. </p><p>The Central Bank collates the information relating to the number of borrowers who have availed of the independent financial advice service on a quarterly basis, commencing in quarter 1 2013.  The data supplied does not relate exactly to the reporting period as there will be delays between the time the lender makes the long-term resolution offer to the borrower, the meeting with the accountant and the receipt by the lender of the invoice.  At the end of Q4 2014, 1,207 borrowers have availed of the independent financial advice service.</p></reply>

This claim was subject to periodical review.  At the time of the most recent review in August 2014, the amount of rent payable by the person concerned, as stated in his review form, was &euro;1000 per calendar month.  Prior to him making a telephone call to the  Rents Unit on 9<sup>th</sup>March 2015 in which he advised that he and his family had already moved out of their rented accommodation, the Department was unaware that his rent had further increased, or that he and his family had left their accommodation.  Consequently his claim for rent supplement was then closed.  In addition the person concerned stated that he did not wish to make a new application for rent supplement or have an information pack sent to him.</p><p>Had the Department been aware earlier of their circumstances this family would have been referred to the housing charity Threshold under the Interim Tenancy Sustainment Protocol.  This would have enabled the family's housing needs to be addressed prior to them moving from their accommodation, and a recommendation would have been made to the Department with regard to their claim for rent supplement.</p><p>The person concerned and his family are being provided with emergency temporary accommodation by the local authority who are presumably looking, via a Housing Action Team (HAT), for more suitable long-term accommodation.  If this is to be in the private rented sector then he should contact the Department, directly or via the HAT, to claim rent supplement payment.</p></reply>

Budget 2014 further extended the reduced rates of jobseeker's allowance to recipients under 26 years of age. This is a targeted measure aimed at protecting young people from welfare dependency. It aims to incentivise young jobseeker's allowance recipients to avail of education and training opportunities.  If a jobseeker in receipt of the reduced jobseeker's allowance rate participates on an education or training programme they will receive a higher weekly payment of &euro;160. Any change to provision in this area would be a matter for Government to consider in a Budgetary context.</p>  <p>  Based on data from February, 2015 the additional full year cost of providing a weekly rate of &euro;188 for all jobseeker's allowance recipients aged 25 and under is some &euro;143m.</p>  <p>  To guard against the development of welfare dependency I believe that it is necessary to provide young jobseekers with a strong financial incentive to engage in education or training or to take up employment.  If they do not improve their skills, it will be much more difficult for them to avail of job opportunities as the economy recovers and they are at risk of becoming long term unemployed from a young age.</p>  <p>  The Government's primary strategy to tackle youth unemployment is through policies to create the environment for a strong economic recovery by promoting competitiveness and productivity. Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth and the availability of productive employment for young people.  This strategy has been succeeding, with an increase of over 80,000 in employment over the last two years.</p>  <p>  Reflecting the improvement in the labour market, youth unemployment continues to fall. For example the youth unemployment rate in Ireland as estimated by Eurostat was 21.6% in December 2014 as compared to 30.8% in December 2011. However, the Government recognises that as the recovery takes hold, there is a need for additional measures to ensure that as many as possible of the jobs created are taken up by jobseekers and young jobseekers in particular. This is the rationale behind the Government's Pathways to Work strategy and the Youth Guarantee Implementation Plan.</p></reply>

Parental income is calculated as gross income less tax, PRSI, Universal Social Charge, superannuation and union dues. Rent or mortgage repayments are then disregarded, where appropriate, and, finally, a parental allowance of &euro;600 per week per couple plus &euro;50 per week in respect of other dependent children are also disregarded. The balance is assessed at 34% and this constitutes the weekly value of benefit and privilege to the claimant.</p>  <p>  There are two exceptions to this rule. No assessment is made where a son or daughter and his or her spouse/civil partner/partner is living with his/her parents.  In addition, where a person returns to the parental home having had an independent life elsewhere in Ireland or abroad for an appreciable length of time e.g. at least three years, the assessment in this case is &euro;7 per week.</p>  <p>  Social welfare payments such as illness benefit and disability allowance are included in the means assessment as they contribute to the total available income in a household. There are currently no plans to alter these arrangements for the jobseeker's allowance scheme.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that once a person reaches 25 years of age, the value of any benefit and privilege is no longer be regarded as means.</p></reply>

The cost of paying those interns an extra &euro;50 per week would amount to circa &euro;11.76m over a nine month period of an internship. </p><p>A total of 11,606 internships commenced between 30<sup>th</sup>December, 2013 and 18<sup>th</sup>December, 2014.  A contribution of &euro;500 in respect of each of these internships would amount to &euro;5,803,000 in respect of 2014.</p><p>The &euro;50 weekly top-up paid to interns is in acknowledgement of extra expenses that may be incurred over and above those of the normal job search. It is not related to training and development expenses.  There is nothing to prevent a Host Organisations reimbursing an Intern for expenses incurred as part of the internship.  However, expenses should not be provided for normal activities such as travel to and from the main location of the internship.</p><p>The purpose of JobBridge is to help unemployed jobseekers break the cycle whereby they cannot find a job without appropriate experience but cannot find appropriate experience without a job. To date it has been very successful in delivering on this objective with this success being partly attributable to the wide variety of internship opportunities that it supports.</p><p>Given that unemployed jobseekers are drawn from many walks of life and have varying levels of work experience and educational qualifications it is essential that Internship opportunities cover many occupations/disciplines from high skill specialist placements to lower skilled general placements.  Therefore JobBridge opportunities are not confined to the type internships that were, and continue to be a feature of, some 'white collar' professions.</p><p>Pathways to Work 2015 includes a commitment to evaluate a range of activation processes and programmes, including JobBridge.  A high level evaluation work plan has been agreed and endorsed by the Labour Market Council. The Department is currently in the process of implementing the work plan, which will consist of a number of separate evaluations across a number of programmes including JobBridge. These evaluations will assess the impacts of programmes in terms of employment outcomes for participants. It is expected that the evaluation of JobBridge will commence later in 2015 with results anticipated by Q1 2016.</p><p>I have no plans at present to restrict internships in sectors with low levels of progression into employment. JobBridge interns gain marketable skills and work experience that can take them into employment in organisations and sectors other than those with which they participate in JobBridge.  An independent evaluation of JobBridge found only minimal levels of displacement. The Department takes any complaints of abuse of the JobBridge Scheme seriously.  All such complaints are investigated thoroughly, and necessary action is taken, if required.  The Department also operates a monitoring system to ensure that all internships are of a high quality. If any individual knows of specific instances of abuse of JobBridge details should be provided to the Department for investigation.</p><p>Host Organisations are also subject to conditions, including cooling-off periods, to limit any abuse of the scheme. If an internship finishes and the Intern concerned is unsuccessful in gaining employment the Host Organisation is subject to a six month cooling off period before they can re-advertise an internship in the same filed of work.  In circumstances where an intern moves into employment with either the host organisation or another organisation the cooling off period of six months is waived. The Department does not routinely keep records of the number of times the cooling-off period is waived.</p><p>With regard to levels of dissatisfaction interns and host organisation can contact the dedicated JobBridge team, the established Departmental complaints system and the staff at the local Intreo centres to register any concerns that they might have. </p><p>A charter is already in place in the form of a standard agreement that must be signed by the intern and the host organisation. It is not in the form of a statutory obligation as JobBridge is an administrative (i.e., non-statutory) scheme. </p><p>Each host organisation are required to nominate an individual to support and/or mentor the Intern during the placement. This person will have responsibility to ensure that the Intern receives a proper induction, ensure that the work experience as described in the standard agreement is progressing, and that monthly compliance checks are being completed (to ensure the Internship allowance continues to be paid by DSP). If an organisation has a formal mentoring programme, they include the Intern in this programme. The Department provides a range of resources and toolkits to support the mentoring of interns.  Host organisations are instructed to read these carefully before offering an internship.</p><p>First Steps is a new under which employers are being asked to sponsor work experience places of four days duration per week for very disadvantaged young people. All participants will be selected by the Department of Social Protection (not as under JobBridge by the host organisation), will be allocated a dedicated case officer throughout their placement and will receive pre-placement training.  The Department of Social Protection will only select clients who are available for, and whom it believes will benefit from, a First Steps placement.  In such circumstances the Department believes clients should have a very strong reason not to participate and in the absence of such a reason participation should be mandatory.  The short preparation course for participants will be provided by Education and Training Boards and will consist of basic workplace skills and etiquette, timekeeping and communication skills and will last approximately one week.  A total of &euro;57.111m has been allocated for First Steps up to the end of 2017.  As of 19<sup>th</sup>March, 89 places have been committed by host organisations for the First Steps programme.</p><p><b>JobBridge Interns under 25 by County</b><table><tr><th>County</th><th>Finished</th><th>Current</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>DUBLIN</td><td>2,948</td><td>413</td><td>3,361</td></tr><tr><td>CORK</td><td>753</td><td>104</td><td>857</td></tr><tr><td>GALWAY  </td><td>550</td><td>84</td><td>634</td></tr><tr><td>LIMERICK</td><td>454</td><td>88</td><td>542</td></tr><tr><td>DONEGAL</td><td>340</td><td>70</td><td>410</td></tr><tr><td>KILDARE </td><td>343</td><td>56</td><td>399</td></tr><tr><td>TIPPERARY </td><td>319</td><td>63</td><td>382</td></tr><tr><td>WEXFORD</td><td>299</td><td>52</td><td>351</td></tr><tr><td>LOUTH</td><td>289</td><td>52</td><td>341</td></tr><tr><td>WATERFORD</td><td>267</td><td>65</td><td>332</td></tr><tr><td>WESTMEATH</td><td>250</td><td>50</td><td>300</td></tr><tr><td>MEATH</td><td>241</td><td>49</td><td>290</td></tr><tr><td>MAYO</td><td>239</td><td>50</td><td>289</td></tr><tr><td>KERRY</td><td>226</td><td>52</td><td>278</td></tr><tr><td>WICKLOW </td><td>203</td><td>33</td><td>236</td></tr><tr><td>MONAGHAN </td><td>177</td><td>25</td><td>202</td></tr><tr><td>SLIGO  </td><td>171</td><td>29</td><td>200</td></tr><tr><td>CLARE</td><td>163</td><td>31</td><td>194</td></tr><tr><td>LAOIS</td><td>143</td><td>33</td><td>176</td></tr><tr><td>KILKENNY</td><td>144</td><td>23</td><td>167</td></tr><tr><td>OFFALY</td><td>127</td><td>28</td><td>155</td></tr><tr><td>CAVAN</td><td>125</td><td>29</td><td>154</td></tr><tr><td>CARLOW</td><td>119</td><td>17</td><td>136</td></tr><tr><td>ROSCOMMON  </td><td>75</td><td>22</td><td>97</td></tr><tr><td>LONGFORD</td><td>69</td><td>9</td><td>78</td></tr><tr><td>LEITRIM  </td><td>50</td><td>6</td><td>56</td></tr><tr><td>Grand Total</td><td>9,084</td><td>1,533</td><td>10,617</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The theme for this year's forum is &ldquo;Social Innovation for Social Inclusion&rdquo;. The forum is organised by the Department of Social Protection in conjunction with the Community Workers Co-operative and the European Anti-Poverty Network Ireland.</p>  <p>  The forum will incorporate a consultation on updating the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion (NAPinclusion) for the extended period 2015 to 2017. In addition, there will be workshops on social housing, migrant integration, children's services &ndash; prevention and early intervention, and youth exclusion. The forum will also showcase projects involved with the UN Day for the Eradication of Poverty and other social inclusion initiatives.</p>  <p>  Approximately 200 delegates are registered to attend from community and voluntary groups across the country, including people experiencing poverty and social exclusion. Officials from government departments and agencies will also be in attendance.</p>  <p>  The Social Inclusion Monitor 2013 will be published to coincide with the forum. The purpose of the monitor is to report officially on progress towards the national social target for poverty reduction, including the sub-target on child poverty and Ireland's contribution to the Europe 2020 poverty target.</p>  <p>  The forum is an important part of the Government structures to monitor and evaluate the implementation of NAPinclusion. It provides an opportunity for consultation and discussion on social inclusion policies and ensures that the community and voluntary sector has a voice in the development and implementation of policies that affect people in poverty.</p>  <p>  A report on the proceedings at the forum will be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas in due course.</p></reply>

This objective is to be achieved over time by enhancing and prioritising the Intreo engagement with newly unemployed young people, and by maintaining and developing the current range of education, training and employment interventions for young people.</p>  <p>  While the resources under the Youth Guarantee are targeted more towards those with the highest risk of becoming long-term unemployed, all young people signing on enter the engagement process (via Group Engagement sessions) within the first two weeks of signing on. Effectively, therefore, all persons under the age of 25 who become unemployed (the target group at whom policies developed under the Guarantee are aimed) are engaged with by the State's public employment services at an early stage of their period of unemployment.</p>  <p>  The Youth Guarantee Implementation Plan provided for over 28,000 programme opportunities for unemployed young people in 2014.  This figure excludes some 24,000 places provided for young people through PLC courses and apprenticeships.  These PLC and apprenticeship places, together with the wide range of vocational third-level courses provided for the young, although not reserved for unemployed jobseekers, nevertheless contribute to the spirit of the guarantee.</p>  <p>  Approximately 25,000 of these places had been taken up at the end of December 2014.  The estimated full year costs for 28,000 places (excluding PLC and apprenticeships) is &euro;336m. Full data on the actual spend to the end of 2014 is not yet available.</p></reply>

The first is the statutory urban school meals scheme, operated by local authorities and part-financed by the Department.  The second is the school meals local projects scheme through which funding is provided directly to participating schools and local and voluntary community groups who run their own school meals projects.  Despite pressure on the social protection budget, the Government allocated an additional &euro;2 million for the school meals programme in 2015, providing a total allocation of &euro;39 million.</p>  <p>  The additional &euro;2 million allocated to the school meals programme will be used to increase payments to existing schools which are part of the Department of Education and Skill's initiative for disadvantaged schools 'Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools', (DEIS), with a focus on the provision of breakfast clubs. The Department is currently considering options regarding the allocation of the additional funding.</p>  <p>  The school referred to by the Deputy, is a DEIS school, and has received over &euro;239,725 in total funding under the school meals local projects scheme since 2005 and was allocated funding of &euro;18,146 for a lunch club for the current academic year. The Department is reviewing the allocation for the current year and has been in contact with the school directly regarding this matter.</p></reply>

Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives. This is particularly important given the challenge that increased longevity is posing for the future sustainability of the State pension.  Therefore, when assessing whether an individual is entitled to a State pension, and to ensure that they can maximise such entitlement, all contributions (paid or credited) from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account. </p>  <p>  The State already assists those with caring roles to qualify for a State pension (contributory). The homemaker's scheme makes qualification for State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme, which was introduced in 1994, allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age or incapacitated people to be disregarded when a person's social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes.  The effect of this is to reduce the number of years by which their contributions are divided, thereby increasing their yearly average contribution.  Given the valuable nature of the State pension (contributory), those who qualify under the homemaker's scheme still need to fulfil the eligibility requirements for that scheme, and have at least 520 paid contributions over the course of their working lives. </p>  <p>  For those with insufficient contributions to meet the requirements for a State pension (contributory), the State pension system provides alternative methods of support.  If someone has been a carer for nearly all of their adult life and has paid little or no PRSI, they may qualify for a means tested State pension (non-contributory), the maximum personal rate for which is &euro;219, which amounts to just over 95% of the maximum rate of the State pension (contributory).  Alternatively, if their spouse or civil partner is in receipt of a State pension (contributory) they may instead qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult of up to &euro;206.30, which is just under 90% of the maximum personal rate of the State pension (contributory). </p>  <p>  It is expected that a total contributions approach to pension qualification will replace the current average contributions test for State pension (contributory) from 2020, although that date is subject to change.  Issues such as equality of outcomes for women and men, including those who spend some years outside the labour market on caring duties, will be considered carefully in the context of that reform. </p></reply>

Employment must be of a full-time nature of at least 30 hours per week over four days.  The rate of payment depends on the length of time the person is unemployed.

The widowed or surviving civil partner grant is a once-off payment of &euro;6,000 where there is a dependent child. A number of social welfare payments, including State pension and carer's allowance, continue in payment for six weeks following a death.

Ordinary employees who have access to the full range of social insurance benefits pay class A PRSI at the rate of 4%.  In addition, their employers make a PRSI contribution of 10.75% in respect of their employees, resulting in the payment of a combined 14.75% rate per employee under full-rate PRSI class A.  (For employees earning less than &euro;356 per week, the rate of employer's PRSI is 8.5%).</p>  <p>  Self-employed workers who find themselves out of business and become unemployed or ill may access social welfare supports by establishing eligibility to assistance-based payments such as jobseeker's allowance and disability allowance.  In the case of jobseeker's allowance they can apply for the means-tested jobseeker's allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.  As in the case of a non-self-employed claimant for jobseeker's allowance or disability allowance, the means of husband/wife, civil partner or co-habitant will be taken into account in deciding on entitlement to a payment.</p>  <p>  Self-employed people in receipt of jobseeker's allowance have access to the full range of activation measures available through the State.  Given the scale of unemployment levels, the key objective of activation policy and labour market initiatives is to offer assistance to those most in need of support in securing work and achieving financial self-sufficiency.  This policy objective prioritises scarce resources to those in receipt of qualifying welfare payments.  Accordingly the employment services and schemes provided by the Department are focused in the first instance on this cohort of unemployed people.  However, many services are available to the formerly self-employed who are not in receipt of a social welfare payment.</p>  <p>  Some employment services, such as assistance with job-search activities and the use of online job search tools, are available to people if they register with the Department's employment services offices, regardless of their social welfare status.  Unemployed persons, including the previously self-employed, not in receipt of payments may also be eligible to avail of up-skilling opportunities but are not eligible to receive a training allowance while undertaking the course.  Springboard courses are open to people who were previously self-employed, regardless of their social welfare status.</p>  <p>  In September 2013, I published the report of the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare on Extending Social Insurance Coverage for the self-employed.  The Group was asked to examine and report on issues involved in extending social insurance coverage for self-employed people in order to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable, with the requirement that any proposals for change must be cost neutral.</p>  <p>  The Group found that the current system of means tested jobseeker's allowance payments adequately provides cover to self-employed people for the risks associated with unemployment.  In this context, the Group noted that almost 9 out of every 10 self-employed people who claimed the means tested jobseeker's allowance during the three-year period from 2009 to 2011 received payment.  Consequently, the Group was not convinced that there was a need for the extension of social insurance for the self-employed to provide cover for jobseeker's benefit.</p>  <p>  The Group found that extending social insurance for the self-employed was warranted in cases related to long term sickness or injuries.  To this end, the Group recommended that class S benefits should be extended to provide cover for people who are permanently incapable of work, because of a long-term illness or incapacity, through the invalidity pension and the partial capacity benefit schemes.  The Group further recommended that the extension of social insurance in this regard should be on a compulsory basis and that the rate of contribution for class S should be increased by at least 1.5 percentage points.</p>  <p>  This recommendation will require further consideration in conjunction with the findings of the most recent Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund which indicated that the self-employed achieve better value for money compared to the employed when the comparison includes both employer and employee contributions in respect of the employed person.  The Actuarial Review found that the effective annual rate of contribution needed to provide the full rate State pension (contributory), currently available to self-employed contributors, is approximately 15%. </p>  <p>  My colleagues in Government and I will continue to reflect on the findings of the Advisory Group on this issue and will further consider the recommendations contained in the report taking into account future developments in terms of the budgetary and fiscal situation.</p></reply>

Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth and the availability of productive employment for young people. This strategy has been succeeding, with an increase of over 80,000 in employment over the last 2 years. </p><p>However, the Government recognises that as the recovery takes hold, there is a need for additional measures to ensure that as many as possible of the jobs created are taken up by jobseekers and young jobseekers in particular. This is the rationale behind the Government's Pathways to Work strategy and the Youth Guarantee Implementation Plan.</p><p>Within this framework, the Youth Guarantee sets a medium-term objective of ensuring that young people receive an offer of employment within four months of becoming unemployed. The main plank of the guarantee is assistance to young people in finding and securing sustainable jobs. For those who do not find employment, additional offers are provided for. Most such offers (over 70%) are in further education or training. Others are in community-based employment programmes such as CE, Gateway and Tus, or through the JobsPlus employment subsidy for private employment. </p><p>Overall, the Youth Guarantee provided nearly 25,000 places for young people in 2014. This figure excludes some 24,000 places provided for young people through PLC courses and apprenticeships.

Models for the engagement of young people through Intreo have been agreed and will form the basis of the national roll-out of the Youth Guarantee in 2015. Potential refinement of these models may be considered on the basis of outcomes and learning from the Ballymun Youth Guarantee Pilot Project. In addition it is expected the following targets in Pathways to Work 2015 will be met:</p><p>-  The First Steps developmental internships programme for 1500 &ndash; 2000 young people was launched in February 2015. It aims to offer young people you are particularly distant from the labour market a work experience opportunity with sponsor employers.</p><p>-  JobsPlus for Youth was also launched in February; it offers employers who recruit a young person under 25 years of age who was unemployed for four months or more a subsidy of up to &euro;416 per month. The duration unemployed threshold for other age cohorts is 12 months.</p><p>-  Allocate 1,000 places on the T&uacute;s scheme to young people.</p><p>-  Introduce a pilot programme to support young unemployed people to take up opportunities under schemes such as Your First EURES Job.</p><p>-  Ring-fence a minimum of 2,000 training places for under-25s by the Department of Education and Skills, under a follow-up to the Momentum programme.</p><p>-  The Department of Jobs Enterprise and Innovation will make &euro;2.5m available to young entrepreneurs via Micro finance Ireland and other business start-up schemes.</p><p><b>Youth Guarantee Progress YTD: End December 2014</b><table><tr><th>Programme</th><th>Expected full-year intake</th><th>2014</th></tr><tr><td>Youthreach/CTC</td><td>3,300</td><td>3578</td></tr><tr><td>JobBridge (including developmental internship)</td><td>5,000</td><td>3138</td></tr><tr><td>T&uacute;s</td><td>1,000</td><td>1410</td></tr><tr><td>JobsPlus</td><td>1,500</td><td>639</td></tr><tr><td>Momentum</td><td>2,000</td><td>631</td></tr><tr><td>BTEA (excl Momentum)</td><td>3,300</td><td>5301</td></tr><tr><td>BTWEA</td><td>200</td><td>139</td></tr><tr><td>VTOS</td><td>500</td><td>672</td></tr><tr><td>FAS/Solas</td><td>9,500</td><td>8659</td></tr><tr><td>CEB youth Entrepreneurship </td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Training and Mentoring supports</td><td>700</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>CEB/MFI micro-loans for young people</td><td>150</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>International Work Experience and Training</td><td>250</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Gateway</td><td>450</td><td>192</td></tr><tr><td>Community Employment</td><td>500</td><td>600</td></tr><tr><td>Total </td><td>28,350</td><td>24,969</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The Government has consistently stated its commitment to maintaining the post office network as set out in the Programme for Government.  In this regard, the Department of Social Protection will pay over &euro;50m to An Post under a contract for cash payment services to welfare customers this year.   </p>  <p>  The recent issuance of letters to randomly selected recipients of State Pension (Contributory and Non-Contributory), was a trial.  It was being done to determine the best means of communicating with people about payment options.  It was a very small trial in that letters were sent to just under 1% of customers. </p>  <p>  Customer engagement with the trial was entirely voluntary.  There are no negative consequences for customers who chose not to engage.  All payment options (cash, cheque, EFT) continue to be fully available to customers (where relevant).  The Department has not introduced changes nor does it intend to.  </p>  <p>  The move to electronic payments in our society undeniably creates a challenge for the current business model of An Post. In this context I am pleased to note that An Post has tendered for the provision of a new transaction account.  I look forward to that becoming available in the not too distant future as it will provide alternative payment opportunities for this Department's customers.</p></reply>

An Attachment of Earnings Order can be sought if the person is in employment, on a social welfare payment or on a private pension, resulting in the maintenance being deducted at the source.  Under the Family Law Act 1995, it is possible to apply for this attachment at the initial maintenance hearing, if the person applying to court fears that there will be a default.</p>  <p>  This Department complies with all such Family Law Maintenance Orders received by deducting the amount specified on the court order from a social welfare payment which, in turn, may result in a reduction of the One-Parent Family payment.</p></reply>

For persons with average weekly earnings of &euro;90 or less, the full rate of OFP may be paid. Earnings above this limit are assessed at 50% &ndash; up to a maximum average of &euro;425 per week. In addition, to OFP where a lone parent is working a minimum of 19 hours per week they may be entitled to the Family Income Supplement (FIS). The rate of FIS payment will depend on the earnings and the amount of OFP they receive. </p>  <p>  The after school child care (ASCC) scheme, which was introduced in Budget 2013, is a joint initiative between my Department and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs (D/CYA) to provide subsidised after-school child care places to low-income and unemployed persons who make the transition into employment.</p>  <p>  The purpose of the ASCC scheme is to help to offset some of the after-school child care costs that are associated with availing of an employment opportunity in a bid to encourage more individuals to take up employment. The scheme supports those who are unemployed as well as OFP recipients who lose their entitlement to the OFP payment. It applies to persons who take up a job, who increase their days of employment, or who take up a place on a Departmental employment programme. The parental contribution is &euro;15 per week per child and remains at this level if the pick-up service is added and during school holidays when full day childcare is required.</p>  <p>  The ASCC scheme builds on the existing range of approximately 25,000 subsidised childcare places that are available for low income parents. These places are provided by the D/CYA. </p></reply>

To be entitled to CA the applicant must be providing full-time care and attention to a person in need of care who does not normally live in an institution.  These conditions apply whether the carer is or is not resident with the relevant person.</p>  <p>  It is a role of a deciding officer (DO) to determine if an applicant for CA is providing full-time care to the care recipient.  While no specific number of hours per day or per week is defined in legislation, Regulations further define full-time care and attention as continual supervision and frequent assistance throughout the day in connection with normal bodily functions or continual supervision in order to avoid danger to himself or herself i.e. the care recipient.  The DO operates appropriate discretion when assessing whether full-time care and attention is being provided, taking into consideration the circumstances of both the applicant and the person receiving care. </p>  <p>  In certain cases, the DO may request that a local social welfare inspector investigate and report on the relevant circumstances in order to assist the DO in making a fair decision.</p>  <p>  Where a decision is made by a DO that full-time care and attention is not being provided, the applicant may request a review of that decision with or without the provision of additional information or evidence.

As a consequence of this information his claim for rent supplement was reassessed on 10<sup>th</sup>March 2015, based on his combined current income from his widow's contributory pension and his private pension. His new entitlement rate was established and in addition he was found to have been overpaid rent supplement from 5<sup>th</sup>January 2015 to 14<sup>th</sup>March 2015.</p><p>The Department also became aware that the person concerned had obtained part-time employment for 11 weeks in 2014 but had not informed the Rents Unit about this at the time. His entitlement for that period was also reviewed, and it was found that based on his total household income for those weeks, he had no entitlement to rent supplement for the period of this employment. He was therefore also overpaid rent supplement for those weeks.</p><p>The person concerned has been informed of his new rate of entitlement and also that he needs to inform the Rents Unit as to how he intends to repay the overpayment.

The telephone allowance was introduced at a time when telephones were expensive and uncommon and a landline service was the only option available to the client. The market has changed considerably since the introduction of the allowance, with several companies providing a range of services and rates with bundled services including television, telephone, broadband and pay-as-you-go mobiles. In addition, the cost of the telephone allowance scheme has risen each year with the number of eligible clients also increasing significantly. In 2007 there were some 316,000 people receiving the telephone allowance compared with almost 396,000 at the end of September 2013, an increase of 25%. Each year almost 10,000 extra clients became eligible for the allowance because of the increased number of pension recipients.</p>  <p>  The overall concern of the Government in recent budgets has been to protect the primary weekly social welfare rates. Maintaining the rate of the State pension and other core payments is key in protecting people from poverty. To allow us to preserve these core payments, we have had to look very carefully at other additional payments. Accordingly, the telephone allowance was discontinued from 1 January 2014.  This decision provided annual savings of &euro;48 million and meant that the Department was able to retain the other elements of the household benefits package such as the electricity and gas allowance and the television licence. The fuel allowance scheme and the free travel pass were also protected for older people and people with disabilities.  These are valuable supports for recipients.</p>  <p>  I am keenly aware of the impact on the Department's clients and particularly those who are living alone. As the Deputy is aware, in Budget 2015, we partially restored the Christmas Bonus and increased the living alone allowance to &euro;9.00 per week.  In these circumstances, I have no plans to restore the telephone allowance. Any decision to increase the household benefits package would have budgetary consequences and would have to be considered in the context of budget negotiations.</p></reply>

To date it has been very successful in delivering on this objective with this success being partly attributable to the wide variety of internship opportunities that it supports.</p>  <p>  Given that unemployed jobseekers are drawn from many walks of life and have varying levels of work experience and educational qualifications it is essential that Internship opportunities cover many occupations/disciplines from high skill specialist placements to lower skilled general placements.  Therefore JobBridge opportunities are not confined to the type internships that were, and continue to be a feature of, some 'white collar' professions. I am satisfied that the positions referred to can offer valuable work experience to some jobseekers and can, subject to all other conditions of the JobBridge scheme being satisfied, form the basis of a JobBridge internship.</p>  <p>  I would also point out that JobBridge is a voluntary scheme. There is no obligation on a Jobseeker to participate in the scheme or to take up any particular internship. Interns choose to participate and choose the host organisation they wish to work for.  </p></reply>

Assuming that the illicit cigarettes consumed displaced the equivalent full tax paid quantities of cigarettes, the results of these surveys suggest that the losses to the Exchequer in excise duty and VAT were of the order of &euro;210 million in 2013.  This figure represents a significant reduction on the estimates for the years 2009 to 2012 where the estimate of losses were between &euro;240 and &euro;260.  The figures for 2014 are not yet available.   </p>  <p>  Matters relating to the  health costs associated with tobacco consumption are the responsibility of my colleague the Minister for Health.</p></reply>

Neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland, as regulator, interfere in the pricing of insurance products.  The provision of insurance cover and the price at which it is offered is a commercial matter for insurance companies and is based on a proper assessment of the risks they are accepting and the making of adequate provisioning to meet these risks. </p>  <p>  The EU framework for insurance expressly prohibits Member States adopting provisions requiring the prior approval or systematic notification of certain matters including general and special policy conditions and scales of premiums. Furthermore, in the context of non-life insurance, the EU framework provides non-life insurers with the freedom to set premiums, as has been acknowledged in case law by the European Court of Justice (Case C-518/06).</p>  <p>  While price competition is to be welcomed in a functioning competitive market, it is important that it is based on a sustainable business model and is not at the expense of the prudential soundness of insurance companies nor at the expense of consumer protection.  It is the role of the Central Bank, as regulator, to ensure that this is the case.  This includes the power to insist on adequate reserves.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank is responsible for the authorisation and prudential supervision of insurance undertakings authorised in Ireland.  The Central Bank of Ireland also has responsibilities in relation to:</p>  <p>  -  Branch establishments of European Economic Area (EEA) authorised Non-Life Insurance undertakings</p>  <p>  -  EEA authorised Non-Life Insurance undertakings conducting business by way of services</p>  <p>  -  Third country branch establishments i.e. a branch of an insurance undertaking whose head office is locates outside the EEA </p>  <p>  The powers of the Central Bank of Ireland have been enhanced significantly in recent years to ensure that it can bring certainty to the financial position of any firms of concern and to undertake any early intervention measures it considers appropriate.</p></reply>

In this regard, VAT in Ireland is not purely treated as a revenue collecting mechanism. Ireland's VAT rate structure has clear social (e.g. 0% on food etc.) and economic (e.g. 9% on tourism related activities) goals which are in line with the EU VAT Directive.</p><p>The cost associated with abolishing exemptions and reduced rates of VAT would depend on the level at which the standard rate is fixed. At present the standard rate is 23%. However, it would in theory be possible to significantly reduce the VAT policy gap on a revenue neutral basis - e.g. the Tax Strategy Group paper on VAT prepared in advance of Budget 2015 (available on the Department's website at ) estimated that a standard rate of 15% (the lowest level permitted under the VAT Directive) could be achieved on a broadly revenue neutral basis by merging the zero, 9%, 13.5% and 23% rates. However, this would involve applying VAT to food, children's clothes and oral medicines as well as raising the VAT rate on a range of other areas of consumption such as fuel and hospitality services.</p><p>The cost of maintaining zero and reduced rates in the context of leaving the standard rate at its current level of 23% is set out below. This is a straight line calculation and takes no account of changes to spending behaviours.  Zero rate items -  &euro;2 billion; 9%  -  &euro;1.8 billion; 13.5%  -  &euro;2.3 billion.</p><p>Costings related to exempted services such as transport, education and charities are not available.</p></reply>

I have no statutory function in relation to the banking decisions made by individual lending institutions at any particular time and these are taken by the board and management of the relevant institution. </p><p>Notwithstanding the State's shareholdings in the banks, I must ensure that the banks are run on a commercial, cost effective and independent basis to ensure their value as an asset to the State. A Relationship Framework has been specified that defines the nature of the relationship between the Minister for Finance and each bank. These Frameworks were published on 30 March 2012 and can be found at .  </p><p>However from a general policy perspective, the approach of the Government is to support people in genuine mortgage arrears and where feasible, to put in place a sustainable restructure to address and resolve such a difficulty. This is clearly set out in the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears where it requires a lender in respect of a cooperating borrower to explore all of the options for an alternative repayment arrangement offered by that lender and that a lender must document its consideration of each option examined and the reasons why the options offered/not offered to the borrower are/are not appropriate and sustainable. </p><p>If a solution cannot be agreed between borrower and lender, or if it is agreed that a mortgage restructure is not a sustainable solution, there are alternative mechanisms available to allow a debtor remain in the house in appropriate cases. For example, the Mortgage to Rent scheme is available in cases where the house and household would be appropriate and eligible for social housing. Where the borrower and lender cannot agree on a sustainable mortgage restructure, the debtor has the option to formulate and propose a PIA to his/her secured and other creditor(s). This initiative rests solely with the debtor and in formulating a PIA, a personal insolvency practitioner is under an onus, insofar as is reasonably practicable, to formulate the proposal on terms that will not require the debtor to dispose of an interest in or cease to occupy a principal private residence.</p><p>I also note, BOI's focus on the resolution of Irish mortgage and business related loans, by agreeing suitable and sustainable solutions, and the progress the bank has made in this regard. In its 2014 annual report, BOI has stated that more than nine out of ten of its challenged owner occupied mortgage customers in Ireland with restructuring arrangements are meeting the agreed repayments. It is also worth noting that BOI met the targets set by the CBI in relation to addressing mortgage arrears.</p><p>At the time of announcing its 2014 full-year results, Bank of Ireland management stated that it was prioritising the capital it was generating to facilitate the de-recognition of the 2009 preference shares. The remaining 2009 preference shares stand at &euro;1.3bn. Furthermore, management has stated that following de-recognition of the preference shares its ambition is to progress to payment of dividends.</p><p>Notwithstanding the fact that management has indicated that the accelerated pace of the bank's capital build has ensured that it is firmly on track to de-recognise the 2009 preference shares in 2016, it will be some time before there is clarity around the robustness of the bank's capital position which would allow such a de-recognition to take place and subsequently the commencement of dividends. In addition the SSM, as regulator, would have to satisfy itself, at the appropriate time, as to the bank's dividend capacity in the context of its overall capital position. Accordingly, I am not willing to speculate on how any plan the bank has in relation to dividends might evolve.</p></reply>

In this regard, in Budget 2012, I fulfilled the commitment in the Programme for Government to increase the rate of mortgage interest relief to 30 per cent for first time buyers who took out their first mortgage in that period. This was the period during which house prices peaked.</p>  <p>  A mortgage holder will qualify for the increased rate if they made their first mortgage interest payment in the period 2004 to 2008 or if they drew down their mortgage in that period. In addition, the increased rate of tax relief for first time buyers who took out their first mortgage in that period will continue up to and including the 2017 tax year.</p>  <p>  Individuals that purchased their home within this specified date range are entitled to a 30% rate of relief on interest paid up to an interest ceiling of &euro;20,000 if married/widowed and &euro;10,000 if single, for the first seven years. Thereafter, the ceiling reduces for the remaining years to a maximum of &euro;6,000 if married/widowed and &euro;3,000 if single. The ceilings reduce in recognition of the fact that interest makes up a larger proportion of the mortgage payable in the earlier years of the mortgage period, and that capital makes up a larger proportion of the mortgage payable thereafter.</p>  <p>  Regarding the Deputy's question concerning the month during which the mortgage is first taken out, Mortgage Interest Relief is granted up to the full appropriate ceiling for that year, and each subsequent year up to 2017, regardless of which month the mortgage payments actually commence. </p>  <p>  Regarding the Deputy's question concerning individuals who built their family home at the end of 2004, it is not clear from the question which particular circumstance the Deputy has concerns about. However, I would point out that the look back period for tax relief purposes in respect of the tax years 2004 and 2005 has now passed.</p>  <p>  Regarding the issue of mortgage difficulties, the latest publication from my Department shows the continued improvement in Principal Dwelling House (PDH) mortgage arrears since August 2013. The number of mortgage accounts in arrears of greater than 90 days has declined by almost 25%, while those accounts in arrears of less than 90 days fell by almost 28%. Total PDH mortgage accounts in arrears show a decline of almost 26% over the same time period from 118,438 in September 2013 to 87,818 at end January 2015.</p>  <p>  Total Mortgage accounts that have been restructured now stand at 106,275. The number of mortgage accounts in arrears of greater than 90 days continues to fall, decreasing by 1,398 accounts to 60,868.  Engagement between consumers and lenders has resulted in an increase of 2,764 permanent mortgage restructures in January.</p>  <p>  Given that the next Budget is almost seven months away it would be inappropriate for me to become involved in speculation on this matter. However, I will say that as part of the normal budgetary preparations, my officials continue to monitor the situation and will be examining potential options for changes to the tax system for my consideration as part of the overall Budget package. However, given that Mortgage Interest Relief has effectively been abolished since 2013 for new mortgages, I am not predisposed to reopen it to further amendment to provide additional benefits to existing claimants.</p></reply>

The primary focus of this strategy is to support those homeowners in difficulty with their mortgage repayments and, insofar as possible, to avoid repossession of the family home.  The Deputy will be aware that the Government's mortgage arrears strategy must be viewed as part of the overarching Government Housing Policy, the implementation of which is overseen by the Construction 2020, Housing Planning and Mortgage Arrears Cabinet sub-Committee, which is chaired by An Taoiseach.  The overall strategic objective of the Government's housing strategy, which comes under the responsibility of the Minister for the Environment, Alan Kelly TD, is to enable all households access good quality housing appropriate to household circumstances and in their particular community of choice.</p></reply>

The Deputy will appreciate that tax reliefs and exemptions have costs which have to be paid for and their introduction must be considered only where there is a clear economic and social policy need to be addressed.  </p>  <p>  It should be noted in relation to local property tax (LPT), that where a person downsizes their residential property, assuming they stay in a similar location to the property they are selling, their LPT liability will, most likely, be less than the amount they would have been liable for on their original property. </p>  <p>  In relation to what might also be regarded as property-related taxes, Stamp Duties are payable on the acquisition of residential property.   The current rates are 1% on values up to &euro;1 million and 2% on any balance over that. I do not consider that a rate of 1% on the purchase of a property would represent a serious disincentive to any property owner considering trading down. </p>  <p>  In relation to Capital Gains Tax (CGT), an exemption is in place on the disposal of a person's principal private residence.   The exemption applies to any gain made on the disposal of an individual's dwelling house together with land occupied up to an area of one acre, excluding the site of the house.  Full CGT relief applies where the period of occupation matches the period of ownership, and partial relief applies where the house has not been occupied by the individual for the full period of ownership. </p></reply>

I have no statutory role in relation to regulated financial institutions passing on the European Central Bank interest rate change or to the mortgage interest rates charged.  It is a commercial matter for each institution concerned.  It is not appropriate for me, as Minister for Finance, to comment on or become involved in the detailed mortgage position of mortgage holders.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank has responsibility for the regulation and supervision of financial institutions in terms of consumer protection and prudential requirements and for ensuring ongoing compliance with applicable statutory obligations. The Central Bank has no statutory role in the setting of interest rates by financial institutions, apart from the interest rate cap imposed on the credit union sector in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Union Act, 1997 and the requirement to be notified of penalty or surcharge interest imposed in respect of arrears. As I stated in previous Parliamentary Questions, a previous Deputy Governor indicated that, within its existing powers and through the use of persuasion, the Central Bank would continue to engage with specific lenders which appear to have standard variable rates set disproportionate to their cost of funds and this is a course of action I expect the Central Bank to continually appraise.The Deputy should be aware that the Governor of the Central Bank, Mr Patrick Honohan in his opening statement to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform last November stated that, as in most advanced economies, including Ireland, it has long been understood that tight administrative control over the rates charged by banks would be counterproductive in ensuring a sufficient flow of properly priced credit on a lasting basis. Such control would strongly discourage new entrants. In this regard, ongoing competition in the banking sector will be crucial in ensuring that the economy is provided with efficient and cost effective banking services. In this regard, there has been some movements on mortgage interest rates of late by a number of institutions which suggest that the market may well be entering a new and more competitive phase. The mortgage interest rates that financial institutions operating in Ireland charge to customers are determined as a result of a commercial decision by the institutions concerned. This interest rate is determined taking into account a broad range of factors including European Central Bank base rates, deposit rates, market funding costs, the competitive environment and an institution's overall funding.However, as part of the Central Bank's work on mortgage arrears, lenders were asked to consider all avenues to help customers in arrears, including interest rate reductions. </p></reply>

Where it is of the opinion that the state of the ICF is such that financial support should be provided for it, it is allowed determine an appropriate contribution to be paid to the ICF by each insurer or insurer authorised in another EEA Member State.  This is calculated as a percentage determined by the Central Bank, not exceeding 2%, of the aggregate of the gross premiums paid to the insurer or insurer authorised in another EEA Member State in respect of policies issued in respect of risks in Ireland.  </p>  <p>  The Insurance Compensation Fund levy has been applied on two occasions and a total of &euro;376.6 million has been collected:</p>  <p>  -  A levy of 2% of gross premium income was introduced on 1 January 1984 following the collapse of PMPA in October of the preceding year.  The levy was paid by all non-life insurers at this rate until 31 December 1991 and a reduced levy of 1% applied for the period 1 January 1992 to 31 December 1992, when it was discontinued. During these 12 years &euro;186.3 million was collected.</p>  <p>  -  In 1 January 2012 the levy was once again introduced at a rate of 2%.  Since the introduction of the levy a total of &euro;190.3 million has been collected. </p>  <p>In the case of the insolvency of the Insurance Corporation of Ireland a levy was not applied.  ICI, a subsidiary of Allied Irish Bank, collapsed in 1985.  No levy was placed on the industry then as compensation to meet the company's liabilities was provided by a combination of AIB funding, commercial loans and State loans which have since been repaid. </p>  <p>  The management and administration of the Insurance Compensation Fund is under the control of the President of the High Court acting through the Office of the Accountant of the Courts of Justice. All amounts paid out of the fund are subject to approval of the High Court. </p>  <p>  The Fund has been used to fund the administration of three insurance companies.</p>  <p>  -  A balance of &euro;164,386,901 was paid from the Fund in relation to the Insurance Corporation of Ireland.</p>  <p>  -  A balance of &euro;139,013,808 was paid from the Fund in relation to PMPA.</p>  <p>  -  To date a total of &euro;1,158,000,000 has been paid from the Fund in relation to Quinn Insurance Limited. </p>  <p>  With regard to insurer liquidations, there has been a total of &euro;29,166 paid out of the fund in relation to sums due under policies issued by Lemma Europe Insurance Company Limited (In Liquidation) in respect of risks in the Irish State. </p></reply>

The USC rates cited in Option 4 are applied to both PAYE and self-employed income. I am also informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, consistent with the Option 4 proposal, the aforementioned estimates do not make any provision for exemptions currently available  to either medical card holders or individuals aged 70 or over  on income less than &euro;60,000.</p>  <p>  All figures above are estimates from the Revenue tax forecasting model for 2015, using the actual data for the year 2012 (the latest year for which data are available) adjusted as necessary for income, self-employment and employment trends in the interim. They are provisional and may be revised.</p>  <p>  It should be acknowledged that since the Review was published there have been major changes to the USC. As a result of the Review the Government decided in Budget 2012 to increase the entry point to the Universal Social Charge from &euro;4,004 to &euro;10,036 per annum. It is estimated that this removed almost 330,000 individuals from the charge.  In Budget 2015 I extended this exemption threshold to &euro;12,012 to apply from 1 January 2015 onwards. This exempted a further 87,000 individuals from the charge. This means that 28% of all income earners are not paying any Universal Social Charge at all. Furthermore, I also reduced the two lower rates at which USC is charged and extended the threshold before the 7% rate becomes chargeable. These measures, together with the introduction of a new 8% rate on income over &euro;70,044, as well as a rate increase from 10% to 11% on self-assessed income over &euro;100,000, further enhanced the existing progressive nature of the USC. </p>  <p>  However, as a result of the changes to income tax and USC in Budget 2015, all those who currently pay income tax and/or USC have seen a reduction in their tax bill this year compared to 2014 and the Government have committed to continue to reform the tax system in this manner in the coming years, contingent on having the fiscal space to do so.</p></reply>

The purchaser should also satisfy himself/herself that the LPT valuation declared by the vendor (as at 1 May 2013) appears accurate. </p>  <p>  To facilitate this process, the vendor (or his/her solicitor) is obliged to provide the purchaser with details of the valuation of the property and the LPT/HHC liabilities paid. The required information can be accessed through an online system, which Revenue has developed to assist the sale process. In this regard the vendor can either provide the purchaser with online access to the LPT property records using secure identification codes or alternatively simply provide printed copies.</p>  <p>   Specifically in regard to HHC, the vendor should confirm payment to the purchaser by way of receipts or other appropriate documentation or, where the property is exempt provide a certificate of exemption or waiver.  </p>  <p>  In the case to which the Deputy refers, it is acknowledged that the person in question purchased the property in 2014. However, there is no record that the outstanding HHC liability on the property was paid, either prior to, or as part of the sale and it seems that there was no agreement on the issue between the person's legal representative and the vendor. For that reason the amount due is recorded as a charge against the property.</p>  <p>  Revenue has confirmed to me that the person made contact with the LPT team on foot of a compliance notification that issued to him on 21 February 2015. The LPT agent confirmed to the person that the liability is correctly due and that Revenue has no discretion in regard to the outstanding amount and must apply the law as set down in the legislation. </p></reply>

In this fiscal context, the Government is now considering options, including a Spring Economic Statement and National Economic Dialogue, to further develop the whole-of-year budgetary cycle.</p>  <p>  A National Economic Dialogue could facilitate a broad inclusive societal discussion of fiscal policy parameters and priorities for resource allocation over the coming years.  My Department is working with the Department of Finance on developing proposals for such a dialogue. It is envisaged that it would be held mid-year in a format that would facilitate an open and transparent public discussion about fiscal policy options and priorities.</p>  <p>  With a dialogue held in mid-year, the outcome of such a dialogue could then inform the work of Government and the Oireachtas in their considerations of the Budget later in the year.</p></reply>

This application was not approved by the OPW and the delegation requested that this decision be re-considered. I understand that no application for funding has been submitted by the Council in respect of the project at East Bridge to date as the proposal involves work on a protected structure and therefore will first require the approval of the National Monuments Section of the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.</p>  <p>  I explained to the delegation that the current requests for funding must be considered in the context of the very significant funding totalling &euro;1.9 million which has been provided to date by the OPW to Galway County Council under the OPW's Minor Works Scheme in respect of flood relief works in Ballinasloe.  This funding has allowed substantial works to be undertaken which will have reduced the flood risk considerable in the town. I indicated that the OPW's core strategy for addressing flood risk in the Shannon Basin is the River Shannon Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Study and that Ballinsaloe is one of the areas, known as Areas for Further Assessment, being looked at in detail under this study. The Shannon CFRAM study is one of six such studies being undertaken nationally and the output of this important project will be an integrated plan of specific measures to address, in a comprehensive and sustainable way, the significant flood risk factors in the Shannon basin.  The recommendations for structural flood measures that will emerge from all the separate CFRAM projects will be prioritised on a national basis and I informed the delegation that it would not be appropriate to give preference to Ballinasloe by committing further significant funding for flood relief works in that AFA pending the outcome of the overall CFRAM work and the national priorities that will emanate from that.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the CFRAM strategy, which is line with national and EU policy on management of flood risk, is the best way to address comprehensively any remaining flood risk in Ballinasloe.  I am cognisant of the great effort and work that the Flood Alleviation Ballinasloe community group has undertaken to date and I indicated at the recent meeting with them that, in light of their presentation on what they consider to be a significant remaining risk in the town, but having regard also to my stated position above in relation to the CFRAM strategy, the application for additional funding would be considered again.</p></reply>

The scheme includes flood alleviation measures in the areas referred to by the Deputy.</p>  <p>  In order to comply with the requirements of SI 469 and SI 470 of 2012, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (DPER) engaged experts to carry out an independent review as part of its assessment of the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) of the Scheme proposals. The report of the independent review was recently received by DPER and this raises a number of matters for clarification and some additional information requirements necessary to enable the adequacy of the EIS to be fully assessed.  The OPW and its environmental consultants are currently considering the report and will be in a position to respond to DPER shortly.</p>  <p>  Pending completion of DPER's assessment and approval of the Scheme by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, it is not possible to say when construction works will commence. </p>  <p>  I wish to re-affirm that the OPW remains committed to carrying out the scheme, subject to the Minister's sanction, and has provided for its cost in its multi-annual capital expenditure profiles to 2017.</p>  <p>  The total estimated budget for the Claregalway Scheme inclusive of provision for professional fees, environmental mitigation measures and maintenance is in the region of &euro;7.1 million and not the amount referred to by the Deputy, which includes the advance works already completed at Claregalway and Crusheeny Bridge at a cost of approximately &euro;2.5 million.

NERA operates a system of risk based inspections in sectors where there are identifiable risks. Inspections are also carried out in response to complaints received and routine inspections are undertaken as a control measure.</p>  <p>  It is a condition of any contract entered into by a public authority with a private sector entity (other than for operations that may reasonably be considered as small scale) that the entity is required to provide access to certain information.  This information may assist the authority to assess compliance with employment legislation consistent with the requirements of EU and national law.  </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-03-24a.473.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1106" speakername="Simon Harris" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015032400065#WRM02700"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 307 to 311, inclusive, together.</p>  <p>  It is important to state at the outset that the River Dargle Flood Defence Scheme in Bray County Wicklow is being undertaken by Wicklow County Council (WCC) as the Contracting Authority with funding from the Office of Public Works (OPW).  While OPW representatives sit on the Project Steering Group which oversees the project, responsibility for the day to day running and management of the scheme, including Health and Safety matters, site supervision and public liaison, rests with WCC.</p>  <p>  In relation to Deputy's question on the Castle Street junction with the Dargle road, I am informed by WCC that, in its view, the junction and road condition is not in a very unsafe condition. While the footpaths and road lining in the area require further work, the area cannot be finally re-surfaced until the piled river wall is complete and the boardwalk is installed.  If footpaths and road lining at this location were re-laid now it would have to be ripped up and re-done at a later date to facilitate the boardwalk. </p>  <p>  With regard to your query on the prevention of unsafe access to the flood relief construction site, I am advised by WCC that two security companies using cameras and night time patrols are employed  by WCC for site security. The monitoring of site safety hazards and the repair and strengthening of security fencing is carried out on an ongoing basis by WCC and its agents. The statutory safety file is being maintained, in line with statutory requirements and best practice, by the consultants hired by WCC. As the OPW is not the contracting authority for the project it is not required to approve the Safety Statement.  I am further informed by WCC that regular safety inspections are being carried out by the construction team and consultants, as required by law and best practice.</p>  <p>  In relation to the People's Park, I understand that a substantial part of it was handed back for public use in November last year and that WCC plans to hand back the remaining, relatively small areas, which are currently being used for works compounds in September 2016. </p>  <p>  As the OPW is not the Contracting Authority on the project it is not responsible for conducting traffic audits.  Satisfactory management of construction traffic will be required of the successful contractors as part of their methodology for undertaking the works. WCC will arrange regular inspection of traffic safety measures as part of its management of the works construction.</p>  <p>  I am further advised by WCC that works to the river bank at La Vallee were emergency works, arranged because of the imminent danger of collapse of the river bank adjacent to apartment and office blocks. The landscaping works being carried out at the apartment blocks at present are re-instatement works and regular and detailed consultation with the apartment owners is ongoing. The opposite bank will be planted in the near future to further stabilise the bank. This planting will be undertaken in accordance with the general principles of the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), and as this bank was envisaged by the EIS to be excavated, it will be planted to the standard envisaged by the EIS, or better.</p></reply>
