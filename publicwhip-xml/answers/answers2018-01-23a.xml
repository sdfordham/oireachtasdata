This underwent a round of consultations, with submissions received from Government Departments, local authorities, and cultural bodies and stakeholders in the cultural sector. The draft framework policy was submitted to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Arts, Heritage, Regional Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs in July 2016, who published its 'Report on Culture 2025 &ndash; &Eacute;ire Ild&aacute;nach, Framework Policy to 2025' in July 2017.</p>  <p>  My Department is now in the process of finalising the framework policy. In this regard, the Joint Oireachtas Committee made a number of very good suggestions including  in relation to how the policy document should be reshaped. My Department is giving careful consideration to these suggestions. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Creative Ireland Programme, which was launched in December 2016, restated the key aims and values set out in the draft Culture 2025 document but took these a stage further in terms of setting out key deliverable actions both in year 1 and over a 5 year period. In effect, the Creative Ireland Programme  has become the main implementation vehicle for the priorities identified in the Culture 2025. In this regard, the main emphasis of the Department during 2017 was to get the Creative Ireland Programme up and running.</p>  <p>  It is important however, notwithstanding the significant achievements under the Creative Ireland Programme, that we have a broad overarching policy document for culture which sets out the strategic aims of Government for future years.  I am committed therefore, following receipt of the Oireachtas report ,and in light of the significant progress made over the past year under the Creative Ireland Programme to publish a final Culture 2025 policy document.</p>  <p>  My intention is to complete this work in the coming weeks and to bring the final policy to Government for approval and subsequent publication.</p></reply>

Last year, my Department awarded a large capital grant to Meath County Council for the enhancement and refurbishment of Meath Arts Centre, known as Solstice, in Navan.  This grant was awarded under the Arts and Culture Capital scheme 2016-2018.  Meath County Council has informed my Department that it hopes to commence work on this project in 2018.  </p>  <p>  The Arts and Culture Capital scheme 2016-2018 which was announced in 2016 focused on the refurbishment and enhancement of the existing stock of arts and culture facilities including Museums throughout the country.  My Department proposes to re-open this scheme for applications later this year and it would be a matter for the County Council to decide on its priorities in making any applications under the scheme.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may also be interested to know that my Department also operates a scheme of small grants which provides funding specifically for local and regional museums to enhance their services and a Co-operation with Northern Ireland Scheme which provides support for small self-contained projects which seek to enhance, celebrate or commemorate the artistic, cultural, musical, film or heritage of the Island of Ireland on a North/South basis.  These schemes may also be of interest.</p></reply>

The meeting focused on how the theatre sector, in particular, could come together to discuss the issues which have arisen.  It was agreed that my Department would assist in any practical arrangements in this regard.</p>  <p>  Following that engagement the Irish Theatre Institute has worked to develop an initiative to provide an opportunity for people in the sector to come together to voice views on recent happenings and to consider a respectful way forward for the sector.</p>  <p>  Details of this initiative are being finalised and further details will be announced shortly.</p>  <p>  I have also asked the Theatre Institute to engage with representatives of the 72 signatories of the open letter which was published in the Irish Times last week with a view to ensuring that the measures proposed can address some of the concerns they expressed, in particular addressing culture and practices in the sector into the future.</p>  <p>  I have indicated that I would welcome a meeting with these representatives in due course so that I can hear their concerns first hand and to ensure that any measures we support, address the core of the issues facing the sector and beyond.</p>  <p>  It is not appropriate for me as Minister to become involved in, or comment on individual cases, and it is important that due process is followed in each individual case. I am however vigorously following up on the measures announced by my predecessor last month which are designed to work with stakeholders to address culture and practices within the sector.   I want to send out a clear message that compliance with the law and a culture of dignity and respect are fundamental and should be the norm for everyone, regardless of where or how they work.</p></reply>

The reference to the figure in question was as an indicator of historic visitor numbers. The exact text of the report states that:</p>  <p>  &ldquo;The average number of visitors per season in the period since 1995 is c. 11,100, a figure that, having been monitored over a period of 13 seasons, is deemed sustainable in terms of protection of the National Monument.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  Rather than prescribing a defined annual maximum on visitor numbers, the approach in the Management Plan is to set a limited daily quota.  The arrangements have been notified to UNESCO and have not been identified as being in any way inimical to the outstanding universal value of the site. </p>  <p>  In tandem with visits to Skellig Michael being subject to a daily limit, local weather and sea conditions also often result in boats being unable to land safely. I understand that the typical experience over several years is that approximately 40% to 45% of landing attempts fail during an average season which also acts as a limiting factor.</p>  <p>  In the context of the maintenance of that daily visitor cap and the other natural and built heritage protections in place for the Island, and the ongoing work of my Department and the OPW, I believe that the unique heritage of this important monument is being protected while also allowing visitors from Ireland and across the world to experience this iconic UNESCO World Heritage Site off the Irish coast.</p></reply>

The Heritage Council is inviting organisations and individuals to take action and respond to the theme. It is open to organisations and individuals to identify initiatives, existing and new, planned for 2018 which meet the objectives of European Year of Cultural Heritage. The aim is to deepen the connection between people and heritage, and build a legacy of increased public engagement.</p>  <p>  At the end of this month I will be announcing a number of events which will be taking place throughout Ireland in 2018 as part of the European Year of Cultural Heritage and which will serve to highlight Ireland's heritage both at home and abroad.</p>  <p>  Cultural heritage is the fabric of our lives and societies. It surrounds us in the buildings of our towns and cities; our landscapes, natural sites, monuments and archaeological sites, traditions and practices.  It is not only made up of literature, art and objects but also by the crafts we learn, the stories we tell, the food we eat, the songs we sing and the films we watch. I welcome the fact that the European Year of Cultural Heritage provides an unique opportunity to bring communities together and build shared understandings of the places we live in. </p></reply>

Firstly to encourage the sharing and appreciation of Europe&rsquo;s cultural heritage; secondly, to raise awareness of our common history and values; and finally to involve all citizens, irrespective or age, to promote a sense of belonging to a common European space. </p>  <p>  My Department is supporting the Heritage Council as National Coordinator in the delivery of the European Year of Cultural Heritage in Ireland.  I will shortly be announcing a menu of events which will be taking place throughout Ireland in 2018 as part of the European Year of Cultural Heritage which will serve to highlight Ireland's heritage both at home and abroad.</p>  <p>  With particular reference to generating interest among young people, the Heritage in Schools Scheme provides a panel of 160 Heritage Specialists who visit primary schools throughout the country to encourage awareness of the genius of the natural and cultural world that surrounds us in our daily lives and engage children in a direct experience of their heritage. The Scheme will form a part of Ireland's programme for   the European Year of Cultural Heritage.</p>  <p>  The Government's Creative Ireland Programme also places a special emphasis on unifying our global reputation and aims to capture the overarching narrative of Ireland&rsquo;s unique creativity and cultural heritage and present a coherent representation of Ireland as a country of creative people. In addition, through Culture Ireland of my Department there is direct support for Irish artists to present their work worldwide. This serves to raise the global awareness of the strong reputation of the Ireland&rsquo;s arts sector  and  develop new audiences abroad for Irish artists. </p>  <p>  I should also mention the significant success which Ireland recently achieved with Uilleann Piping receiving recognition as being worthy of inscription on the UNESCO Register for Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. Uilleann Piping is acknowledged as the sound of Ireland, enjoyed and played by young and old across the globe  which serves to generate increased interest in  Ireland and our cultural heritage.</p></reply>

In order to provide this service, the staffing and structure of my Department is reviewed on an ongoing basis. </p><p>Details of the number of staff employed in my Department over the past three years are as follows:</p><p>-  31 December 2015 - 196.1 (whole-time equivalent)</p><p>-  31 December 2016 - 188.2 (whole-time equivalent)</p><p>-  23 January 2018 - 205.1 (whole-time equivalent)</p><p>Currently, my Department is structured around seven work areas.

The staffing resources of the Division currently amount to a whole-time equivalent of 24.3 staff across the full range of policy areas. The work of this Division includes supporting the work of Cabinet Committee C, which deals with EU affairs, including Brexit, and supports me in my role as a member of the European Council. </p><p>In particular, this Cabinet Committee assists the Government in its ongoing consideration of Brexit issues including input to the negotiation process, both on the issues that are of unique or particular concern to Ireland, and more generally.</p><p>The Division prepares me for engagement on a wide range of EU issues, as well as the debate on the future of Europe, and supports efforts to develop our strategic alliances in a post-Brexit scenario.</p><p>The Division also supports me in my International role and in all of my international engagements ensuring that they are strategically aligned with, and effectively advance, the Government's priorities, with a particular focus on driving job creation, sustainable economic development, trade, tourism and investment and on protecting and promoting our strategic interests internationally. </p><p>The Division also provides advice and support to me in relation to Northern Ireland Affairs and British Irish relations, and Brexit issues in that context. Staff in other divisions also contribute to the work on Brexit.  For example, the Economic Division advises me on economic policy aimed at supporting sustainable economic growth, with a particular focus on jobs and competitiveness including possible economic impacts of Brexit.</p><p>In all of its work across international, EU and British and Northern Ireland issues, my Department works closely with other relevant Departments including, in particular, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade which has lead responsibility for most policy matters in these areas, including Brexit.</p></reply>

The Department aims to issue the balance of Statements for the years up to 2016 by April 2018.  If a Single Scheme member in the Permanent Defence Force wishes to have a Benefit Statement in relation to their particular case they can contact the Pensions Administration Section of my Department and ask for a manually calculated Benefit Statement.  </p>  <p>  It is important to note that the Single Scheme is fundamentally different to all pre-2013 public service schemes as it is based on career-average pay rather than final salary and service.  Also, it is one Single Scheme across the entire public service.  It is significantly more complex to administer than all preceding schemes.  This has presented significant operational challenges with regard to issuing Benefit Statements for large and growing numbers of members.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is examining various options for the long-term administrative arrangements for the Single Scheme and the Government has decided on a phased approach to addressing the challenges around the administration of the Scheme.  This includes the design and development of a Shared Single Scheme Administration Service for the Scheme in the long-term.</p></reply>

Overall, 17,509 migrants were rescued under Operation Pontus and details are out in the table below. <table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Deployed</th><th>Naval     vessel</th><th>Persons     rescued</th></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>16 MAY - 17 JULY </td><td>L&Eacute;   EITHNE</td><td>3,377</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>10 JULY - 02   OCTOBER</td><td>L&Eacute; NIAMH</td><td>4,127</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>24 SEPTEMBER - 29   NOVEMBER</td><td>L&Eacute; SAMUEL BECKETT</td><td>1,088</td></tr><tr><td>TOTAL</td><td></td><td></td><td>8,592</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>01 MAY &ndash; 15   JULY </td><td>L.&Eacute;.

These Resolutions also authorise the interception of vessels suspected of being used for illicit activities and impose an arms embargo on Libya in an effort to prevent the flow of illicit arms and related material into that country. </p><p>An Irish naval vessel, L.&Eacute;. Niamh, deployed on 6 October 2017 to join Operation Sophia and returned to Ireland on 20 December 2017.  In the course of its deployment as part of Operation Sophia, the L.&Eacute;. Niamh was primarily tasked to respond to Safety of Life at Sea (Search and Rescue) events in the area of operation.  Over the period of its deployment with Operation Sophia, a total of 613 persons were rescued by the LE Niamh.  </p><p>As a participant in Operation Sophia, Ireland is now working closely as part of 27 EU Member States making a contribution to addressing some of the root causes of migration and human trafficking. From a security and disruption perspective, Operation Sophia has been able to dispose of more than 520 assets used by smugglers and traffickers.  The mission has apprehended 130 suspected smugglers on the high seas who have been handed over to the Italian authorities and are currently either awaiting or facing trial.  It has responded to 290 Safety of Life at Sea events and rescued over 42,400 migrants to date.</p></reply>

It is important therefore to remain fully engaged in all CSDP processes.  Fully participating in these developments ensures that we have a voice and that we can influence the evolution of these initiatives. </p>  <p>  Now that we are participating in PESCO the focus for Ireland will be on identifying key PESCO projects which enhance the capability and capacity of the Defence Forces to successfully undertake modern complex UN mandated missions, including CSDP operations and on supporting interoperability in this regard.  Consideration is currently being given to the potential PESCO projects in which Ireland will participate.  The work on elaborating the details of these project proposals and potential participants is currently ongoing at EU level and Ireland is playing its full part in those deliberations.</p>  <p>  To the extent that PESCO is designed to provide more effective delivery of enhanced military capability for CSDP crisis management operations at the highest level, it will benefit the men and women of our Defence Forces, from all across the country including Co. Kildare.  </p>  <p>  When the Defence Forces deploy overseas our men and women never do so alone.  We always work in close cooperation with other countries deployed on such operations. PESCO is also a means of enhancing interoperability with our future project partners, something that will be of great benefit for our troops on future missions overseas.</p></reply>

This issue has a personal priority for me since I took up office as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.  Ireland and the EU support political efforts to encourage a resumption of direct negotiations, which are ultimately the only way to achieve peace. Ireland and the EU also engage in action on the ground on human rights and justice issues affecting Palestinians under occupation, including settlement activity, which is progressively endangering prospects for a peace agreement.  </p>  <p>  In recent months the new United States administration has been actively exploring the possibilities for re-launching the process to reach a comprehensive peace agreement.  This engagement is welcome, and I have met myself with the US team to encourage their work, and to underline to them the key parameters for an agreement which the EU has long espoused. </p>  <p>  I was very disappointed at the US announcement recognising Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and initiating steps to move the US Embassy, which I believe was premature and ill-advised, and unhelpful to efforts to resolve the conflict in the Middle East.  Ireland was one of 128 UN Member States which supported a UN General Assembly resolution stressing that the Holy City &ldquo;is a final status issue to be resolved through negotiations in line with relevant UN resolutions.&rdquo; </p>  <p>  In discussions with my EU colleagues, at the Foreign Affairs Council yesterday, I again urged the EU to play a positive role in an appropriate US peace initiative.  The EU will also continue work on the ground to help preserve and create the political and physical space in which the two state solution can be achieved.  I am actively exploring with EU colleagues how this can best be done.</p>  <p>  Earlier this month, I visited Israel and Palestine for the second time in my role Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, and in all of my meetings &ndash; with Israelis, Palestinians, and UN partners &ndash; I conveyed the importance the Irish people attach to the resolution of the Middle East Peace Process.</p>  <p>  In my meetings with the Israeli authorities, I expressed Ireland&rsquo;s concerns about the impact of the continuing occupation, including settlement construction and the effects on minors who are detained. I had a frank discussion with Prime Minister Netanyahu about the prospects for returning to negotiations between the parties, and how Ireland and the EU can play a constructive role in the MEPP. </p>  <p>  I also had the opportunity to meet with Palestinian President Abbas, whom I met again at the Foreign Affairs Council yesterday, and urged him to keep an open mind on any proposal the US may bring forward. In my meeting with Foreign Minister Malki, I discussed the challenges facing the Palestinian people, the prospects for reinvigorating peace negotiations, and efforts to restore the Palestinian Authority to its role in Gaza &ndash; work that I encouraged and supported.</p></reply>

I condemn unreservedly the loss of life in the aftermath of those elections and express my sincere condolences to the families of the victims. Freedom of expression and assembly are the cornerstones of any functioning democracy and those rights must be guaranteed.  All sides in Honduras must work within the political system to deliver the political reforms necessary to secure the trust of the Honduran people in the country&rsquo;s institutions.  </p>  <p>  While Ireland does not have diplomatic representation in Honduras, officials at my Department engage closely with the European External Action Service working through its EU delegation in Tegucigalpa, and meet with human rights defenders and civil society organisations active in that country, most recently in Dublin in October 2017 when the elections were discussed in some detail. Furthermore, Irish Aid contributes funding to programmes in Honduras through civil society organisations, chiefly Tr&oacute;caire, including in support of its important work on human rights.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, facilitated by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Ireland contributed one long-term observer and one short-term observer to the EU Election Observer Mission to Honduras, beginning in October 2017.  Officials of the Department conducted a debrief with the observers in early January.  The EU Observer Mission will deliver its final report on the election in the coming months.  In its preliminary statement, the Mission gave a generally positive evaluation of the organisation of the elections, while at the same time noting the negative public perception of the neutrality of the Supreme Electoral Tribunal and the disparity in resources enjoyed by one candidate compared with competitors.    </p>  <p>  I urge the Government of Honduras to take on board and adopt any recommendations made by the EU observer mission in order to help to restore much needed public confidence in future electoral processes in the country. </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that we will continue to monitor the situation closely and maintain contact with actors on the ground in Honduras in the weeks and months ahead.</p></reply>

This issue arises, for instance, in the case of Israeli settlements in Palestinian territory or in occupied Syrian Golan. Ireland and the European Union do not recognise these settlements as legal and do not provide assistance to their development.  We maintain very clearly the position that these settlements are illegal, and harmful both to the Palestinian people, and to the prospects for peace between Israel and its neighbours. Ireland supports normal trade access for Israeli goods and services to the EU single market, consistent with the treatment of other countries with which the EU has trade and political agreements (many of which are the subject of very serious human rights concerns).  However, Ireland has argued successfully that any rights granted to Israel under these agreements cannot be applied to Israeli settlements in Palestinian territory, and in response the EU has acted in a number of ways to give effect to its disapproval of, and long standing position of opposition to, illegal Israeli settlements:   </p>  <p>  - Goods from settlements are excluded from the low tariff rates applied to Israeli goods.</p>  <p>  - EU funding may not be disbursed to Israeli entities based in settlements.</p>  <p>  - Ireland and a number of EU Member States have published advice to citizens and businesses against investing in, or engaging in any form of economic activity with, settlements.</p>  <p>  - EU-wide guidelines on labelling of goods from settlements </p>  <p>  In discussions at EU level, I am open to considering in principle any proposal that the European Union should exclude products from illegal settlements from entering the EU market.  However, the inescapable fact is that there is no prospect of such a proposal in relation to Israeli settlements gaining wider support at present.  </p>  <p>   My Department will carefully examine any proposed plans that may be put forward relating to the prohibition, at a national level, of imports from, or the sale of goods to, territories that are under occupation as defined by international law.  It is, however, necessary to caution that international trade between the European Union&rsquo;s Member States and third countries is regulated by the EU&rsquo;s Common Commercial Policy and is a matter of exclusive Union competence.  As a result, the scope which is afforded to a Member State to take such action is both limited and, naturally, governed by EU law including Regulation 2015/478 on Common Rules for Imports.</p>  <p>  Any action by one Member State alone would raise not just legal, but also numerous practical problems.  In any case, it is my firm view that an action of this type sends an effective signal only when pursued by a group of countries, sending a signal of international opinion on the issue.  A coordinated EU policy is the only method that will have the potential to bring about change.  The impact which this type of coordinated response can have was evident in the EU&rsquo;s import ban on goods from, and restrictions on exports to, Crimea and Sevastopol, following their illegal annexation by Russia.</p>  <p>  I would like to draw a clear distinction between settlements in occupied territory, and Israel itself, and to reiterate that the Government does not support the policy known as &lsquo;BDS&rsquo; in relation to Israel. This has been the position of every Irish Government. </p>  <p>  Ireland remains a strong and consistent critic of Israeli policies relating to the occupation, and in particular those connected with the construction of settlements on Palestinian land.  We make those criticisms clearly and directly to the Israeli authorities, and in discussions in the EU and other relevant international fora. We do the same in relation to other countries.</p></reply>

Ireland strongly condemns all forms of persecution on the basis of religion or belief, and attaches great importance to combating all forms of discrimination based on religion or belief and incitement to religious hatred.  Ireland consistently raises the issues of racism and intolerance and advocates for inclusive societies at the UN Human Rights Council, as well as at the Council of Europe and the OSCE. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, Ireland is unequivocal in its stance on the death penalty.  We oppose and condemn its use in all circumstances, and in particular in cases where there are allegations of unfair trials preceding its implementation.  The abolition of the death penalty is one of Ireland&rsquo;s international priorities, and my Department regularly conveys our stance on this issue to all countries where the death penalty is still in use. </p>  <p>  The conflict in Yemen, now in its third year, has led to grave concerns about human rights and Ireland has worked in the UN system to address these. At the Human Rights Council in September 2017, Ireland joined the small core group of countries that drove forward the adoption of a Resolution on Yemen, which established a group of international experts to investigate the facts in relation to violations of human rights and humanitarian law on the ground. This group will report back to the Human Rights Council, as an important step towards accountability in Yemen.</p>  <p>  Among other pressing issues, this resolution expressed concern at the severe restrictions on freedom of religion or belief in Yemen, including for members of the Baha&rsquo;i faith. Ireland calls on all parties to immediately release all Baha&rsquo;i detained in Yemen due to their religious belief, to cease the issuance of arrest warrants against them and to cease the harassment to which they are subjected. </p>  <p>  Officials from this Department also remain in contact with representatives of the Baha&rsquo;i community in Ireland, with whom they have discussed the situation in Yemen, and will continue to monitor the situation closely.</p>  <p>  My Department necessarily prioritises its efforts to promote improvements in the general human rights situation, as it does not have the capacity to actively pursue at EU and international level all of the individual cases that arise.  Accordingly, my Department will continue to monitor the human rights situation in Yemen, as well as the issues of freedom of religion and the death penalty, and will take every appropriate opportunity to advocate for them. </p>  <p>  Finally, a real improvement in the human rights situation in Yemen will require an end to conflict. I would like to assure the Deputy that Ireland will continue to support all efforts towards a negotiated settlement to the conflict in that country.</p></reply>

Ireland has been a consistent supporter and full participant in the development of the EU&rsquo;s Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP), in particular ensuring ongoing support for the UN and multilateralism and its capacity to contribute to international peace and security operations. As one of the main contributing countries to CSDP missions we have also been fully engaged in developing the PESCO concept. Ireland views the development of PESCO as a mechanism aimed at enhancing the EU&rsquo;s capacity to engage in peacekeeping and crisis management operations, in line with our own values, and consequently complementing our work in disarmament.    Disarmament and non-proliferation remains a high priority for my Department and continues to be a strong focus for our foreign policy. In 2017 we played a lead role in the adoption of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. Ireland also currently holds the Chairmanship, with Iceland, of the Missile Technology Control Regime. </p>  <p>  With regard to PESCO, it is important to reiterate that there is no requirement on Ireland or any other EU member State to achieve any specific target in relation to Defence expenditure, nor is there any agreement at EU level in this regard. The Deputy will be aware that the Lisbon Treaty explicitly provides that it is entirely a matter for Ireland, or any other Member State, to determine the nature and volume of its own defence and security expenditure, as well as the nature of its defence capabilities.</p></reply>

I can confirm that the person&rsquo;s parents have submitted an application for an Irish passport.  However that application is on hold, pending the receipt of guidance from the Department of Justice and Equality on the question of the status and citizenship entitlement of persons born in the State to a parent benefiting from subsidiary protection.  This clarity is necessary due to the Department&rsquo;s legal obligations under the Passports Act, 2008 as amended (&ldquo;the Act&rdquo;).  The Act provides, among other things, that a person must be an Irish citizen before a passport can be issued to him/her.  In order to meet this legal requirement, therefore, each person must demonstrate an entitlement to Irish citizenship in his/her application.</p>  <p>  For those persons who were born in the State on or after 1 January 2005, their entitlement to Irish citizenship is governed by the terms of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956 as amended (&ldquo;the 1956 Act&rdquo;).  Section 6A of the 1956 Act provides that a person born in the State on or after 1 January 2005, where neither parent is an Irish or British citizen or otherwise entitled to reside in the State or Northern Ireland without restriction at the time of that person&rsquo;s birth may claim citizenship by birth in the State (and thereby establish eligibility for an Irish passport) only where a parent has been lawfully resident in the State for three years of the four preceding his/her birth.</p>  <p>  Proof of lawful residence in the State, to determine whether or not a parent has the required three year period of lawful residence, is required in all such passport applications. </p>  <p>  In the case in question, the applicant&rsquo;s parent had been granted Subsidiary Protection by the Department of Justice and Equality (D/JE) shortly before the applicant&rsquo;s birth.  This Department has sought confirmation from D/JE on whether such residence is reckonable for the purposes of citizenship under section 6A of the 1956 Act.    Pending receipt of the requested guidance by the Department, the passport application submitted for the person in question cannot be finalised, as no entitlement to Irish citizenship has yet been demonstrated.</p></reply>

At the 28th Session of the Universal Periodic Review of the Human Rights Council in Geneva on 6 November 2017, Ireland commended Argentina on its record of adherence to international human rights norms and treaties, but expressed our concern that the implementation of legislative processes pertaining to human rights remained weak in some cases, and that this implementation gap disproportionately affected vulnerable members of Argentine society, including members of indigenous communities.</p>  <p>  In that regard Ireland recommended that Argentina develop and implement, in close consultation with civil society, a national human rights plan with clear, specific and measurable goals.</p>  <p>  In addition to representations at multilateral level, officials of my Department at home and abroad meet regularly with human rights activists and civil society leaders in Latin America, including those working on the rights of indigenous communities. My Department also makes a financial contribution to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights to support its valuable work of protecting and vindicating human rights in the region. </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy of this Department&rsquo;s ongoing engagement with issues affecting indigenous communities in Latin America.</p></reply>

The property valuation must be determined on a specific &lsquo;valuation date&rsquo; and forms the basis for the LPT charge until the next &lsquo;valuation date&rsquo;. The first &lsquo;valuation date&rsquo; for LPT was 1 May 2013 and the valuation of a property set on that date remains valid until 31 October 2019, following legislative amendments in the Finance (Local Property Tax) Amendment Act 2015. The 1 May 2013 valuation is not affected by any subsequent improvements or extensions to a residential property. Likewise, where a property is sold during the valuation period, and the value of the property has increased, there is no additional liability to LPT providing the initial 2013 valuation was accurate.</p><p>To assist with the calculation of LPT liability, valuations are divided into twenty (20) &lsquo;valuation bands&rsquo; that incrementally increase by &euro;50,000 per band. The only exceptions in this regard are Band 1 (&euro;0 to &euro;100,000) and Band 20 (greater than &euro;1m). The LPT liability for Bands 1 to 19 is calculated at 0.18% of the mid-point in each band. For example, properties valued in Band 1 pay &euro;90 per year (0.18% of &euro;50,000). The LPT liability on properties valued in Band 20 is calculated at 0.18% up to &euro;1m and 0.25% on the portion above &euro;1m. With effect from 2015, Local Authorities can vary the LPT base rate (rate applied in 2014) by plus or minus 15% on residential properties located in their specific area. This variation is referred to as the 'Local Adjustment Factor'. </p><p>The person who is the liable owner of a residential property on the &lsquo;liability date&rsquo; must make all statutory returns and payments in respect of that year. The &lsquo;liability date&rsquo; in respect of 2013 was 1 May 2013 and for all subsequent years is 1 November in the preceding year. For example, the liability date in respect of 2018 is 1 November 2017. The statutory payment date for LPT is 1 January in the due year (i.e. 1 January 2018 for 2018). However to ease the payment burden Revenue introduced a wide range of options that facilitate payment in full on the due date, on a phased basis over the course of the year, or by annual debit authority on 21 March in the due year. The phased payment arrangements can operate through direct debits from current bank accounts, through salary deductions, or through deductions from certain Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine payments.</p><p>The LPT Act provides for a number of exemptions from the tax where certain qualifying criteria are met. Properties qualifying for some of the exemptions are not liable to LPT for the full &lsquo;valuation period&rsquo; (currently 1 May 2013 to 31 October 2019) while others cease to be available once a change occurs in the status of the property and the qualifying conditions are no longer met. </p><p>The LPT Act also provides for a deferral or partial deferral (50%) of LPT where certain specified circumstances exist. These circumstances include &lsquo;Income Level&rsquo;, &lsquo;Hardship&rsquo;, &lsquo;Personal Insolvency&rsquo; and &lsquo;Personal Representative of a Deceased Person&rsquo;. Once granted, a deferral normally remains in place for the duration of the &lsquo;valuation period&rsquo; (currently 1 May 2013 to 31 October 2019). However a deferral is not an exemption and the outstanding liability remains as a charge on the property and must be paid before a sale or transfer can be completed. Interest is also charged on the deferred amount at a rate of 4% per annum. </p><p>In circumstances of non-compliance, Revenue has a number of sanctions available to secure payment. These include mandatory deduction from salary, occupational pension and certain Government payments; withholding of a refund of other tax as payment against LPT; surcharge on income tax, corporation tax or capital gains tax returns; refusal of a tax clearance certificate; application of interest at the rate of 8% per annum; referral to a sheriff or a solicitor for collection;  Attachment of a bank account or third party debt. Revenue always makes every effort to engage with the defaulting taxpayer in an attempt to agree a mutually acceptable payment arrangement before any debt collection sanctions are applied. </p><p>Revenue publishes detailed statistical information on LPT, including collection at Local Authority level, on its website at:  <i><i>www.revenue.ie/en/corporate/information-about-revenue/statistics/local-property-tax/index.aspx.</i></i></p><p>I recently announced that a review of the LPT will be advanced by my Department during 2018.  The review will look in particular at the impact on LPT liabilities of property price developments. It will also include an examination of the outstanding recommendations of the 2015 Thornhill review of the Local Property Tax (LPT). The review will be carried out by the Department of Finance in conjunction with the Revenue Commissioners and the Departments of Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform and Housing, Planning &amp;amp; Local Government. The review will include a consultation process to enable all interested parties and individuals to submit their views on the future of the LPT.</p><p>The purpose of the review will be to inform me in relation to any actions I may recommend to Government concerning the overall yield from LPT and its contribution to total tax revenue. The review will be informed by the desirability of achieving relative stability, both over the short and longer terms, in LPT payments of liable persons.</p><p>Distribution of LPT to local authorities is the responsibility of the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government. Local retention of LPT began in 2015 and is now established as an important source of funding for the local government sector, thereby reducing reliance on central funding. The Government decided that 80% of the estimated LPT liability in each local authority area for a given year is retained in that area to fund public services, notwithstanding any local variation decisions. The remaining 20% of LPT is re-distributed to provide equalisation funding to those local authorities that have lower property tax bases, due to the variance in property values and density across the State. This reflects the fact that local authorities vary significantly from one another in terms of size, population, public service demands, infrastructure and income sources.</p><p>In accordance with decisions taken by Government regarding the distribution of LPT, every local authority has a minimum level of funding available to it, known as the baseline.  There are variances across the country in terms of LPT levels but it is important that all local authorities receive at least this baseline level of funding to ensure they can deliver services. Equalisation is the process that ensures that every local authority&rsquo;s LPT allocation is brought up to this baseline and there is a finite level of funding available for this purpose. Funding for equalisation purposes is provided via the Local Government Fund. The shortfall between the 20% contribution from all local authorities and the total amount required for equalisation is met by the Exchequer. </p><p>LPT allocations amounts and the distribution of equalisation funding are published on  Department of Housing Planning and Local Governments&rsquo; website at the following link:  <i>www.housing.gov.ie/search/archived/current/sub-type/funding-allocation/type/publications?query=local%20property%20tax%20allocations.</i></p></reply>

However, the Bank has also advised that it will continue to review, challenge and verify the work undertaken by the lenders to ensure that all affected customers are identified and that any emerging issues are addressed.  The Central Bank has pointed out that the examination framework requires lenders to contact impacted customers when they are identified and to immediately stop the imposition of further harm.  In terms of the payment of appropriate redress and compensation, the Central Bank has indicated that every bank is dead lined to the maximum of their ability to deliver such payments.  Unfortunately it will take some banks, such as the one referred to by the Deputy, somewhat longer than some other banks to conclude this process but I have made it clear that I want every affected mortgage borrower to be paid the appropriate redress and compensation as soon as possible.  The Central Bank is also very conscious of this and it has indicated that all impacted borrowers who have so far been identified will be repaid and compensated by the end of June.</p></reply>

Neither I nor the Central Bank can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on the risks they are willing to accept.</p><p>However, it is acknowledged that pricing in the motor insurance sector has been subject to a lot of volatility in recent years, from a point where some premiums appeared to be priced at an unsustainably low level to the more recent experience of large increases.</p><p>Indeed, the problem of rising motor insurance premiums was the main impetus for the establishment of the Cost of Insurance Working Group in July 2016.  Its <i>Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance</i>was published in January 2017.  The Report makes 33 recommendations with 71 associated actions to be carried out in agreed timeframes, which are set out in an Action Plan. </p><p>These recommendations were formulated to address the issue of increasing motor insurance costs, whilst taking account of the need to ensure a financially stable insurance sector.  This stability aspect is important, as we do not want to find ourselves in a situation again where particular firms drive prices down to a level that is unsustainable and which ultimately results in insolvency.</p><p>Work is ongoing on the implementation of the recommendations by the relevant Government Departments and Agencies and there is a commitment within the Report that the Working Group will prepare quarterly updates on its progress.  The third such update was published on the Department's website on 23 October 2017 and shows the progress to date on the overall implementation of the recommendations. </p><p>32 actions were due for completion in the first three quarters of 2017 in total and 29 of those actions have been completed to date.  Substantial work has also been undertaken in respect of the nine action points categorised as &ldquo;ongoing&rdquo;.  The fourth quarterly update for 2017 is scheduled to be published within the next few weeks and will focus on the 14 actions which were due for completion in the final quarter of 2017. </p><p>I believe that the ongoing implementation of the <i>Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance, </i>in addition to the implementation of the Working Group's forthcoming report on employer and public liability insurance, will make a difference to the pricing of insurance premiums over the next 12 or so months.  It is envisaged that the implementation of all the recommendations cumulatively, with the appropriate levels of commitment and cooperation from all relevant stakeholders, will achieve the objective of delivering fairer premiums for consumers.  I also believe that the Setanta judgment, by finding that MIBI is not liable to meet third party claims, removes a major uncertainty from industry, which I would expect to be reflected in pricing in the short to medium term.</p><p>Finally, it should be noted that the most recent CSO data (for December 2017) indicates that private motor insurance premiums have decreased by 16.3% since peaking in July 2016.  While the CSO statistics indicate a greater degree of stability on an overall basis, these figures represent a broad average and therefore there are many people who may still be seeing increases.  However, I am hopeful that this greater stability in pricing will be maintained and that premiums should continue to fall from the very high levels of mid-2016.</p></reply>

The Deputy will appreciate that tax reliefs and exemptions have costs which have to be paid for and their introduction must be considered only where there is a clear economic and social policy need to be addressed.  </p>  <p>  It should be noted in relation to local property tax (LPT), that where a person downsizes their residential property, assuming they stay in a similar location to the property they are selling, their LPT liability will, most likely, be less than the amount they would have been liable for on their original property. </p>  <p>  In relation to what might also be regarded as property-related taxes, Stamp Duties are payable on the acquisition of residential property.  The current rates are 1% on values up to &euro;1M and 2% on any balance over that. I do not consider that a rate of 1% on the purchase of a property would represent a serious disincentive to any property owner considering trading down. </p>  <p>  In relation to Capital Gains Tax (CGT), an exemption is in place on the disposal of a person's principal private residence.  The exemption applies to any gain made on the disposal of an individual's dwelling house together with land occupied up to an area of one acre, excluding the site of the house. Full CGT relief applies where the period of occupation matches the period of ownership, and partial relief applies where the house has not been occupied by the individual for the full period of ownership.</p></reply>

However, most such companies are likely to be recorded in the broader trade sector &ldquo;Mining and Quarrying&rdquo;.  The effective Corporation Tax rate for companies in the Mining and Quarrying sector for the years 2006 to 2015 (the latest year available), is as shown in the following table.

Profit resource rent tax applies in respect of profits from operating oil and gas fields in respect of licences/licensing option granted on or after 1 January 2007 to 17 June 2014.

This assessment must also include the consideration of the results of a test on the personal consumer&rsquo;s ability to repay the mortgage instalments, over the duration of the agreement, on the basis of a two per cent interest rate increase, at a minimum, above the interest rate offered to the personal consumer.  (This two per cent test does not apply to mortgages where the interest rate is fixed for a period of five years or more).  In order to conduct such an assessment, the lender is required to obtain and record sufficient financial and personal information from the consumer which is necessary, sufficient and proportionate.  In due course the lender will also be obliged to access the information held on the Central Credit Register in relation to a mortgage or other qualifying credit application.  </p>  <p>  The policy responsibility for personal insolvency law, including its cross border aspects, are a matter for the Minister for Justice and Equality.

Subject to compliance with applicable legislative and regulatory requirements, the decision to grant or refuse credit is a commercial decision by the individual regulated mortgage lender.</p></reply>

At the time of its introduction the Government had limited involvement in the banking system.  However, by Finance Bill 2013, this measure was considered to have outlasted its initial purpose.  Due to the State&rsquo;s substantial holdings in the banking sector (99.8% AIB and 15% of BOI at the time) it was deemed to be acting against the State&rsquo;s interests. </p>  <p>  Section 396C was repealed to:</p>  <p>  - Reduce the State&rsquo;s role as a &lsquo;backstop&rsquo; provider of capital. </p>  <p>  - Improve the existing value of the State&rsquo;s equity and debt investments. </p>  <p>  To recognise the part that the banks played in the financial crisis, in 2013, the Government decided that the banking sector should make an annual contribution of approximately &euro;150 million to the Exchequer for the period from 2014 to 2016.  In Budget 2017, the payment of this levy was extended until 2021.  It was anticipated that the bank levy could be expected to raise &euro;750 million over five years.</p>  <p>  As I have previously stated, I do not intend to reintroduce the 50% restriction that was in place until 2014 and that the appropriate way for the banks to contribute to the economy is through the bank levy.  However, at Report Stage of Finance Bill 2017, I made a commitment to provide a technical paper on the matter of bank losses to the Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach by June 2018.  The commitment was made in the context of the potential impact on capital levels of the banks if changes were made to the manner in which loss relief can be offset, with the stipulation that maintaining the bank levy as the appropriate measure would remain the clear policy standpoint.</p></reply>

My Department, along with the Department of Rural and Community Development, are the Departments tasked with the responsibility for fulfilling this commitment. </p>  <p>  Local public banking is where a State, or other public body, has ownership of a financial institution.  In Germany, local public banks, called Sparkassen, are only permitted to operate in specific geographic regions.  The business model of Sparkassen is not to maximise profits, but rather promote economic development and financial inclusion in the particular regional area in which they operate.  In terms of SME finance, Sparkassen tend to build close relationships with SMEs in their locality.</p>  <p>  The investigation of local public banking has consisted of a consultation process engaging with stakeholders and interested parties.  This consultation process was carried out last year by the Department of Rural and Community Development, assisted by my Department.  </p>  <p>  Additionally, there has also been consideration of a proposal put forward by Irish Rural Link and the Savings Banks Foundation for International Cooperation (SBFIC), the international development wing of the Sparkassen group.  The proposal outlines a potential model of local public banking, based on the German model, in Ireland.  There have been a number of meetings between officials in both departments and representatives from Irish Rural Link and SBFIC. </p>  <p>  Officials in my Department and the Department of Community and Rural Development have been working closely together.  They have now completed the report on the findings of their investigation and both I, and my colleague, the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Michael Ring T.D., have received this report.  We are currently reviewing and considering it.  We expect to be in a position to bring the joint report on the investigation of local public banking to Government, for approval, in the near future.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may be interested to know that there are already significant Government measures in place to support access to finance by Irish SMEs.   These include the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI), the Supporting SMEs Online Tool, the Microenterprise Loan Fund, Local Enterprise Offices, the Credit Review Office and the Credit and Counter Guarantee Schemes.</p>  <p>  Additionally, my Department is working with other Government departments to develop tailored and innovative schemes to meet the evolving needs of Irish SMEs, such as the Agricultural Cashflow Support Loan Scheme and the Brexit Loan Scheme I announced in Budgets 2017 and 2018 respectively.</p></reply>

Sealuchais &Aacute;rachais Teoranta (SAT), a statutory company under the Insurance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1985 acted as a non-trading holding company for Icarom plc (formerly the Insurance Corporation of Ireland) which was under administration.  The two Directors of the company were officials of my Department.  The administration of Icarom came to a close in early 2013.

It ceased operations in July 2017 and all board members have resigned.  A caretaker board consisting of two Departmental officials and a Central Bank nominee will remain in place until dissolution is effected through primary legislation which will effect the transfer of all of ReBo&rsquo;s assets and liabilities to the Minister for Finance.</p>  <p>  The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland is a new company established in 2014.</p>  <p>  The Tax Appeals Commission was established in 2016 and replaces the Office of the Appeal Commissioners.</p>  <p>  The Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman Act 2017 merged the offices of the Pensions Ombudsman and the Financial Services Ombudsman into a single office which provides a one stop shop for people with unresolved complaints against financial service and pension providers.  The Office of the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman was established on 1 January 2018.  Within that office is the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman Council.  Prior to the amalgamation, the Financial Services Ombudsman&rsquo;s Council was previously a body under the aegis of my Department and  the Pensions Ombudsman was a body under the aegis of what is now the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.</p></reply>

Something had to be done to preserve and boost jobs and it is an unavoidable fact that difficult economic situations require hard and very often unpopular decisions.  All sectors of the economy had to contribute to the recovery plan and the levy was designed to claw back a small amount of the very generous tax reliefs that those contributing to pension arrangements had benefitted from over many years. </p>  <p>  The original 0.6% stamp duty levy on pension fund assets ended in 2014.  The additional levy of 0.15% which my predecessor introduced for 2014 and 2015, mainly to help continue to fund Jobs Initiative, also ended in 2015.</p>  <p>  The position is that the equivalent value of all of the money raised from the stamp duty levy has been used to fund the wide range of measures introduced in the Jobs Initiative to protect existing jobs and to help create new jobs and the Initiative has been a success in this regard.  The measures introduced include expenditure measures such as the JobBridge and Springboard schemes, as well as a number of tax and PRSI incentives such as the reduction in the VAT rate from 13.5% to 9% for the tourism and hospitality sectors and the temporary halving of the lower employer PRSI rate. </p>  <p>  Under the legislation, the payment of the levy is treated as a necessary expense of a pension scheme and the trustees or insurer, as appropriate, are entitled where needed to adjust current or prospective benefits payable under a scheme to take account of the levy.   It is up to the trustees or insurer to decide whether, when and how the levy should be passed on and to what extent, given the particular circumstances of the pension schemes for which they are responsible.  However, the legislation also includes safeguards aimed at ensuring that should the option of reducing scheme benefits be taken, it must be applied in an equitable fashion across the different classes of scheme members that could include active, deferred and retired members.  In no case may the reduction in an individual member's or class of member's benefits exceed the member's or class of member's share of the levy.  Where pension scheme trustees or an insurer took the decision to treat the levy as an expense of the pension scheme, they would have adjusted current or prospective benefits payable to members under that scheme.  The consequence of this treatment by the trustees or insurer could be a permanent reduction in members' benefits.</p>  <p>  The value of the funds raised by way of the levy have been used to protect and create jobs and this has helped to create the improving financial and economic position of the State.  Taxpayers to whom the impact of the levy may have been passed on by the chargeable persons responsible for the payment of the levy (the pension scheme trustees, etc.) will benefit from the changes which my predecessor began in Budget 2015 and which have continued in subsequent Budgets to reduce the tax burden on low and middle income earners.</p></reply>

The Minor Works proposed in this area will involve site investigations and further assessment to examine the current conveyance capacity of the culvert at Willow Dale, and the replacement of the existing debris screen to the culvert at Willow Avenue.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-01-23a.318.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018012300069#WRF05000"><p>The Public Service Stability Agreement (PSSA) 2018-2020, which was ratified by Government and by public service trade unions and representative associations, sets out the policy on public service pension increases adopted by Government for the duration of that agreement (to end-2020). </p>  <p>  Specifically, section 6.2 of this agreement indicates that pension increases in the public service will be guided by the following three elements:  </p>  <p>  - First, the need to adopt an equitable approach to the various public service pensioner cohorts differentiated by date of retirement (in particular pre and post end-February 2012) is affirmed.  </p>  <p>  - Second, for those who retired or will retire post end-February 2012, to the extent that they retired on reduced salaries for pension award purposes, they will receive pension increases in line with pay increases received by their peers currently in employment in accordance with the terms of the collective agreement. </p>  <p>  - Third, when alignment is achieved between pre and post end-February 2012 pensioners, as will happen progressively for salary ranges up to &euro;70,000 in 2020 under the proposed collective agreement, pay increases will continue to benefit pensions in payment for the duration of the agreement.  </p>  <p>  This means that, in general, the pay increases awarded under the PSSA over the period 2018-2020 will be passed through to qualifying pensions in payment.  Those public servants who have retired from 1 March 2012 (post-February 2012 retirees) will benefit from the pay increases awarded under the PSSA in nearly all cases.  </p>  <p>  Public servants who retired before 1 March 2012 (pre-March 2012 retirees) will benefit from the pay increases under the PSSA only where the current equivalent salary (paid to serving staff) is above, or moves above, the salary on which that pension is based. </p>  <p>  In addition to this, the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017 provides for the significant further lessening of the Public Service Pension Reduction (PSPR), occurring by way of threshold and rate changes to apply on 1 January 2019 and 1 January 2020.  </p>  <p>  This scheduled further lessening of the PSPR impact on pensions will mean that from 1 January 2019 all pensions up to &euro;39,000 per annum will be exempt from PSPR, removing some 12,000 pensioners from the impact of PSPR.</p>  <p>  From 1 January 2020, further PSPR-amelioration will mean that all pensions up to &euro;54,000 per annum will be exempt from PSPR, removing some 10,500 additional pensioners from the impact of PSPR.</p>  <p>  When fully in place from the beginning of 2020, these changes will mean that the vast majority of public service retirees - approximately 97% - comprising everyone with occupational pension values up to at least &euro;54,000, will be entirely free of PSPR.  For those who retired since end-February 2012 that threshold will be even higher at &euro;60,000.</p></reply>

The Council has now made two calls for apprenticeship proposals inviting consortia of enterprise, professional bodies and education and training providers to submit proposals for apprenticeship programmes to be developed to meet identified skill needs in their sector.</p><p>Following the Council&rsquo;s first call for proposals in 2015 a proposal for a HGV Driver Apprenticeship, with the Irish Road Haulage Association as industry lead, is currently in development and is scheduled to get underway later this year.  This programme, which is 3 years in duration, will lead to a level 5 qualification on the National Framework of Qualifications.</p><p>Resulting from last year's second call for proposals, last month, I announced 26 new apprenticeship proposals to be further developed into national apprenticeship programmes, including a proposal for a Logistics Associate Apprenticeship, with the Freight Transport Association Ireland as industry lead.  This programme, which is 2 years in duration, will lead to a level 6 qualification on the National Framework of Qualifications.  It is estimated that the development process will take between 12 and 15 months.</p><p>These apprenticeship proposals approved for further development include detail on the wider breadth of the delivery of the apprenticeships and a commitment to the delivery of off-the-job training on a national basis with the appropriate resources and facilities. As consortia further progress their proposals, further detail will become available.  A list of the 26 proposals is set out in the following table.</p><p>With regard to apprenticeships in mechanics, there are a number of apprenticeships currently on offer in the area such as motor mechanic, heavy vehicle mechanic and agricultural mechanic.

In addition, my Department is currently engaging with the local authority in relation to additional residential development in Kildare, including the Naas area.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, there are building projects for Naas included in the Major Capital Programme at St. Corbans Primary School and Mercy Convent Primary School.</p></reply>

The GIS uses data from a range of sources, including the Central Statistics Office, Ordnance Survey Ireland, the Department of Social Protection and the Department's own databases.  With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises at primary and post primary level to determine where additional school accommodation is needed.</p>  <p>  Where demographic data indicates that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may, depending on the circumstances, be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following: utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools; extending the capacity of a school or schools; and provision of a new school or schools.</p>  <p>  As with other school planning areas nationwide, the demographic data for the South Kildare school planning areas is being kept under ongoing review by my Department to take account of updated data.  It is anticipated that decisions based on the nationwide demographic exercises will be announced shortly.</p>  <p>  With regard to demand for particular models of school provision, it should be noted that the patronage process for new schools is a separate process which has been in place since 2011.  This process is run after it has been decided that a new school is required.  Parental preferences are central to this process and prospective patrons are required to provide evidence of demand for their particular school model and medium of instruction.  Therefore, where, based on demographics, it might be indicated that a new school is required, it cannot be guaranteed that this would be a school under a particular type of patronage as this will be dependent to a large degree on parental preferences in the area at the time of a patronage process.</p>  <p>  The patronage process has been in place since 2011 and is a fair, transparent and open process and it is open to all patrons to apply.  In the context of the ongoing demographic exercises and in light of the process in place to decide who will operate any school(s) which may arise from these exercises, it would not be appropriate to meet with individual campaign groups.</p>  <p>  My Department is aware that representatives of Educate Together and the Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board entered into discussions regarding a possible partnership to provide Educate Together second-level provision in the Newbridge area of South Kildare, where significant additional places are being delivered.  I welcome this development and consider it a great example of constructive co-operation between patron bodies in order to provide greater choice and diversity to the education system.</p></reply>

The content of the Science curriculum is broken into four main strands /areas of learning: Living Things, Energy and Forces, Materials and Environmental Awareness and Care. The Science curriculum effectively allows for the evolving nature of the subject by having a programme which is not solely focused on acquiring knowledge and facts but rather promotes skill development. Pupils&rsquo; skills of working scientifically and designing and making are developed as work is completed on the four areas. Pupils are provided with opportunities to develop their higher-order skills by applying the knowledge and skills acquired to solving open-ended investigations and to design and make activities.</p>  <p>  Therefore the Primary Science curriculum aims to develop knowledge and understanding of scientific and technological concepts through exploration, to develop a scientific approach to problem solving which emphasises understanding and constructive thinking, and to foster children&rsquo;s natural curiosity.</p>  <p>  Other additional opportunities to support pupils&rsquo; learning in Science through their involvement in STEM education initiatives in primary schools include: Discover Primary Science and Maths Awards; the BT Young Scientist and Technology Exhibition (BTYSTE); SciFest; CoderDojo; Coolest Projects; RDS STEM Learning; LearnStorm; Smart Futures; and the Green Schools&rsquo; Programme.</p>  <p>  My Department's Action Plan for Education for 2016-2019 and the National Skills Strategy contain a clear commitment to supporting and developing Science, Technology, Engineer and Mathematics (STEM).  My Department also published a new STEM Education Policy Statement and Implementation Plan in November 2017. The Implementation Plan, which covers the period 2017-2019, contains a range of actions for primary education, including: providing guidance and support to newly qualified teachers to embed STEM into teaching, learning and assessment; commencing a school-based initiative on coding in primary schools to explore approaches to integrating coding in the primary curriculum; and providing advice and guidance to schools to facilitate teachers and schools working together to improve the quality of STEM teaching and learning.</p>  <p>  Additionally, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment is in the process of developing a new primary Mathematics curriculum which will include elements of creative and computational thinking, which underpin coding and computer science.</p></reply>

The income threshold for this grant is &euro;23,000. Qualifying postgraduate students may also be eligible to have their tuition fees paid up to a maximum fee limit of &euro;6,270.</p>  <p>  Alternatively a postgraduate student may qualify to have a &euro;2,000 contribution made towards the cost of his/her fees. The income threshold for this payment is &euro;31,500 for the 2017/2018 academic year.</p>  <p>  My Department also provides funding for the Student Assistance Fund (SAF). The fund is available in various publicly funded higher education institutions. The SAF provides financial assistance to students experiencing financial difficulties while attending third level. Students can be assisted towards their rent, childcare costs, transport costs and books/class materials. The SAF is open to full-time registered students on courses of not less than one year's duration leading to an undergraduate or postgraduate qualification.</p>  <p>  Tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education. Further information on this tax relief is available from the Revenue Commissioners at www.revenue.ie.</p></reply>

The next step will be for the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to bring forward a Memorandum for Government on the formal ratification process which will happen in the coming weeks.  The Attorney General has advised that a D&aacute;il resolution will be required in the context of a charge upon public funds arising from the ratification of the convention.  This will be a welcome opportunity for debate in the House on the position of people with disabilities in our society and the importance of this convention. </p>  <p>  The Government also approved the publication of draft legislation relating to deprivation of liberty for public consultation.  The draft legislative provisions outline proposed safeguards for older people, persons with a disability and certain categories of people with mental health issues to ensure that they are not unlawfully deprived of their liberty in residential facilities. </p>  <p>  Deprivation of liberty is a sensitive and important matter which goes to the heart of fundamental freedoms and human rights.  Legislative proposals in this area will have significant implications for families, the operation of the health services and the courts.  It is important that people fully understand what is being proposed.  For this reason, Minister Harris and I are inviting submissions from stakeholders and the general public by way of public consultation up until March before these are finalised for drafting. </p>  <p>  This Government is making good progress with regard to making the Convention&rsquo;s requirements operational in Ireland in an appropriate and timely manner.  Considerable progress has already been made to overcome the remaining legislative barriers to Ireland&rsquo;s full implementation of the Convention as set out in the 2015 roadmap. </p>  <p>  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 was signed into law on 30 December 2015 and is a comprehensive reform on the law of decision&ndash;making capacity.  Section 5 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 was reformed through a 2017 Act of the same name to facilitate the full participation in family life of persons with intellectual disabilities and the full expression of their human rights.   </p>  <p>  There are two further priority implementation issues: these are the enactment of the Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016 and the commencement of the Assisted Decision Making Capacity Act 2015 which requires the Decision Support Service to be operational and ready to roll out the new &ndash;decision making support options.  The 2018 Budget has provided an allocation of &euro;3 million for the establishment of the Decision Support Service. </p>  <p>  Finally, I am continuing to take a wide range of practical measures to improve the lives of people with disabilities.  The Report of the &lsquo;Make Work Pay Group&rsquo; was published in April of last year and already action, as announced by Minister Harris has been taken on its recommendations. </p>  <p>  We have a Comprehensive Employment Strategy in place and 2017 saw positive action measures being taken to support public service recruitment of people with disabilities.  I also published the Disability Inclusion Strategy in July of last year containing a wide range of practical commitments to improve the lives of people with disabilities. </p></reply>

Accordingly, the putting in place of the internal structures to service the Disclosures Tribunal referred to was a matter for the Commissioner without a direct role for the Minister.  I am advised that it would be proper for me as Minister to prescribe the approach which is taken by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na towards the Tribunal.</p>  <p>  On a general note I would reiterate that the Government has been anxious to ensure that the Tribunal receives the greatest degree of assistance possible from all parties, not least An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  To that end the Government has sought to ensure that the required resources are at the disposal of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to service the Tribunal in a timely and effective manner. </p>  <p>  I am advised that the Disclosure Tribunal Co-ordination Office is currently staffed by two fulltime members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, one appointed by the former Garda Commissioner and one by the current Acting Commissioner.  There are also a number of additional personnel facilitating the work of the coordination office on an ad hoc basis as requirements dictate.  Liaison persons have been nominated from relevant sections/regions to deal with specific requests from the Tribunal.  I am further advised that the Disclosures Tribunal Coordination Office will assist any member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, serving and retired, irrespective of rank in relation to the Disclosures Tribunal.   </p>  <p>  Early last year the former Commissioner identified a need for the re-engagement of a small number of retired persons to meet the needs of the Tribunal and my Department approved this in February, subject to formal sanction, which was conveyed by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on 5 May.  The Tribunal commenced its work in February. </p>  <p>  The formal sanction provided for the engagement of three persons (i.e. two retired members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and one civilian) for up to nine months for the purposes of servicing the Tribunal.  I am advised that the services of two retired senior members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (one retired Assistant Commissioner and one retired Chief Superintendent) were engaged initially for a period of six months and then for a further period of three months to 30 November 2017 in accordance with the formal sanction. I understand that both former officers concerned have now left their posts in compliance with the sanction.  There are no retired members currently employed with the Disclosure Tribunal Co-ordination Office. </p>  <p>  For completeness I would remind the Deputy that the Commissioner made a report to me under section 41(1) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 on 27 November last.  The report forwarded a document that detailed concerns in relation to the operation of the Tribunal Co-ordination Office. </p>  <p>  This matter is something I treat with the utmost seriousness and in that regard I instructed that the contents of the report be referred to the Tribunal.  That was done on 29 November last. The report was also referred to the Office of the Attorney General in order to seek advice in relation to the matters contained in the document and the appropriate course of action.</p>  <p>  I wrote to the Commissioner and requested a report under section 41(2) of the 2005 Garda Act 2005 addressing all of the issues raised in the document in so far as it relates to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Commissioner's responsibilities.  In late December, the Commissioner's interim response was forwarded to my Department.  This response does not articulate any concerns in relation to the establishment, staffing or operation of the Disclosures Tribunal Liaison Office.  I have however, sought further detail from the Commissioner to allow my Department to assess, independently, the material points contained in document in relation to matters within the responsibility of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p></reply>

Human trafficking and forced labour can exist in supply chains, in Ireland, or in the overseas supply chains of companies operating here.</p>  <p>  Human trafficking is an offence under the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008, which provides for up to life imprisonment and an unlimited fine. That legislation includes the offence of trafficking for the purposes of labour exploitation. The Act defines trafficking broadly, to include both recruitment and the provision of employment in situations of exploitation. The Act includes provisions in respect of extra-territorial jurisdiction. </p>  <p>  With regard to workplaces in Ireland, the Workplace Relations Commission is an independent, statutory body, responsible for the inspection of employment rights compliance and the provision of information to employees and the regulation and licensing of recruitment agencies. Inspectors notify an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na where there is a concern in relation to human trafficking. </p>  <p>  In addition to the deterrent effect of the law, I believe that consumer and investor demand are leading to greater awareness amongst companies of the need for human rights compliance in their supply chains. This includes ensuring trafficked labour does not form part of the chain, whether in Ireland or overseas. The Government supports this work in a number of ways across different Departments and Agencies.</p>  <p>  The Department of Justice and Equality, under the Second National Action Plan to Prevent and Combat Human Trafficking in Ireland, keeps under review the adequacy of all measures aimed at the protection of individuals from labour exploitation. In formulating the Second National Action Plan, the Department engaged with trade unions and employers' representative bodies, and will continue to do so with a view to strengthening their preventative role against trafficking and forced labour.  </p>  <p>  My Department will also work with the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation as lead Department, to enable ratification of Optional Protocol No. 29 to the Forced Labour Convention of the International Labour Organisation. That Protocol further strengthens the international legal framework against forced labour, including by supporting due diligence by public and private sectors to prevent and respond to risks of forced or compulsory labour.</p>  <p>  There are a range of other initiatives supported by Government to address the root causes of trafficking and forced labour in supply chains.</p>  <p>  Ireland's National Action Plan on Corporate Social Responsibility, which is being taken forward by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, includes the promotion of guidance and best practice initiatives relating to sustainable supply chain policies.</p>  <p>  Ireland's National Plan on Business and Human Rights 2017-2020, recently launched by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, aims to give effect to the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.

This Government has put in place significant Garda resources, both human and financial, but, as the Policing Authority has emphasised, cultural change within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is of critical importance. </p>  <p>  The Road Safety Authority published its mid-term evaluation of the Road Safety Strategy 2013-2020 earlier this month, and the consensus of all stakeholders involved in the evaluation was that the focus must be on the main killer behaviours on Irish roads. 22 new actions were drawn up, including 12 key actions for priority implementation, which include the extension of the Fixed Charge Notice (FCN) System and an increase in penalties associated with a number of road traffic offences, such as speeding, mobile phone use and seatbelt use. As such, the operation of an effective FCN system continues to be a central tenet of road traffic enforcement and, by extension, national road safety.</p>  <p>  I have requested a report from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to the statistical information sought by the Deputy and I will be in contact directly with the Deputy immediately on receipt of a Garda report. </p></reply>

These reports were submitted to the Department on 31 August and published on 6 September. </p>  <p>  Following the consideration of these reports by the Department, further clarification was sought from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to the implementation of the proposed solutions relating to the issue of manual summonses. I am advised by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that an IT solution has been deployed to enable the Manual Summons Report to be delivered directly to the mailbox of each relevant District Officer with effect from 1 November 2017 and to the investigating member with effect from December 2017.</p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has also indicated that it has been considering an IT solution that would reduce the number of FCN offence codes that require manual summonses/manual intervention. The Garda National Roads Policing Bureau has been reviewing the number of FCN offence codes currently in use in view of the significant volume of codes in existence (614), however if the number of codes is reduced, this will increase the number of FCNs that proceed to manual summons and will increase the number of summonses that will require manual intervention. I have asked my officials to seek a further update on this matter from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, Crowe Horwath was selected by the Policing Authority to undertake a quality assurance review on the remedial actions taken by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in response to the FCN/summons and MAT issues and the ensuing report was published in November 2017. The Crowe Horwath report recommended that the Criminal Justice (Fixed Charge Processing System) Working Group (the Working Group) should examine its FCN/summons&rsquo; recommendations to identify and bring forward further improvements to the FCPS that can be made. Prior to the publication of the Crowe Horwath report, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na formally requested the Working Group to examine the findings of its internal FCN/summons&rsquo; examination and I understand that the recommendations/findings contained in both reports relevant to the Working Group's remit will be discussed at the Working Group&rsquo;s next meeting on 31 January 2018.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to maintain ongoing, close contact with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Policing Authority in relation to these road traffic enforcement issues. </p></reply>

It has extensive powers under the 2005 Act to enable it to carry out its responsibilities. The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act stipulates that GSOC is independent in the exercise of its functions and indeed, it is this guarantee of independence which is the hallmark of effective oversight.</p>  <p>  Respecting the independence of bodies such as GSOC is of paramount importance.  It would be a travesty if, having established such bodies, this House was then to seek to undermine their decisions.  </p>  <p>  Once GSOC has received a complaint it is a matter for it alone to carry out any investigation and arrive at a conclusion. Where a person is dissatisfied with the outcome of an investigation devolved to the Garda Commissioner under section 94 of the Act that person may request the Commission to review the investigation.  In all other respects where a person is unhappy with a decision of the Commission they may take it up with the Commission itself.  Alternatively such an individual may wish to obtain independent legal advice on any other options available to them.</p>  <p>  There is, as the Deputy is probably aware, a mechanism in the Act for an independent inquiry into the conduct designated officers of GSOC.  Section 109 of the Act permits the Minister, having consulted with GSOC, to invite the Chief Justice to nominate a judge of the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeal or the High Court to inquire into the conduct of a designated officer of GSOC while performing functions under section 98 or 99 in relation to an investigation.  Given the nature of such an inquiry, one which is carried out by a judge of the superior courts it can not be considered to be an ordinary complaints or grievance procedure and I would emphasise the point.  Furthermore, it is important to emphasise that the purpose of such an inquiry is to inquire into the conduct of a designated officer either on a particular occasion or in general in performing functions under the relevant sections.  Nevertheless, the section may be invoked in appropriate circumstances.</p></reply>

The Bill proposed to insert a new section 29A in the Coroners Act 1962 to: </p><p>(i) provide for the possibility of a verdict of Iatrogenic Suicide, </p><p>(ii) define Iatrogenic Suicide as &ldquo;the ending of one&rsquo;s own life where the effect of medical treatment undertaken by the deceased, including any prescribed medication, is the primary cause of such an action&rdquo;, and</p><p>(iii) provide a safeguard clause so that this verdict does not contravene section 30 of the Act of 1962 as far as they apportion of civil or criminal liability is concerned. </p><p>As I explained then to the Seanad, the Government's position on introducing a verdict of iatrogenic suicide was and remains that:</p><p>- while the proposal is well intentioned, it cannot be supported primarily for the reason that acceptance of the definition and, of a verdict of &lsquo;iatrogenic suicide&rsquo;, would risk the inquest apportioning some liability on the medical practitioner who may have prescribed the treatment or medication for the deceased person, </p><p>- the coroner's inquest cannot consider questions of civil or criminal liability and section 30 of the Coroners Act 1962 specifically provides against such consideration,  </p><p>- a sufficient range of verdicts is available to coroners including of suicide, open or medical misadventure.</p><p>I intend, in the forthcoming Coroners (Amendment) Bill to provide for a wider scope at inquests from investigating the immediate cause of death to looking also at the wider circumstances in which the person died. However, this Bill will not propose any change to coroners&rsquo; independence, nor to the existing rule that the coroner&rsquo;s verdict may not seek to decide any question of civil or criminal liability. Liability in that regard must remain a matter for the courts.  </p><p>I had the opportunity again at the meeting with the persons concerned to express my deepest sympathies over their loss. However, I had also to explain why it was not possible to support their campaign concerning a verdict of iatrogenic suicide. In addition, the Office of the Attorney General had advised that it would be legally unsound since such a new verdict would be capable of ascribing criminal liability to a person or persons who would be readily identifiable. </p><p>The Coroners Society of Ireland was also opposed to the proposal on iatrogenic suicide.</p><p>With regard to non-coronial medical matters, I would be happy to assist the persons concerned to arrange a meeting with the Minister for Health.</p></reply>

The General Scheme of Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Compensation) Bill 2017, which was approved by Government on 9 May 2017, aims to:</p><p>- repeal and replace the current legislative framework for Garda compensation with a more effective and efficient scheme giving rise to reduced legal and administrative costs,</p><p>- make provision for an independent assessment of quantum by the Personal Injuries Assessment Board having due regard to the Book of Quantum, and</p><p>- provide for the management of claims by the State Claims Agency which will also facilitate a risk assessment facility to afford An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na the opportunity to avoid risks identified.</p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, the NTMA is a State body which operates with a commercial remit to provide asset and liability management services to Government and is designated as the State Claims Agency when performing the claims and risk management functions delegated to it under the National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act 2000.</p><p>NTMA reports directly to the Minister for Finance in the performance of its State Claims Agency functions. The SCA&rsquo;s principal objectives are:</p><p>- To ensure that the State&rsquo;s liabilities in relation to personal injury and property damage claims, and the expenses of the SCA in relation to their management, are contained at the lowest achievable level.</p><p>- To implement targeted personal injury and property damage risk work programmes to mitigate litigation risk, in State authorities and healthcare enterprises, in order to reduce the costs of future litigation against the State.</p><p>The State Claims agency holds much of the relevant information sought by the Deputy, in respect of all Government Departments and Agencies.<table><tr><th>Compensation Scheme</th><th>Year</th><th>Nature of Claim</th><th>Amount &euro;</th><th>Number of claims the payouts related to by each agency</th><th>Number of claims that were settled out of court</th><th>Number of payments that were the result of a court judgement</th></tr><tr><td>Garda Compensation Scheme *</td><td>2010</td><td></td><td>&euro;5.4 m</td><td>174</td><td>0</td><td>174</td></tr><tr><td>Garda Compensation Scheme *</td><td>2011</td><td></td><td>&euro;6m</td><td>175</td><td>0</td><td>175</td></tr><tr><td>Garda Compensation Scheme *</td><td>2012</td><td></td><td>&euro;6.8m</td><td>111</td><td>0</td><td>112</td></tr><tr><td>Garda Compensation Scheme *</td><td>2013</td><td></td><td>&euro;5.9m</td><td>124</td><td>0</td><td>124</td></tr><tr><td>Garda Compensation Scheme *</td><td>2014</td><td></td><td>&euro;4m</td><td>111</td><td>0</td><td>111</td></tr><tr><td>Garda Compensation Scheme *</td><td>2015</td><td></td><td>&euro;3.6m</td><td>63</td><td>0</td><td>63</td></tr><tr><td>Garda Compensation Scheme *</td><td>2016</td><td></td><td>&euro;4.7m</td><td>74</td><td>0</td><td>74</td></tr><tr><td>Garda Compensation Scheme *</td><td>2017</td><td>Compensation for members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na maliciously injured in the course of their duty</td><td>&euro;5.7m</td><td>98</td><td>0</td><td>98</td></tr><tr><td>Ex-Gratia Scheme for members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na**</td><td>2017</td><td>Ex-Gratia Scheme for members injured or killed while driving an official vehicle in the line of duty where no malice was involved</td><td>&euro;60,000</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Legal Actions </td><td>2015</td><td>Miscarriage of Justice case under the Criminal procedure Act 1993</td><td>&euro;525,000</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Legal Actions</td><td>2016</td><td>Legal costs associated with Miscarriage of Justice case</td><td>&euro;294,848.50</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Legal Actions</td><td>2016</td><td>Miscarriage of Justice case</td><td>&euro;515,000</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Legal Actions</td><td>2017</td><td>Miscarriage of Justice case under the Criminal procedure Act 1993</td><td>&euro;179,277.90</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td></tr></table>Notes *The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Compensation) Acts, 1941 and 1945 provide for a scheme of compensation for members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who are maliciously injured in the course of their duty or in relation to the performance of their duties as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and for the dependants of members who have died from injuries maliciously inflicted on them.

The Department of Justice and Equality funded this research following a recommendation made by Ms Emily Logan, the then Ombudsman for Children in her Report of the Special Inquiry (the &ldquo;Logan Report&rdquo; published on 1 July 2014).</p><p>The research provides a complex picture of the Roma in Ireland confirming that they are a diverse group of people. According to this research, the Roma community in Ireland comprises between 4,000 and 6,000 people. The majority of Roma adults here are from Romania &ndash; about 80%. Most of the balance of Roma adults are from the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Over 60% of Roma children living here were  born in Ireland. </p><p>Roma have access to mainstream public services in Ireland on the same basis as all other EU citizens. Their children can access education services for instance on the same basis as children of other EU citizens. </p><p>However, this research points to barriers that may prevent some Roma from accessing the services to which they are entitled. </p><p>There is a need for more targeted awareness raising so that Roma are aware of the documentation needed to access specific services.</p><p>Funding will be provided by the Department of Justice and Equality this year for a number of Roma-focussed initiatives which are in the process of being evaluated.</p><p>I, as Minister of State at the Department of Justice, with responsibility for Equality, Immigration and Integration, launched the National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy 2017 - 2021 in June 2017. The strategy provides a whole of Government Framework for addressing the needs of Traveller and Roma communities. It includes 149 actions across a range of themes. The steering group charged with implementing it is being chaired by me. </p><p>The recommendations of the research contained in Roma in Ireland - A National Needs Assessment will be examined carefully by the NTRIS Steering Group. The Steering Group includes representatives from Pavee Point and the relevant Government Departments.</p><p>The NTRIS for instance includes a number of education-focused actions aimed at improving access, participation and outcomes for members of the Roma community. The aim is to achieve outcomes for Roma that are equal to those of the majority population. Actions include a commitment by the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and TUSLA to develop early intervention education welfare supports to promote and support Roma attendance, participation and engagement with the education system. Similarly, the Government is promoting the Early Childcare Education pre-school scheme to facilitate access for Roma children to free pre-school from the age of three until they start school. </p><p>My Department has begun work on an action to fund Traveller and Roma representative groups to implement community based supports to assist the retention of Roma children in the education system.</p><p>The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection is developing targeted initiatives to increase Roma engagement with employment and training services. </p><p>The Department of Health and the HSE will support the implementation of the findings of this Roma Needs Assessment. Also, acknowledging the results of the National Roma Needs Assessment for Roma in Ireland, the HSE will support Roma women to access maternal health services in a timely manner.</p><p>The National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy 2017 - 2021 may be accessed on my Department's website or by clicking on this link: </p></reply>

This includes in counties Sligo, Leitrim, Donegal and Roscommon, where there is currently a total of 50 IDA Ireland client companies collectively employing 7,590 people. While the IDA is determined to grow these numbers further in 2018, the current jobs total represents an increase of 19% in employment by multinationals across these four counties since 2011.</p><p>IDA Ireland markets Donegal, Sligo and Leitrim, as part of its North-West region. The Agency's business development strategy for the region includes efforts aimed at increasing investment from high value manufacturing (pharmaceutical, medical devices and engineering) along with the international financial services sector. Roscommon, meanwhile, is marketed as part of the West Region which also includes Galway and Mayo. The IDA emphasises that particular region's strengths in global business services and high tech manufacturing in its efforts to secure further investment from prospective investors. IDA Ireland also, of course, works closely with its existing clients in both the North-West and West to encourage further employment growth and capital investment.</p><p>As regards site visits, the IDA always does its best to highlight suitable sites in regional areas - including in counties Sligo, Leitrim, Donegal and Roscommon - to potential investors. It is sometimes the case, however, that IDA clients will have specific requirements that may preclude certain locations. Site visits are also not necessarily indicative of the potential for foreign direct investment in an area, as at least 70% of all new investment comes from existing IDA clients that are already present in Ireland.</p><p>Details on the number of site visits to Sligo, Leitrim, Donegal and Roscommon over the past five years are outlined in the table below.<table><tr><th>County</th><th>2013</th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th><th>2016 </th><th>Q1-Q3 2017</th></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>7</td><td>6</td><td>5</td><td>7</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>8</td><td>8</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td>10</td><td>7</td><td>15</td><td>20</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon</td><td>4</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>2</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Older and less healthy people pay the same price as younger and healthier people. In a risk-rated private health insurance market, older and sicker people seeking health insurance would pay much more than others.</p>  <p>  Our system of community rating is supported by a risk equalisation scheme.  Under our scheme, credits are paid to all insurers for their older and sicker members - these credits are funded directly by a levy on all health insurance contracts written. The scheme redistributes funds between insurers to meet some of the additional cost of insuring older and sicker members. By sharing the cost of insurance this way, we can ensure that older people are treated fairly.</p>  <p>  From 1 April 2018, the levy on advanced policies (which represents 90% of the market) will be &euro;444 for an adult, unchanged from last year.  The levy on non-advanced policies, those offering less comprehensive coverage for customers, will be &euro;177 for an adult, which is a reduction of &euro;45 from last year.  The current average premium paid is &euro;1,188 (as of 30 June 2017).</p>  <p>  The price of each premium is a commercial decision by health insurers, who decide how much they wish to charge for the level of coverage in each health insurance contract, taking account of a range of factors in addition to the amount of levy payable. Without the levy, the cost of health insurance for older and sicker members of the insured population would be in excess of current premium prices.</p></reply>

Between July and December the overall cataract waiting list was reduced by 2,000 and the number waiting over 15 months was reduced from almost 1,600 to just over 300.  NTPF figures for the end of December showed more than half of cataract patients are waiting less than 6 months and 72% are waiting less than 9 months.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-01-23a.765.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1261" speakername="Jim Daly" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018012300077#WRO03400"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 343 and 344 together.</p><p>The Nursing Homes Support Scheme (NHSS), commonly referred to as <i>A Fair Deal, </i>is a system of financial support for people who require long-term residential care. Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost.</p><p>The NHSS covers the cost of the standard components of long-term residential care which are:</p><p>- Nursing and personal care appropriate to the level of care needs of the person; </p><p>- Bed and board;</p><p>- Basic aids and appliances necessary to assist a person with the activities of daily living; and</p><p>- Laundry service.</p><p>A person's eligibility for other schemes, such as the medical card scheme or the drugs payment scheme, is unaffected by participation in the NHSS or residence in a nursing home.  In determining  the services covered by the NHSS it was considered very important that the care recipient and the taxpayer would be protected and would not end up paying for the same services twice. For this reason, medications and aids that are already prescribed for individuals under an existing scheme are not included in the services covered by the NHSS, as this would involve effectively paying twice for the same service.</p><p>Although the NHSS covers core living expenses, residents can still incur some costs in a nursing home, such as social programmes, newspapers or hairdressing. In recognition of this, anyone in receipt of financial support under the NHSS retains at least 20% of their income. The minimum amount that is retained is the equivalent of 20% of the State Pension (Non-Contributory). An operator should not seek payment from residents for items which are covered by the NHSS, the medical card or any other existing scheme.</p><p>Part 7 of the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2013 stipulates that the registered provider of the nursing home must agree a contract in writing with each resident on their admission to the nursing home. This contract must include details of the services to be provided to that resident and the fees to be charged. Residents should never be charged fees which are not set out in the contract. The Department of Health and the HSE are not a party to such contracts which are concluded between each resident and the private or voluntary nursing home.</p><p>Registered providers of nursing home care are obliged to provide an accessible and effective complaints procedure.  Concerns about additional charges should in the first instance be taken up with the nursing home provider.  The Office of the Ombudsman can examine complaints about the actions of a range of public bodies and, from 24 August 2015, complaints relating to the administrative actions of private nursing homes. The Office of the Ombudsman normally only deals with a complaint once the individual has already gone through the complaints procedure of the private nursing home concerned.  </p><p>I have met with both Nursing Homes Ireland and Age Action to discuss this issue in detail.  In order to improve the transparency of these additional charges, I outlined that a schedule of charges should be provided to potential residents on enquiry to an individual nursing home, rather than at the point of admission.  Nursing Homes Ireland undertook to advise their members to do so.  I have also recently met with  the National Treatment Purchase Fund, the Office of the Ombudsman and HIQA  to discuss this matter further.</p><p>I have asked the Interdepartmental/Agency Working Group established to oversee the implementation of certain recommendations contained in the 2015 Review of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme to also consider this matter and examine the options that might be available, as part of its ongoing work. As part of this work, Officials  from the Department of Health and the HSE are to preform  an examination of the issue of additional charges in nursing homes. They will report their findings and recommendations to the Interdepartmental/Agency Working Group for consideration.</p><p>In the past week I have met with the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC)  who are undertaking a project to develop guidelines for the contracts between nursing homes and their residents. I fully support the CCPC in this work and I have already asked my Department to engage with the CCPC as required to assist with its work. In that regard, officials have already met with the CCPC project team to assist with its enquiries.</p><p>In relation to the Deputy's reference to prescription charges, I can confirm that from the 1st January 2018 the prescription charge for all medical card holders is &euro;2, with a monthly cap of &euro;20. The Programme for a Partnership Government contains a commitment to reduce the cost of medicines for Irish citizens and further reductions in the prescription charge may be considered in the future, having regard to the funding available.</p></reply>

However, the only statutory scheme in place at present to support older people is the Nursing Home Support Scheme. The Government intends to address this by establishing a new stand-alone statutory scheme for the financing and regulation of home care services.  The Department of Health is currently engaged in a detailed process to progress this. </p>  <p>  The statutory scheme for home care will introduce clear rules in relation to the services for which individuals are eligible and in relation to how decisions are made on allocating services. It will therefore be an important step in ensuring that the system operates in a consistent and fair manner for all those who need home care services. It will also help to improve access to the home care services that people need, in an affordable and sustainable way. The system of regulation for home care will help to ensure that the public can be confident that the services provided are of a high standard.</p>  <p>  As an initial step in this process, the Department commissioned the Health Research Board to undertake a review of the home care systems in four other European countries. This review, which was published in April 2017, will help us to learn from the experiences of other jurisdictions and will inform the debate and future consideration of approaches to formal home care financing and regulation here in Ireland.  I, along with Minister Daly, also launched a public consultation process in July 2017 which closed in October 2017.  The purpose of this consultation was to allow all those with views on this topic to have their say, including older people themselves, their families, and healthcare workers.  There was a very high response rate to the consultation process with approximately 2,600 submissions received.  It is intended to publish a report of the findings of the consultation process in the coming months.  Further consultation with stakeholders, including service users, will take place later this year.</p>  <p>  The development of a new home care scheme is a complex undertaking which will involve significant legislative, operational and financial resources. A considerable amount of detailed work remains to be undertaken before final decisions are taken on the form of a home care scheme and the regulation of these services. This is necessary if reforms are to be successful, affordable and sustainable.</p></reply>

The HPRA has stated that Hormonal Pregnancy Tests (HPTs) such as Primodos were never authorised (i.e. licensed) for use in Ireland. </p>  <p>  The 1975 annual report of the National Drugs Advisory Board (NDAB, a predecessor of the HPRA) outlined the consideration given by the NDAB to the use of hormonal testing for pregnancy. This report related to hormonal pregnancy testing preparations in general, and did not mention any specific product. In April 1975, the NDAB issued a warning letter to practitioners regarding the use of hormonal pregnancy testing preparations. This letter reminded practitioners that these preparations had not been assessed by the NDAB, and that their use as a means of pregnancy testing had not been accepted by the NDAB. The letter also highlighted that these preparations should be avoided, as a firm statement of safety could not be given and other, more efficient methods of pregnancy testing were available. </p>  <p>  Between 1976 and 1980, the NDAB received five reports of suspected adverse reactions associated with the use of HPTs. There is very limited information available in relation to these reports.</p>  <p>  In the UK, where HPTs were licensed (and where they were used from the early 1950s to 1978), an Expert Working Group of the UK&rsquo;s Commission on Human Medicines recently completed a review of this issue and published a report on the use of hormone pregnancy tests (HPTs) and adverse effects relating to pregnancy, including possible birth defects. This report concluded that following an extensive and rigorous review, based on the totality of the available data, the scientific evidence does not support a causal association between the use of HPTs such as Primodos and birth defects or miscarriage.</p></reply>

The Protected Disclosures Act 2014 sets out that a worker making a protected disclosure will receive appropriate protections and cannot be penalised as a result of having reported relevant wrongdoings under the Act.</p><p>Section 5 of the 2014 Act provides protection for workers who disclose information in relation to the following wrongdoings:</p><p>a) The commission of an offence;</p><p>b) The failure of a person to comply with any legal obligation, other than one arising under the worker's contract of employment or other contract whereby the worker undertakes to do or perform personally any work or services;</p><p>c) A miscarriage of justice;</p><p>d) A danger to the health and safety of any individual;</p><p>e) Damage to the environment;</p><p>f) An unlawful or otherwise improper use of funds or resources of a public body, or of other public money;</p><p>g) An act or omission by or on behalf of a public body that is oppressive, discriminatory or grossly negligent or constitutes gross mismanagement; or</p><p>h) Information tending to show any matter falling within any of the preceding paragraphs (a) to (g) has been, is being, or is likely to be concealed or destroyed.</p><p>A worker must make a disclosure in the manner set out in the Act to be entitled to the protections of the Act. Different standards apply depending on the person or body to whom the worker makes the disclosure. </p><p>There is an onus on employers in public bodies under my aegis to assess any disclosure made, to conduct an investigation where warranted and to address all findings of that investigation that require attention.  In doing so they must keep the identity of the individual confidential insofar as is possible and of course the person must not be penalised by their employer for reporting relevant wrongdoings.  All public bodies, including the HSE have developed policies and procedures for dealing with protected disclosures.</p><p>If employers fail to protect the worker or if worker is penalised  for making a protected disclosure, Part 3 of the Act sets out the protections and potential redress available.  The Department of Public Expenditure's guidance notes that Procedures should include a commitment that penalisation of workers who make a disclosure will not be tolerated and workers who feel that they are being subjected to adverse treatment should report the matter immediately to management.  The Procedures should further contain a commitment to assess / investigate such notifications and to take appropriate action (which may include disciplinary action against supervisors and co-workers) where necessary.  The HSE includes this advice to its workers on its website.  If a complaint is made by a person to the HSE of penalisation contrary to the 2014 Act, then that complaint will be dealt with, having regard to the continued obligation to protect the identity of the discloser under the Act.</p><p>In addition, if an employee feels that the employer has penalised him/her for making a protected disclosure, the employee may refer the matter to an Adjudicator of the Workplace Relations Commission.  Generally speaking such action by the employer would encompass any action which could be interpreted as penalisation by the employer against the employee for having made a protected disclosure.</p><p>The Workplace Relations Commission has published a Code of Practice on Protected Disclosures Act 2014.  The Code notes that p  enalisation is defined in the Act and includes, for example, suspension/layoff/dismissal,  demotion, transfer of duties, imposition of reprimand discipline or other penalty, unfair treatment, discrimination and harassment threat or reprisal.  An Adjudicator will hear the case and issue a decision. A decision could declare that the complaint was not well founded, or if declared well founded, it could require the employer to take a specified course of action, including payment of compensation.  The decision of an Adjudicator may be appealed to the Labour Court.</p><p>This Code is accessible at the following website: <i>.</i></p></reply>

While this is under development, both the Department and Health Service Executive (HSE) are continuing efforts to incrementally improve the existing home care services.  As detailed in its <i>National Service Plan,</i>the HSE has begun work on streamlining home care services by moving towards a single funded home support service.  This brings together the funding for home help and standard home care packages which will operate as a single home support service from 2018 onwards.  The additional resources made available in 2018 bring the total budget for the direct provision of home support services to &euro;408m.  This new approach will provide significant benefits for the service users, the public and the health system including: </p><p>- making the services easier to understand;</p><p>- streamlining the application processes resulting in only one application and decision being required for home support services for older people; and </p><p>- facilitating service users to move to changed levels of services as their assessed needs change, without the need for an additional application process.</p><p>The HSE&rsquo;s National Service Plan provides for a target of some 17.094m home support hours to be provided to 50,500 people, which compares with 16.34m hours delivered to 50,000 people (home help and home hours combined), an increase of 754,000 hours to 500 more people.  In addition 235 intensive home care packages will provide 360,000 home support hours for people with complex needs.  </p><p>Despite this significant level of service provision, the demand for Home Care continues to grow.  It is important to note that the allocation of funding for home care across the system, though significant, is finite and services must therefore be delivered within the funding available.  Home care is monitored on an on-going basis, to ensure that activity is maximised relative to individual clients&rsquo; assessed care needs and within the overall available resources for home care and having regard to demand throughout the year.</p></reply>

BCG vaccine stock in all areas expired at the end of April 2015 and as of today this continues to be problem for Ireland and other countries in Europe that use the this licensed BCG vaccine. Since this problem became apparent, the HSE National Immunisation Office (NIO) has been in regular contact with the manufacturer of BCG vaccine to ascertain when the vaccine might be available. There is only one licensed supplier of BCG vaccine to Ireland and this vaccine manufacturer has informed the NIO that the BCG vaccine will not be delivered into Ireland until late 2018 at the earliest. The NIO and the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) have sought an alternative supply of BCG vaccine that meets safety, quality and effectiveness standards and that could be used in Ireland. To date no appropriate alternative manufacturer has been found.  When there is confirmation of the date of new supply, the HSE will be guided by the recommendations of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee on its administration.</p></reply>

Slurry may only be applied by means of a downward trajectory splash-plate or by low emission slurry spreading (LESS) equipment.</p>  <p>  Implementation of the Nitrates Directive falls under the remit of the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government.  Under the Directive, closed periods are required for the application of chemical and also organic fertiliser such as slurry.  Under Ireland&rsquo;s NAP the closed period for the spreading of slurry commences on 15 October and ends between 12&ndash;31 January, depending on location.</p>  <p>  Research, including that from the Agricultural Catchments Programme (ACP), has found that there are disproportionate high nutrient losses to waters during winter months when grass and crop growth has ceased and high rainfall is a probability.  The current closed period coincides with the time when the risks of losses to water are the highest.  The closed period was agreed after extensive public consultation including discussions with farming bodies.</p>  <p>  There is no flexibility as regards the dates of the closed period.</p></reply>

Finally the draft amending legislation would resolve some typographical errors in the Principal Act of 2006 and introduce other miscellaneous and technical amendments. The contents of the draft amending legislation, which has not yet been approved or finalised, will provide for appropriate procedures to ensure fairness in any relevant provisions.</p>  <p>  The Heads of this are currently being finalised. Thereafter, it will be necessary to submit a Memorandum to Government seeking approval for the drafting of a Bill along the lines of the General Scheme, and forwarding the General Scheme for consideration to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine in the context of Pre-legislative Scrutiny prior to its submission to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel for drafting.</p>  <p>  A Regulatory Impact analysis (RIA) was prepared to analyse the key areas of inter alia the Points System for Masters, the legislative underpinning of the policy of quota as a national asset and marine environmental regulations. This was published on the Department&rsquo;s website in September 2014 and used as a discussion document throughout autumn and winter 2014 during consultations with fishermen, fish processors, producer organisations and other stakeholders.</p></reply>

It recognised that some of these had already been identified by my own Department as part of its ongoing management of the sector.  In fact, the audit team pointed that there were aspects of our management system here in Ireland which could usefully serve as examples for control regimes elsewhere. I am satisfied that the integrity of the organic label in Ireland is fully intact.</p>  <p>  As regards the release of information relating to fish mortalities at farms operated by the company named, the initial decision was indeed to refuse the request, in accordance with the applicable legislation which in this case was the Access to Information on the Environment Regulations 2007-2014.

The design of the new scheme has included an extensive independent economic appraisal. This appraisal compared the cost of supporting a range of commercial renewable technologies, including Solar Photovoltaics (Solar PV) at various scales including Utility (farm scale), to ensure that the new scheme delivers value for money for energy users whilst also delivering on the energy pillars of sustainability and security of supply. The assessment included analysis of the optimum financial support mechanisms for renewable technologies, in line with the 2014 EU State Aid Guidelines.</p>  <p>  In designing the new RESS, the cost implications for people and businesses have been a high priority and I will ensure that the new scheme is designed in a cost efficient manner.</p>  <p>  A public consultation on the emerging principles of the proposed RESS closed on 10 November. Over 1,250 submissions were received, which are being reviewed and will inform the final design of the RESS. Following on from this, a final proposal will be brought to Government for approval in early 2018, including the overall costs and technologies to be supported. Subsequent to a Government decision, a formal application for State Aid clearance from the European Commission will commence. </p>  <p>  To date there have been over 80 applications for a grid connection from solar farms in Co. Wexford.</p>  <p>  At this point no final decisions have been made as regards which technologies will be supported under the new RESS. I note with interest the falling costs of some renewable technologies over the past year, most notably Solar PV and offshore wind. Increasing renewable technology diversity is one of several policy objectives the new RESS is trying to deliver and falling technology costs may lead to increased diversity of the renewable portfolio over the medium term.</p></reply>

Government is fully supportive of An Post in its endeavours. Reflecting its commitment to sustaining a nationwide post office network and daily mails service, the Government has made &euro;30m available in State funding to An Post to support the renewal of the post office network and the continued fulfilment of a 5 day per week mails delivery service. The &euro;30m funding is subject to stringent conditions and Key Performance Indicators, the delivery of which will be monitored on by the parent Departments and NewERA. The loan from the Minister for Finance is for 5 years with the possibility of two one year extensions. The detailed conditions contained in the loan agreement were agreed between the Minister for Finance and An Post and as they are commercially sensitive are subject to confidentiality.</p>  <p>  The strategic plan harnesses the company's existing strengths such as its nationwide reach, trusted brand and the relationship of postmasters with communities, both rural and urban. At the same time, An Post has recognised that it must embrace the digital agenda. and this is reflected in the plan, especially in the emphasis on growing the parcels business. Enhanced banking services are becoming available through the post office network with the smart bank account. It is expected that further such opportunities will be available across the network, especially as high-speed broadband becomes widely available through the roll-out of the national broadband plan. The Government has also committed to exploring the potential for extra Government business, including motor tax, to be channelled through the network and my Department is engaging with other relevant Government Departments in this regard. </p>  <p>  Discussions on the future of the post office network are a matter for An Post and the Irish Postmasters Union. I understand discussions are ongoing between both parties and I continue to encourage the parties to work closely to find an agreed solution to the renewal of the network.</p></reply>

There have been no commercial discoveries of oil to date.  </p><p>Once the commerciality of an oil or gas discovery has been established the authorisation holder must apply for a Petroleum Lease. The application must include the outline development and financial plans for the exploitation of the discovery based on the applicant's considered likely production profile.</p><p>Within one year of the date of issue of a Petroleum Lease the lessee is required to submit for approval by the Minister a detailed plan of development including a detailed production profile for the life of the field. The application must also include all such technical, economic and financial information, as will enable the Minister to evaluate the proposals fully and to assess their economic, social and environmental implications. During the period of the Petroleum Lease, no material deviation from the approved plan of development may take place without the Minister's prior approval.</p><p>Profits from the Kinsale, Ballycotton, Seven Heads and Corrib gas fields are subject to Corporation Tax at a rate of 25%. The operation of the taxation system and the receipt of taxation are matters for the Revenue Commissioners. As a consequence, I am not in a position to provide the Deputy with a figure for the Corporation Tax yield to the State in respect of the operation of the offshore gas fields.</p><p>Royalties from the Kinsale and Ballycotton gas fields are payable to the Exchequer at a rate of 12.5% of the fair market value of the gas at the well head. Royalties paid in respect of the Kinsale and Ballycotton gas fields over each of the last 20 years are as follows:<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>&euro;m</th></tr><tr><td>1998</td><td>6.7</td></tr><tr><td>1999</td><td>4.5</td></tr><tr><td>2000</td><td>8.8</td></tr><tr><td>2001</td><td>8.2</td></tr><tr><td>2002</td><td>7.3</td></tr><tr><td>2003</td><td>5.1</td></tr><tr><td>2004</td><td>4.9</td></tr><tr><td>2005</td><td>5.1</td></tr><tr><td>2006</td><td>12.2</td></tr><tr><td>2007</td><td>6.2</td></tr><tr><td>2008</td><td>8.2</td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>2.1</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>2.6</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>3.9</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>4.0</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>4.6</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>2.0</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>1.6</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>0.3</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>0.7</td></tr></table></p><p>Royalties for the period 1998-2001 have been converted from Irish Punt to Euro.</p><p>Royalties are not payable in respect of production from the Seven Heads and Corrib gas fields as Ireland abolished royalties, similarly to the UK and Norway who abolished royalties for new fields in 1982 and 1986 respectively, and moved to a purely tax based system in 1987.</p><p>The rate of Corporation Tax that will apply to profits arising from any future commercial discoveries made under an authorisation granted prior to January 2007 will be 25%.</p><p>The rate of tax (Corporation Tax and Profit Resource Rent Tax) that will apply to profits arising from any future commercial discoveries made under an authorisation granted from January 2007 to May 2014 will be between 25% and 40% depending on the profitability of the field.</p><p>The rate of tax (Corporation Tax and Petroleum Production Tax) that will apply to profits arising from any future commercial discoveries made under an authorisation granted from June 2014 onwards will be between 25% and 55% depending on the profitability of the field. In addition there is a requirement for a minimum Petroleum Production Tax payment at a rate of 5% of gross revenues in every year that a field is selling production.</p></reply>

This Regulation implements in EU law the provisions of the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal as well as the OECD Decision Concerning the Control of Transboundary Movements of Waste Destined for Recovery Operations.  The Regulation includes a ban on the export of hazardous wastes to non-OECD countries as well as a ban on the export of waste for disposal to such countries. The fundamental purpose of this system is to ensure that not only is waste moved to another country with that country&rsquo;s advance knowledge, but that wastes from the EU are not dumped in less developed countries.Under the Waste Management (Shipments of Waste) Regulations 2007, Dublin City Council was designated as the National Competent Authority for all waste exports and imports and the National Transfrontier Waste Shipment Office (NTFSO) was established under the auspices of Dublin City Council. The primary aim of the Regulations is to prevent the illegal shipment of waste abroad, and to assist businesses engaged in legitimate waste export activities.</p><p>Any proposals for the shipment of waste must first of all be brought to the attention of the National TFS Office by means of the submission of an application, known as a notification, consisting of a notification document and a movement document.</p><p>The Notification Document provides the Competent Authorities of countries concerned in the proposed waste shipment with information such as the waste type, waste generator, intended quantity of shipments, disposal/recovery process, expiry date etc.  The Movement Document, must accompany the waste shipment at all times through the countries of transit on route to the disposal/recovery facility in the country of destination and only facilities authorised by the competent authority in destination countries are permitted to accept imported waste. This document provides information on the notifier, importer, carriers of the consignment, means of transport etc.  The main objective of this document is to track and trace the movement of the waste shipment from cradle to grave, including the certification regarding the acceptance and the completed recovery/disposal operation at the authorised waste recovery/disposal facility. </p><p>A Certification of Completion is completed by the disposer or recoverer to certify the completion of the disposal or recovery of the waste. Signed copies of the movement document with this certification need to be sent to the notifier and competent authorities of dispatch, transit and destination as soon as possible, but no later than 30 days after the completion of the recovery or disposal and no later than one calendar year following the receipt of the waste. </p><p>The NTFSO compiles an annual register for movement of both Amber and Green list waste; the latest registers compiled by the NTFSO deal with 2016 and can be accessed on its website at <i></i>.</p></reply>

This is further reflected within the National Strategic Outcomes contained with the draft National Planning Framework, including &lsquo;Transition to a Low Carbon and Climate Resilient Society,&rsquo; which I expect to be fully reflected in the final National Planning Framework which is due to be published shortly. </p>  <p>  I understand that under the National Planning Framework, each Regional Assembly will be tasked with preparing a Regional Spatial and Economic Strategy (RSES).  The principal purpose of each RSES is to support the implementation of the National Planning Framework by providing a long-term strategic planning and economic framework for the development of the regions. Each RSES will be required to be consistent with the National Policy Objectives of the National Planning Framework and assist in the delivery of its National Strategic Outcomes. </p>  <p>  In addition, I understand that the preparation of each of the RSES will be subject to Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) which requires each plan to take full account of relevant EU and national legislative requirements, including in relation to climate change, in accordance with the SEA legislation.  </p>  <p>  The National Adaptation Framework, which I launched on 19 January, sets out the context to ensure local authorities, regions and key sectors can assess the key risks and vulnerabilities of climate change, implement climate resilience actions and ensure climate adaptation considerations are mainstreamed into all local, regional and national policy making.  The role of spatial planning through the National Planning Framework will be critical in ensuring a successful outcome for implementing the National Adaptation Framework. </p>  <p>  Alongside the National Adaptation Framework, I also announced a funding commitment from my Department of &euro;10 million over 5 years to establish four Local Authority Regional Climate Action Offices.  This commitment recognises the significant obligation which has been placed on the local government sector to develop and implement its own adaptation and mitigation measures as well as the need to build capacity within the sector to engage effectively with climate change. </p>  <p>  The proposed Regional Climate Action Offices will be operated by a lead local authority in four different regions grouped according to shared climate change risks.  The Offices are intended to provide a coherent and coordinated response to climate change at local level, both in terms of adaptation and mitigation and they will also be a key enabler in linking effectively with the new National Planning Framework.   </p></reply>

The Deputy will be aware I recently announced that I am considering introducing a levy on disposable coffee cups in an attempt to effect environmental behavioural change and incentivise individuals to use their own cups on the go.  While the policy in this regard is at a very early stage in the process, a levy such as this has proved very successful in the past in curbing the use of plastic bags.</p>  <p>  I am conscious that in today&rsquo;s &ldquo;on the go&rdquo; culture, there is a demand for disposable cups.  In this regard, my Department has been meeting with packaging manufacturers who produce coffee cups to explore options to move away from the traditional non-recyclable coffee cups to compostable and recyclable alternatives.  This is in line with the  strategy  from the EU on plastics released on 16 January 2018 which has set a target date of 2030 by which all packaging placed on the EU market can be reused or recycled in a cost effective manner.    </p>  <p>  In addition the EU Plastics Strategy encourages industry to come up with voluntary pledges to boost the uptake of recycled plastics.   My Department will ensure that the industry is aware of the opportunity to take this voluntary action and at the same time will encourage the vendors to take other voluntary actions immediately such as rewarding customers who bring their own cup.  </p>  <p>  Finally, my officials and I have been in consultation with the compost industry to ensure that any significant change in the type of coffee cup placed on the market in Ireland can be treated appropriately.  </p></reply>

The design of the new scheme has included an extensive independent economic appraisal. This appraisal compared the cost of supporting a range of commercial renewable technologies, at various scales including micro-generation, to ensure that the new scheme delivers value for money for energy users whilst also delivering on the energy pillars of sustainability and security of supply.  The assessment included analysis of the optimum financial support mechanisms for renewable technologies, in line with the 2014 EU State Aid Guidelines.</p>  <p>  The 2014 EU State Aid Guidelines set the framework and extent of financial support options for national renewable electricity (RES-E) support schemes. In general and except for small scale and demonstration projects, RES-E support levels must be set through competitive bidding processes (renewable electricity auctions) and all new RES-E schemes should provide support in the form of a premium in addition to the market price. </p>  <p>  Micro generation, which typically involves an element of self-consumption and the selling of excess electricity to the grid, was also appraised as part of the RESS economic assessment.  The appraisal clearly indicated that the costs associated with supporting micro generation of renewable electricity are greater, relative to larger and medium scale renewable electricity projects. In addition, the analysis identified a number of challenges that may need to be addressed before a support scheme for micro generation can be developed.  These include a reform of network charges, an assessment of the distributional impact of such a policy decision on the PSO (cost burden sharing), and development of a fair tariff for exported electricity taking the benefits of self-consumption into account.  This approach is in line with experience from other EU member states who have attempted to introduce supports for micro generation.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding these challenges, I am committed to further exploring opportunities for supporting micro generation, as I believe that micro-generation could have an important role in Ireland&rsquo;s transition to a low carbon economy, in assisting Ireland meet its renewable electricity targets, and in increasing social acceptance of renewable energy projects right across the country. In October 2017 my Department and SEAI hosted a workshop on micro generation which discussed a number of these challenges with relevant stakeholders. A number of potential options to incentivise a greater uptake of micro generation in Ireland were identified and my Department will work with all relevant stakeholders over the coming months to further develop these options.</p>  <p>  A public consultation on the emerging principles of the proposed RESS closed on 10 November. Over 1,250 submissions were received, which are being reviewed and will inform the final design of the RESS.  Following on from this, a final proposal will be brought to Government for approval early this year, including the overall costs and technologies to be supported. Subsequent to a Government decision, a formal application for State Aid clearance from the European Commission will commence. </p></reply>

Over &euro;900,000 was recently awarded to projects for the improvement of habitat. A further &euro;300,000 was awarded for brown trout specific angling access projects.</p><p>There are a significant number of staff employed primarily on the seven fisheries, Loughs Corrib, Mask, Carra, Conn, Cullen, Arrow and Sheelin, which are designated, in national policy, to be managed primarily as wild brown trout waters. Stock management is prioritised in line with the special designation of these lakes.  I have directed my officials to consider how this designation can be given statutory status as a matter of priority.</p><p>Warranted protection officers are based throughout the country and deploy planned and reactive patrols to ensure the protection of fish stocks and habitat.  Inland Fisheries Ireland operates a confidential 24 hour hotline to which anglers and members of the public can report incidents of poaching and pollution and other activity.  The number is 1890 34 74 24. </p><p>IFI is also aware of one particular catchment where recent introductions of another species have led to potential threats to established wild trout stocks. In this regard, while management of predator species has been undertaken in recent years and continues, IFI has recently prepared a specific management plan for this catchment to augment protection of, and underpin the process of restoring, wild trout in the catchment.  I will shortly announce the implementation of this specific plan and follow up with plans to manage stocks during this year in other trout waters in the near future.</p><p>During 2017 IFI ran the #cprsavesfish campaign which encourages anglers to voluntarily catch, photo and release fish caught.  Information on this campaign is available at .</p><p>An IFI sponsorship scheme is available to support angling and trout clubs and federations have availed of it to support competitions and novice angler programmes. To encourage conservation, the sponsorship programme does not support events where the results/scoring system necessitates the killing of fish.  </p><p>I am assured by IFI that the Board is committed to developing a comprehensive strategy to meet current and future trout production needs, subject to securing any investment required for their fish farm operations. All stakeholders have agreed to continue to work closely together to deliver this strategy.</p><p>I am also developing further protection plans to be published in the near future to further protect wild brown trout fisheries.</p></reply>

Permits for shorter periods are also available.  On average, permit fees account for an annual income of &euro;120,000 and the cost to IFI to protect, develop, manage and conserve these fisheries is considerably in excess of this.  </p><p>The revenue and redistribution of funds under the Midland Fisheries Fund in the years 2014-2017 is set out below. </p><p><b>Permit Revenue and Redistributed Fund to Angling Clubs/Groups</b><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Permit Revenue</th><th>Grant Scheme</th></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>&euro;130,597</td><td>Not yet available</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>&euro;134,462</td><td>&euro;50,000</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>&euro;111,975</td><td>&euro;40,000</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>&euro;110,595</td><td>&euro;50,000</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The aim of the scheme, a joint policy initiative between my Department and the Department of Health, which began in 2016, is to demonstrate the positive effects that making homes warmer and more energy efficient can have on the health and wellbeing of people in energy poverty who are living with a chronic respiratory condition.  An independent research project is underway alongside the scheme's delivery and will assess the impact the scheme is having.  As a pilot scheme, it is currently available in Dublin as it is critical to build the capacity of the HSE public health team and allow for the level of support required by participants in this

As such and in recognition of the impact of illegal dumping on communities across the country, an anti-dumping initiative was launched by me in 2017.  The aim of this initiative is to provide funding for projects tackling illegal dumping, including the provision of support for the clean-up, monitoring and surveillance of dumping black-spots.  I allocated funding of almost &euro;1.3 million from the Environment Fund for this purpose.</p><p>These funds have been used to support 229 clean-up and restorative projects led by community, environmental and sporting groups across the country.  Funds have also been made available to equip local authority enforcement officers with the latest technologies available to support enforcement of our waste laws.

The purpose of these review meetings is for eir to report progress against each sub-milestone task and also to identify any risks or issues and their associated risk mitigation plans.  These sub-milestones cover the tasks that are required to deliver high speed broadband to premises within the Planned Rural Deployment area.  A detailed definition of each sub-milestone is provided in the Commitment Agreement.  As of Q3 2017 eir had met all milestones laid out under the Commitment Agreement, having passed over 101,000 premises.  Information submitted for Q4 have not yet been verified by the Department.  </p>  <p>  There is provision within the Commitment Agreement for the re-designation of the LIGHT BLUE areas as State intervention areas.  The Commitment Agreement provides me with the right to change the Intervention area and incorporate premises from the LIGHT BLUE area into the AMBER area where eir fail to fulfil their obligations under the Agreement.</p>  <p>  While there is no commitment agreement in place with commercial operators for the BLUE areas of the High Speed Broadband Map, my Department continues to monitor deployment progress and any issues that arise.  Where commercial plans to provide access to high speed broadband to premises within a BLUE area do not materialise, it is my intention that the implementation of the NBP will overcome these issues and that all premises will be able to access high-speed broadband services.</p></reply>

Any replacement of the requirement for the display of discs on vehicle windscreens would need to be considered in the context of the level of application of Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) by An Garda Sioch&aacute;na, in order to ensure that adequate enforcement levels are maintained.</p>  <p>  As you may be aware, the abolition of the motor tax disc took effect in the U.K. from 1 October 2014.  In that jurisdiction, a vehicle excise duty evasion survey is carried out on a bi-annual basis.  The results of the survey carried out in 2015, the first following the abolition of the disc, found that the rate of unlicensed vehicles observed on the road was much higher than had been observed in the previous survey in 2013, prior to the abolition of the disc.  The survey concluded that the increase was probably due to the changes in the vehicle licensing system which took effect from October 2014, which included the abolition of the disc.  The 2017 survey, published on 16 November 2017, found that the rate of unlicensed vehicles observed on the road had increased since the 2015 survey. </p>  <p>   The Cost of Insurance Working Group, chaired by the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Mr. Eoghan Murphy, T.D., in his former role as Minister of State at the Department of Finance, published a Report on the cost of motor insurance in January 2017.  The Group considered the issue of the abolition of the paper-based insurance disc as part of its deliberations.  The decision of the Working Group was that it was not recommending the phasing out of the paper-based insurance disc.  In arriving at its conclusion, the Group noted the experience in the U.K. following the removal of the paper motor tax disc and, in terms of enforcement, set out that Ireland is not yet in a position to underpin an enforcement regime where technology would be the primary method of enforcement.  In relation to the use of ANPR, the Group recommended that the phasing out of the paper insurance disc should be reviewed in the future as the development of technology progresses.  The continued use of the paper motor tax disc will also be kept under review in that context. </p>  <p>   The replacement of motor tax with increased fuel charges is also not being considered at the current time.  In order to maintain the tax base currently realised from motor tax, an increase in fuel duty in the order of some 30c per litre would be required, with direct negative impacts on the rate of inflation and economic competitiveness.  As indicated in the Question, goods vehicles and other high usage and high mileage vehicles, such as public service vehicles and buses, would have higher costs under a pay-as-you-drive system.  There would be other distributional effects, including on those with longer distances to commute.</p>  <p>  A significant increase in fuel duty would lead to an increase in cross-Border fuel purchasing, further depressing the tax base and requiring a compensatory adjustment to make up the shortfall.  The potential for an increase in fuel laundering is also clear in this regard.  Any benefits to replacing motor tax with fuel duty would have to be weighed against these issues, and others, before any such change could be contemplated.</p>  <p>  In relation to the environmental issues raised in the Question, motor tax for pre-2008 cars is based on engine size.  The basis of charging from 2008 onwards is on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.  The public consultation process on the proposed changes, in December 2006, made it clear from the outset that the objective of the new motor tax system was to influence the future purchasing decisions of consumers in favour of lower carbon emitting vehicles.  European Environment Agency (EEA) statistics show that the average emissions of new cars in Ireland in 2001 was 166.6 grams per kilometre (g/km), reducing to 161.6g/km in 2007, just prior to the introduction of the new system.  The average emissions of new cars entering the fleet in 2015 was 114g/km, ahead of the EU target of 130g/km set out in EU Regulation No. 443 of 2009 which sets performance standards for new passenger cars as part of the Community&rsquo;s integrated approach to reduce CO2 emissions from light duty vehicles.  It is, therefore, clear that the measure has been successful from an environmental perspective in reducing emissions from CO2.  The issue of emissions from diesel cars will be considered in the context of the Clean Air Strategy being developed by the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Mr. Denis Naughten, T.D.</p>  <p>  In respect of payment periods, motor tax is payable on an annual, half-yearly or quarterly basis.  The rates applicable for the half-yearly and quarterly options are 55.5% and 28.25% of the annual charge, respectively.  These relativities have remained generally consistent since the 1960s.  </p>  <p>  The differential takes account of the extra workload for staff in motor tax offices and the Driver and Vehicle Computer Services Division of my Department (which operates the online motor tax system) in processing non-annual renewals, as well as the resultant administrative and printing costs that arise, including the issuing of renewal notices.  Each quarterly renewal of motor tax follows the same administrative procedures as the annual renewal process.  Consequently, renewing on a quarterly basis generates four times the workload of an annual renewal for the equivalent period.</p>  <p>  The loss of income that would arise from changing these arrangements would have a negative impact on the total collected via motor tax and would have to be borne elsewhere in the motor tax system or through the taxation system generally.</p>  <p>  On the basis of the current payment arrangements, the number of motor tax discs issued each year is in the order of some 5m discs.  The introduction of a facility whereby a motor tax disc can be taken out on a monthly basis would significantly increase the volume of discs and renewals, with a resultant increase in the costs of operating the motor tax system administratively and in terms of financial costs and controls, including bank charges, which are not currently met by vehicle owners.</p>  <p>  In respect of a system of payment by direct debit, it should be noted such a proposal would require significant additional enforcement provisions to recoup income lost to the taxpayer where there are insufficient funds in personal accounts to meet the payment or where the direct debit option is cancelled after a disc has been issued, as well as provisions to enable recovery of a disc in such circumstances.</p></reply>

Consequently, renewing on a quarterly basis generates four times the workload of an annual renewal for the equivalent period.</p><p>The loss of income that would arise from changing these arrangements would have a negative impact on the total collected via motor tax and would have to be borne elsewhere in the motor tax system or through the taxation system generally.</p></reply>

The next investment priority is to address bottlenecks and congestion, to improve efficiency and sustainability of transport systems.  Finally, targeted investments that: enhance the efficiency of the existing network; improve connections to key seaports and airports; in the case of roads, provide access to poorly served regions, for large-scale employment proposals, to complete missing links and to address critical safety issues; and support identified national and regional spatial planning priorities.</p></reply>

Specifically, it will allow substantial progress on electrification of the Northern rail line as far as Balbriggan - now expected to be delivered in 2022 - and commencing work on the Maynooth line.  The remaining elements of the DART Expansion programme are being considered in the context of the 10 year investment plan that is expected to be published in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  In light of the NTA&rsquo;s responsibility in this area and their previous response to the Deputy of 19th October 2017, I have forwarded the Deputy&rsquo;s question to the Authority for an update on the issue raised.  Please advise my private office if you do not receive a response within ten working days.</p></reply>

This is the reason the project was not mentioned in my 16th January press release.</p>  <p>  The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads in Co. Louth is the statutory responsibility of Louth County Council, in accordance with the provisions of Section 13 of the Roads Act 1993. Works on those roads are funded from local authorities' own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.  My Department has no grant application on hand in relation to the proposed Northern Cross route in Drogheda.</p>  <p>  While the Capital Plan, as enhanced with the extra Capital Plan Review allocations, does allow for the build up in Exchequer funding for maintenance of the network and for some limited investment in road improvements, it will be some years yet before funding reaches the level needed to maintain the network in a "steady state" condition. The primary focus of expenditure will continue, therefore, to be on the maintenance and renewal of the network.  </p></reply>

I wish to assure Deputy Broughan that steps are being taken to help alleviate these pressures. </p>  <p>   I understand that the Deputy refers to the &lsquo;September Measures&rsquo; which relate to the introduction of a universal payment (a maximum of &euro;1,040 per year) and the substantial increase of up to 50% in the targeted subventions available to families that need it most to support their return to work or training. </p>  <p>   Since September these additional supports have been available in 89% of services nationally and to date the families of nearly 66,000 are benefitting from these supports, including more than 31,000 children registered for the new universal subsidy. </p>  <p>   Recent data showed a rise in the cost of childcare last year for the first time in five years. The average cost of childcare in Ireland rose by &euro;7 per week, which is well below the &euro;20 per week on offer through the universal subsidy and significantly lower than the targeted subventions available, which amount to up to &euro;145 per child, per week, up to age 15.  </p>  <p>   I understand that any rise in childcare fees is a very significant matter for any family. I hope that the additional subsidies noted above go some way to lessening the impact of these changes on families but fully accept that the Government must do more to improve affordability further and I am committed to achieving this.  </p>  <p>  The past three budgets have seen an increase in investment in early years of over 80%. I will continue to seek more investment to assist parents by offering subsidies such as those above and I am working very hard on this. We are also closely monitoring fees and this will inform whether we need to take a different approach in future years. I have commissioned an Independent Review of the Cost of Delivery of Quality Childcare; which is underway and will examine what the real cost of delivering childcare is so that Government can be better informed of what appropriate fees are and the level of funding that is required to subsidise fees for parents.  </p>  <p>  In the meantime I will continue to work to deliver quality, accessible, affordable childcare for all families in Ireland.</p></reply>

Its goal is to support early years providers to deliver an inclusive pre-school experience. AIM is a child-centred and evidence-based model, involving seven levels of progressive support, moving from the universal to the targeted, based on the needs and strengths of the child and the early years setting. Supports provided under AIM include: the development of an inclusive culture; enhanced continuing professional development for early years practitioners; the provision of equipment, appliances and grants for minor alterations; access to therapeutic intervention and increased capitation for early years providers in the case of children with very complex needs. AIM was launched in June 2016 and is administered by Pobal on behalf of the Department. </p>  <p>  AIM is designed to support children to access the ECCE programme. The child must qualify on age grounds for the ECCE programme and the early years provider must be registered with Tusla and hold an active DCYA contract to deliver the ECCE programme. The only exception to this is where the child qualifies for the ECCE programme but is availing of early childhood care and education services funded under another DCYA childcare programme such as the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) or Training and Education Childcare (TEC) programmes. </p>  <p>  In its first year, AIM provided 2,486 children with 4,760 targeted supports to ensure that they could fully participate in the ECCE programme. In the current programme year, AIM has provided 3,071 children with 4,474 targeted supports to date. </p>  <p>  At the moment, there are no plans to extend AIM supports beyond the ECCE programme to cater for children in after-school care or the CCS Programme. However, I wish to note that the benefits of AIM are extending beyond pre-school children to these and other cohorts. AIM universal supports are benefitting all children in early years settings through for example, improvements in inclusive practice within these settings and improvements in knowledge and competence among the staff in relation to disability.  </p>  <p>  An End of Year One Review of AIM is underway and will be completed in mid-2018. This will be followed by a full and more in-depth end of year three evaluation of AIM in 2019. These reviews will examine what has worked well and identify where improvements could be made to the Model. They will also help to inform consideration of possible future AIM expansion.</p></reply>

At that time, the ECCE Programme only operated for a 38 week period, or one programme year.  For some children with special/additional needs, attending preschool five days a week was not feasible and so an allowance was made to enable them split ECCE over 2 years, for example, a child may have availed of 3 days ECCE provision in year one and 2 days in year two.  Their total ECCE provision remained at 38 weeks.</p>  <p>  In order to facilitate this, in the cases where the child would have been over the age limit for ECCE (5 years and 6 months when finishing ECCE) an overage exemption was approved. This flexibility was never intended to conflict with the legislative requirement to start school by age six.  The law and policy on school start-age is clearly established in Ireland.  Children should be in school by the time they are six and the primary school system has a variety of resources to support children with disabilities. If children are not in school by six, under the Educational Welfare Act, the Educational Welfare service of Tusla must be satisfied that the child is receiving a minimum standard of education in a place other than a recognised school.  (Tusla does this by sending Educational Welfare Inspectors out to the place of the child's education.  Should this be required, this would be in addition to the Early Years Inspectorates funded by my Department.) </p>  <p>  Since ECCE was first introduced, my Department has worked to improve the pre-school experience for children with disabilities and to optimise their early development.  The two main enhancements are:- </p>  <p>  - ECCE entitlement currently averages at 61 weeks, up from 38 weeks, and it will expand further to 76 weeks from September 2018.  This is in keeping with good international practice.</p>  <p>  - The Access and Inclusion Model (AIM) has been introduced with 7 different levels of support for children with disabilities.  Over 5,000 children have so far benefited from targeted supports and many multiples of this from universal supports available under AIM.</p>  <p>  Purely in the best interests of children, and for no other reason, a proposal was considered to remove the overage exemption to the upper age limit to the Programme.  On 6th December 2017, I announced that I paused a decision on the removal of the Upper age limit exemption for ECCE so that further consultation with parents can occur.  This means that for the 2018/2019 ECCE year the overage exemption will continue to be available.  </p>  <p>  In summary, from September 2018, all children, including children with disabilities will be able to access a full two years of ECCE.</p></reply>

It was introduced in June 2016 and is administered by Pobal on behalf of my Department. AIM includes 7 levels of progressive support, moving from the universal to the targeted.  The degree of support provided depends on the needs and strengths of the child in the context of the pre-school setting they are attending. </p>  <p>  A pre-school provider, in partnership with a parent, can apply for AIM Level 7 support - additional capitation. Where the AIM Early Years Specialist (EYS) (a support provided under AIM Level 4) considers that an AIM Level 7 support is critical to a child's participation in the ECCE programme, they will further consider the degree of Level 7 support required having regard to the needs of the child and the pre-school setting. </p>  <p>  There are two rates of Level 7 capitation.  The lower rate is &euro;130 per week (which is calculated on the basis of 10 hours of support per week) and the higher rate is &euro;195 per week (which is calculated on the basis of 15 hours of support per week).   </p>  <p>  This additional capitation can be used to reduce the adult to child ratio in the pre-school room or can be used to buy in additional assistance.</p>  <p>  In relation to this particular child, Pobal has advised that an application for support under AIM Level 7 was received on 16th January 2018.  An EYS has been assigned and will be in contact with the pre-school provider by telephone shortly to arrange for an observation visit to take place.  Following this, the EYS will submit a recommendation to the Pobal AIM Level 7 appraisal team who will review this information and make a decision.  The outcome of the application will then be communicated to the applicants.  Pobal has advised that they would expect a turnaround of between 4 and 6 weeks from receipt of the application to communication of the decision to this child's parents and pre-school provider.</p></reply>

This capital funding will directly support outdoor play areas, extra spaces and essential maintenance, for example.  The investment reflects my on-going commitment to developing quality, affordable childcare in Ireland, and assisting providers in delivering high quality services to parents and children.</p>  <p>  One of the key objectives of my Department for 2018 was to open this capital scheme as early as possible to enable the evaluation and award process early in the year and the works to be completed by year end.  This is based on feedback from providers regarding previous capital programmes and I am delighted that we have made some progress in this regard.  My Department first notified the Capital 2018 programme to providers in November 2017.  This early notification aimed to achieve an earlier application window (opening in February 2018), and an earlier commencement of works (end May 2018), than in 2017.  It is intended that this will allow services the opportunity to commence their capital works as early as possible after applications are approved in May 2018. </p>  <p>  With respect to 2 of the 5 strands of Capital 2018: as in previous years, priority has been given to community/not for profit services, many of which were established using significant state investment under previous capital programmes, the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme (EOCP) or the National Childcare Investment Programme (NCIP).  In such cases, capital funding for maintenance of these properties is released in accordance with public spending guidelines, with the aim of protecting the value of previous significant investment by the state. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, as community services are non-profit-making, the capital funding available under Strands 2 and 5 is intended to assist where private financing may not be achievable.  The key aim of Strand 2 and 5 grants will be to ensure that community services continue to be fit for purpose with capital funds contributing towards the provisions of, for example, essential repairs to the existing building and facilities, replacement of the building&rsquo;s fixtures and fittings, and/or works highlighted as a direct result of an inspection by TUSLA or other competent authorities. </p>  <p>  My Department and I remain committed to developing the annual Early Years Capital programme in respect of the needs of children and providers, with the aim of providing childcare facilities of the highest quality.  My Department has supported both private and community services over the last number of years and our intention is to continue to do so.  My Department is also currently enhancing its capacity to examine medium and long term needs in the sector and this will enable further analysis of the need for multiannual and larger scale capital development.</p></reply>

They comprise local representatives from the statutory, community and voluntary sectors, childcare providers and parents. There are now 30 CCCs, as Limerick City and Limerick County CCCs have amalgamated, as have Waterford City and Waterford County and North and South Tipperary. Each committee has a distinct legal identity and board of directors. City and County Childcare Committees receive funding from my Department for the operations of the Committee, allowing each one to employ staff and implement actions contained in its strategic plan, which is approved by my Department to reflect national policy objectives. Pobal acts as managing agent on behalf of the Department in relation to the performance of individual CCCs. Pobal appraises and monitors the local planning and implementation of activities and outcomes of each CCC associated with my Department's funding, and supports CCCs individually and collectively.</p><p>The CCCs support the delivery of the childcare programmes operated by my Department: the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) Programme, the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) Programme and the Training and Employment Childcare (TEC) Programme. CCCs perform a range of activities to promote the Access and Inclusion Model (AIM) including providing information and support for parents and ECCE settings. They are also responsible for rolling out the Equality, Diversity and Inclusion training programme to pre-school practitioners nationwide. They provide support and guidance to local service providers and parents in relation to the childcare programmes and support quality in keeping with national frameworks and policy objectives. CCCs are also available to co-ordinate and provide training to providers and offer support to families with regard to Early Years services within their respective catchment areas.</p><p>The information requested by the Deputy is outlined in the table.  This table outlines the core funding allocated annually to each CCC from 2008 to 2018. To note that my Department also provides additional annual funding to the CCCs to support a number of initiatives including the administration of the Childminding Development Grant, the Access and Inclusion Model (AIM), and  the Parent and Toddler Initiative.</p><p><table><tr><th>City/County Childcare

Gaisce is a limited company set up under the Companies Acts.</p>  <p>  The Children (Amendment) Act 2015 provided for the amalgamation of Oberstown Boys School, Oberstown Girls School and Trinity House School on 1 June 2016.   </p>  <p>  The Child and Family Agency Act, 2013 provided for the establishment of Tusla, the Child and Family Agency.  On its establishment in 2014, Tusla assumed responsibility for functions previously performed by the Health Service Executive relating to child welfare and protection. </p>  <p>  The Child and Family Agency Act, 2013 also made provision for the transfer of the previous responsibilities held by the Family Support Agency (FSA) and the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) to Tusla with the aim of facilitating the greater integration of services for children and families.  The transfer of these responsibilities from the FSA and the NEWB, both under the aegis of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, saw the disbandment of these organisations on the establishment of Tusla on 1 January, 2014.</p>  <p>  In 2011, the Government decided that the Family Mediation Service should transfer from the Family Support Agency to the Legal Aid Board.  This aimed to facilitate the use of mediation in family disputes in order to speed up the legal process, reduce cost and ameliorate the stress of contested court proceedings.  The commencement order for Part 16 of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011 gave effect to the transfer from 1st November 2011.</p>  <p>  In September 2011, the Children Acts Advisory Board was dissolved by means of the commencement by the Minister of Health of Part 6 of the Child Care (Amendment) Act 2011.</p></reply>

(ADM) with the agreement of and as a requirement of the European Commission to manage a Global Grant.  In its initial form it was an intermediary company working on behalf of Government to support social and economic development within Ireland.  Between 1992 and 2005, the company expanded its service provision to Government Departments and took on the management and administration of a number of programmes. In 2005, ADM was re-named Pobal. </p><p>Pobal is a not for profit company limited by guarantee. Charitable status was granted to the company by the Revenue Commissioners on the 20<sup>th</sup>November 1996. In accordance with Section 40 of the Charities Act, 2009, Pobal was entered onto the Register of Charitable Organisations automatically on 16 October 2014.  </p><p>A charitable organisation must meet three requirements if they are to be considered to be a charity: it must operate in the Republic of Ireland; it must have a charitable purpose only; and it  must exist to benefit the public or a section of the public in Ireland, or elsewhere, through its charitable purpose(s). Under the Charities Act, there are four categories of charitable purpose - the prevention or relief of poverty or economic hardship; the advancement of education; the advancement of religion; and any other purpose that is of benefit to the community.</p><p>The basis for Pobal having charitable status is tied to the objects for which the company was founded which are specified in its Memorandum and Articles of Association. Pobal&rsquo;s primary objectives are: </p><p>a) the delivery and management of programmes which promote social inclusion, reconciliation and equality through integrated social and economic development within communities,</p><p>b) the delivery and management of local, community and other development programmes,</p><p>c) the provision of technical assistance, support and advice to the groups and beneficiaries of the programmes, which are delivered/managed,</p><p>d) the provision of assistance and support in the analysis and exchange of experience, leading to the communication of information and the identification and dissemination of good practice within the programmes which are delivered/managed,</p><p>e) aiding, through the lessons learnt from these programmes, in the formation of Government and other policy development at local, regional and national levels, and</p><p>f) the provision of technical assistance, support and advice to other bodies with the approval of the Minister for Rural and Community Development. </p><p>No discussions have taken place between this Department and other Departments in regard to Pobal&rsquo;s charitable status. </p><p>I am satisfied that Pobal is fully compliant with the relevant legislative requirements including those of the Charities Act, 2009.</p></reply>

These supports include work programmes such as Community Employment (CE) and T&uacute;s.</p><p>Schemes such as CE and T&uacute;s provide part-time temporary work in local communities, as a stepping-stone back to employment.  However, it is important to note that these placements are not full-time sustainable jobs.  Instead, they are designed to break the cycle of unemployment and maintain work readiness, thereby improving a person&rsquo;s opportunities of returning to the labour market or getting a job for the first time.  </p><p>The Deputy will appreciate that the welcome reduction in the unemployment rate is a factor in recruitment to all programmes.  Long-term unemployment is expected to fall further this year in line with the continuing forecasted fall in overall unemployment.  </p><p>In the context of the economic recovery, my Department undertook a review of the work programmes in 2016.  While the primary focus was on CE, the review also looked at other employment programmes such as T&uacute;s.  </p><p>Arising from the review, the Government agreed to implement changes to the qualifying conditions for CE in order to broaden access to a wider range of people.  These new rules were implemented from July 2017.  As part of the changes introduced, the qualifying age was reduced to 21 years.  In addition while, in general, all placements will now be for one year only, if a CE participant is undertaking training to achieve a major  award, their time can be extended by up to 2 years to allow them to complete the training which will enhance their overall employment prospects.  This allows for 3 years continuous participation on CE.  Those over 55 years of age can also remain on CE for three years.  In addition, the reference year for CE participation was moved from 2000 to 2007 which ensures that more people can re-qualify for the programme.  Overall, these changes improve the way that CE operates and should allow access to more people who are long-term unemployed.  </p><p>Currently, participants can remain on T&uacute;s for one year and I have no plans to change this.<font color="#004080"> </font>However, changes will be implemented in the coming weeks to the selection criteria for T&uacute;s which should broaden the numbers available for this scheme.  This includes an increase in the percentage of assisted referrals from 20% to 30%, as well as permitting someone who has had a break of up to 30 days on the Live Register  in the past 12 months to be considered eligible for T&uacute;s selection. </p><p>I will continue to keep this whole area under review so that these schemes provide real and valuable support to both individuals and communities. The Government is very mindful of the large number of work programme places involved in service delivery and other valuable services around the country.  In this regard, if any scheme is experiencing particular recruitment difficulties, they should contact their local Intreo Centre for assistance.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

As more public service providers move to using SAFE2, people who are already registered to SAFE2 will not need to repeatedly register their identity information when accessing public services.</p><p>Once a person is registered to SAFE2 they may be issued with a Public Services Card (PSC).  This is essentially a physical token that proves a person has been SAFE2 registered.</p><p>The SAFE project commenced as a result of a Government decision of 29 June 2004 (S290/05/25/0025).</p><p>The first Public Services Card was issued following the first SAFE registration on the 26<sup>th</sup>of October 2011.  SAFE registration and associated PSC issuance has been rolled out to the public on a phased basis since that date.  To date, in excess of 3 million PSCs have issued.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Carer&rsquo;s allowance (CA) is a primary income support and its means test is one of the least onerous in the suite of social protection supports provided by my Department.  The means test for Carer's Allowance involves assessing income and if a person is single, &euro;332.50 of their gross weekly income is not taken into account.  If they are married, in a civil partnership or cohabiting the first &euro;665 of their combined gross weekly income is disregarded.  PRSI, union dues, superannuation (pension contributions) and travel expenses are also deducted.  For a couple, the combined gross weekly balance is then halved to give the carer's weekly means.  Any payment made by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection (DEASP) is not taken into account in the means test for Carer's Allowance.</p>  <p>  The level of payment for Family Income Supplement (FIS) is determined on a completely different basis as a percentage of the difference between the household income and annual family income limits which are increased in line with the size of the family.  It would not therefore be appropriate to apply alternative thresholds to a specific action.  More generally, any improvements or additions to the income limits for carers allowance could only be considered in a budgetary context and in the light of available financial resources.</p>  <p>  Considerable improvements have been introduced for carers in recent years.  In Budget 2016, the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant, which is payable without a means test, was increased to &euro;1,700 in addition to other measures benefiting carers including extending the period when the allowance can be paid following the death of a care recipient from 6 to 12 weeks.  In addition to the Christmas Bonus and the &euro;5 increase in the weekly rate, Budget 2017 introduced a measure that extends payment of CA for 12 weeks where the care recipient enters permanent residential care.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that I am very aware of the key role carers play in society and I will continue to keep the range of supports available to carers under review.  If the Deputy has a particular case that he wants to be considered in the context of his question, I would invite him to send details to me for examination.</p></reply>

This provides them with access to the following benefits: State pension (contributory), widow&rsquo;s, widower&rsquo;s or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s pension (contributory), guardian&rsquo;s payment (contributory), maternity benefit, adoptive benefit, paternity benefit, treatment benefit (from March 2017).  Entitlement to invalidity pension was extended to the self-employed from December 2017.</p>  <p>  This compares favourably with employees who, in general, are liable to the class A rate of 4%.  In addition their employers are liable to PRSI at the rate of 8.6% on weekly earnings up to and including &euro;376 or at the rate of 10.85% where weekly earnings exceed &euro;376.  Accordingly the combined rate of PRSI rate paid in respect of class A employees is 12.6% or 14.85%, depending on the level of weekly earnings.  These class A employees are entitled to the full range of social insurance benefits.   </p>  <p>  The issue of extending additional social insurance benefits to the self-employed paying class S PRSI was considered in the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance fund (SIF) as at 31 December, 2015, which I published on the 18 October 2017.  The review, required by legislation, was carried out by independent consultants, KPMG.  It examines the projected income and expenditure of the SIF over the course of the 55 year period from 2016 to 2071.</p>  <p>  The review found that the fund currently has a modest surplus of income over expenditure.  In 2016 there was a surplus of &euro;0.4 billion on expenditure of &euro;8.8 billion and receipts of &euro;9.2 billion.  However, this will reduce over the next two years and will return to a small shortfall in 2020.  The annual shortfalls are projected to increase from 2021 onwards as the ageing of the population impacts.  Projections indicate that, in the absence of further action to tackle the shortfall, the excess of expenditure over income of the fund will increase significantly over the medium to long term.  The shortfall in expenditure over income is projected to increase from &euro;0.2 billion in 2020 to &euro;3.3 billion by 2030 and to &euro;22.2 billion by 2071.  It should be noted that as self-employed workers were to be eligible to apply for invalidity pension from December 2017, the cost of this introduction has been factored into the actuarial review&rsquo;s findings.</p>  <p>  As part of the review the independent consultants were required to project the additional PRSI expenditure if invalidity pension and illness, jobseeker&rsquo;s and carer&rsquo;s benefits were extended to class S self-employed workers and the PRSI contribution rates required to provide these benefits on a revenue neutral basis.</p>  <p>  The review found that the combined cost of introducing the invalidity, illness, jobseeker&rsquo;s and carer&rsquo;s benefits for class S contributions is estimated to be &euro;118 million in 2018, rising steadily to &euro;223 million in 2020.  By 2025 the projected cost is &euro;413 million and, over the period of the review the cost would rise to &euro;1.3 billion in 2071.  </p>  <p>  The review indicates that, where these benefits are extended to the self-employed, the class S rate of PRSI contribution would need to increase substantially in order to ensure that the benefits are delivered in a revenue neutral manner.  It estimates that when expenditure on the additional benefits is considered over the entire projection period, PRSI rates would need to increase by 94% under a scenario of no subvention from the exchequer.  This is equivalent to an increase of the Class S contribution rate from the current 4% rate to 7.8%.</p>  <p>  This increased contribution is attributable to the costs of extending these additional benefits to PRSI class S contributors.  It does not take account of the value to PRSI class S contributors of access to the range of existing benefits, and in particular State pension contributory.  The consultants estimated that the typical cost of State pension (contributory) on its own is of the order of 10% to 15%, depending on other factors including rate of average earnings and date of commencing paying PRSI.  Adding in the other benefits referenced the total class S rate of contribution to ensure revenue neutrality would be of the order of 20% per annum.</p>  <p>  The findings of the Review will play an important role in informing the overall debate on policy developments in relation to the SIF in the years ahead, including the financial sustainability of the Fund given the expected demographic challenges and consideration of extending the scope of benefits for workers generally, including the self-employed.</p></reply>

In addition to its own statutory responsibilities in relation to information and advocacy service provision, it has statutory responsibility for the countrywide networks of Citizens Information Services (CIS) and the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS).</p><p>In February 2017, the Board of CIB decided to change its governance arrangements from ninety three individual service delivery companies to an eight region model.  The new model will comprise sixteen regional companies, with one CIS and one MABS company in each region.</p><p>MABS National Management Forum, (NMF), was established as a representative body for the 51 local MABS management companies.  A small annual funding allocation was made by CIB to the NMF to cover expenses, such as travel and subsistence etc., incurred in its day to day activities.  As the local management boards will no longer be in place following the establishment of 8 new regional boards, the NMF will have no function in the revised structure.  CIB issued a letter to NMF on January 18<sup>th</sup>informing them of its decision to cease direct funding.</p><p>However, any  expenses, such as travel and subsistence etc, incurred by the local MABS companies&rsquo; representatives on the NMF,  pending the establishment to the new regional management structure, can be claimed from the relevant local company.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

It also found that the changes increased the probability of employment and higher employment income for lone parents.  The report also concluded that assisting lone parents to enhance skills also needs to be seen as a key objective as low paid employment will not, on its own, ensure a reduction in the risk of poverty.</p><p>The report of the Joint Committee on Social Protection described the main challenges facing lone parents including child poverty, activation and education, childcare costs, maintenance payments and the changes to the OFP scheme.</p><p>Both of these reports have made, and will continue to make, a valuable contribution to the policy approach for supports for lone parents by my Department. </p><p>My Department continues to work closely with other Departments on this issue.  This includes working with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs on childcare, with the Department of Education and Skills to follow up on the recommendations of the report on barriers to Third Level education for lone parents and plans to consult with the Department of Justice and Equality as part of the review currently underway in the area of maintenance.</p><p>Budgets 2015, 2016 and 2017 included a range of measures that benefited lone parents.  I ensured improvements for lone parents in particular in Budget 2018 by introducing the following measures:</p><p>- Income disregard for lone parents on OFP and the jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment (JST) to be increased from &euro;110 a week to &euro;130 a week with effect from 29<sup>th</sup>March 2018;</p><p>- The increase for a qualified child (IQC) rate to be increased from &euro;29.80 a week to &euro;31.80 a week with effect from 29<sup>th</sup>March 2018.</p><p>A number of other budgetary measures will also benefit lone parents, including the &euro;5 primary rate increase, the additional week to the fuel allowance and the Christmas bonus of 85%, which was paid in early December.  </p><p>These changes will see a lone parent on OFP or JST working 15 hours a week on the National Minimum Wage gain by almost &euro;1000 per year in their overall income.</p><p>My Department&rsquo;s social impact assessments of the last four Budgets show a cumulative increase of &euro;36.75 in the average weekly household income of employed lone parents and &euro;33.60 for unemployed lone parents.  This compares favourably with a weekly increase of &euro;34.45 for the average household.</p><p>I intend to continue to prioritise supports for lone parents, particularly those which incentivise work over welfare.  I stated at the publication of the Indecon Report that I intend to provide for the further review of the OFP scheme.As there is a time lag before the benefits of labour market reforms appear, I anticipate that this review will include data to the end of 2018.</p></reply>

This will be a successor to the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion 2007-2016 (NAP inclusion) and its 2015-2017 update which concluded last year.</p>  <p>  My Department has started preparations for the new four year plan for the period 2018-202, with the public consultation process due to take place in the coming weeks.  Like its predecessor, the plan will  have a &lsquo;whole of Government&rsquo; approach that aims to improve outcomes for  the vulnerable and marginalised in our society, while recognising a shared responsibility across Government to implement actions to achieve the overall objectives.  The theme of the new plan is one of active inclusion, which will enable every citizen, notably the most disadvantaged, to fully participate in society, including having a job.</p>  <p>  The primary focus will be the reduction of consistent poverty through a three pronged approach: supporting incomes through as high as possible a level of employment, and encouraging and assisting people to enter the workforce; setting targets for the level of relevant welfare payments (as in the original NAP inclusion) designed to reduce relative poverty among those who cannot (or cannot find) work; and finally improving access to quality services such as health, education, childcare, training, housing, community supports in order to minimise deprivation for all groups and, in particular those who are on relatively low incomes such as one parent families.</p>  <p>  A key element of NAP inclusion is the national social target for poverty reduction (NSTPR), which sets out the Government&rsquo;s ambition for reducing and ultimately eliminating poverty.  The headline target is to reduce consistent poverty   to 2 per cent or less by 2020 (with an interim target of 4 per cent by 2016), from the 2010 baseline rate of 6.3 per cent.  In addition, there are sub-targets in relation to children and for Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to the Europe 2020 poverty target.  Meeting these targets &ndash; or indeed making significant progress towards them &ndash; by the 2020 deadline will be a challenge and one that will require the combined efforts of all Government Departments, boosted by the resources and commitment of civil society. However it will remain a key element of the new plan.</p></reply>

The maximum rate of pension is payable where a person has a yearly average of at least 48, and there are banded entitlements below that.</p>  <p>  In calculating the yearly average, the number of full-rate contributions paid and/or credited is counted up to the end of the last full tax/contribution year before reaching pension age (66), and this total is divided by the number of tax/contribution years in their record up to that point.  For example, if someone&rsquo;s record was from 1972, and they turned 66 on 1 July 2016, it would be the contributions they paid or were credited in the period to 31 December 2015, divided by 44 years (i.e. every year from 1972 to 2015).  Taking the subsequent period into account to calculate the yearly average could only increase their contributions by a maximum of 26 contributions, and if their yearly average was already higher than that, this would have the effect of reducing their yearly average, rather than increasing it, as the amended total would be divided by 45.  Given the fact that in most cases, this would result in a lower rather than a higher yearly average, it is to most people&rsquo;s advantage that the rule should apply as it does now. </p>  <p>  However, the Deputy should note that contributions can still be used to satisfy other pension conditions (notably the requirement to have a minimum of 520 contributions paid to qualify for State pension contributory). </p>  <p>It should also be remembered that PRSI does not just fund the State pension contributory and enable people to qualify for that payment, but also working age benefits before they retire.</p>  <p>  I do hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

There is no limitation placed by the scheme on the length of tenancy that can be supported by  HAP.  However, as with other private rental tenancies, the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 (as amended) governs the relationship between landlord and tenant and the length of the tenancy is a matter that must be agreed between the landlord and tenant in that context.  My Department does not hold information in relation to the length of individual tenancies.</p>  <p>  An analysis of data to end 2017 is not yet available.  However, data available at the end of Q3 2017 indicates that during the period Q1-Q3 2017 2,250 HAP tenancies had ceased.  This includes tenant led exits; compliance exits; transfers to other forms of social housing and also landlord exits.</p>  <p>   In cases where a HAP supported tenancy comes to an end, the tenant can find alternative accommodation and retain their eligibility for HAP support or the local authority may decide to offer another form of social housing support to the tenant in accordance with their scheme of letting priorities.</p>  <p>  On 19 September 2017, I announced a number of improvements to the rental market as part of the rolling review of Rebuilding Ireland.  One such change is that the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) will be given additional powers and resources to take on a regulatory responsibility in the rental sector over the next two years.  Changes needed in legislation and in the Board&rsquo;s financing arrangements will be addressed and a two-year change management plan will be implemented, on foot of which the RTB will become the sector&rsquo;s regulator.  It will be an offence to implement rent increases that contravene the law and the RTB will be given the powers to investigate and prosecute landlords who implement such increases.  The onus will no longer be exclusively on the tenant.</p></reply>

Following receipt of such a proposal, the Minister requests the Director of the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) to conduct an assessment of the area to establish whether or not it meets the criteria for designation and to report to the Minister on whether the area should be designated as a Rent Pressure Zone.</p><p>For an area to be designated a Rent Pressure Zone, it must satisfy the following criteria set out in section 24A(4) of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 (as inserted by section 36 of the 2016 Act):</p><p>(i) The annual rate of rent inflation in the area must have been 7% or more in four of the last six quarters; and </p><p>(ii) The average rent for tenancies registered in the area with the RTB in the last quarter must be above the average national rent (the National Standardised Rent in the RTB&rsquo;s Rent Index Report) in the last quarter (&euro;1,056 per month in Q3 2017).</p><p>On 20 December 2017, the RTB published its Rent Index Report in relation to Quarter 3 2017, which includes a summary of the data used as the criteria for designating Rent Pressure Zones in relation to all Local Electoral Areas in the country.  This allows all interested parties to see exactly where their area stands in relation to average rent levels and increases and possible designation.  The data from the Rent Index Report relating to Mullingar, County Westmeath are detailed in the following table: <table><tr><th>Local   Electoral   Area</th><th>Quarters &amp;gt;   7%</th><th>Average 2017   Q3 (&euro;)</th></tr><tr><td>Mullingar - Kilbeggan <br /><br />Mullingar - Coole </td><td>3<br /><br />4</td><td>723.41<br /><br />741.69</td></tr></table></p><p>In both Local Electoral Areas in Mullingar, the average monthly is below the national standardised rent of &euro;1,056 per month.  Therefore, neither of the Local Electoral Areas in Mullingar meet the criteria for designation at this time.</p><p>The Housing Agency will continue to monitor the rental market and may recommend further areas for designation.  Where, following the procedures set out in the Act, it is found at a future date that additional areas meet the criteria, they will be designated as Rent Pressure Zones.</p></reply>

Section 24 defines a market rent to mean: </p><p>&lsquo;the rent which a willing tenant not already in occupation would give and a willing landlord would take for the dwelling, in each case  on the basis of vacant possession being given, and having regard to:</p><p>a.  the other terms of the tenancy, and</p><p>b.  the letting values of dwellings of a similar size, type and character to the dwelling and situated in a comparable area to that in which it is situated.&rsquo; </p><p>Essentially, the amount of the rent payable is agreed between the landlord and tenant, cognisant of local rents for similar dwellings. </p><p>The Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) publishes its Quarterly Report of the RTB Rent Index, which are based on the actual rents being paid for private rented properties and is compiled by the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) from the RTB&rsquo;s own register of tenancies.  This extensive database is the largest in the country and is populated with information on actual/agreed rent, location, six categories of dwelling types, accommodation size and number of occupants and tenancy length.  These Reports are available to view on the RTB website, <i>,</i>by tenants and landlords who wish to check the current market rents in their region.</p><p>Section 20 of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 provides that a review of rent may not take place more than once in any period of 12 months or in the first 12 months of the tenancy.  The Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2015, which was enacted on 4 December 2015, amends section 20 to provide that rent reviews can only take place every 24 months rather than every 12 months, unless there has been a substantial change in the nature of the accommodation that warrants a review.  This measure will have effect for a period of 4 years, after which the duration between reviews will revert to 12 months.  The review of rent will still be on the basis that the market rent cannot be exceeded.  A rent review could give rise to a rent decrease/increase or to no rent change.</p><p>Tenants must be given 90 days&rsquo; notice of new rent and can make an application for dispute resolution to the RTB, if they have not been given the required notice, or if they feel the rent increase is in excess of the market rent.  These provisions have effect notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in a lease or tenancy agreement. </p><p>Both Threshold, the national housing charity, and the RTB are available to provide detailed and practical assistance to tenants.  Threshold operates the Tenancy Protection Service (TPS), a national service providing advice and support to households living in private rented accommodation who are experiencing tenancy problems, including where a tenancy is at risk of termination.  The TPS seeks to protect existing tenancies, keeping people in their homes and preventing them from having to access homeless services.  The TPS helpline is available from Monday to Friday, 9am to 9pm on free-phone 1800 454 454.  Further information is also available at <i>www.threshold.ie</i>.</p><p>In addition, the RTB has a central role in supporting the residential rental sector.  It deals with disputes between landlords and tenants, including disputes about rent reviews.  It also provides information about rent reviews and lawful rent increases.  If there is a dispute about the amount of rent being proposed, either party can refer the dispute to the RTB.  Evidence should be provided of rental rates for similar properties in the same area.  Further information is available at <i>www.rtb.ie/tenants </i>and through the RTB helpline - Lo-call on 0818 30 30 37 (mobile operators might charge a premium rate to the Lo-call number) or 01 702 8100 - available from Monday to Friday, 8:30am to 6.30pm.</p></reply>

Section 118(3) of the Local Government Act 2001 sets out the primary duties of the local government auditor as follows:</p><p>&ldquo;In the course of the audit of accounts of the local authority or other body, the local government auditor shall carry out such audit tests as he or she considers appropriate in order to be satisfied as to:</p><p>(a)  whether the annual financial statement is prepared in accordance with section 108 or with the accounting requirements otherwise applicable to the body concerned,</p><p>(b)  whether the annual financial statement presents fairly the financial position of the authority or other body and of its income and expenditure for the period in question,</p><p>(c)  whether the transactions of the audited body conform to the statutory or other authorisation under which they purport to have been carried out.&rdquo;</p><p>Following the audit each auditor issues an audit opinion, an audit report and a management letter to the Chief Executive of the local authority.  Included in the audit report is any matter which the auditor considers should be reported.  The Chief Executive of a local authority is required to respond to this report and his/her comments are included, if of material significance, as part of the final report.  This procedure has enhanced public scrutiny of local government, as management responses to address the issues raised at audit now form part of the published audit reports.  </p><p>The local government auditors&rsquo; statutory reports issued to the elected members of the local authorities on the audits of the annual financial statements for 2016 are published on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: <i>.</i></p><p>NOAC was established in July 2014 under the Local Government Reform Act 2014 to provide independent oversight of the local government sector.  Its functions are wide ranging, involving the scrutiny of performance generally and financial performance specifically, supporting best practice, overseeing implementation of national local government policy and monitoring and evaluating implementation of corporate plans, adherence to service level agreements and public service reform by local government bodies.  A Government Minister may also request that NOAC prepare a report relevant to its functions on any specified aspect of local government.</p><p>As well as the LGAS and NOAC, an audit committee is now place in each local authority, so as to enhance the financial management and audit control systems in local authorities.  Membership of these committees includes both elected members and expert external membership.  The functions of audit committees include reviewing financial and budgetary reporting practices and procedures within a local authority; reviewing auditors&rsquo; reports and special reports, and assessing follow-up action by management; assessing and promoting efficiency and value for money, reviewing risk management systems and making such recommendations to the authority as the committee considers appropriate in respect of such matters. </p><p>Given this threefold approach, I am satisfied that there is an appropriate audit framework in place for the local government sector.</p></reply>

The review involved discussions with the National Federation of Group Water Schemes, the representative body of the group water sector.  Discussions concluded in December, when I approved the revised subsidy levels.  The new subsidy arrangements, endorsed by a special delegate conference of the Federation on 13 December 2017, came into effect on 1 January 2018.</p>  <p>  The changes implement the recommendation contained in the report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services (JOCFFDWS), endorsed by both Houses of the Oireachtas in April 2017, that there be equity of treatment and equivalent financial support between households using public water services and those availing of private water services.  The subsidy scheme is demand-led and available to all eligible group water schemes irrespective of county location.  </p>  <p>  The revised subsidy levels are as follows:</p>  <p>  1) For the annual subsidy towards the operation and maintenance costs of group water schemes providing a supply of water for domestic purposes (knows as &lsquo;Subsidy A&rsquo;): </p>  <p>  The maximum subsidy per house in private group water schemes has increased from &euro;140 per household to &euro;231.  An increased maximum subsidy of &euro;281 per household is available for small schemes of less than 100 houses that are willing, in the interests of providing in the long-term a more sustainable water supply to their members, to progress towards rationalisation or amalgamation with other schemes.</p>  <p>  The maximum subsidy per house for public group water schemes has increased from &euro;70 per household to &euro;115.  These are schemes that supply their members with water that is provided by Irish Water.</p>  <p>  The portion of costs that can be recouped by group water schemes has also increased.  Typically up to 60% of costs have been covered by the subsidy payments.  This has increased to 85%.  There are also changes and simplifications to how these costs are assessed.</p>  <p>  2) For the additional subsidy that is paid towards the costs of group water schemes that have long-term Operation and Maintenance Contracts (for example, as part of a Design Build Operate project) for the delivery of water (known as &lsquo;Subsidy B)&rsquo;: </p>  <p>  There has been an increase in the level of volumetric costs incurred by group water schemes operating under these contracts that is recoupable, from 60% to 85%.  This will allow for a greater portion of costs to be included within the subsidy payment.</p>  <p>  In addition to the above, my Department is currently finalising proposals to increase the level of grant support for users of private wells, details of which I will be announcing shortly. </p>  <p>  Separate to the initial review of group water scheme subsidy levels and also in fulfilment of the JOCFFDWS recommendations, I will shortly be establishing a working group to conduct a wider review of investment needs and rural water services.  The review will focus on issues such as governance, supervision and monitoring of the sector, and capital investment requirements.  This group will engage widely with relevant stakeholders and will aim to complete its work by mid-2018.  </p>  <p>  Cognisance will be taken in this regard of any required measures to support the implementation of the finalised River Basin Management Plan 2018-2021, which I plan to finalise and publish early this year.</p></reply>

This recommendation was accepted by Eurostat, with a proviso that the decision could be reviewed at a future date. </p>  <p>  In December, the CSO made a decision that 14 of the 16 largest AHBs examined (i.e. those with 300+ homes in their property portfolios) in the initial phase of the review should be re-classified as falling within the public sector, under the broad local government classification.  This decision has been sent to Eurostat for their consideration and ultimate determination.</p>  <p>  While a final decision has yet to be taken by Eurostat regarding the classification of AHB expenditure, detailed analysis of the potential impacts on the Government debt and expenditure will be completed by the relevant Departments and Agencies.  To inform these considerations, the CSO is currently engaged in collecting the required data to compile the end-March 2018 Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP) notification tables (also known as the Maastricht returns), covering general government deficit and debt.  At the same time, the Department of Finance is also preparing the Stability Programme Update 2018.  This will take full account of the figures published by the CSO as part of the government finance statistics release.</p>  <p>  My Department is examining the provisional assessment by the CSO in detail, including the rationale for their recommendation, in close collaboration with my colleague, Minister Donohoe&rsquo;s Departments and the AHB sector itself, to assess the historic and future implications as well as identifying what measures can be taken to manage or mitigate the potential impacts on the capacity of the AHB sector in the supply and management of social housing.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this assessment by the CSO, the Government still sees an important role for the voluntary housing sector in contributing to delivery of social housing under Rebuilding Ireland, and we intend to press ahead with our ambitious plans to use all mechanisms and schemes, including through the AHB sector, to ensure that we maintain our planned momentum towards meeting the 50,000 Rebuilding Ireland social housing target.</p></reply>

My Department received the output of the working group in June 2017 and is presently further developing the strategy with a view to publishing it in the near future.</p>  <p>  In advance of formal publication, it should be noted that a significant number of measures to incentivise the increased use of vacant housing stock have already been introduced which are being progressed by my Department and local authorities.  These measures include:</p>  <p>  - requiring all local authorities to develop Vacant Homes Action Plans for their functional areas by end January 2018;</p>  <p>  - requiring local authorities to designate Vacant Homes Officers to co-ordinate local actions to address vacancy (the majority of local authorities now have a designated Vacant Homes Officer in place);</p>  <p>  - the ongoing implementation of the Repair and Leasing Scheme, the Buy and Renew Scheme, and the Housing Agency Acquisitions Fund for the purchase of vacant buy-to-let properties from financial institutions;</p>  <p>  - the review of planning legislation to allow the change of use of vacant commercial units in urban areas, including vacant or under-utilised areas over ground-floor premises, into residential units without having to go through the planning process. Draft regulations to give effect to this measure were laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on 13 December 2017 and it is intended that the new regulations, which - as set out in the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended - require the approval of both Houses, will be made as soon as possible; and work on further streamlining, and providing guidance on, the building control regulatory requirements in relation to the conversion of vacant premises (including vacant over the shops spaces) into residential use.  </p>  <p>  As part of their vacant homes action plans, local authorities are also undertaking local surveys to ascertain up-to-date vacancy levels within their functional areas.  Actions plans received to date from local authorities indicate that the level of vacant homes is significantly less than that set out in Census 2016, which was in essence, a snapshot at a particular point in time, i.e. end April 2016.  In this regard, it is considered that a significant number of those vacant units contained in the Census 2016 data have, given the passage of time since its collation, been re-introduced as viable housing stock, including homes that were subject to short-term vacancies that normally occur in a properly functioning housing market, e.g. the house may have been placed on the market for sale or to let, it may have been temporarily vacant while undergoing refurbishment works, or it may have been subject to legal or probate procedures. </p>  <p>  The Department is currently liaising with relevant stakeholders to agree a robust methodology to assess vacancy for inclusion in the national vacant homes strategy.  The local vacant homes actions plans - which, as mentioned, are due to be submitted by the end of January 2018 - will inform the finalisation of the strategy in terms of setting further actions and targets, and it is proposed to publish the strategy as soon as possible thereafter.</p></reply>

They provide and operate Ireland's principal emergency services which respond to emergencies on a daily basis.  The principal emergency services have developed arrangements for working in a co-ordinated fashion at a range of events, from small, routine incidents to large-scale emergencies.  The framework for major emergency management sets out arrangements that facilitate the principal emergency services in scaling up the response required, so as to utilise the full resources of the principal response agencies and to work together in the management of large-scale incidents.   Each principal response agency and principal emergency service operates under its own legislative code. </p>  <p>  The framework also provides mechanisms for linking the work of the principal response agencies with those at other levels of Government.   As part of the systemic approach to emergency management, major events and incidents are reviewed and learning points are identified and improvements made.  A region-based structure is in place to facilitate on-going development of emergency management at the local level and this process is supported and overseen by the inter-Departmental national steering group for major emergency management which was also established  by Government decision in 2006.</p></reply>

Subject to the suitability of the dwelling for social housing, and the agreement of the property owner, the cost of the necessary repairs will be met up-front by the local authority or an approved housing body. </p><p>The RLS was established on a pilot basis in Waterford and Carlow local authorities in October 2016 and expanded nationwide from 23 February 2017.  No targets were set for the scheme in 2016. Individual targets for 2017 were set for each local authority and these are set out in tabular form below. </p><p>Provisional 2017 outputs, across the range of delivery methods available to local authorities and approved housing bodies, were published on 15 January 2018 and are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link:</p><p><i>.</i></p><p>My Department is currently validating data from local authorities in order to report detailed progress on the RLS in the final quarter of 2017.

However, at the end of the third quarter 2017, 292 dwellings had been deemed suitable and local authorities were negotiating with properties owners; a further 231 dwellings were being inspected for suitability by local authorities; 18 Agreements to Lease had been signed. A detailed breakdown of the RLS scheme data for the third quarter of 2017 is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: </p><p><i></i>.</p><p>Funding of &euro;32 million is available for RLS for 2018 with an overall target of 800 dwellings.  The target number of social houses to be delivered across all delivery mechanisms in each local authority area out to 2021 was confirmed to each local authority on 5 January 2018, with a particular focus on 2018 delivery.

The preparation of each of the RSESs will be subject to strategic environmental assessment, SEA, which requires each plan to take full account of relevant EU and national legislative requirements, including in relation to climate change, in accordance with the SEA legislation.  </p>  <p>  The national climate adaptation framework, which was launched last week by my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and the Environment, sets out the context to ensure local authorities, regions and key sectors can assess the main risks and vulnerabilities of climate change, implement climate resilience actions and ensure climate adaptation considerations are mainstreamed into all local, regional and national policy making.  The role of spatial planning through the national planning framework will be critical in ensuring successful implementation of the national adaptation framework. </p>  <p>  Minister Naughten has also announced a funding commitment of &euro;10 million over five years to establish four local authority regional climate action offices.  This commitment recognises the significant obligation which has been placed on the local government sector to develop and implement its own adaptation and mitigation measures as well as the need to build capacity within the sector to engage effectively with climate change. </p>  <p>  I understand the proposed regional climate action offices will be operated by a lead local authority in four different regions, grouped according to shared climate change risks.  These offices are intended to provide a coherent and coordinated response to climate change at local level, both in terms of adaptation and mitigation and they will also be a key enabler in linking effectively with the new national planning framework.</p></reply>

The levy will be applied by planning authorities, commencing on 1 January 2019 in respect of sites which were vacant and on the vacant site register during the year 2018 and will subsequently be applied on an annual basis thereafter, as long as a site remains on the vacant site register in the preceding year.</p><p>Planning authorities are presently engaging in the necessary preparatory work, prior to the application of the levy with effect from January 2019 in respect of sites identified on their vacant site registers in 2018.As required under the Act, this includes the identification of specific vacant sites for entry on the register, the registered owners of the sites in question and undertaking site valuations of the registered sites.  </p><p>My Department does not maintain a central register of vacant sites as each local authority administers the vacant site register in respect of their functional area.  However, on foot of a recent review of the on-line vacant site registers across all local authority areas, I understand that there are collectively over 230 sites on the registers.In total, the inclusion of 49 of these sites on the local registers has been appealed to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, with 20 of these appeals having been decided, leaving 29 appeals currently on hand with the Board, as follows:<table><tr><th>Local Authority</th><th>Number of Appeals</th></tr><tr><td>Dublin City Council</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>Fingal County Council</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny County Council</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford City &amp;amp; County Council</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow County Council</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>Total:</td><td>29</td></tr></table></p><p>My Department continues to monitor and engage with local authorities in relation to the implementation of the vacant site levy and held a seminar with authorities on 8 November 2017 in this regard.</p><p>The purpose of the levy is to act as an incentive to the bringing forward of vacant underused sites for development, for residential or regeneration purposes.I would hope that as many sites as possible will be developed for these purposes, thereby avoiding liability to the levy.</p><p>As recently announced, it is proposed to increase the rate of levy from 3% to 7% of the market valuation of relevant sites with effect from January 2020 in respect of sites included on the local vacant site registers in 2019.  Legislative provision for this increase will be tabled by way of Seanad amendment to the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2016, which is presently at D&aacute;il Report Stage.</p></reply>

The retirement age of 55 years of age was introduced because of health and safety considerations related to the job.  Since the enactment of the Health, Safety and Welfare at Work Act 1989, underpinned by subsequent legislation, each fire authority, as an employer, has a statutory duty to avoid placing employees at risk.</p><p>A full time firefighter is statutorily required to retire at age 55 under the Public Service Superannuation (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004.  This retirement age is set at 55 due to the physically demanding nature of the fire-fighter role. </p><p>The retirement age for retained fire fighters is 55 with an extended period to age 58 subject to a formal application process including a compulsory medical assessment. </p><p>A collective agreement was reached between the Local Government Management Services Board and the trade unions involved, SIPTU and ATGWU, in November 2002.  This collective agreement provided,<i>inter alia</i>, for the appointment of an expert group which in turn would advise as to the retirement age for retained firefighters.  The Expert Group's Report on Retirement Age recommended that the retirement age for retained firefighters remain at 55, with provision for an annual extension, subject to medical assessment, up to 58 year of age.  Following the report of the expert group published in April 2003, a circular was issued by my Department in November 2003 setting out the age requirements in relation to retained firefighters in line with the expert report.</p><p>In general, any changes proposed by either management or unions are negotiated using the established industrial relations processes. In this regard, the matter of increasing the retirement age for firefighters was included as part of recent discussions on a wide range of issues at the Workplace Relations Commission, between the Local Government Management Agency, representing the employers, and SIPTU.</p><p>I understand that these discussions are at a preliminary stage and therefore I am unable to give an indication as to when these discussions will be completed or the likely outcome.</p></reply>

To qualify for HAP a household must first be deemed eligible for social housing support.  Eligibility for social housing support is based primarily on a household's income.  The Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011 prescribe maximum net income limits for each housing authority, in different bands according to the area, with income being defined and assessed according to a standard household means policy.</p>  <p>  The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band are based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country. The limits also reflect a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn and thereby promote sustainable communities.</p>  <p>  Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support.   The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources. </p>  <p>  However, as part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of the income eligibility limits for social housing supports, including HAP has commenced.  I expect the results of this review to be available for publication later this year.</p></reply>

Applicants for social housing support are assessed in relation to income, residency and current and alternative accommodation.  It is open to any person or household to apply to a housing authority for a social housing assessment for the purposes of qualifying for social housing support.</p>  <p>  Social housing applicants who are not Irish or UK nationals must meet additional criteria in order to satisfy the residency requirement for social housing support.

In 2017, my Department allocated &euro;1 million to local authorities from the Creative Ireland budget to enable them to develop their Culture and Creativity Action Plans and an associated programme of events and initiatives in each county.  This was bolstered by an additional &euro;1 million from the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.  This meant that each local authority received approximately &euro;64,000 each to implement their Culture and Creativity Plans for 2017.</p><p>In total, the plans listed over 750 local cultural projects, events and initiatives taking place nationwide in 2017 of which approximately 250 were funded through the enabling budget provided under the Creative Ireland Programme.</p><p>A key principle underpinning the Creative Ireland Programme is community empowerment and therefore each local authority decided themselves what events/projects they wished to include in their respective plans. It is therefore not possible to provide an exact breakdown of costs for each activity for every local authority.  However, this information -in accordance with normal departmental monitoring procedures and in line with the reporting requirements specific to this initiative - will be submitted by each local authority over the coming weeks.</p><p>A breakdown of the total allocation to the local authorities in tabular form is contained in the Creative Ireland Programme End Year Report 2017 which is available on the Creative Ireland website of my Department at <i><i></i></i>.  All 31 local plans can be accessed at <i><i></i></i>.</p><p>It should be noted that the allocation from my Department to each local authority will be doubled to &euro;2 million for 2018 to enable them commence the implementation of their long-term Culture and Creative Strategies due to be launched early next year.  As in 2017, this will be divided equally among each of the 31 Local Authorities.</p></reply>

These Directives aim to ensure the protection of habitats and species which have been selected for conservation within special areas of conservation and special protection areas.</p>  <p>  Significant efforts have been made by the State to resolve the issue of the protection of Ireland&rsquo;s raised bog special areas of conservation within the framework of the Habitats Directive. This has included intense and on-going engagement with turf cutting interests, the farming community, non-governmental organisations and with the European Commission, as well as the establishment of a long-term compensation scheme for affected turf cutters. </p>  <p>  The National Raised Bog Special Areas of Conservation Management Plan 2017-2022, published in December 2017, sets out how the raised bog special areas of conservation are to be managed, conserved and restored and how the needs of turf cutters are to be addressed, including exploring the options in terms of certain provisions of article 6 of the Habitats Directive. </p>  <p>  13,429 annual payments and 994 deliveries of turf have been made in respect of applications received under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme for raised bog special areas of conservation. 737 annual payments and a delivery of turf have been made to applicants from raised bog natural heritage areas under the scheme. In addition, 1,782 once-off incentive payments of &euro;500 have been made, of which 42 relate to natural heritage areas.</p>  <p>  The Review of Raised Bog Natural Heritage Area Network, published in January 2014, concluded that Ireland could more effectively achieve conservation of threatened raised bog habitat through focused protection and restoration of a reconfigured network. Arising from this review, the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill 2016 has been presented to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and is currently proceeding through the necessary stages in the Houses of the Oireachtas. Its purpose is to provide for the implementation of a reconfiguration of the natural heritage area network arising from the 2014 Review.</p>  <p>  Final resolution of all issues in relation to the protection of Ireland&rsquo;s protected raised bogs will only be brought about by everyone working together, within the law, with my Department and with the Peatlands Council, which was established for the purpose of ensuring the input from all stakeholders.</p></reply>

Strategic priorities include providing support for the international presentation of Irish artists and arts organisations, developing new and diverse international audiences and markets for Irish arts, and linking culture into the Government&rsquo;s international promotion strategy in tandem with other relevant Government Agencies. </p><p>Culture Ireland has extensive international reach, supporting Irish artists at hundreds of international events every year and is seeking to continually increase this number. In 2017 Culture Ireland supported 450 events with Irish artists in 50 countries, reaching a live audience of 3.5 million and 7 million online.  Many of these artists achieved high profile awards and critical recognition. </p><p>In 2018 Culture Ireland will present Culture Ireland GB18, a year-long programme of Irish arts in Great Britain. The year-long programme aims to showcase Irish artistic excellence in partnership with significant UK institutions, venues and festivals, to build on the unique cultural relationship between the two countries and expand the reach of Irish culture to new audiences. </p><p>Great Britain is a key market for Ireland in terms of tourism, trade and investment promotion and the GB18 programme enables us our culture to continue to serve as  a unique door-opener for Ireland and Irish business, and an effective means of articulating our values at a time of change in Ireland's  wider relationship with Britain.</p></reply>

Implementation of the Programme is underpinned by three essential operating principles - collaboration and communication, community empowerment and internationalisation.</p>  <p>  The programme is based on five pillars which are: enabling the creative potential of every child, enabling creativity in every community, investing in our creative and cultural infrastructure, establishing Ireland as a centre of excellence in media production and unifying our global reputation. Implementation of the Programme, while under the aegis of my Department, will, where the opportunity arises, primarily be through, and in collaboration with existing agencies, local authorities, cultural institutions, State bodies and other cultural partners.  Pillars 2, 3 and 4 of the Programme are of particular relevance to the economic development of communities. </p>  <p>  My Department, together with its other partners, is now in the process of finalising plans to further the implementation of the Creative Ireland Programme for 2018 and beyond in respect of the five pillars of the programme, working collaboratively with colleagues across Government and in the sector.</p></reply>

Later this year, my Department will be inviting applications from candidate sites for inclusion on the upcoming 2020 Tentative List. Inclusion on list will ultimately be determined by whether a site meets relevant criteria relating, inter alia, to outstanding universal value, availability of adequate site management and protection resources, and the extent of stakeholder engagement and support for the bid.</p>  <p>  I am aware of the Valentia Cable Station supporters' interest in getting on to the 2020 list as a transboundary proposal with its counterpart at Heart's Content, Newfoundland, Canada.  The cable stations at Valentia and Heart's Content are at opposite ends of the first transatlantic telegraph system and a potential bid for World Heritage status would centre on the unique history and relationship between the two sites.</p>  <p>  My Department is in contact with its Canadian counterpart, Parks Canada, in relation to the Valentia proposal and has informed them that Ireland will support the Valentia bid once it meets the qualifying criteria.</p>  <p>  I understand that a considerable amount of preparatory work has already been done locally on the Valentia proposal which will assist in the preparation of the Tentative List application later in the year. My Department will also provide such advice and guidance as it can support Kerry County Council as the lead organisation at local level.</p></reply>
