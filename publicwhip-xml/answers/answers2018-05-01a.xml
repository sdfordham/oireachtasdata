There is much work to be done, but we have made good progress.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department, along with colleagues in Pobal, have been working hard to develop the legal, technical and administrative infrastructure for the new Affordable Childcare Scheme.  This scheme will provide financial support for parents, establish a sustainable platform for investment in the childcare sector for decades to come and, crucially, allow us to continue to invest in giving our children the best start in life. </p>  <p>  Before Christmas the Childcare Support Bill 2017, the legal framework for the scheme, was published.  It passed all stages in the D&aacute;il in the first quarter of this year.  I was very pleased with the positive, cross party support it received and I want to thank Deputies again for their valuable input which strengthened the legislation. The Bill has now completed Second Stage in the Seanad and will commence Committee Stage this Thursday.  </p>  <p>  Alongside the Childcare Support Bill, intensive work is ongoing on the drafting of supporting regulations for the scheme and on regulations to provide, for the first time, for the registration of school-age childcare providers.  The latter regulations will ensure that all school-age childcare services are registered with Tusla prior to the introduction of the Affordable Childcare Scheme and can participate in the scheme from the outset.   </p>  <p>  With regard to the scheme's supporting IT infrastructure, good progress is also being made.  In January I published a Request for Tenders for the development of a new IT system and received these at the end of March. They are now being evaluated in line with strict procurement rules, and I anticipate finalisation of the process very shortly.  The introduction of the scheme is dependent on this new IT system. As soon as a contract is awarded to a successful bidder and a timeframe agreed for the completion of the system, I hope to be in a position to confirm and communicate an official launch date for the Scheme. </p>  <p>  I have often emphasised that we need to take the time to put a rigorous, carefully planned IT system in place. We are continuing this process and making good progress. It is vital to an effective, user-friendly scheme for parents and providers, and I want to get it right.</p>  <p>  The ACS is an ambitious project, which my Department is working on intensively. I will be happy to keep the Deputy, and this House, informed of developments as we move ahead.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-05-01a.17.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018050100072#WRC01000"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 37, 38 and 45 together.</p><p>I acknowledge that the recruitment and retention of social workers is one of the biggest challenges for Tusla with only 200-250 graduating per year in a very competitive labour market. </p><p>Working in child protection is one of the most difficult areas, and I fully appreciate the dedication of all professionals in Tusla who undertake this extremely important task.</p><p>I am fully supportive of Tusla&rsquo;s proactive approach to recruiting, supporting and retaining staff across all grades. In support of this I have provided for a significant increase in Tusla&rsquo;s funding allocation with an increase of &euro;40.6m in 2018 and a total increase of &euro;144m since its establishment in 2014. </p><p>Given this level of funding, Tusla expects to increase its total workforce by approximately 422 resulting in a total workforce of 4118 whole time equivalents (WTE) by the end of 2018. </p><p>Also, given the current limited availability of social work graduates, Tusla expects at least 45 of these staff to be additional social workers. There will also be proactive recruitment of grades such as social care and clerical administration staff to support social workers to ensure that they can focus on their core tasks.</p><p>To support Tusla&rsquo;s ambitious recruitment targets it launched its 2018 graduate recruitment campaign last September. This campaign is currently open for applications with interviews expected to commence in May/June 2018. </p><p>The campaign included Northern Ireland and Scotland. Continuing <i>Tusla Recruit&rsquo;s</i>proactive approach of previous years all campuses were visited and over 200 students registered their interest. <i>Tusla Recruit</i>maintains on-going communications with the registered students and partners them through the application and CORU registration process with a view to making Tusla an employer of choice. </p><p>Tusla also has an on-going rolling campaign to attract existing social workers who have a particular interest in working in child protection. This campaign is also designed to appeal to social workers who may currently be living abroad and wish to move to Ireland. </p><p>I have also asked Tusla to develop a <i>Multi-annual Strategic Workforce Plan</i>to identify the future composition of Tusla&rsquo;s workforce so as to deliver on Tusla&rsquo;s priorities. I expect the Plan to encompass a range of activities aimed at addressing Tusla&rsquo;s short, medium and long term needs and to manage the current challenges Tusla faces recruiting social workers. </p><p>The Plan will also form the basis of engaging with key stakeholders such as the education sector to ensure a sustainable supply of social workers in the future.</p><p>With regard to current vacancies, Tusla advises that 207 social work posts are at various stages of the recruitment process. </p><p>Of the 207 posts:</p><p>- 26 are Senior Social Work Practitioner;</p><p>- 15 are Principal Social Worker;</p><p>- 17 are Social Worker - Team Leader and</p><p>- 149 are Social Worker.</p><p>Tusla publish their Performance and Activity data on a monthly basis and I can inform you that as of the end of February 2018 there were 4,756 cases awaiting allocation to a social worker, out of 24,366 open cases. </p><p>Of the total number of unallocated cases, 898 were categorised as High Priority. An unallocated case relates to a case about a child  that is deemed to need a social work assessment,  but has not yet been  allocated to a social worker. </p><p>It is important to note that all urgent and emergency cases receive immediate attention by the local duty social work team. The majority of unallocated cases are new referrals. However, they may also include children living with their families who had an allocated social worker, or to a child in care, where there may be a social work vacancy.</p><p>Tusla is working hard to maintain and improve its retention rate. In March 2018 it had a total staff turnover rate of 5.6%. The current social worker turnover rate is 8.1% compared to 9.4% in March 2017. A low turnover rate is clearly in the interest of vulnerable children and families and it is also more efficient for the organisation as a whole. </p><p>Tusla values its staff and in acknowledgement of this it has established a Retention Steering Group to plan and implement an integrated approach to retention throughout the organisation.  Tusla's Health, Wellbeing and Employee Assistance Programmehas a range of services available to staff. The Programme has completed a staff survey on retention and its findings will inform part of a new Strategy on Retention for Tusla.</p><p>Tusla is also placing an increased focus on well-being by actively encouraging employees to adopt behaviours that will improve their life and improve workforce morale. </p><p>Furthermore as part of its retention strategy, Tusla has also implemented an extensive Continuous Professional Development Strategyin recent years. The strategy commits all social workers to having a minimum of 21 hours for personal development plans and 10 hours for engaging in continuous profession development. </p><p>Tusla has also introduced a National Transfer Policyto facilitate staff wishing to relocate to another part of the country within Tusla&rsquo;s services while ensuring that the Agency retains their valuable expertise.  </p><p>Other supports for Tusla staff include rehabilitation services to support staff that are out of work due to injury or illness and a Critical Incident Stress Management Teamto support teams and individuals in the event of any traumatic event.</p></reply>

Eligible children can only be registered during a snapshot period and can avail of up to &euro;145 per week.</p><p>The Community Childcare Subvention Plus (CCSP)does likewise but is available from privately owned childcare services also, and eligible children can be registered at any time during the year. </p><p>The Training and Employment Childcare (TEC) Programmessupport parents on eligible training courses, as well as categories of parents returning to work.</p><p>In September 2017, I introduced a new universal subsidy, which is available for all children aged between 6 months and 3 years of age in registered childcare. This amounts to &euro;1040 per annum.</p><p>The provision of childcare services for children under 2 poses extra demands for providers in that,  for example, they require higher staff ratios. </p><p>I continue to seek to support providers in this regard and build additional capacity nationally via a number of initiatives. These include higher subsidy levels under the forthcoming Affordable Childcare Scheme, and capital grants in 2018 to build extra capacity for this age group.</p></reply>

For some children, it is in their interest that this contact happens in a supervised, neutral, child friendly venue.</p><p>The evaluation report on Family Child Contact Centres, to which the Deputy refers, recommended an integrated response by my Department and the Department of Justice and Equality. It is my belief that this is the best approach to progress the recommendations.  </p><p>I am pleased to advise that officials from my Department have come together with colleagues in the Department of Justice and Equality to jointly look at the implementation of the recommendations of the report.</p><p>It was agreed that my Department will draft the Terms of Reference for the Working Group, in consultation with the Department of Justice and Equality. We expect to advance this matter shortly.</p><p>In preparation for the work of the Group, officials in my Department have carried out a scoping exercise to establish both the demand for these services, and also the current provision of family contact services.  </p><p>To date this has included: </p><p>- a review of evaluations and recommendations relating to family contact services;</p><p>- a comparison of the family contact services available internationally; </p><p>- a review of the services currently offered at Family Resource Centres; </p><p>- the collation of information from other service providers; and </p><p>- consultation with individuals who are/have been working directly in  family contact services. </p><p>I am confident that the inter-departmental group is the best approach to look at how a family contact centre service will work for families in this country. </p><p>As I said at my recent meeting with Time4Us, a Galway organisation providing family contact services, the group has the potential to develop a robust  model which could be used by many other services.</p></reply>

This survey showed that the average cost of childcare in Ireland rose by 4% or &euro;7 per week last year, which is well below the &euro;20 per week on offer through the newly introduced universal subsidy and significantly lower than the &euro;145 per week, per child, subventions to families most in need.  Fees for part-time childcare actually showed a slight reduction.</p>  <p>  On becoming Minister for Children and Youth Affairs I committed to improving the accessibility, affordability and quality of childcare in Ireland and although there is much yet to be achieved, I am happy with significant progress made on these fronts over the past year. </p>  <p>  The universal subsidy, worth up to &euro;1,040 per year for children under three in registered childcare is now being availed of by 35,588 children. Targeted supports for lower income families are being availed of by 38,680 children.  My Department has exceeded our target of a total of 70,000 children by 4,268 and these numbers will continue to rise until the end of the program year. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, I understand that any rise in childcare fees is a very significant matter for families and that childcare fees continue to represent far too high a proportion of family income. The new subsidies introduced last September will remain in place until we complete the development of the new Affordable Childcare Scheme which, as I have briefed Deputies on previously, should be introduced in 2019. This scheme will mark a major milestone in making childcare more affordable. </p>  <p>  I remain strongly committed to continuing to make childcare more affordable for families whilst at the same time supporting the early years workforce to provide a high quality service.</p></reply>

The upper age ECCE requirement is that the child must not reach 5 years and 6 months before the end of the programme year.</p>  <p>  Some children will not be able to commence their ECCE in September 2018 as they will not have reached the age of 2 years and 8 months on or before 31st August 2018. However, they will be able to commence ECCE in September 2019, and continue for a further year from September 2020, commencing school in September 2021. Parents of children born around this time of the year may prefer for their children to start school at 4 rather than 5. These parents may therefore choose to avail of 1 year of ECCE only. However, it is important to note that this is a parental choice and that the overall policy change has ensured that two programme years are available to all children, an improvement on the system as it has operated to date.  </p>  <p>  This extension to ECCE from September 2018 refines the development introduced last year, whereby three intake dates were adopted, and will increase the duration of each registered child on ECCE from a current average of 61 weeks, to an entitlement to 76 weeks (two programme years). This enhancement delivers fully on a commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government that is good for children, families and Early Years providers.</p>  <p>  This new measure will also address the situation where there was a wide range in the number of preschool weeks a child could avail of &ndash; between 61 and 88 weeks &ndash; and will ensure a programme that is equitable for all children.</p>  <p>  The number of entry points will revert to one at the beginning of the new programme year (September, 2018). One enrolment period at the start of the pre-school year will help streamline the administration process and will make it easier for childcare providers to operate and budget for the programme year. This will also make it easier for parents to secure places on the ECCE programme for their children. </p>  <p>  At a broader level, I announced on the 6th December 2017 that I have put a pause on the decision to remove the ECCE over age exemption so that further consultation with parents of children with disabilities can occur. Until the consultation is complete, and both the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the Department of Education and Skills have time to consider its findings, the overage exemption will continue to be available.</p></reply>

Work is ongoing to address these matters. While we remain confident that these issues will be addressed, I can also confirm that the Department has approached the Department of Public Expenditure in order to put in place an interim solution.</p>  <p>  This interim solution consists of advising Tusla that, while discussions continue between the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in relation to including foster carers under the General Indemnity Scheme operated by the State Claims Agency, no approval for overall indemnification can be provided at this stage. However, both Departments are aware of the critical importance of this matter and are committed to ensuring that every foster parent is offered an indemnity on an individual basis where required.  </p>  <p>  In this regard, any such individual indemnification would be on an ex-gratia basis and, as such, indemnification would be made available voluntarily and outside any strict legal obligation. This is a temporary measure to address immediate individual cases while the overall indemnification issues are being resolved.</p>  <p>  It might also be noted that the Irish Foster Care Association have been appraised of matters as they stand and my officials have undertaken to keep the Association informed as to progress in the matter.</p></reply>

I would be delighted to update you on positive progress in preparing the new Affordable Childcare Scheme. </p>  <p>  Officials from my Department, along with colleagues in Pobal, have been working hard to develop the legal, technical and administrative infrastructure for the new Affordable Childcare Scheme.  This scheme will provide financial support for parents, establish a sustainable platform for investment in the childcare sector for decades to come and- crucially- allow us to continue to invest in giving our children the best start in life. </p>  <p>  As you know, the Childcare Support Bill passed all stages in the D&aacute;il in the first quarter of this year. I was delighted with the positive, cross party support it received and want to thank you again for your valuable input. The Bill has now completed Second Stage in the Seanad and will commence Committee Stage this Thursday.  </p>  <p>  Alongside the Childcare Support Bill, intensive work is ongoing on the drafting of supporting regulations for the scheme and on regulations to provide, for the first time, for the registration of school-age childcare providers.  The latter regulations will ensure that all school-age childcare services are registered with Tusla prior to the introduction of the Affordable Childcare Scheme and can participate in the scheme from the outset.   </p>  <p>  With regard to the scheme's supporting IT infrastructure, good progress is being made. In January I published a Request for Tenders for the development of a new IT system and an evaluation of tenders received is currently coming to a conclusion. The introduction of the scheme is dependent on this new IT system.  As such, as soon as a contract is awarded to a successful bidder and a timeframe agreed for the completion of the system, I hope to be in a position to confirm and communicate an official launch date for the Affordable Childcare Scheme. For planning and procurement purposes, we have an indicative estimated timeframe of late May/ June 2019 for opening the system to applications, with financial supports flowing from September 2019.  </p>  <p>  Work is also ongoing on the administrative and communication elements of the scheme.  In particular, specialist expertise has been procured to support the detailed development of a robust governance framework for the scheme.  A high-level Communications and Engagement Strategy was published in February and a training needs analysis is underway at present. Both of these provide the starting point for significant work in preparing timely and user-friendly information, resources and supports for parents, providers and other stakeholders.  In tandem with the development of these resources, I am also committed to ongoing consultation and engagement with all stakeholders in the run-up to the introduction of the scheme.  </p>  <p>  As you know, ACS is ambitious in scale and complex in its design but I am delighted that we are achieving our milestones in its development and confident of the lasting impact it will have once launched. </p>  <p>  Finally, in order to fast-track some of the benefits of the new scheme, last September I introduced a new universal subsidy, worth up to &euro;1,040 per year for children under three in registered childcare, alongside significantly increased subsidies under existing targeted schemes. I can confirm to you that these supports have now reached the families of over 74,000 children, well in excess of our original estimate of 70,000. Of these 74,000 children, over 35,500 are receiving the new universal subsidy, while a further 38,700 are receiving up to &euro;145 per week towards the cost of their childcare. I have confirmed that these supports will remain in place until the Affordable Childcare Scheme goes live.</p></reply>

Officials in my Department are participating in this process.</p>  <p>  While my department does not have a lead responsibility in this area, it does play an important role in a wider range of actions across a number of departments.</p>  <p>  Child protection is our mission. The Children First Act 2015 places a number of statutory obligations on organisations providing relevant services to children. These obligations include a requirement to keep children safe from harm while they are availing of the service; a requirement to carry out a risk assessment, and, a requirement to prepare a child safeguarding statement which sets out the policies and procedures which are in place to mitigate these risks. </p>  <p>  In this regard, my Department plans to amend the Children First Guidance to include a specific reference to the need to consider online safety in the completion of a Child Safeguarding Statement. </p>  <p>  I am also concerned that the voices of children and young people will be heard and acted upon when we make decisions on internet safety. My Department undertakes and supports consultation and participation processes. This includes developing structures to enable such participation in decision making by children and young people. Such structures include both D&aacute;il na n&Oacute;g and Comhairle na n&Oacute;g. </p>  <p>  Earlier this year, the Deputy was on the Oireachtas Committee of Children and Young People that met with groups of young people from Counties Clare and Wicklow Comhairle na n&Oacute;g on this important subject. It is only through engagement with young people that we can find the solutions that will work.</p>  <p>  I am aware that the Oireachtas Committee also considered the recommendations of the Internet Content Governance Advisory Group. Responsibility to advance proposals in relation to that Group's recommendations rests with the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and the Environment.</p></reply>

On December 11 2017, I commenced the remaining provisions of the Children First Act, 2015. This saw the introduction of mandatory reporting of child protection concerns. The Children First Act 2015 places a statutory obligation on persons, who have been identified by virtue of their position, training, qualifications and experience, to make reports of concerns of harm, above a defined threshold, to Tusla, The Child and Family Agency. All institutions providing services to children  who are not in the company of their parents  are now legislatively bound to undertake a risk assessment which should inform their Child Safeguarding Statement. </p><p>The additional resources secured for Tusla in 2018 will assist in meeting key priorities. The additional investment allows Tusla to recruit a range of additional staff to respond to areas of key  risk, and to meet increased demand for services. The Deputy will be aware that referrals to Tusla are increasing on a year on year basis, and I anticipate there may be a  further  increase in referrals following the introduction of mandatory reporting. This increase in funding is also enabling the further management of unallocated cases. To improve the overall functioning of Child Protection Teams, Tusla is in the process of recruiting more administrative staff as well as social work practitioners. </p><p>Tusla has  introduced an international evidenced  practice methodology called &ldquo;Signs of Safety&rdquo; which should help to improve the depth and quality of the screening and assessments of referrals. </p><p>The first consideration when receiving a referral is the immediate safety of the child. All referrals to the Social Work Service of Children and Family Services are screened on the day they are received irrespective of the source.</p><p>The criteria for a member of the public or a mandated person to consider a referral of a child protection or welfare concern is also detailed in Children First National Guidance and in Tusla's Children First Guide for the Reporting of Child Welfare and Protection Concerns. </p><p>Cases awaiting allocation fell by almost 17% to 4,756 compared to the same time period as last year.</p><p>Please find outlined in the following tables a breakdown of cases awaiting allocation by priority level and time waiting.

The conflict, which is now in its eighth year, has cost up to 500,000 lives.  Over 13 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance inside Syria, including close to 3 million people trapped in besieged and hard-to-reach areas.  Over 6 million people are displaced internally, and a further 5.5 million have fled to neighbouring countries and the wider region.  There have been repeated breaches of international humanitarian and human rights law.  There have been numerous instances of denial and diversion of humanitarian aid, the use of medieval &lsquo;starve or surrender&rsquo; siege tactics and the use of chemical weapons.  I am aware of the correspondence to which the Deputy refers and I fully concur with the sentiment of concern expressed by the petitioners about this appalling situation.</p>  <p>  Ireland and the EU fully support the efforts of UN Special Envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura to bring about an end to the conflict.  The EU provides direct assistance to the UN-led Geneva peace talks and has launched, in coordination with the UN, an initiative to identify common political ground with key actors from the region.  We also support a broad range of measures to ensure full legal accountability for all war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Syria. Ireland has been a strong and consistent donor to the humanitarian response to the crisis.</p>  <p>  I attended the Second Brussels Conference &ldquo;Supporting Syria and the Region&rdquo; on the 24th of April. I met with key EU and UN humanitarian and political partners - including EU Commissioner Christos Stylianides and United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi - to discuss further humanitarian assistance and highlight our commitment to a peaceful resolution of the conflict.</p>  <p>  At the conference, Ireland reiterated its support for the UN-led efforts to bring about a resolution of the conflict.  Ireland also called on the international community, particularly those with influence on the parties to the conflict, to redouble efforts to ensure a ceasefire and unimpeded humanitarian access.  Ireland condemned the repeated breaches of international law which have taken place in Syria, and called for full legal accountability for all war crimes and crimes against humanity, particularly the use of chemical weapons.</p>  <p>  Ireland also pledged a further &euro;25 million in humanitarian support in 2018 - maintaining the same level of assistance as provided last year.  This brings Ireland&rsquo;s support since 2012 to over &euro;100 million &ndash; our largest ever response to a single crisis.</p></reply>

This represents Ireland&rsquo;s largest ever engagement with a humanitarian crisis.</p>  <p>  Our funding provides supports to those in need inside Syria as well as Syrian refugees and vulnerable host communities in the region.  We work with UN, Red Cross and NGO partners to ensure that our funding reaches the most vulnerable.  These partners provide humanitarian supplies and urgently needed health, education, water and sanitation services, as well as implementing measures to protect women, children and vulnerable families.</p>  <p>  Through our membership of the EU, Ireland also supports the EU&rsquo;s humanitarian response in Syria.  The EU and its member states are the single biggest donor to the Syria crisis having mobilised over &euro;10.6 billion in humanitarian, stabilisation and resilience assistance since 2012.</p>  <p>  In addition, through the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF), to which Ireland is the eighth largest donor, a total of over $100m has been provided to Syria.</p>  <p>  At the recent Second Brussels Conference "Supporting the Future of Syria and the Region" on the 24-25 April, Ireland pledged &euro;25 million in humanitarian assistance in response to the Syria crisis for 2018 and made a commitment to multi-annual support beyond 2018.  We have begun to fulfil our 2018 pledge, having provided funding of over &euro;15 million to UN and Red Cross partners for response inside Syria and in the broader region.  We are currently preparing an additional disbursement to NGO partners, and funding to other humanitarian partners is also under consideration.</p>  <p>  The Government remains strongly committed to supporting those affected by the Syria crisis.  We will continue to monitor the situation and provide funding where needs are greatest.  We will also continue to advocate within the EU and UN for a political solution to the crisis.</p></reply>

The ruling is being fully considered by the Government.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that, although the Court dismissed the Government&rsquo;s application for a revision, nothing in the ruling alters the Court&rsquo;s original 1978 judgment that the men suffered inhuman and degrading treatment, in breach of Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>  <p>  The question of seeking a referral of the ruling to the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights is a decision for the Government, taking account of advice from the Attorney General.  There is a window of three months after the judgment by the Court for a referral.</p>  <p>  No decision has yet been reached on this matter.  The ruling needs to be considered fully and carefully and that is now being done.</p>  <p>  My thoughts at this time are with the men who were subjected to the appalling treatment and who have had to deal with long-lasting adverse effects in the decades since.  I met with a group of the men and close family members of some of the other victims and their legal representatives on 24 April, in order to hear their views and experience.</p>  <p>  They are understandably disappointed with the ruling by the European Court of Human Rights in March.  I listened very carefully to their views on this ruling, and those of their legal representatives.  I also noted that any further information or views that they may wish to provide as the Government considers the ruling by the European Court of Human Rights should be provided to my Department as soon as possible and this will be considered fully.</p>  <p>  My Department has maintained contact on an ongoing basis with the legal representatives of the men and their families as appropriate, since the Government submitted an application in 2014 for a revision of the 1978 Ireland v UK case.  This contact will be maintained in the period ahead.</p></reply>

The provision of scholarship opportunities for Palestinian students to study in Ireland is an important dimension of our overall support.</p><p>In January this year, the T&aacute;naiste announced an increase of &euro;200,000 in scholarship funding for Palestinian students.  Funding is being ring-fenced to create further opportunities for Palestinian students to undertake Masters level courses in our Higher Education Institutions in Ireland.  This is a first step towards scaling up a scholarship programme for Palestinian students over the next five years.  The programme is intended to focus on courses which will enhance labour market skills and, in particular, in the areas identified by the Palestinian Authority where there is a deficit.  The programme will be accessible to groups across Palestinian society with the relevant undergraduate qualifications, enhancing opportunities for women and providing opportunities to other previously under-represented groups.</p><p>Ireland has long been a strong supporter of the development of modern and quality education for all Palestinians in conjunction with our partners, the Palestinian Authority and the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees.  This scholarship programme will be another tangible expression of that support.</p><p>Furthermore, there is an existing Irish Aid Fellowship Training Programme (FTP), which has been part of Ireland&rsquo;s broad programme of support to capacity building in Partner countries for over 40 years and which aims to address capacity deficits that hinder the attainment of long-term development goals through the training and development of key individuals.  Fellowships are also offered at Masters&rsquo; level and Palestinian students can also apply for a scholarship under this programme to study in Ireland.  Successful Palestinian fellows have studied a variety of different courses including human rights law and global health at Higher Level Institutions in Ireland.  Information on the FTP can be found on Irish Aid&rsquo;s Fellowship website at <i>www.irishaidfellowships.ie</i>.</p></reply>

We discuss both Irish specific issues as well as those on the discussion with regard to the EU&rsquo;s future relationship with the UK, which are also vitally important for Ireland.  I am also kept informed of the progress of domestic preparations for Brexit.  As this is a fast moving process, I often discuss the negotiations with my officials between those meetings, and I am in any case kept continually briefed.</p>  <p>  Co-ordination of the whole-of-Government response to Brexit is being taken forward through the cross-Departmental coordination structures chaired by my Department, including the Inter-Departmental Group on the EU and Brexit, which meets on a fortnightly basis.</p>  <p>  Contingency planning for a no-deal or worst-case outcome in March 2019, bringing together the detailed work being undertaken by individual Ministers and their Departments on issues within their policy remits, is very well advanced.  Its focus is on the immediate regulatory and operational challenges which would result from such an outcome.  It assumes a trading relationship based on the default WTO rules, but also examines the possible effects on many other areas of concern.  This work is therefore providing baseline scenarios for the impact of Brexit across all sectors, which can then be adapted as appropriate in light of developments in the EU-UK negotiations, including in regard to transition arrangements and the future relationship.  It also takes account of the planning being undertaken at EU level by the new Commission Preparedness Unit, which is issuing information notes aimed at different business sectors.</p>  <p>  Before the summer the Government will finalise a paper, building on that published in May 2017, on our approach to the negotiations and our latest assessment of the economic and sectorial challenges posed by Brexit and our responses to them.</p></reply>

It is the responsibility of the bank, as the employer, to identify any benefits to staff to which section 122(3) TCA 1997 applies and to compute and pay the tax liability.</p>  <p>  I am informed by Revenue that its approach to the possible application of section 122(3) in the case of loan restructurings, involving the full or partial write-down for an employee or former employee, is that where non-preferential loan(s) are/were originally advanced by a bank to the employee in the normal course of business and the bank can show to Revenue&rsquo;s satisfaction that the outcome of the write-down would be the same for that employee or former employee as it would be for a non-employee customer of the bank, then no liability to income tax will arise in respect of the write-off of the non-preferential loan(s).</p>  <p>  If the employee or former employee has only preferential loans from the bank then section 122(3) TCA 1997 applies to give rise to a tax liability on the full amount written off by the bank.</p>  <p>  If there are a number of loans, including preferential loans, then, regardless of the order of the write-off, the amount written off has to be first set against the amount of any preferential loan(s) outstanding and any tax liability arising on the preferential loan(s), so treated as written off first, has to be paid in accordance with section 122(3) TCA 1997.</p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that it has outlined its approach in this matter to individual banks which have been identified as potentially impacted.</p></reply>

It provides for relief from tax on the profits earned from the exploitation of patents, copyrighted software and IP for small companies, provided that IP was developed through R&amp;D carried out in Ireland.</p>  <p>  The potential cost of the KDB was arrived at by looking at the taxable profits of the companies who claimed the R&amp;D tax credit in 2014 and who it was considered might be in a position to claim the KDB.  For example, certain categories of companies (such as multinational-owned companies) were excluded as it was considered they would not have the required structures to facilitate claims under the KDB.</p>  <p>  I am informed by Revenue that, to date, not more than 10 companies have claimed relief under the KDB and that the tax cost of these claims to date is no more than &euro;5 million.  However, these figures are as yet preliminary due to the deadlines which apply for submission of claims.  Relief under the KDB was introduced for accounting periods ending on or after 1 January 2016.  Therefore, the first corporation tax returns in which relief could be claimed were due for filing up to 23 September 2017.  However, as the regime is complex and a company must make an irrevocable election into the KDB, the legislation provided that companies had a 24-month period in which to make their claim for relief.  Therefore, most companies have until the end of this year to submit their claims for their 2016 accounting periods.</p>  <p>  At the outset it was anticipated that companies would make full use of that 24-month period to make a decision on whether or not to elect into the KDB.  Therefore, it is expected that the figures relating to the companies who have already claimed the relief are preliminary and should not be used to assess the impact of the relief until they are finalised after December this year.</p>  <p>  With regard to the Deputy's question as to measures taken to increase uptake of the KDB, I am advised by Revenue that they have published extensive guidance on the KDB.  They have presented at a number of R&amp;D industry events to help ensure a consistency of approach in applying the legislation, and also ensure that uncertainties on the application of the KDB are identified at an early stage and addressed.  As taxpayers encounter uncertainty in the application of the rules &ndash; particularly those around the tracking and tracing documentation requirements &ndash; Revenue will develop updated examples to bring clarity to issues identified.</p>  <p>  I also understand that a number of State Agencies are actively engaged in promoting the use of the KDB.  The IDA and Enterprise Ireland have presented at a number of R&amp;D industry events.  Additionally, since its introduction, the IDA have promoted the KDB to existing and new clients.</p></reply>

I have no role in the day to day workings of the office. </p><p>As the Deputy will be aware the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO) was established on 1 January 2018 under the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman Act 2017.  I have been advised by the Ombudsman that Section 18 of the Act sets out how the Ombudsman shall co-operate with the regulatory authorities with a view to ensuring that this Act operates in a way that contributes to promoting the best interests of consumers and actual or potential beneficiaries of financial or pension services and to the efficient and effective handling of complaints.</p><p>The Act provides that the Ombudsman may make recommendations to the Central Bank in relation to measures that the Bank might take in order to effectively deal with persistent patterns of complaints.  A similar provision existed in the legislation which underpinned the FSPO&rsquo;s precursor body, the Financial Services Ombudsman (FSO), and the FSO and the Central Bank agreed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) which sets out the terms under which both parties give effect to these provisions.  The MoU has not yet been updated to reflect the establishment of the FSPO on 1 January 2018, however, the original MoU continues to operate and is available on the FSPO website.  </p><p>While the MoU provides for regular and routine information sharing, it also provides for specific information sharing whereby the FSPO will provide the Central Bank with detailed and specific information relating to a complaint (or complaints) for its general consideration in the following instances: </p><p>1. Where the circumstances of the case appear to call into question:</p><p>- a financial service provider&rsquo;s fitness and probity; </p><p>- or whether any specified person may not be a fit and proper person to carry on a relevant function; </p><p>- or if it appears that a criminal offence or a serious regulatory contravention has occurred. </p><p>2. If it appears that a complaint or a series of complaints may give rise or are giving rise to issues of regulatory relevance to the Central Bank (whether or not the financial service provider has itself drawn the issues to the attention of the Bank). </p><p>3. If it appears that it would be desirable and appropriate for the Central Bank to consider using one or more of its regulatory tools, including the exercise of its investigative and other enforcement powers, the making of rules or the giving of guidance to financial service providers. </p><p>4. In response to a request from the Central Bank where it is, or is contemplating, using any of its regulatory tools in relation to the subject matter of the request. </p><p>5. Where it appears that a regulated entity has failed to comply with an award, determination, or direction (or equivalent thereof) made by an Ombudsman, or a court order in respect thereof. </p><p>6. Where it appears that a financial service provider has, without reasonable excuse, failed to comply with a requirement to provide information or to produce documents to an Ombudsman. </p><p>7. If it appears that it may be necessary for the Central Bank to exercise its powers to address shortcomings in a financial service provider&rsquo;s complaint handling procedures. </p><p>The following table outlines the number of cases in which the FSPO/FSO reported potential systemic issues to the Central Bank in each of the past four years and to date in 2018.</p><p><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Number of cases involving Potentially Systemic Issues</th></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>4 </td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>2018</td><td>0</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The Central Bank expects all firms to have adequate systems and controls in place and where issues that impact customers arise they should be addressed and rectified urgently, particularly as customers are increasingly using and becoming dependent on online and mobile banking services. In this regard, the Central Bank expects firms to communicate clearly and promptly with affected customers when a technical incident occurs, including details of the impacted service, details of alternative access to services and an undertaking that identifiable loss will be remediated.

In addition, on-site inspections are a tool used by the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) in the supervision of banks and such on-site inspections are used in the area of IT risk. On-site inspections are carried out in line with the SSM supervisory processes, procedures, methodologies and manuals. </p>  <p>  In response to the establishment of the SSM which assumed supervisory responsibility for Eurozone banks in November 2014, the Central Bank created a three divisional banking supervisory function with responsibility for:</p>  <p>  - Supervision;</p>  <p>  - Inspections and</p>  <p>  - Analytics. </p>  <p>  The Inspections Division is responsible for conducting in-depth investigations of risks, risk controls and governance frameworks within Credit Institutions. These inspections cover risks such as Credit, Liquidity, Capital, Operational, IT, Business Model and Internal Governance. The inspections are performed by dedicated inspection teams at the premises of the Credit Institution.  It is the responsibility of individual institutions to ensure that they have the necessary resources, including information systems, to deliver on their strategy.

Neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept.

I understand that the coverage relates in particular to the portion of Net Premium Income which these costs represent. </p><p>The Central Bank has informed me that, audited insurance company returns to the Central Bank of Ireland show that total industry management expenses and commission have remained relatively stable over the last ten years. </p><p>Insurance Ireland has separately noted that the net premium income which has been referenced does not include the costs of reinsurance protection.  In other words, it represents premium income retained by insurers following payments made for such reinsurance protection.  This means that where the cost of reinsurance protection increases, net premium income by definition falls.  Insurance Ireland has indicated that this is what has actually happened in some years and that a comparison is being made in such years between a reduced net premium income and a level of management expenses that have not risen in absolute terms and have remained largely the same since 2005.  This they say is demonstrated by Central Bank Statistics on motor management expenses which in 2005 amounted to &euro;224 million and in 2015 were &euro;216 million.  They say that the effect of this comparison is to create an apparent spike in management expenses in recent times, which does not reflect the reality of the situation. </p><p>Insurance Ireland has also pointed out that reinsurance is an essential risk management tool for insurers as it involves the transfer of claims risk to a reinsurer.  There is a cost associated with this as such reinsurance entities must also meet their own regulatory solvency requirements and therefore they charge the appropriate reinsurance premium to cover such risks, which an insurer must pay.</p><p>In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s second query, the Central Bank has informed me, that information on management expenses was included in the Solvency I returns that were submitted to the Central Bank. These audited returns formed the basis of the blue book. Those returns were based on the insurance companies&rsquo; financial statements, which were audited, and are available from the Companies Office. </p><p>It should be noted that information on management expenses is also available in the Solvency II returns submitted to the Central Bank. Interested parties seeking data at company level can find such data in publically available reports which are required of all insurance undertakings under the Solvency II regime.  These reports are known as the Solvency and Financial Condition Reports (SFCRs).  The SFCRs include a detailed narrative report on the insurance undertaking coupled with key quantitative reporting templates that contain premiums, claims, expenses, technical provisions, solvency and other information.  All SFCRs for 2016 are made available by the Central Bank in a dedicated SFCR repository which can be accessed at</p><p><i>.</i></p><p>Whilst the Central Bank monitors the levels of management expenses at a company and industry level it has no role in the control of those expenses.</p><p>It is worth noting also that one of the recommendations of the Cost of Insurance Working Group linked to increasing transparency in the insurance sector is the publication of key aggregated metrics on claims costs and trends within the market, as an interim measure prior to the establishment of the National Claims Database.  In July of last year, I published the first of these reports on the Department&rsquo;s website: . That Report provides information on the expenditure of a large portion of the insurance industry for the years 2011 to 2016 as a percentage of gross premium income.  In that regard, the data provided by insurers indicates that combined commissions and other operating expenses reduced from 18.9% to 17.4% during that time. </p><p>In conclusion, the reports in the media demonstrate the need for the National Claims Information Database.  It is clear that there is a need to be able to collect data related to the income and expenditure of insurers, in addition to the data linked to the costs associated with claims.  Having such information will assist policyholders and researchers to better understand the drivers of the costs of insurance.  This is one of the central policy aims of the National Claims Information Database and I think the publication of such data at industry level will facilitate an understanding into how particular expenses may or may not have an impact on the overall cost of insurance.</p></reply>

A number of responses were received from industry and business groups.  My officials have been reviewing the content of these responses as they relate to the drafting of the Bill.  As part of the process of finalising the Bill, the Department is assessing the responses with regard to the validity of the concerns expressed against the overall policy aim of the legislation.  </p><p>The Deputy will recall that the policy aim of the Database is to enable policymakers to better understand the factors that influence the cost of insurance.  This will require the collection of information linked to other factors such as the income and costs of insurers, and the settlement channels used to settle claims and the associated costs.  On the basis of its review of the responses to date, the Department does not anticipate that substantive amendments will be required at this stage and therefore it is not anticipated to give rise to any delay in the finalisation and publication of the Bill.  </p><p>In that regard, the Bill is included in the Government Legislative Programme on the list of Priority Legislation for publication this session and based on drafting progress to date I anticipate being in a position to publish the Bill before the summer recess. </p><p>A consultation will also have to take place with the European Central Bank on the Bill once it is published.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, it will take a certain amount of time following publication of the Bill, for it to pass through the Houses of the Oireachtas however I am hopeful that with the cooperation of all parties in the Houses, the Bill can be considered and approved expeditiously.</p></reply>

However, we have always been clear that we are fully committed to ensuring that recovery of the alleged Apple State aid takes place and have committed significant resources to ensuring this is achieved. Given the unprecedented scale of the recovery amount, this has been a complex technical and legal process.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, on 24 April the Escrow Framework Deed which sets out the detailed legal agreement regarding the recovery of the alleged State aid was signed by me on behalf of the Government and also signed by Apple. This is a significant milestone with regard to the commencement of the recovery of the alleged State aid. This followed recent announcements that the Bank of New York Mellon London Branch has been selected as the preferred tenderer for the provision of escrow agency and custodian services to the fund and Amundi, BlackRock Investment Management (UK) Limited and Goldman Sachs Asset Management International have been selected as preferred tenderers for the provision of investment management services.</p>  <p>  The signing of the Escrow Framework Deed now allows for the final processes to be completed including the formal appointment of the Escrow Agent/Custodian and the Investment Managers which in turn activates the process for the collection of the alleged State aid. </p>  <p>  It is anticipated that the funds will flow into the escrow account in significant tranches and I expect that the full recovery will be effected by the end of Q3 2018. </p>  <p>  In general, I should say that the costs associated with the fund are a liability of the fund. The arrangements in the Escrow Framework Deed include the agreement that all claims of ownership and access to these vast sums of money is suspended until the European Courts have concluded proceedings that the Government and Apple have brought.</p></reply>

Apple therefore must be deprived of the benefit of the alleged aid, which the Commission have estimated will amount to approximately &euro;13 billion plus interest, as set out in EU Regulations on the recovery of State Aid.  These sums will be placed into an escrow fund with the proceeds being released only when there has been a final determination in the European Courts over the validity of the Commission&rsquo;s Decision.</p>  <p>  Following consultation with the Central Statistics Office and Eurostat, it has been confirmed that there will be no impact on the General Government balance and that there will be no fiscal impact for the period in which the funds are in escrow.  </p>  <p>  This is because Apple and the Government are challenging the Commission&rsquo;s Decision of August 2016 before the European Courts, and it could be several years before this is ultimately resolved. The basis for this is set out in the European System of Accounts 2010 (ESA 2010), Paragraph 20.189 which states:</p>  <p>When a court of justice rules that compensation must be paid, or a transaction reversed, resulting from or related to past events, the time of recording of the expenditure or revenue is when the claimants have an automatic and incontrovertible right for a given amount that can be individually determined, and when it is unlikely that claimants will fail requesting their due. When a court of justice merely sets a principle of compensation, or when the claims must be reviewed for eligibility and in relation to determination of the amount by administrative services, expenditure or revenue is recorded as soon as the value of the obligation is reliably determined.</p>  <p>  As a result, the amount and timing are not recognised until a final judgement before the European courts.</p></reply>

Rent arising from a property situated in Ireland is considered Irish source income and is therefore within the charge to Irish income tax notwithstanding that the individual is tax resident in the UK.</p><p>Relief for double taxation is provided for under the terms of the Ireland/UK Double Taxation Agreement.  Article 7 of this agreement grants taxing rights to Ireland in respect of income from immovable property.  Therefore, under the terms of this agreement, Ireland may tax this income notwithstanding that it is also taxed in the UK.  </p><p>In general, the country in which an individual is considered a resident <i>of </i>for the purposes of the Ireland/UK treaty will grant relief for any element of double taxation.  On the basis that the individual is a resident <i>of</i>the UK, the question of relief for Irish tax paid is a matter for the UK tax authorities.  Any credit for Irish tax which is allowed in the UK cannot exceed the UK tax due on that same income.  </p></reply>

However, notwithstanding this, my officials have been in contact with Insurance Ireland in respect of this matter and were informed that Insurance Ireland is aware of four providers for this type of insurance at present.</p>  <p>  In relation to the issue of whether a claim made on a condition in a particular year will render it uninsurable in future years, it is important to be aware that neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products. </p>  <p>  My understanding is that when making their individual decisions on whether to offer pet insurance cover and what terms to apply, insurers, as with any other type of non-life product, use a combination of rating factors.  Such factors include the relevant claims record, and the insurer&rsquo;s own past claims experience generally.</p></reply>

In the State PCP finance is underwritten by standard financial institutions, manufacturer banks, and special purpose institutions which exclusively offer motor finance. </p>  <p>  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) undertook the first comprehensive study of the Personal Contract Plans (PCP) market in the State. As part of its study the CCPC issued detailed questionnaires to all the financial institutions that underwrite PCP finance in the State. This allowed the CCPC to compile, for the first time, primary data relating to the number and value of PCP finance contracts issued. The report was published on the 6 March 2018 and is available at www.ccpc.ie. </p>  <p>  The Deputy may also be aware that an Economic Letter on this area was published by the Central Bank on 28 March. This provides further comprehensive data on the PCP market in Ireland, where at the end 2017 PCP finance accounted for 43%(&euro;1.2 billion) of car-related bank debt. The Economic Letter is available at www.centralbank.ie.</p>  <p>  My officials will examine these publications and give careful consideration to what actions, if any, would be appropriate.</p>  <p>  On the issue more generally, the Central Bank regulates financial services institutions as set out under legislation but does not regulate individual financial products. Under current legislation (Consumer Credit Act 1995), the CCPC has responsibility for authorising and supervising the credit intermediaries which typically sell PCP contracts to consumers, including garages and retailers. The CCPC provides licenses to credit intermediaries and keeps an online list of credit intermediaries holding a valid authorisation which is available on the CCPC website www.ccpc.ie.</p>  <p>  The CCPC also deals with complaints about the advertising of Credit Agreements, issuing Pawnbrokers licenses and the advertising of car finance on credit intermediary websites and in the media. The CCPC&rsquo;s remit is limited to authorisation, as opposed to having a regulatory role for PCPs. It also has a specific statutory remit to provide personal finance information and education to assist consumers.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to keep financial legislation relating to consumer protection under review to ensure consumers are protected. However, the Consumer Credit Act 1995 and the CCPC itself both come under the aegis of  my colleague the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation.  </p></reply>

The following extra protections are given to a female worker in respect of pregnancy related illnesses: </p><p>(i) An employee who is absent for a pregnancy related illness will receive a minimum of half pay during the pregnancy related illness, regardless of whether she has exhausted her ordinary entitlement to paid sick leave. This means that a female employee will not be taken off pay while on pregnancy related sick leave.</p><p>(ii) Any pregnancy related sick leave taken at the half rate of pay will not be taken into account in  calculating entitlement to ordinary sick leave after the pregnancy.</p><p>(iii) The Critical Illness Protocol, which allows for an extended paid sick leave provides specifically for pregnancy-related illness. Where a pregnancy related illness is serious it will be covered by the CIP.  One of the criteria for awarding of CIP more generally is 10 consecutive days of hospitalisation, however, this requirement is reduced to 2 days for pregnancy related illness in accordance with Labour Court recommendation (ref: LCR 20667). </p><p>In these ways, the Public Service Management (Sick Leave) Regulations, S.I. 124 of 2014 recognise the distinct position of the pregnant worker and make provision for the protection of the health and welfare of such workers. The Regulations implement the principles of European law in relation to non-discrimination against pregnant workers.</p><p>The sick leave record of an individual needs to be kept for a minimum of four years as access to paid sick leave is determined on the basis of how much sick leave a person has taken over the previous four years. </p><p><b>Appendix A</b></p><p><b>Public Service Sick Leave Scheme</b></p><p>The new Public Service Sick Leave Scheme came into effect from 31st March 2014 for the generality of the Public Service. </p><p>The new provisions allow staff access to the following paid sick leave:</p><p>- maximum of 92 days on full pay in a rolling one year period;</p><p>- followed by a maximum of 91 days on half pay in a rolling one year period;</p><p>- subject to a maximum of 183 days paid sick leave in a rolling four year period.</p><p><b>Temporary Rehabilitation Remuneration</b></p><p>Temporary Rehabilitation Remuneration (TRR - previously Pension Rate of Pay) can be granted where an individual has exhausted the limits for sick pay provided there is a realistic prospect of that person returning to work. The maximum period for which TRR can be paid is 547 days under ordinary sick leave arrangements. </p><p><b>Critical Illness Protocol</b></p><p>In addition, in order to provide support for public service employees the new Critical Illness Protocol (CIP) was put in place as part the scheme. This allows an employee, who suffers a critical illness or serious physical injury, access to 12 months of paid sick leave on the same basis as the previous sick leave scheme (i.e. 183 days on full pay in a rolling one year period, followed by 182 days on half pay subject to a maximum of 365 days in a rolling four year period).  In such cases TRR is for also available for 12 months with a further possibility of 2 years depending on the severity of the illness.</p></reply>

Establishing the appropriate suitability criteria that are relevant and appropriate to a particular contract is, of course, a matter for the contracting authority concerned. This is because the contracting authority is in the best position to gauge the appropriate levels of financial capacity that are appropriate to the needs of that specific contract. Therefore, there are no centrally imposed requirements for a minimum turnover. Such requirements must logically be developed on a case by case basis with reference to the specific needs of the contract, balancing the risk of contractors failing to perform the contract with encouraging more competition.</p>  <p>  However, the Government recognises that the small and medium enterprise (SME) sector is very important to the economy and that public procurement can be a source of business for SMEs. In this regard, Government Policy, as set out in Circular 10/14: Initiatives to assist SMEs in Public Procurement issued by my Department, is aimed at facilitating greater participation of SMEs in public procurement opportunities.  In relation to suitability criteria, the circular stresses that public bodies must ensure that any criteria/turnover levels set by them should be both justifiable and proportionate to the needs of the contract and, a matter of general policy, should not for routine goods and services competitions set company turnover requirements at more than twice the estimated contract value. </p>  <p>  The Office of Government Procurement through its engagement with public bodies and SME representative bodies is ensuring that this message continues to be highlighted.</p></reply>

In effect, it is a form of procurement available to the public sector. </p>  <p>  There are a number of different PPP models which can be used, including:</p>  <p>  1. Projects financed by the private sector and remunerated by deferred annual payments (Unitary or Availability Payments) from the Exchequer e.g., Design, Build, Operate &amp;amp; Finance (DBOF); or Design, Build, Operate, Maintain and Finance (DBOMF);</p>  <p>  2. Projects partly or fully financed by the private sector and remunerated by user charges, mainly in the roads area (DBOF with a Concession to levy user charges for a period); and</p>  <p>  3. Projects funded from State Authorities own resources, mainly in the local authority area (e.g., Design, Build &amp;amp; Operate/Maintain). </p>  <p>  When referring to PPPs, we generally mean projects in category (a) or (b) above, whereby the asset is funded and constructed by the private partner, following which it is made available for public use and is paid for by the State and/or users over an extended period (typically 20-25 years), after which the asset comes into State ownership.  In the meantime, the PPP is regarded as &lsquo;off balance sheet&rsquo; from a General Government perspective, which means that the initial capital cost of the project does not impact on the General Government Balance (GGB) over the construction period, nor does the debt associated with the project impact on General Government Debt (GGD).  Rather, the cost of such projects is spread over the lifetime of the projects, by way of annual unitary payments. </p>  <p>  These are the projects that are reported on annually by my Department on the ppp.gov.ie website - on the basis that these are the PPP projects which have not been recorded on the balance sheet of the Government and so constitute a future contingent liability for the State.  Such contingent liabilities pose a potential risk for the Exchequer, in terms of a potential future GGB/GGD impact were they to be terminated and surrendered to the Exchequer earlier than anticipated, thus requiring a reclassification as on-balance sheet at that time.  For this reason, these contingent liabilities must be reported to Eurostat, via the Central Statistics Office, on an annual basis.  Accordingly, it is appropriate that such contingent liabilities associated with PPPs be carefully monitored and reported on.    </p>  <p>  On the other hand, the projects pursued under category (c) above have been fully funded by the Exchequer and are already classified as on-balance sheet in General Government terms.  Such projects are not generally regarded as &lsquo;classic&rsquo; PPPs and there are no contingent liabilities associated with them as there is no risk of a potential future GGB or GGD impact associated with such projects, since they are already on-balance sheet (unlike &lsquo;classic&rsquo; PPPs).  On this basis, we do not record these projects on the PPP.gov.ie website, nor do I propose to change this approach.   </p>  <p>  Since 1 January 2014, Irish Water now has statutory responsibility for all aspects of water services planning, delivery and operation at national, regional and local levels, and this included taking on responsibility for the water related &lsquo;PPPs&rsquo; from the local authorities.  Details of the PPP projects in the water area would therefore be available from Irish Water.   </p>  <p>  In relation to the PPP related expenditure that is provided for in the context of the multi-annual capital allocations now agreed for the period 2018 to 2022, my Department is in the process of producing a detailed breakdown of this information to be published soon.  </p>  <p>  Chapter 6 of the NDP included a section on the PPP review which stated that, in order to improve transparency in reporting on PPPs, a number of changes in the reporting arrangements for PPPs were recommended by the Review Group.  One of the improvements in reporting being introduced on foot of these recommendations is that the table published by my Department on the ppp.gov.ie website will, in future, include details of the PPP unitary payment charges for each individual project by year, until such time as the project is handed back by the PPP Company to the Sponsoring Authority.  Officials in my Department are currently compiling the required data in conjunction with the responsible Departments and it is expected that the new reporting arrangement will be in place and the data published on the PPP website soon.   </p>  <p>  These new arrangements will address the suggestion of the Parliamentary Budget Office that future PPP commitments be disaggregated and that clarity be provided on the amount of the total capital allocations for 2018-2021 that will be required to fund such commitments - but in respect of all future years and not just the period 2018-2021.</p></reply>

It is integrated into European Social Fund (ESF) programming as a dedicated priority axis within the ESF Programme for Employability, Inclusion and Learning 2014-2020 (PEIL).  The specific YEI allocation for Ireland of &euro;68m is matched by equal amounts from our ESF allocation and from the Exchequer, giving an overall allocation of &euro;204m.   </p>  <p>  All ESF activities, including YEI activities, are fully funded up-front by the Exchequer with the EU (ESF/YEI) funding being claimed in arrears.  While no payment application has been made to date to the Commission under the PEIL, it is expected that the funding will be fully drawn down.</p>  <p>  The ESF authorities must be designated in accordance with the EU regulations prior to making the first payment application.  This designation is based on the opinion of the Independent Audit Body (IAB) which must be satisfied across a range of criteria that systems are in place to allow the ESF authorities to perform their required functions.  These systems requirements include the provision of a computerised accounting and information system for EU funds to meet the 2014-2020 functionality requirements.  The final phase of the IT system went live at the end of March 2018.  The ESF authorities are engaging with the IAB and it is expected that designation will be completed in the coming weeks.  </p>  <p>  Preparations are underway for the submission of a first payment application to the Commission in Q3 2018. The European Commission has advised that the potential decommitment at end 2018 is &euro;127.7m, if not claimed in payment applications in the meantime.  The ESF authorities will ensure that sufficient payment applications are submitted to fully drawdown the EU funding allocations.</p></reply>

This scheme is additional to other capital funding schemes that are operated by the Department such as the additional accommodation scheme, Emergency Works scheme i.e. for projects of such urgency that they would prevent some or all of the school from opening, and Minor Works schemes.</p><p>The Summer Works Scheme (SWS) is a multi-annual Scheme.  Over 1,650 schools, nearly 50% of schools, applied for inclusion under the current round of the scheme which reflects a very high demand.  </p><p>To date, almost &euro;80 million has been approved under the current round of the Scheme, in respect of 635 school projects, 464 primary and 171 post-primary schools, for Gas, electrical upgrades, mechanical, sanitation and roof improvement works.  Details of the successful school applicants, are published on the Department's website <i>www.education.ie.</i></p><p>In relation to the Summer Works Scheme 2018, over &euro;25 million will be spent on summer works projects in 2018.  This expenditure will enable the remaining approved improvement works for 178 schools nationwide to be completed.  These works will be carried out by the schools themselves on a devolved basis mainly over the summer months, so the disruption to students, teachers and other school staff will be kept to a minimum.</p><p>Furthermore, the Department intends to engage with the relevant education partners in relation to giving schools a better lead-in period for planning and delivering projects under the summer works scheme from 2019 onwards.  While the Summer Works Scheme is hugely successful in enabling small scale refurbishment works to be done on a devolved basis, the Department considers that the operation of the scheme could be improved by providing a better lead-in period for schools rather than in Quarter 2 as in previous years.  This will also help ensure that works done under the Summer Works Scheme fit better with any wider refurbishment/energy retrofit plans that may be done at schools under the increased funding provided in the National Development Plan.  The engagement with education partners will commence shortly and will assist in developing a better timeline for the planning and delivery of summer works projects for 2019 onwards.</p></reply>

This decision is based on a recommendation contained within a professional assessment in consultation with the NCSE.</p><p>Students enrolling in specialised placements must have a report from a relevant professional or team of professionals stating that: </p><p>- S/he has a disability (in line with the designation of the special placement in question) and</p><p>- S/he has significant learning needs that require the support of a specialised setting and the reasons why this is the case.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible for organising and planning provision for children with Special Educational Needs, including the establishment of special classes in mainstream primary and post primary schools. </p><p>Since 2011, the NCSE has increased the number of special classes from 548 in 2011 to 1,304 for the 2017/18 school year. 1,048 of these are ASD special classes.</p><p>125 special schools also provide specialist education for those students with complex special educational needs, including students diagnosed with ASD.</p><p>This reflects the priority which the Government has put on helping children with Special Educational Needs to achieve their potential.</p><p>With regard to Co. Dublin in particular, there are 37 special schools and 218 special classes attached to mainstream schools. Of these, 18 are ASD early intervention classes, 124 are primary ASD classes and 36 are post primary ASD classes.  The number of ASD special classes in Co. Dublin have increased from 66 in 2011/2012 to 178 in 2017/2018.</p><p>The NCSE is aware of emerging need in Dublin from year to year, and where special provision, including special class provision, is required, it is planned and established to meet that need. This process is ongoing.</p><p>The NCSE has informed my Department that they intend to establish approx. 18 new ASD Special Classes in Co. Dublin for 2018/19 school year to meet currently identified need.</p><p>ASD special classes are resourced to cater for six pupils with complex educational needs arising from their diagnosis of autism and as such are staffed with a reduced PTR (6:1 Primary and 6:1.5 Post Primary) and two Special Needs Assistants.  Details of all special classes for children with special educational needs are available on <i>www.ncse.ie</i>in county order.</p><p>The enrolment of a child to a school is a matter, in the first instance, for the parents of the child and the Board of Management of a school.  My Department has no role in relation to processing applications for enrolment to schools and it does not maintain details of waiting lists in schools.</p><p>Where parents have been unsuccessful in enrolling their child in a school placement, for the 2018/19 school year, they should update their local SENO to inform the planning process.  Contact details are available on <i>www.ncse.ie</i>. </p><p>In the case of all new schools, it is general practice to include a Special Needs Unit (SNU) in the accommodation brief for new school buildings, unless local circumstances indicate that it will not be required.</p><p>The NCSE will continue to work with schools, parents, NEPS, health professionals and other staff who are involved in the provision of services in the area referred to by the Deputy for children with special educational needs, to ensure that each child has a placement appropriate to their needs for the 2018/19 school year.</p><p>The Deputy may be aware that during the Committee Stage debate of the School Admissions Bill, I outlined my intention to include a provision that will provide, based on reports and advice from the NCSE, a power for the Minister to require a school to open a special class or increase the number of special classes in schools identified by the NCSE.

Early intervention classes are intended to provide early support for children with ASD before they start school.  Following early intervention, children will attend a mainstream class unless there is professional guidance that they require a special class or a placement in a special school.</p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) which is an independent statutory body, plans and co-ordinates the provision of education and support services to children with special educational needs, in consultation with the relevant education partners and the Health Service Executive (HSE).</p>  <p>  The NCSE is aware of emerging need in North Dublin, and where special provision, including special class provision, is required, it is planned and established to meet that need.  This process is ongoing.</p>  <p>  The school referred to by the Deputy includes a 2 classroom Special Needs Unit (SNU) in which it currently operates 2 ASD Early Intervention classes.

The NCSE are currently engaging with the school in relation to establishing ASD primary classes for the forthcoming school year. </p>  <p>  The Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2016 was published on 6 July 2016.

The criteria for the allocation of posts are communicated to school managements annually and are available on the Department website.</p><p>The recruitment and appointment of teachers to fill teaching posts is a matter for the individual school authority, subject to procedures agreed under Section 24 (3) of the Education Act 1998 (as amended by the Education (Amendment) Act 2012). </p><p>There are currently 36,900 teachers allocated to our primary schools and approximately 29,550 teachers allocated in our post primary schools.  This is an increase of over 2,800 teachers compared to the 2016/17 school year and an increase of over 5,000 teachers compared to the 2015/16 school year.</p><p>In Budget 2018 an additional 1,280 teaching posts were announced effective from 01 September 2018 include: </p><p>- 545 teaching posts to cater for an estimated 8000 extra pupils in 2018.</p><p>- 305 posts to provide for a reduction in the primary staffing schedule from 27:1 to 26:1</p><p>- 230 new teachers in special classes and special schools</p><p>- 100 new Special Education teachers</p><p>- 100 new posts for Guidance </p><p>Overall it can be seen that the number of teaching posts allocated has increased between 2012 and the current school year by 4,729 posts at primary level and by 4,176 at post-primary level &ndash; a total of 8,905 additional posts. </p><p>These additional posts have been successfully filled and I am giving priority to ensuring that the supply of teachers is sufficient to meet the requirements of the system over the coming years.  In that regard, following consultation with the Irish Universities Association, I recently announced 380 additional places on post primary ITE programmes for 2018, including 100 at postgraduate level in the priority areas such as foreign languages and Irish.</p><p>I have also established the Teacher Supply Steering Group, which is chaired by the Secretary General of my Department.  The Group will consider the issues that impact on teacher supply, including: policies and arrangements for schools and teachers that impact on teacher mobility/supply; promotion of the teaching profession; initial teacher education policy, provision, funding and support; and data/research requirements. </p><p>The Group will oversee a programme of actions according to strict timelines and clear deliverables to meet important needs.  In undertaking its task, the Group will be cognisant of the requirement that all persons wishing to teach in recognised schools must meet the professional registration standards and criteria set by the Teaching Council, which is the professional regulatory body for the teaching.</p></reply>

I agreed with this recommendation on the basis that those applying for concessionary transport are making a conscious decision to do so, understand that they are not eligible for school transport and understand the implications of this choice at the time of application.</p><p>The report also recommended that the number of concessionary places should be reduced in line with the rules introduced in 2012 on a phased basis.

Concessionary transport is subject to a number of terms and conditions including the availability of spare seats on an existing service and payment of the annual charge. </p>  <p>  Seats for concessionary applicants are allocated after all eligible children have been accommodated on school transport services.  This exercise normally takes place after the closing date for receipt of payments.  Where seats are limited a random selection process is used.</p>  <p>  This case was also the subject of an appeal to the School Transport Appeals Board which has made a determination in the matter.  The parents have been notified of this decision.</p></reply>

This Budget represented the start of a major reinvestment in education, and the first phase of implementation of the Action Plan for Education, aimed at becoming the best education system in Europe within a decade. The budget provided for over 2,400 additional teaching posts for our primary and post primary schools for the 2017/18 school year. This included 680 additional teaching posts to meet demographic need and 100 additional posts for enhancements to guidance provision. </p>  <p>  Measures announced by my Department as part of Budgets 2016, 2017 and 2018 mean that 500 of the 600 guidance posts that were withdrawn in Budget 2012, will be restored to schools from September 2018.</p></reply>

Substantial research, analysis, consultation with service users and stakeholders, and piloting have gone in to the development of this model and all of the evidence points to the fact that this new system will deliver better outcomes for children.  </p><p>No school, has lost supports as a result of the implementation of the new model. In addition, no school received an allocation, for the support of pupils with complex needs, less than the allocation they received to support such pupils during the 2016/17 school year.  </p><p>An additional 900 teaching posts have been provided in the 2017/2018 school year to support the introduction of this new allocation model. The provision of an additional 900 teaching posts is a very significant investment in the provision of additional teaching support for pupils with special educational needs in our schools.  </p><p>The additional funding provided additional supports to over 1300 schools who identified as needing additional supports as a result of the new model while ensuring that no school received a reduced allocation.</p><p>For the 2017/18 school year to date, 13,306 additional special education teaching posts have been allocated, of which 13,281 have been allocated to schools, with 25 posts having been allocated to the NCSE to develop support services for schools. </p><p>Allocations may continue to be made to schools, where exceptional circumstances arise, in accordance with the review criteria set at <i>www.ncse.ie</i>.</p></reply>

Following a visit to the school by my Department's inspectorate, a devolved grant for two science labs was approved to the school for delivery. </p>  <p>  At the time, my Department advised the school that we were in the process of carrying out a nationwide demographic review of all school planning areas, including the area in which the school is located to determine where future need for primary and post-primary school places across the county is required.  </p>  <p>  Arising from this review, the Deputy will be aware that my Department announced recently plans to establish 42 new schools over the next 4 years.  The area where this school is located was one of the areas identified to establish a new post primary school in 2019.  This new school will provide additional school capacity to meet demographic need in the area. </p>  <p>  Following this announcement, my Department was in further contact with the school relating to the building project that has been approved.  The school indicated that they will revert to the Department with additional information and this is awaited. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that under the National Development Plan (NDP), increased funding has been provided for the school sector capital investment programme.  This funding allows for a continued focus on the provision of new permanent school places to keep pace with demographic demand and also provides for an additional focus on the refurbishment of existing school buildings to include the building and modernisation of PE facilities in primary and post-primary schools.</p></reply>

Each Code of Behaviour must be developed in accordance with the Education Welfare Service national guidelines, Developing a Code of Behaviour: Guidelines for Schools. </p>  <p>  Each school Code of Behaviour sets out the standards of behaviour that shall be observed by each student attending the school.  The Code of Behaviour must also set out any measures that the school may take when a student fails or refuses to observe those standards of behaviour.  The Code of Behaviour must also disclose the procedures to be followed before a student may be suspended or expelled from the school.  The School must implement fair procedures when considering whether to suspend or expel a student and the school is obliged to take special care to ensure that the fair procedures are accessible to students with special educational needs. </p>  <p>  Under Section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 an appeal can be made to the Secretary General of my Department where a board of management has decided to suspend a student for more than 20 school days in any school year or to permanently expel a student.  In relation to expulsion, a Section 29 appeal can only be taken where a board of management have formally decided to expel a student.  Under Section 24 of the Education Welfare Act, 2000 a board of management must inform the Education Welfare Service of Tusla when they intend to expel a student and the Board must allow 20 school days to pass before making a decision on whether to formally proceed with the expulsion.  </p>  <p>  Each Section 29 Appeals Committee conduct a full &lsquo;de novo&rsquo; appeal on the matter.  The Appeals Committee must come to their own independent determination on whether the suspension or expulsion is warranted.  In the appeal hearing, parents outline the grounds for their appeal and they are also allowed to question the school representatives through the Appeals Committee chairperson. </p>  <p>  Each Section 29 Appeals Committee is made up of three members.  One of these must be a serving school inspector and the other two members are normally retired former school principals and inspectors.  It is generally individuals with significant experience of working in the education sector, normally at a senior level in schools, who are appointed to serve as Appeal Committee members.  My Department also provides regular training to Section 29 Appeal Committee members. </p>  <p>  While I do not believe that the Section 29 Appeals process is inappropriate in the case of a suspension or expulsion of a student with special educational needs, I am proposing to make some changes to the Section 29 Appeals process as part of the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2016. These changes aim to make the Section 29 appeals process more efficient and less cumbersome for parents and schools.  Among the changes proposed, I am setting out in legislation for the first time the factors that a Section 29 Appeals Committee must have regard to when hearing and determining an appeal in relation to suspension or expulsion.</p></reply>

However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has informed me that a total of 170 minors, persons under the age of 18, were brought into Wardship from 2008 to 2017.</p><p><table><tr><th>Year </th><th>Number of persons under 18 brought into Wardship</th></tr><tr><td>2008</td><td>16 </td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>10 </td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>13 </td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>14 </td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>19 </td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>20 </td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>12 </td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>19 </td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>21</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>26 </td></tr></table></p><p>The Courts Service has also informed me that there are a number of reasons why it might be necessary to take a person under 18 years of age into Wardship.  The most common situation is where the minor has been awarded substantial damages by a Court and has special housing and/or care needs. </p><p>While the needs of each ward are different, all wards under a legal disability are therefore vulnerable persons.  The Wards of Court Office, under the direction of President of the High Court, takes its responsibility to protect the person and property of every ward seriously, ensuring that the ward&rsquo;s assets are protected and appropriately invested, approving expenditure on the ward&rsquo;s behalf, dealing with the ward&rsquo;s committee or guardian (usually a family member) to ensure that the ward&rsquo;s personal needs are met, dealing with proposals for sale, purchase or adaptation of accommodation for the ward&rsquo;s benefit, liaising with healthcare professionals and drafting proposals concerning the person and property of the ward for the President of the High Court to help and support the ward.</p></reply>

The Policing Authority assumed responsibility for undertaking these competitions on 1 January 2017 and, coinciding with that date, the eligibility criteria were extended to include any member of the PSNI not below the rank of inspector who has served not less than 2 years in that rank.  Previously, they were confined to those in the rank immediately below.  The 2005 Act also provides for the secondment from the PSNI to certain ranks in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for a period not exceeding 3 years. </p>  <p>  Also of relevance is the statutory provision for former members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to be re-appointed to the organisation.  The most recent applications in this respect concern a number of former members who departed to serve in police services in Australia and have gained valuable skills and experience from that service and wish to re-join An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  Individuals with appropriate policing experience and qualifications gained in other jurisdictions may also be suitable for appointment to various civilian roles available within the Garda organisation.  Having regard to the Government's aim of 20% of the Garda workforce comprising civilians by 2021 it can be expected that these opportunities will increase.</p>  <p>  I am very keen to explore how further opportunities can be created to open up entry routes at all levels and in line with the recommendations of the Garda Inspectorate report &lsquo;Changing Policing in Ireland&rsquo;.  In this regard my predecessor requested the Inspectorate in October 2016 to examine options for opening up entry routes into An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at all levels and report back with recommendations.  Those options could include, for example, fast track entry for policing professionals from other jurisdictions at the lower ranks and the targeted intake of experienced skilled police officers at the senior ranks.  The report will also include an examination of practice in other jurisdictions.  I have been advised by the Garda Inspectorate that the report is in the final review stages and will be provided to me shortly.</p></reply>

I am assured by the Commissioner that following completion of this competition the needs of all Garda Divisions including the Wexford Division will be fully considered when determining the allocation of Sergeants and Inspectors.

The meeting was attended by officials from the Departments of Justice and Equality; Transport, Tourism and Sport; Housing, Planning and the Environment; and Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht; An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; the Road Safety Authority; and the Revenue Commissioners.  My Department also met separately with a representative from Dublin City Council on 23 April. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, a multi-agency approach is required to tackle this anti-social issue effectively.  The purpose of the cross-sectoral meeting was to ascertain whether there are additional legislative or other solutions, which can assist in dealing with this the misuse of scramblers and quad bikes more comprehensively, with a view to determining responsibility and timeframes for implementation of solutions identified.</p>  <p>  I am advised that the meeting took account of a range of perspectives on the misuse of scramblers and quad bikes, and also considered the experiences currently being encountered in tackling this matter.</p>  <p>  By way of next steps, legal advice will be sought by my Department from the Attorney General's Office in relation to the interpretation of various pieces of legislation identified at the meeting to determine whether any legislative amendments are necessary to assist in curbing anti-social activity insofar as scramblers and quad bikes are concerned. </p>  <p>  My officials also intend to consult further with local authorities in the context of the positive engagement fostered by local authorities with local communities, examples of which include community and youth-centred projects, such as the Dunsink Horse Project and the Mulhuddart Motocross Club.  The experiences of local authorities involved in these and other projects will be very informative to my Department in terms of assessing the contribution that such approaches can make to reducing the misuse of these vehicles.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will also be aware, an important element of this issue is the misuse of scramblers and quad bikes by children.  I would emphasise that the supply of mechanically propelled vehicles to persons under 16 and 17 (depending on the vehicle) constitute offences under accordance with Section 30 of the Road Traffic Act 2004.  In this regard, I am advised that the Road Safety Authority (RSA) intends to run a safety campaign later this year with the aim of discouraging those who may consider purchasing scramblers or quad bikes as Christmas presents for minors.  I might add that the RSA targets road safety awareness campaigns at young people throughout the school curriculum. </p>  <p>  I remain committed to actively supporting any positive actions that can be pursued to counteract the serious public safety issues associated with the misuse of scramblers and quad bikes.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.</p><p>I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that, as of the 31 March 2018, the latest date for which figures are available, the strength of the Galway Division was 575. There are also 31 Garda Reserves and 55 Garda civilian staff attached to the Galway Division.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.</p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal. </p><p>Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just under 1,800 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide.  22 members of this cohort have been assigned to the Galway Division. Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 &ndash; a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016. </p><p>I am pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track.  This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College; some 400 of whom have already done so. In total, 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year, some 200 of whom attested last month.  Further, Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, are on track to reach 14,000 by the end of this year.</p><p>In addition, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties.  There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training in 2018. </p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Division, including the Galway Division.</p><p>In so far as the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute; is concerned, this is a matter for the Commissioner.  I am assured by the Commissioner that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of resources.  However, it is important to keep in mind that newly attested Garda&iacute; have a further 16 months of practical and classroom based training to complete in order to receive their BA in Applied Policing.  To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required training and development structures and resources in place, including trained Garda tutors and access to a permanently appointed supervisory Sergeant who is thoroughly familiar with their responsibilities under the training programme.</p><p>I am advised by the Commissioner that due to the moratorium on recruitment there were no attestations in 2014.

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.</p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that the Garda strength of the Dublin Metropolitan (DMR) Divisions on 31 March 2018, the latest date for which figures are available, was 3,443 with 165 Garda Reserves and 264 Garda civilian staff attached to the Division.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.</p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal.</p><p>Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just under 1,800 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, of whom 831 or 46% have been assigned to the D.M.R. Divisions.  I am pleased to say that Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 - an increase of over 600 since the end of 2016.</p><p>I am pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track.  This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College; some 400 of whom have already done so.  In total, 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year, some 200 of whom attested last month.  Further, Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, are on track to reach 14,000 by the end of this year.</p><p>In addition, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties.  There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training in 2018.</p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division, including the DMR Divisions.</p><p>The information requested by the Deputy in relation to the number of Garda&iacute; assigned to each Garda Station in the DMR in 2017 and on 31 March 2018, that latest date for which figures are currently available, is as set out in the following tables.</p><p><table><tr><th colspan="4"><div><b>D.M.R.

This is the most substantial change to the US tax code in 30 years.  These reforms include a reduction in the US corporate tax rate and a move to a territorial system.</p><p>It is important that we continuously monitor the situation as companies and Governments around the world analyse the implications that may arise from what are complex changes.  It is not possible to say at the moment what, if any, the impact might be for Ireland.  My officials and I, as well as the IDA, remain in regular contact with companies and with colleagues across Government as the international taxation environment evolves.</p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s corporation tax regime will continue to be competitive while also offering long-term certainty to international business.  Our regime is underpinned by substance. <i>Enterprise 2025 Renewed </i>reaffirms our focus on export-led growth that is underpinned by innovation, talent and investments in place-making.  We cannot predict the future, but we are taking action to deepen resilience across our enterprise base.  We will continue as a country to be anticipatory and adaptive to global challenges.</p><p>Our Corporation Tax regime, whilst important, is only one element of Ireland&rsquo;s value proposition for FDI.  Business location decisions are informed by a range of factors.  Access to the EU market is, and will remain, a key factor in attracting FDI from the US and elsewhere.  Other key factors involved in attracting and maintaining FDI here include:</p><p>- Talent: we have a talented workforce that is hardworking, flexible and adaptable to change and a first-class education system that helps nurture the future talent required.</p><p>- Innovation: we have developed leading edge capabilities in R&amp;amp;D, have a supportive regime for innovation and continuously work with enterprises to gain more investment in high value added research, development and innovation activities.</p><p>- We have a proven track record of delivery for enterprise and it is easy to do business here.</p><p>- We are English speaking yet can service over 140 languages from Ireland which greatly assists ICT and Financial Services companies in particular.</p><p>- Through Project Ireland 2040, the National Planning Framework and National Development Plan, we will focus coordinated investments to ensure that we offer a range of compelling, dynamic and competitive locations for investment throughout Ireland.</p><p>I will remain alert and responsive to any changes in the US or global tax environment working with colleagues across Government.</p></reply>

I am also aware that the Central Bank published an Economic Letter &ldquo;An overview of the Irish PCP market&rdquo; in recent weeks.</p>  <p>  The CCPC&rsquo;s report made a number of recommendations, including to the Department of Finance and the Central Bank.  These include a call for PCP agreements to be brought within the scope of the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code, thus mirroring the protections afforded to consumers when they take out other forms of credit.</p>  <p>  Under the current regulatory framework, those arranging PCP products are not required to check the affordability or suitability of the consumer before selling them a PCP product.  This contrasts with the requirements placed upon finance providers when selling other financial products, for example when a consumer takes out a loan to buy a car.  While the majority of the financial institutions that offer PCP finance are already regulated by the Central Bank, the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code does not currently apply to hire purchase (HP) products or variants thereof such as PCPs.</p>  <p>  I understand that the Central Bank publishes car finance data, which contains information on PCP contract numbers and PCP lending amounts.  This data is contained in Table A.19 of the Credit and Banking Statistics. Data is currently available for the period between 2012 and December 2017 and I understand that the Central Bank is currently developing a regular publication and reporting of this which will begin in Q3 2018.</p>  <p>  I am aware that the recommendations set out in the CCPC&rsquo;s report are currently under consideration by the Department of Finance and the Central Bank.</p>  <p>  A credit intermediary can arrange or offer to arrange a PCP for a consumer.  The CCPC is responsible, under the Consumer Credit Act 1995, for the authorisation of credit intermediaries, who arrange financial accommodations for consumers to fund the purchase of goods such as cars, electronics or &ldquo;white goods&rdquo;.  The CCPC licenses credit intermediaries and keeps an online register of credit intermediaries holding a valid authorisation.  The CCPC also deals with complaints about the advertising of credit agreements.  However, the CCPC&rsquo;s remit, derived from the Consumer Credit Act 1995, is limited to this licensing role, as opposed to a more complex and robust supervisory or regulatory role for PCPs.</p>  <p>  My Department will give careful consideration to the recommendations and findings in both reports and will continue to engage with officials from the Department of Finance in this regard.</p></reply>

The LEOs can also offer advice and guidance in areas such as Local Authority rates, public procurement and other regulations affecting business.</p><p>There are a range of supports available from the LEOs to assist start-ups. The LEOs can offer direct grant aid to microenterprises (10 employees or fewer) in the manufacturing and internationally traded services sectors which, over time, have the potential to develop into strong export entities. These include feasibility grants (investigating the potential of a business idea) and priming grants (to part-fund a start-up). In 2017, almost &euro;6.5 million in priming grants was approved for 294 new LEO clients across the country. It should be noted that the LEOs do not provide direct grant-aid to areas such as retail, personal services, local professional services, construction/local building services, as it may give rise to the displacement of existing businesses). </p><p>The LEOs may be able to offer &lsquo;soft&rsquo; supports in the form of training, such as a Start Your Own Business (SYOB) course, or assign a mentor to work with the business proposer.

Funding has been provided to support extension of the existing cath lab operating hours to 12 weekly sessions per week, or by 20%, as recommended in the Herity Report. Recruitment efforts to support this service extension are ongoing.</p>  <p>  In the interim, a mobile cath lab service has been provided.  The mobile cath lab was initially deployed in October 2017 and last week I directed that it should stay in place for a further number of weeks to allow time for UHW to complete recruitment of the additional staff required for the service extension to the existing cath lab. </p>  <p>  A modular cath lab has also been proposed, as an interim solution pending the outcome of the National Review of Specialist Cardiac Services, and the Department of Health is currently examining this proposal at my request.</p>  <p>  A national review of specialist cardiac services is underway, which aims to achieve optimal patient outcomes at population level with particular emphasis on the safety, quality and sustainability of the services that patients receive by establishing the need for an optimal configuration of a national adult cardiac service.  In terms of scope, the National Review will cover scheduled and unscheduled hospital-based services for the diagnosis and treatment of cardiac disease in adults.  The Steering Group for the review held its first meeting on 31 January last.  As set out in the National Development Plan 2018-2027, investment in cardiac catheterisation laboratories and other cardiac services infrastructure nationally will be informed by the outcome of the National Review.</p></reply>

This framework sets out for the first time a methodology for calculating the staffing requirement and skill mix needed in our specialist medical and surgical wards in adult hospitals.</p>  <p>  The framework was developed based on international research, consultation with key stakeholders and was piloted in three hospitals.  Results for the pilots showed significant benefits for both patients and staff.  Benefits for patients included reduced length of stay, increased quality of care and increased satisfaction with the care received.  Staff reported an increase in job satisfaction and reduced absenteeism with a corresponding reduction in agency costs.  </p>  <p>  The next step is  to develop a national implementation plan for incremental roll out across our hospitals.  While it will determine the whole time equivalent of nurses and care assistants required, the unique point about the framework is that it is underpinned by the assessment of individual patient need, monitoring patient outcomes, staff and patient experience as well as assessment of required nursing hours.  Therefore accurate costings will only become available when the implementation plan is developed.</p></reply>

That evidence base does not exist for the aerosol generated from e-cigarettes.  However, individual organisations/companies are free to introduce an e-cigarette free policy if they so choose.</p>  <p>  The European Union (Manufacture, Presentation and Sale of Tobacco and Related Products) Regulations 2016 (SI No. 271 of 2016) does not place restrictions on the number of retail outlets selling these products.  It does however, set the requirements for e-cigarettes and refill containers which include quality and safety, labelling and advertising. </p>  <p>  The Government approved the drafting of the General Scheme of a Bill to provide for the introduction of a licensing system and other measures in relation to tobacco products and electronic non-medicinal nicotine delivery systems (NMNDS), including e-cigarettes.  The proposed legislation will introduce an annual licensing system for the sale of  electronic cigarettes and other non-medicinal nicotine delivery systems.  The legislation will also prohibit the sale of NMNDS by persons under 18 years of age and to persons under 18 years of age.  The drafting of the General scheme is ongoing.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to monitor the emerging research on these products so as to inform decisions around any future additional regulation in this area.</p></reply>

The Strategy will be implemented on a phased basis and this work is being led by the National Women and Infants Health Programme. The Programme's Implementation Plan for the Strategy includes a number of actions to facilitate the provision by all maternity hospitals/units of dating and anomaly scans to all pregnant women.</p>  <p>  Indeed, the issue of anomaly scanning is a matter of priority for the NWIHP and additional funding provided to the Programme for 2018 will facilitate the recruitment of the 28 additional sonographers required to provide 100% access to such a service.  Pending the recruitment and necessary training processes, the Programme will continue to work with the six Hospital Groups to assist in increasing access to anomaly scans. In this context, it is expected that the establishment of Maternity Networks across Hospital Groups will assist in the development of a sustainable service model that ensures that all women can access anomaly scans.  </p>  <p>  In relation to the specific query raised concerning Cavan General Hospital, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly.</p></reply>

It made its first report to Government in May 2017, which informed negotiations on a successor to the Lansdowne Road Agreement.  While the evidence collected by the Commission suggested that there are no significant recruitment difficulties across the public service vocational streams, it found evidence of some recruitment and retention issues in certain specific areas of the public service. These include certain areas of the health sector (including nurses and midwives) and the Defence Forces, as well as senior executive and professional posts in the civil service.</p>  <p>  It suggested that &lsquo;a more comprehensive examination of underlying difficulties&rsquo; could take place where &lsquo;such difficulties are clearly evident&rsquo;. The Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020, which was ratified by the PNA, provides for such an examination to take place. The aim of the next phase of work by the Public Service Pay Commission is to determine to what extent, if any, issues relating to the recruitment and retention of staff exist within certain sectors of the public service. </p>  <p>  The Public Service Pay Commission is taking a modular approach. The first module is looking at health grades - including nurses and midwives. Their report is expected in June and I look forward to reading its findings.</p></reply>

Further planning to progress investment in this new facility will now be undertaken, including full evaluation of local capacity and infrastructural needs and a framework for decision-making on the optimal location from a clinical and population needs perspective. </p>  <p>  It is important to recognise that the National Development Plan is a long-term plan which provides for a large number of health developments across the country, including both national programmes and individual projects, across acute, primary and social care. We must ensure that we carefully plan the use of this capital funding so as to meet the population needs and achieve value for money. Health capital projects and programmes currently underway will continue. As is to be expected with a ten year plan, many proposals, including the new hospital in Cork, are at an early stage and will require to progress through appraisal, planning, design and tender before a firm location, timeline or funding required can be established.</p></reply>

They are designed to maximise a child&rsquo;s quality of life and developmental opportunities while also helping to keep children out of hospital as much as possible.  </p>  <p>  The in loco parentis rule reflects the fact that PHCPs are intended to serve as a clinical support and is in place to ensure that a second person will be present in the event of an acute emergency such as respiratory arrest, decanuation of a tracheostomy or status epileptus. </p>  <p>  I acknowledge the cross-party concerns raised about the operation of the loco parentis provision and recognise that respite can be an issue for parents of children with complex medical needs.  Indeed, the matter is already being examined as part of the Quality Assurance Process for PHCPs that was commenced by the HSE in 2017. This process will inform how PHCPs should be delivered, including the operation of the in loco parentis provision. </p>  <p>  Many parents have already contributed to the Quality Assurance Process, and further engagement will take place in the coming weeks and months. Furthermore, the HSE intends to establish a Parental Reference Group that will help shape how care is delivered to children with complex medical needs.    </p>  <p>  The Government shares the commitment of all Deputies to supporting the families of these children and to ensuring the provision of a service that both works for parents and reflects their expertise in caring for their children.</p></reply>

The overall allocation to Ballymun Drug and Alcohol Task Forces for community-based drugs initiatives in 2018 is in excess of &euro;1.1m, the same amount was provided in 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017. </p>  <p>  It is a matter for the Task Force to ensure that its budget is effectively deployed to meet current priorities and locally identified needs, taking into account the changing nature of the drugs phenomenon. Where possible, it is desirable that initiatives funded by task forces are mainstreamed into government funding. </p>  <p>  Ballymun Local Drugs and Alcohol Task Force has informed the Department of Health that it has decided to cease supporting breakfast clubs from the end of June 2018 as alternative sources of public funding are available for school breakfasts through the Department of Social Protection's School Meals Programme. The task force intends to refocus its resources on individuals, children and families with the most acute needs and most risk due to drug/alcohol issues. </p>  <p>  The task force will assist schools in the area to apply for funding for breakfast clubs through this programme. Funding for the school meals programme in 2018 amounts to &euro;54 million, up from &euro;47.5 million in 2017. Some 18,400 more children and 80 newly designated DEIS schools will benefit from September  2018.</p>  <p>  I am confident that the food and nutrition needs of children in the community service referred to by the Deputy can be met under this expanded programme.</p></reply>

Section 47 of the Public Health (Tobacco) Acts prohibits smoking in most enclosed work places.  This includes office blocks, public houses/bars, restaurants and company vehicles (cars and vans).  The overall purpose of the ban is to limit people from the harms of second hand tobacco smoke. Section 47(7) provides exemptions from the general prohibition in respect of certain places / premises including prisons, nursing homes, non-acute long stay facilities and psychiatric hospitals.</p>  <p>  The Protection of Children's Health (Tobacco Smoke in Mechanically Propelled Vehicles) Act 2014 prohibits the smoking of tobacco in cars where children are present.</p>  <p>  The policy document Tobacco Free Ireland (2013) sets a target for Ireland to be tobacco free (i.e. with a prevalence rate of less than 5%) by 2025.  Tobacco Free Ireland addresses a range of tobacco control issues and initiatives and contains over 60 recommendations.  Some of those recommendations relate to extending the smoking ban on a legislative basis to the campuses of primary and secondary schools and child care facilities.  Other recommendations relate to the promotion, on a voluntary basis and in conjunction with key stakeholders, of smoke free environments on the outdoor campuses of third level institutions, health care facilities, Government facilities, sports facilities, playgrounds, parks and beaches.  Progress has been made in particular in relation to health care and Government facilities, playgrounds and third level institutions.</p>  <p>  The Government recently agreed to support a Seanad Private Members' Motion seeking the Minister for Health to extend the smoking ban to outdoor commercial public places where food is consumed.  It was agreed that the measure would be addressed on the completion of the current tobacco control legislative programme as set out in Tobacco Free Ireland and in line with our international legislative obligations.  Minister Byrne set out this legislative programme and obligations in detail in the Seanad Debate on this issue on 25th April, 2018.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-05-01a.815.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1261" speakername="Jim Daly" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018050100091#WRW01800"><p> As you are aware the Department of Health is currently engaged in a detailed process to develop plans for a new statutory scheme and system of regulation for home care services.</p>  <p>  The statutory scheme for home care will introduce clear rules in relation to the services for which individuals are eligible and in relation to service-allocation.  For that reason, developing a new statutory scheme will be an important step in ensuring that the system operates in a consistent and fair manner for all those who need home care services.  It will also help to improve access to the home care services that people need in an affordable and sustainable way.  The system of regulation for home care will help to ensure that the public can be confident that the services provided are of a high standard.</p>  <p>  As an initial step in this process, the Department commissioned the Health Research Board to undertake a review of the home care systems in four other European countries.  This review, which was published in April 2017, will help us to learn from the experiences of other jurisdictions and will inform the debate and future consideration of approaches to formal home care financing and regulation here in Ireland.  I, along with Minister Harris, also launched a public consultation process in July 2017 which closed in October 2017.  The purpose of this consultation was to allow all those with views on this topic to have their say, including older people themselves, their families, and healthcare workers.  There was a very high response rate to the consultation process with approximately 2,600 submissions received.  I intend to publish a report of the findings of the consultation process at the end of May.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that a significant amount of detailed work remains to be carried out before final decisions are taken on the form of home care scheme and the system of regulation for these services.  This is required if reforms are to be successful, affordable and sustainable.</p>  <p>  However, while the new home care scheme is under development, the Department of Health and Health Service Executive (HSE) are continuing efforts to incrementally improve the existing services.  The HSE has begun streamlining services in 2018 by bringing together the funding for home help and standard home care packages, which now operate as a single home support service. This new approach will provide significant benefits including making the services easier to understand; streamlining the application and decision-making processes; and facilitating service users to move to changed levels of service as their assessed needs change, without the need for an additional application process.</p>  <p>  2018 has also seen a significant increase in the provision of home support services.  The HSE&rsquo;s National Service Plan provides for a target of some 17.094m home support hours to be provided to 50,500 people.  This represents an increase of 754,000 hours to 500 more people over last year.  In addition 235 intensive home care packages will provide 360,000 home support hours for people with complex needs.</p>  <p>  The HSE will also continue to encourage local integration of services and build appropriate care pathways, in particular for people with dementia and complex needs.</p></reply>

Almost 50% of this funding was used to deliver home support packages and transitional care beds to reduce the incidence of delayed discharges.  Furthermore, over 200 beds have been opened this winter and more beds are due to come on stream later in the year.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the increased level of resources provided, this winter has been particularly difficult for our health services with ED attendances up 3.7% and admissions up 3.3% during the first quarter of the year, as compared to the same period in 2017.</p>  <p>  The situation was further exacerbated by Storm Emma and the severe weather that followed.  In response to this, I approved a further &euro;5m in emergency funding to provide additional home support packages and transitional care beds to assist the safe discharge of patients who required support to return home following the adverse weather.</p>  <p>  In the light of the conclusions of the Health Service Capacity Review that the system will need nearly 2,600 additional acute hospital beds by 2031, I have asked my Department to work with the HSE to identify the location and mix of beds across the hospital system which can be opened and staffed this year and into 2019 in order to improve preparedness for Winter 2018/2019.</p>  <p>  As outlined in the Capacity Review, the demographic pressures being experienced by the health service are such as to demand not just additional capacity but continued emphasis on health and well-being initiatives, an improved model of care with a stronger role for enhanced community based services and continued improvement in productivity including in acute hospitals.  The Government has approved a record level of capital investment in health at &euro;10.9 billion over the next 10 years.  This will provide for a major enhancement of the capacity of our health services to meet demand.  Importantly, the accelerated introduction of additional capacity for 2018/2019 will be matched by forthcoming reforms including the publication of a detailed Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Plan and the overhaul of the current GP contract.</p>  <p>  Finally, a review of the Winter Initiative 2017/2018 is being undertaken, which will inform a 3 year plan for unscheduled care, as well as supporting the provision of additional capacity in Winter 2018/19.</p>  <p>  With specific regard to the Deputy's question on persons over 75 years of age, there are three main programmes focused on prioritising and improving the experience of patients over 75 in the emergency healthcare system.</p>  <p>  The Integrated Care Programme for Older People (ICPOP) and the National Clinical Programme for Older People (NCPOP) are developing integrated primary and secondary care services for older people.  This involves establishing integrated multidisciplinary teams (MDTs) in both acute hospitals and CHOs to address the specific needs of older people (especially those who are frail or at risk of frailty); case management within MDTs linked to other services that coordinates and plans care needs across a continuum; and bespoke care pathways with appropriate expertise in older persons&rsquo; care.</p>  <p>  The Frailty at the Front Door (FFD) programme, which is the assertive case management of frail older patients deployed in acute hospitals (i.e. ED and MAUs) consists of timely identification and screening of older attendees to acute hospitals; comprehensive and early multidisciplinary team assessment; and assertive discharge with a coordinated response to the needs of frail older patients.</p></reply>

This is necessary in order to protect forests and also to ensure that forestry operations and activities are carried out in compliance with the principles of sustainable forest management.  The obligation to replant felled trees is required under the Forestry Act, 2014 and the Forestry Regulations, SI 191/2017.</p>  <p>Due to the extent of deforestation by the early 20th century, legislation was introduced to regulate tree felling.  This has facilitated, in part, sustainable forest management.  There is a need to avoid deforestation in relation to economic and social considerations and particularly in an environmental context such as carbon, landscape and amenity considerations.  Reforestation after felling is essential to prevent deforestation, which would otherwise counteract the benefits of the initial afforestation, regardless of whether that was grant aided.</p>  <p>  Every application for a tree felling licence is carefully assessed to ensure that the tree felling and the required replanting is carried out to the highest standards.  All applications are desk assessed by Forestry Inspectors of my Department and where required a field assessment will be carried out.  This assessment will include an examination of the proposed replanting and will include certain conditions in this regard, for example, any necessary setbacks from water courses, roads or dwellings.</p>  <p>  I understand, the application for a tree felling licence for the person named, is currently being examined by a Forestry Inspector and a decision is awaited.</p></reply>

This management is carried out by Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI), the State Agency with statutory responsibility for inland fisheries.  This is based on the fact that each of Ireland&rsquo;s 147 salmon rivers, river sections, estuaries, etc., has its own genetically unique stock of salmon which migrates to sea as juveniles and returns to the same river in adulthood to spawn and create the next generation of fish exclusive to that river.    The Atlantic salmon is a protected species under the EU Habitats Directive with which Ireland&rsquo;s current salmon management regime complies.  In order to align fully with the Directive and the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organisation (NASCO) principles, the Irish Government closed mixed stock fisheries in 2007, including coastal and offshore fishing for salmon, </p>  <p>  The government introduced a Hardship Scheme under which, fishermen active in the commercial salmon fishery could opt to voluntarily cease fishing and undertake not to seek a licence in the future.  In excess of &euro;25 million was allocated to the scheme to facilitate payments to fishermen, with a further &euro;5 million provided for community development projects.  It is considered that river stocks in Ireland would be in a far more perilous state if the closure of mixed stock fisheries had not been implemented. </p>  <p>  Harvest fisheries are now only allowed on individual river stocks which are shown to have a surplus of fish over the conservation limit.

These "mixed stocks" pose particular difficulties for management as they contain individual fish often from a wide range of rivers internationally some of which are below sustainable reproductive capacity.  Any deviation from current policy would be contrary to the international independent scientific advice and would lead to indiscriminate exploitation as the &ldquo;home river&rdquo; of off-shore salmon cannot be identified and it is not possible to disaggregate the individuals or stock groups at sea.</p>  <p>  Such a move could potentially lead to conflict with EU and international obligations on grounds of not protecting vulnerable Irish and international salmon stocks.  The conservation imperative demands that current salmon stocks are not further eroded by mismanagement or inappropriate exploitation, whether via angling, commercial fisheries in rivers inland or through the operation of mixed stock fisheries at sea or in estuaries. </p>  <p>  Ireland is committed to international agreements entered into at EU level and at NASCO and the prohibition of mixed stock fisheries is a key element of international best practice in salmon conservation and management.</p></reply>

Local authorities have specific powers under the Act to require measures to be taken, or to take measures directly, to prevent or limit environmental pollution caused or likely to be caused by the holding, recovery or disposal of waste, and to mitigate or remedy the effects on the environment of such activity.   My role, as Minister, is to provide the legislative and policy framework under which both local authority and Environmental Protection Agency enforcement action is initiated. Enforcement action against illegal waste activity is a matter for the local authorities and the Office of Environmental Enforcement of the EPA as appropriate.</p>  <p>  Underpinning waste enforcement is state funding for waste enforcement officers. I have made &euro;9 million available from the Environment Fund this year to support the Waste Enforcement Regional Lead Authorities and the recruitment and continued employment of a network of local authority waste enforcement officers. This investment is critical in providing an enhanced response on the ground to other infractions of the waste code. </p>  <p>  Funding has been provided under the 2018 Anti-Dumping Initiative to support a pilot project undertaken by Sligo County Council aimed at tackling and addressing the source of illegal dumping. The aim of this project is to create and maintain a register of how households are managing their waste based on information provided by Waste Collectors. It is anticipated that this approach will facilitate the process of trying to deal with illegal dumping, burning of waste and unauthorised waste management and may form a model of best practice for other Local Authorities to adopt, which in turn will work towards curbing illegal dumping activity nationally.</p>  <p>  The Regional Waste Management Planning Offices are also currently preparing a template to help standardise bye-laws on the presentation of waste. The draft template bye-laws aim to place the onus of proof on the householder to prove that they are managing their waste correctly by signing up to a waste collection service or providing receipts for the deposit of waste in authorised facilities. </p></reply>

Today, almost 7 out of 10 of the 2.3 million premises in Ireland have access to high speed broadband. Since this Government came into office almost 400,000 additional premises have access to high speed broadband. This will increase to nearly 8 out of 10 premises by the end of this year and by 2020, 9 out of 10 premises will have access to a high speed broadband connection. This is being achieved via a combination of commercial investment and a State led intervention.  In April 2017 I published an updated High Speed Broadband Map which is available at <i>www.broadband.gov.ie</i>.  This Map shows the areas targeted by commercial operators to provide high speed broadband services and the areas that will be included in the State Intervention Area under the NBP. </p><p>The Map is colour coded and searchable by address/eircode:</p><p>- The AMBER areas represent the target areas for the proposed State led Intervention under the NBP and are the subject of an ongoing procurement process.  </p><p>- The BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have plans to deliver high speed broadband services.  </p><p>- The LIGHT BLUE areas represent eir's commercial rural deployment plans to roll-out high speed broadband to 300,000 premises by the end of this year as part of a Commitment Agreement signed with me in April 2017. </p><p>The Commitment Agreement signed with eir relates to its plans to provide high speed broadband to 300,000 premises in rural areas on a commercial basis. eir has committed to completing the roll-out by the end of this year.  Information on eir's planned rural deployment is available at <i></i>.</p><p>A copy of the Commitment Agreement is available on my Department&rsquo;s website <i>www.dccae.gov.ie</i><i><i>.</i></i></p><p>My Department is in a formal procurement process to select a company who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network in the State intervention area. That procurement process is now in its final stages.</p><p>In the interim, practical initiatives will continue to be addressed through the work of the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce to address obstacles and improve connectivity in respect of existing and future mobile phone and broadband services. </p><p>Under this Taskforce, engagement between telecommunications operators and local authorities through the Broadband Officers is continuing to strengthen.  These Broadband Officers are acting as single points of contact in local authorities for their communities.  The appointment of these officers is already reaping rewards in terms of ensuring a much greater degree of consistency in engagements with operators and clearing obstacles to developing infrastructure.  There is a link to a list of these local Broadband Officers on my Department's website.</p></reply>

The main aim of the scheme, which began in 2016, is to demonstrate the positive effects that making homes warmer and more energy efficient can have on the health and well-being of people in energy poverty who are living with chronic respiratory conditions. An independent analysis is being carried out to assess the health and well-being impact the scheme is having. At the conclusion of the scheme and with independent evidence on its effectiveness, the potential for a wider roll-out will be considered.In total to date, 534 homes have received upgrades under the scheme, with an average cost of &euro;15,700 per home.

I will be delivering the VNR at the HLPF  and my Department is currently finalising the draft VNR, in consultation with the SDG Interdepartmental Working Group, which is comprised of representatives from all Government Departments. My Department has not formally or informally consulted with any stakeholder directly regarding the VNR to date, but intends to announce VNR consultation arrangements this week. The list of stakeholders who participate in that consultation exercise will be made publically available through my Department's website.</p><p>I launched Ireland&rsquo;s first Sustainable Development Goals National Implementation Plan 2018 &ndash; 2020 (the Plan) on 26 April 2018. My Department prepared this first Plan, again in consultation with the SDG Interdepartmental Working Group.  In drafting the Plan, my Department carried out a stakeholder consultation in December 2017. While this consultation exercise related to the Plan and not the VNR directly, Ireland's approach to the VNR process is set out in the Plan and this would have informed stakeholders' responses. The list of stakeholders who provided my Department with feedback through this consultation exercise is set out in the following table.<table><tr><th>Stakeholders</th><th></th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>National Milk Agency</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Business in the Community Ireland</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Jeanne Moore (in a personal capacity) </td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Development Perspectives</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Vincent Carragher, Research Fellow Trinity College</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>World Vision Ireland</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Environment Protection Agency</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>The Wheel</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>David O'Flynn (in a personal capacity)</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>SDGHub at Trinity College Dublin</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>Social Justice Ireland</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>Kerry County Council </td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>National Youth Council of Ireland </td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>&lsquo;Domestic Sector&rsquo; of Coalition2030 </td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>ICMSA</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>Galway City Community Network</td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td>Irish Development Education Association</td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td>Presentation Interprovincial Justice Desk</td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td>Community Work Ireland</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>ECO-UNESCO</td></tr><tr><td>21</td><td>Chambers Ireland</td></tr><tr><td>22</td><td>Steering Committee of Coalition 2030</td></tr><tr><td>23</td><td>Irish Congress of Trade unions</td></tr><tr><td>24</td><td>UCD Centre for Sustainable Development Studies </td></tr><tr><td>25</td><td>All Together in Dignity Ireland</td></tr><tr><td>26</td><td>Irish Family Planning Association </td></tr><tr><td>27</td><td>European Anti-Poverty Network </td></tr><tr><td>28</td><td>Irish Rural Link </td></tr><tr><td>29</td><td>Road Safety Authority</td></tr></table></p><p>In launching the Plan, I highlighted the importance of stakeholder engagement to support the effective implementation of the SDGs, which is why an SDG Stakeholder Forum will be established as a priority action under the Plan.

Today, almost 7 out of 10 of the 2.3 million premises in Ireland have access to high speed broadband. Since this Government came into office almost 400,000 additional premises have access to high speed broadband. This will increase to nearly 8 out of 10 premises by the end of this year and by 2020, 9 out of 10 premises will have access to a high speed broadband connection.  This is being achieved via a combination of commercial investment and a State led intervention.

For this reason there continues to be limited scope for funding improvement projects under the Specific/Strategic Grant Programmes.  Any projects proposed by local authorities for consideration under these Grant Programmes are assessed by the Department on a case-by-case basis with the main focus on larger scale safety improvement and bridge rehabilitation projects.  Such projects are subject to appraisal as required in the Public Spending Code and the Department&rsquo;s Capital Appraisal Framework.</p>  <p>  It is a matter for each local authority to assess its priorities and draw up a roadworks programme based on the State grant funding and own resources available to it.

Areas requiring improvement are also identified however, in particular the need for greater clarity in the Department's own guide to making an application.  The Review also suggests a number of measures aimed at further prioritising applications from disadvantaged areas and all proposals in this regard will be fully considered prior to the next round of the programme opening for applications. </p><p>Separately, a full Value For Money Review of the Sports Capital Programme is underway which is being led by the Department's Strategic Research and Analysis unit, with oversight from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Provisional findings from this Value For Money Review are expected later this year.  A comprehensive Sports Policy paper is also being finalised and future rounds of the SCP will reflect that policy's relevant provisions.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-05-01a.958.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018050100094#WRZ03500"><p>The Navan Rail Link Project, currently part of the TEN-T comprehensive network, was originally included under the Transport 21 Initiative and was to be developed in two Phases.  Phase 1, which comprised the Dunboyne Rail Line project and involved the reopening of 7.5km of a railway line running off the Maynooth line, at Clonsilla, to the M3 interchange at Pace near Dunboyne, was opened in September 2010 with Park and Ride facilities for 1200 at Pace and for 300 at Dunboyne.  Phase 1 was completed in 2013 with the opening of Hansfield Station. Exchequer funding of &euro;160 million was approved for Phase 1.  No TEN-T funding was received for the Navan Rail Link Project.</p>  <p>  The plan for Phase 2 involved the extension of the Dunboyne Line between Clonsilla and M3 Parkway Station, onwards to north Navan. This development together with a number of other transport projects was postponed in 2011 due to the economic and fiscal crisis.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s recently published National Development Plan confirms a number of key investment priorities including not only protecting investments already made but also considerable investment in public transport modes including Bus, Rail, Luas, Metro, Cycling and Walking, next generation ticketing systems, customer information systems, transition to low emission fleets all to deliver a much expanded comprehensive public transport network that would match travel demand, alleviate congestion and deliver a range of benefits over the next decade. </p>  <p>  The NDP also recognises that over the period of the plan it will be very important to examine the role the interurban rail network can play in enhancing regional connectivity. In this regard the NDP notes that the NTA is required to review its Greater Dublin Area Transport Strategy before the end of 2021. This review will include a reappraisal of the extension of the Dunboyne/M3 Parkway line to Dunshauglin and Navan taking into account the scale of new and planned development along the route and will allow for its consideration during the NDP Mid Term Review.</p>  <p>  Also looking ahead, the European Commission, in reviewing the implementation of the TEN-T core network by end 2023 and in consultation with Member States, will evaluate whether the core network should be modified to take into account developments in transport flows and national investment planning.</p></reply>

Through a multi-agency approach by NTA, DCC, and TII working in conjunction with the various Public Transport Operators, the measures set out in the 2015 Study (including the College Green Plaza proposal, developed by Dublin City Council, and currently being considered by An Bord Plean&aacute;la) are being progressed so as to ensure that Dublin City transport system is capable of operating efficiently and reliably, with consistent journey times, and that it is facilitating the City's continued development and growth. </p>  <p>  The NTA's "Transport Strategy for the GDA 2016-2035" provides the overarching framework for the planning and delivery of transport infrastructure and services in the GDA over the next two decades. The measures proposed in the strategy are linked to an analysis of current and projected levels of travel demand across the region and also will be subject to a number of influencing factors including funding availability.</p>  <p>  On the issue of funding availability, Budget 2018 provides for an increase in the multi-annual capital investment for public transport with a four-year capital envelope of &euro;2.7 billion over the period 2018-2021. The National Development Plan (NDP), which was launched earlier this year by Government as part of Project Ireland 2040, confirms a number of key investment priorities.  These will be delivered progressively and steadily over the short, medium and long term, to deliver a comprehensive public transport network to match transport demand, alleviate congestion and deliver a range of benefits over the next decade.</p>  <p>  In line with legislation, the NTA Strategy will be supported and given effect through a series of sequential shorter-term implementation plans that will set out the investment priorities and proposals over a six year period. Now that the National Development Plan and the National Planning Framework are published, the NTA are in a position to finalise a draft Integrated Implementation Plan for the next 6 year period. I understand that a consultation process on the proposed draft Plan will be commenced later this year after which the Draft Plan will be submitted for my approval.</p></reply>

The measures proposed in the strategy are linked to an analysis of current and projected levels of travel demand across the region and also will be subject to a number of influencing factors including funding availability.</p>  <p>  On the issue of funding availability, Budget 2018 provides for an increase in the multi-annual capital investment for public transport with a four-year capital envelope of &euro;2.7 billion over the period 2018-2021. </p>  <p>  The National Development Plan (NDP), which was launched earlier this year by Government as part of Project Ireland 2040, confirms a number of key investment priorities.  These will be delivered progressively and steadily over the short, medium and long term, to deliver a comprehensive public transport network to match transport demand, alleviate congestion and deliver a range of benefits over the next decade.</p>  <p>  In line with legislation, the NTA Strategy will be supported and given effect through a series of sequential shorter-term implementation plans that will set out the investment priorities and proposals over a six year period. Now that the National Development Plan and the National Planning Framework are published, the NTA are in a position to finalise a draft Integrated Implementation Plan for the next 6 year period. I understand that a consultation process on the proposed draft Plan will be commenced later this year after which the Draft Plan will be submitted for my approval.</p></reply>

The application should be accompanied by a parental consent form and by a HSE AIM Level 5 template completed by a health professional. The health professional will need to confirm that the proposed equipment is necessary and critical to enable the child to participate in the ECCE programme.</p>  <p>  The application process for AIM supports for children entering ECCE for the first time in September 2018 opens on 1st May.  It is advisable that applications for AIM supports are made as early as possible to ensure that the relevant supports are in place when required.</p>  <p>  AIM is a model of supports designed to ensure that children with a disability can access the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme.  The key objective of AIM is to support pre-school providers to deliver an inclusive pre-school experience, ensuring that children with a disability can fully participate in the ECCE programme, thereby reaping the benefits of quality pre-school education.</p>  <p>  AIM is a child-centered model, involving seven levels of progressive support, moving from the universal to the targeted, based on the needs of the child and the pre-school setting.  AIM Level 5 provides for access to specialised equipment, appliances, assistive technology and/or minor alterations capital grants for early years settings to ensure children with a disability can participate in the ECCE programme.

In these circumstances, it is not possible for Government to put in place a redress scheme in relation to the broad range of matters within the scope of this investigation prior to the Commission submitting its findings and conclusions. </p>  <p>  The challenges for Government in considering such matters at an interim stage of a Commission&rsquo;s work were further highlighted in the Special Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on the Residential Institutions Redress Scheme.</p>  <p>  As I have indicated previously, when the final reports of the Commission are available, the Government will listen and respond to the full account of the Commission&rsquo;s conclusions on this and all matters regarding the treatment of former residents. </p>  <p>  In the interim, the Government has agreed to consider supports to meet the health and well-being needs of former residents. The establishment of a Collaborative Forum is a progressive approach to assist former residents to prioritise areas of concern for them and their families.

While no further studies on the impact of homelessness have been carried out by my Department, there can be little doubt that homelessness is an extremely distressing experience, and that any medium to long-term period living in a hotel or other emergency accommodation seriously impacts on normal family life and is particularly detrimental to children. </p>  <p>  Where children are homeless as part of a family experiencing homelessness, my Department is working closely with Tusla to provide supports to mitigate the challenges faced by these parents and children.  These include the introduction of free childcare for the children of families experiencing homelessness.  As part of the scheme a daily meal is provided for each child, the cost of which is included in the subvention rate.  The scheme is also designed to help those transitioning from homelessness to permanent accommodation.</p>  <p>  Tusla works together with other statutory and voluntary agencies to provide services and supports to children, young people and families experiencing homelessness.  Actions taken by Tusla include the provision of funding for child support workers and the appointment of a Homelessness Liaison Officer.</p>  <p>  Family Resource Centres, part funded by Tusla, are working with people who are experiencing homelessness and many have developed local responses to the needs of families in emergency accommodation.  These include, by way of example, family fun days, homework support, after school programmes, play therapy and transport services.  Under its Business Plan for 2018 Tusla has committed to assigning a Tusla team to all currently operational family hubs and to each new hub at the commencement of operations. Tusla has also committed to developing specific targeted initiatives so that children and their families who are homeless can avail of services in a safe, warm, welcoming space where they feel comfortable and respected.  These initiatives will be located in FRCs and places which are close to where children and families may access emergency accommodation. </p>  <p>  In recognition of the difficulties associated with homelessness and school attendance, Tusla&rsquo;s Educational Welfare Service offers a number of supports to children (and families) experiencing homelessness.</p>  <p>  Tusla&rsquo;s joint protocol with the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive (DRHE) covers child welfare and protection matters for children in emergency accommodation.  It is fully operational in the DRHE areas and it is intended to replicate this protocol across the State. A Joint Working Protocol has been signed between Tusla and Galway City Council. </p>  <p>  Finally, the DRHE is coordinating the development of a comprehensive National Quality Standards Framework for homeless services on behalf of all housing authorities.  Consultation with service users and key stakeholders, including Tusla, has been undertaken and the draft standards have been piloted in selected services.  These standards, including a child safety element which will provide homeless services with a framework for continuous quality improvement, will be implemented nationally. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that Tusla only intervenes in family life in exceptional circumstances.  Children who are with their families in emergency accommodation remain in the care of their parents or guardians.  Where Tusla has concerns regarding the welfare and development of any child they will provide family supports to assist that family and child.</p>  <p>  Ultimately, my concern is that we minimise and then eliminate the problem of homelessness.  In the meantime, I will continue to support measures to help those affected, to the greatest degree possible within my area of responsibility. </p></reply>

Furthermore, the DRHE requires that, in relation to service providers for emergency accommodation, all owners, managers and staff, contract or otherwise must undergo Garda vetting in advance of commencing employment. The service provider has responsibility for obtaining Garda vetting and the DRHE provide assistance to the service provider in this regard.</p>  <p>  I met with Inner City Helping Homeless in March and agreed, on foot of that meeting, to raise a number of concerns voiced on the day with the Dublin Region Homeless Executive (DRHE). The DRHE replied to my letter of March 14 on March 23. This response has recently been forwarded to Inner City Helping Homeless and I apologise for the delay in so doing.</p>  <p>  I understand that in the latter half of 2017, the DRHE developed a guideline document for Private Emergency Accommodation service providers, outlining the requirements that operators must meet as part of their contractual arrangements with the DRHE. In line with this document, the DRHE developed a training programme for all staff employed by private emergency operators which covers areas such as child protection, dealing with challenging behaviour, staff conduct and boundary setting. This programme of training is offered to all providers of private emergency accommodation and continues to be rolled out through 2018.</p>  <p>  In relation to the component of training referring to child protection, a full of training takes place covering child protection matters - delivered by an expert in the area of child welfare and protection. </p>  <p>  Finally, the DRHE have informed me that they carry out regular inspections, both announced and unannounced, on all service providers. The inspection results are made known to the service providers who are then required to carry out any corrective action necessary.</p></reply>

I believe that this is the best way forward in our response to what are hugely complex and sensitive matters.  The principles of transitional justice inform my approach to these measures. </p>  <p>  In this regard the Deputy may be aware that I am currently in the process of establishing a Collaborative Forum for former residents.  It is a progressive response to the theme of &ldquo;nothing about us without us&rdquo; which emerged from the facilitated consultations I held with former residents last year.  A number of priority areas have been identified from our consultations to date.  The Forum will incorporate three sub-committees that will examine a range of areas, including key transitional justice measures such as memorialisation and the capture of personal narratives.  I have appointed an independent Selection Panel to select representative members from those persons who express an interest in participating in this process. An information campaign on how to apply to become a member of the Forum will commence in the coming days.  </p>  <p>  I believe that open and consistent communication with former residents and other stakeholders on the matters of concern to them is essential while the Commission continues with the work it was established to do. In this regard, my Department has continued to post a an e-zine update on the Mother and Babies Homes section of my Department's website on the first Friday of every month.  In this way we can ensure that everyone has access to the same information at the same time. </p>  <p>  I also secured Government approval for an invitation to be extended to the UN Special Rapporteur on the promotion of truth, justice, reparation and guarantees of non-recurrence to visit Ireland.  I am pleased to confirm that this invitation has issued.  The Special Rapporteur will have many demands on his time but I hope that he may be in a position to provide a favourable response to this invitation.  A visit from the UN Special Rapporteur would provide a vital insight into the relationship between international human rights standards and the everyday lives of Ireland&rsquo;s citizens.</p>  <p>  In relation to the site of the former Mother and Baby Home in Tuam, following the publication of the Report of the Expert Technical Group, public consultations were held in March so that all interested parties could have an opportunity to voice their opinions on these sensitive matters.  The facilitator's report is now available to inform the deliberations of the inter-departmental committee coordinating the State's response to this matter.  The committee is meeting tomorrow with a view to making recommendations to me on these sensitive matters. I will then be in a position to bring proposals to Government for a decision on the future of the site.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to post a monthly e-zine update on the Mother and Babies Homes section of my Department's website on the first Friday of every month.

The overall purpose is to improve outcomes for children and young people by enhancing interagency co-operation at a local and national level having regard to issues including children and young people not in education or who are not participating in training courses.  Through its work in the Sligo area, Sligo CYPSC aims to realise the five national outcomes set out in Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures:  The National Policy Framework for Children and Young People (2014 &ndash; 2020).</p><p>My Department administers a range of funding schemes and programmes to support the provision of youth services to young people throughout the country, including those from disadvantaged communities.</p><p>The funding provided by my Department to Mayo, Sligo and Leitrim Education and Training Board over the past five years for vulnerable and disadvantaged people in Sligo is provided in the accompanying table.

Young People Facilities and Services funding was established by the Government in 1998 to assist in the development of preventative strategies in a targeted manner through the development of youth facilities, including sports and recreational facilities.  Youth Information Centre funding provides young people with access to information on rights, opportunities, health and other matters.  The Local Youth Club Grant Scheme supports youth work activities at a local level.  These grants are made available to all youth clubs and groups through their local Education and Training Board.</p><p>Youth Officers of the Education and Training Boards have an important support role to my Department in the administration and co ordination of youth services at a local level.  Funding is provided under the Youth Officer function to assist Education and Training Boards with the cost of employing youth officers.  Last year the local youth club equipment scheme enabled volunteer led clubs and groups that work with young people to purchase sports, arts, adventure and other much needed items.</p><p>My Department recently completed an exercise with Pobal and each Education and Training Board which mapped youth service provision across the State.  This mapping exercise will assist my Department and each Education and Training Board in developing a detailed social demographic profile, in terms of both population numbers and deprivation levels, which will inform future developments and investment in youth services.  My Department is committed to working with Mayo, Sligo and Leitrim ETB to identify need and explore ways to address this need where it emerges.</p></reply>

I understand that the Special Rapporteur will have many demands on his time but I hope that he may be in a position to provide a favourable response to this invitation.</p>  <p>  The Government believes that the expertise and experience of Mr. Fabian Salvioli can provide valuable assistance in our response to the issues relating to mother and baby homes.  A visit from the UN Special Rapporteur could also provide vital insight into the relationship between international human rights standards and the everyday lives of Ireland&rsquo;s citizens.</p>  <p>  Separately, the Deputy may also wish to note that I will be meeting with the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Sale and Sexual Exploitation of Children in the course of her upcoming visit to Ireland from 14th to 21st of May.</p>  <p>  I have a keen interest and focus on the mandate of the Rapporteur which covers a broad scope of children's issues.

I know that some people may need to access various supports around this time and I have previously advised any persons so affected to consider contacting the Health Service Executive National Counselling Service. </p>  <p>  With regard to the Commission of Investigation, it is important to recognise that the statutory Commission is independent in the conduct of its investigations. Therefore, the individual arrangements with witnesses are a matter for the Commission and I have no role in this regard. </p>  <p>  I am aware that the Commission does ask former residents attending as witnesses if they have access to supports and whether they would like information on available services. I understand that, if they so wish, this information is provided by the Commission but it does not make referrals to these services. </p>  <p>  In relation to the number of former residents who have given evidence to the Commission, I do not have this information for the reasons outlined above. However, the Commission's Third Interim Report, which I have published, states that as of September 2017, the confidential committee  had met with 346 former residents or others with connections to the institutions under investigation, and  expected to engage with a further 200 persons who had applied to meet the committee.</p></reply>

Where appropriate, children who are in need of care and protection are received into the care of the State under the Child Care Act, 1991, as amended. </p><p>Regulations govern the placement of children in care.  These provide for the welfare of the child, the care practices, care records, accommodation and safety precautions. The Regulations also provide that the allocated social worker oversees the implementation of the child's care plan, visits the child and consults with family members, foster carers and other people involved with the child to ensure that his or her needs are being met and that the care being provided is optimal. </p><p>Children, depending on their identified need, may be placed in foster care either with relatives or general foster carers, in residential care, special care or other placement types.  The majority of children in care in Ireland are in foster care.  Matching carers with children and young people is outlined in the National Standards for Foster Care (2003), and the National Standards for Children's Residential Centres (2001) outlines the need for suitable placements in residential care. </p><p>It is vital that all children in care, and their carers, receive adequate support to ensure a successful placement.  Foster care is the main form of alternative care for children in need of care and protection, and is the preferred option for children who cannot live with their parents or guardians.  At the end of December 2017, there were 6,189 children in care in Ireland.  92% (5,702) of these were cared for in foster placements.  The majority of children are in the care of general foster carers. </p><p>Key elements of the support to be provided to children in care include: access to a link social worker for supervision and support to the foster carers; allocation of a dedicated social worker for children in care; onward referral and advocacy for access to specialist services to meet the child's identified needs, such as speech and language therapy, counselling and psychology services.</p><p>The link worker is a professionally qualified social worker and meets regularly with foster carers to supervise the capacity of the foster carers to adequately meet the needs of the child and to provide training, information and whatever other support that may be required.  At the end of December 2017, 81% (3554/4384) of foster carers had a link social worker and 95%(5415/5702) of children in foster care had an allocated social worker.</p><p>Tusla provides funding to the Irish Foster Care Association which provides supports to carers, including training and a phone advice service. </p><p>My Department receives regular detailed reports on key performance and activity indicators of service provision, including on children in care, from Tusla, the Child and Family Agency.  My officials have regular meetings on a monthly and quarterly basis with Tusla management to review the overall level of service provision, including areas in need of improvement. In addition to regular reports, Tusla also provides occasional or special topic reports, as required, which can then be used for budget and resource planning. </p><p>In addition to the reporting arrangements with Tusla my Department also reviews the findings of a number of independent bodies, which are made available in the inspection reports from the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) who inspect all statutory children's residential centres and special care units run by the State, as well as Fostering Services and Child Protection and Welfare Services in each area.  Services are required to develop an Action Plan in response to any recommendations made by Inspectors.  HIQA undertakes follow-up inspections to examine the progress being made against Action Plans.  All of these Reports are published on HIQA's website<i>www.hiqa.ie.</i>All 17 areas have been inspected at least once by HIQA, as well as a number of private foster care services.</p><p>Registration and inspection of non-statutory run Residential Centres is carried out by Inspection and Monitoring Officers employed by Tusla, the Child and Family Agency.  My Department also receives reports on child deaths and serious incidents from the independently chaired National Review Panel, and reports from the Ombudsman for Children.</p></reply>

In addition to this, there are two strands of funding dedicated to community childcare services only (Early Years Strand 2 and School Age Strand 5) to provide grant funding to contribute towards essential maintenance and repair of facilitates.  The final strand of funding (Early Years Strand 3) provides for the creation of a new natural outdoor play area, and is open to all early years providers, both community and private.</p><p>  I am happy to have secured &euro;250m in capital funding for childcare under the National Development Plan (NDP, 2018-2027), as part of which childcare has been confirmed as a strategic priority for capital investment.  Officials in my Department are currently undertaking research to determine capital need both current and future, with a view to focusing state capital investment in the sector.  The preliminary results of this research are due later this year, and will inform any capital plans or programmes administered by my Department from there on.  The shape and focus of capital investment under the National Development Plan are as such yet to be determined.</p><p>  Furthermore, I would like to assure you that the structure and priorities of 2019's Capital programmes are under review by officials in my Department, and these will be shared with childcare providers and the general public as soon as they are confirmed in late 2018.  As part of this, the scale of individual grant amounts available is being reviewed along with all other aspects of Early Years and School Age capital funding. </p><p>I remain committed to assisting all childcare providers, both community and private, in providing world-class childcare and meeting demand for childcare places, and I anticipate that next year's Capital programme will build on this year's good work in the sector, as well as that of previous years.</p></reply>

It will help to ensure that child protection concerns, in whichever setting they arise, are brought to the attention of Tusla without delay.  The Act is an important addition to the child welfare and protection measures already in place, and it forms part of a suite of child protection legislation including the Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 and the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012. </p>  <p>  The framework surrounding the placement of children in the care of the State in foster care (including foster care with relatives) and residential care is governed by the Child Care Act 1991 and associated Regulations, relevant standards and, in the case of private service providers, contractual obligations.

Under the Child Care Act, 1991 and the Child and Family Agency Act 2013, Tusla has a duty to promote the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care or protection.  The Agency is obliged to provide care for these children for as long as their welfare requires it. </p>  <p>  Children First National Guidance (2011) gives advice for notifying Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, of situations where abuse is suspected.  A range of professionals including teachers, nurses, early years educators, Garda&iacute; and other health professionals, who see children regularly, are in a good position to identify children at risk.  Where someone has reasonable grounds for suspecting a child is being, or has been, abused, they are expected to immediately contact Tusla. </p>  <p>  The Children First Act, 2015 places a statutory obligation on key professionals, such as those named above (mandated persons) to report concerns of harm above a defined threshold to Tusla without delay.  These provisions commenced on December 11th, 2017. </p>  <p>  When a child who is undocumented, and is living with his or her parent or guardian, is taken into care, their needs are given priority.  A social worker is assigned to the child and prepares a care plan, in consultation with the child.  The plan should be dynamic and formally reviewed regularly.  Intrinsic to this process is ensuring that the voice and best interest of the child are central.  When outlined in the care plan, Tusla will  assist the child with the process of establishing residency.</p>  <p>  Unaccompanied asylum seeking children who seek the assistance of the State are placed in the statutory care of Tusla.  Their needs are assessed by an allocated a social worker from a specialist team who work exclusively with unaccompanied minors.  They receive appropriate educational, social, medical counselling support.  </p>  <p>  Children who, with their parents, live in Direct Provision, are provided with welfare supports as required.

As the Deputy will also know, the aftercare provisions of the Child Care (Amendment) Act 2015 came into force on the first of September last.  This means that there is now a statutory obligation on Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, to prepare an aftercare plan for each eligible child and young person.  This plan encompasses the range of supports that a young person may need from all service providers, including Tusla, to help them make the transition to independent adult life.  This might include identifying suitable accommodation, which for many young people may mean remaining with their former foster carer.</p>  <p>  A minority of young people leaving care are at a more pronounced risk of entering unstable accommodation due to the complexity of their support needs.  Funding is now available to Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) under the Capital Assistance Scheme (CAS) to provide accommodation to these particularly vulnerable young people.  The security provided by a tenancy in CAS accommodation combined with the aftercare supports identified by Tusla as part of the aftercare planning process should ensure that these young people have a safe base from which to begin their independent life. </p>  <p>  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that I have secured an additional &euro;40 million for Tusla in 2018.  This is the third year in succession that Tusla has received a significant increase in its funding, which now amounts to over &euro;753m.  The additional resources secured for Tusla in 2018 will assist in meeting key priorities.  The additional investment will allow Tusla to recruit a range of additional staff to respond to areas of identified risk, and to meet increased demand for services, including aftercare supports.</p></reply>

The internet is an increasingly valuable resource for everyone, including children and young people, but it also exposes people to new risks, including the risk of cyberbullying.</p>  <p>  A range of Government Departments and agencies have a role in relation to internet safety, including: the Department of Justice and Equality, which has responsibility for the Office of Internet Safety; the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, which has functional responsibly for internet providers; and the Department of Education and Skills, which leads on the implementation of the Action Plan on Bullying. While my Department does not have a lead responsibility in these areas, I am conscious that issues emerging in relation to online safety require a whole of government approach.  In this regard, the Department of the Taoiseach is currently developing an Action Plan on online safety and my Department is participating in this process.</p>  <p>  The Children First Act 2015 places a number of statutory obligations on organisations providing relevant services to children.

Appropriate corrective measures would depend on both the source and severity of such concerns or stress.</p>  <p>  As part of the Government-funded Growing Up in Ireland Study, and through other funded research and PhD scholarship programmes, my Department supports a number of research studies, key findings and data outputs relating to our understanding of the lives and experiences of children and young people in Ireland. Many of these are on topics related to aspects of children's lives which may be a source of stress or concern for them, for example, on relationships and friendship networks, experiences of bullying or discrimination, social disadvantage, inequality and mental health issues, and social and emotional outcomes for young people.</p>  <p>  My Department also publishes a range of indicator data on the lives of children and young people in the form of the biennial State of the Nation's Children (SONC) reports and in the Better Outcomes Brighter Futures (BOBF) indicator set. Both these sets include indicators on areas commonly associated with concern or stress among young people, including some which were identified through a review of consultations with children.  These include relationships with parents, parental mental health, home environment, self-perception, body image, schoolwork load and exam stress.</p>  <p>  My Department supports a range of initiatives and programmes to support children and young people, including among disadvantaged, marginalised and vulnerable groups, across the many aspects of their lives that may give rise to concern or stress.  This includes through the many actions supporting children and young people that are committed to in a number of Department of Children and Youth Affairs strategies, such as Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures, the national policy framework for children and young people and the National Youth Strategy. In this context also is the provision of funding for youth programmes and services.

This will help to rejuvenate town centres while also contributing to the housing needs of individuals.</p>  <p>  I have established a Steering Group to oversee the design and delivery of the pilot scheme.  The Steering Group is chaired by my Department, and involves a number of other key Departments and agencies, including the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Department of Finance, and the County and City Management Association which provides representation from the Local Authority sector.</p>  <p>  This is a complex issue, but work in relation to developing the pilot scheme is ongoing and I expect that substantial progress will be made in developing the pilot over the coming months.  This pilot has the capacity to inform future initiatives for town centre renewal under the new &euro;1 billion Rural Regeneration and Development Fund which was announced by the Government recently as part of Project Ireland 2040.</p></reply>

They were established for the purpose of bringing about a more joined-up approach to local and community development in their respective areas.  They typically comprise between 15 and 19 members, with stakeholders drawn from public bodies, as well as local development, community and voluntary, social inclusion and a range of other community interests.</p>  <p>  A review of LCDCs was commenced in October 2017.  The objective of the review is to develop an understanding of the LCDC landscape nationwide and the challenges facing the structures, identify opportunities for strengthening and enhancing them, and to make recommendations for their ongoing and future development.</p>  <p>  A Steering Group has been established to oversee the review.  It is chaired by an official from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and includes members drawn from my own Department, local authorities and the North West Regional Assembly.</p>  <p>  My Department has undertaken a very broad consultation process and an analysis of the data collected is ongoing.

Both schemes provide significant support to individuals so that they can work up to 3 days a week and still retain access to a reduced jobseeker&rsquo;s payment.  The 2018 Estimates for my Department provide for expenditure this year on the jobseeker&rsquo;s schemes of &euro;2.17 billion.</p>  <p>  An Taoiseach, in his previous role as Minister for Social Protection, gave a commitment at D&aacute;il report stage of the Social Welfare Bill 2016 that he would ask officials to examine the issue of jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit and the treatment of part-time and seasonal workers, including those categorised as having a subsidiary employment.  My Department has completed a report on jobseekers benefit and the treatment of seasonal and part time workers which I am examining.  </p>  <p>  On 7th December 2017, I published the Employment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2017 The Bill delivers on the commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government to tackle the problems caused by the increased casualisation of work and strengthen the regulation of precarious work.  The Bill completed Second Stage in the D&aacute;il on 15th February 2018 and Committee Stage is scheduled for 17th May next.</p>  <p>  This very important piece of legislation will improve the security and predictability of working hours for employees on insecure contracts and those working variable hours in all sectors of employment.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently collating data on jobseekers benefit recipients in subsidiary employment. We will have 12 months of data gathered by May 2018 at which point I will be in a better position to make an informed decision on this issue. </p>  <p>  I intend to submit the report on jobseekers benefit and the treatment of seasonal and part time workers to the Joint Oireachtas Committee. The report will be published subsequently and will be made available to all members.</p></reply>

What is proposed, in the context of this competitive tender process, is a continuation and upgrade of this existing technology.  This technology helps prevent and detect cases of suspected social welfare and identity fraud.</p><p>The Department uses facial image matching software to strengthen the SAFE<b></b>registration process.  The normal digital photograph in JPEG format is captured during the SAFE<b></b>registration process.  It is inputted into and stored in this facial image matching software and  is then modelled and searched against the Department&rsquo;s photo database to ensure that the person in the photograph has not already been registered using a different Personal Public Service Number or a different identity dataset.  The software compares photographs by converting the image into an arithmetic template based on the individual&rsquo;s facial characteristics and checking it against the other image templates already held in that software&rsquo;s database from other SAFE<b></b>registrations.  It is a similar approach to that taken by the Passport Office in its systems when processing passport applications/renewals.  </p><p>The Public Services Card does not store biometrics.  Nor is the biometric or arithmetic template of the photo stored in the PSI dataset or shared with other public bodies. </p><p>The current matching system is over 5 years old and upgrading the system will result in achieving significantly improved matching accuracy which, in turn, will lead to increased efficiencies and effectiveness for my Department.  The process will involve the application of the upgraded algorithm to all of the facial templates currently on the facial matching server in order to improve matching accuracy.</p><p>In conclusion, my Department currently has no plans to extend SAFE registration beyond that of SAFE level 2.</p><p>I hope that this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The TCA model being made available to them will award a maximum rate pension for those with 40 years contributions (including up to 20 years HomeCaring credits), and pro-rata payments for those with fewer contributions.  Up to 10 years ordinary credits (e.g. for Jobseekers or Illness Benefit) may also be used, subject to the total number of HomeCaring and ordinary credits not exceeding 20 years.</p>  <p>  Preparations for this change are being advanced by officials in my Department, notably in the areas of legislation, administration, and IT-related work.

These include the likely take-up of HomeCaring Credits, particularly among men.  Current estimates suggest that the full year cost in respect of 2019 may be in the region of &euro;35 million for people already in receipt of a State pension (contributory).  However, this figure does not include expected inflows from other schemes such as State pension (non contributory) and from Increase for Qualified Adult payments, who have not previously made an SPC claim.  Additionally, payments made in 2019 will also include arrears payments in respect of 2018 as payments will be effective from 30 March 2018 where applicable.  Therefore, the total cost in 2019 will not be evident until next year.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This is a review required by legislation.  It examines the projected income and expenditure of the SIF over the course of the 55 year period from 2016 to 2071.</p>  <p>  The review found that the fund currently has a modest surplus of income over expenditure.  In 2016 there was a surplus of &euro;0.4 billion on expenditure of &euro;8.8 billion and receipts of &euro;9.2 billion.  However, this will reduce over the next two years and will return to a small shortfall in 2020.  The annual shortfalls are projected to increase from 2021 onwards as the ageing of the population impacts.</p>  <p>  Projections indicate that, in the absence of further action to tackle the shortfall, the excess of expenditure over income of the fund will increase significantly over the medium to long term.  The shortfall in expenditure over income is projected to increase from &euro;0.2 billion in 2020 to &euro;3.3 billion by 2030 and to &euro;22.2 billion by 2071.</p>  <p>  As part of the review the independent consultants were required to project the additional PRSI expenditure if invalidity pension and illness, jobseeker's and carer&rsquo;s benefits were extended to Class S self-employed workers and the PRSI contribution rates required to provide these benefits on a revenue neutral basis.</p>  <p>  The review found that the combined cost of introducing the invalidity, illness, jobseeker's and carer&rsquo;s benefits for Class S contributions is estimated to be &euro;118 million in 2018, rising steadily to &euro;223 million in 2020.  By 2025 the projected cost is &euro;413 million and, over the period of the review the cost would rise to &euro;1.3 billion in 2071.</p>  <p>  These costs assume that the cost of extending invalidity pension to the self-employed builds up steeply for the first 10 years after introduction after which time the scheme is almost at maturity or a steady state.</p>  <p>  For the shorter term schemes, illness and jobseeker's benefits, it is estimated that they will reach maturity after 2 years.  Projected expenditure on jobseeker's benefit assumes the same incidence rate as prevail in the employed (PRSI Class A) population.</p>  <p>  The review indicates that, where these benefits are extended to the self-employed, the Class S rate of PRSI contribution would need to increase substantially in order to ensure that the benefits are delivered in a revenue neutral manner.  It estimates that when expenditure on the additional benefits is considered over the entire projection period, PRSI rates would need to increase by 94% under a scenario of no subvention from the exchequer.  This is equivalent to an increase of the Class S contribution rate from the current 4% rate to 7.8%.</p>  <p>  This increased contribution is attributable to the costs of extending these additional benefits to PRSI Class S contributors.  It does not take account of the value to PRSI Class S contributors of access to the range of existing benefits, and in particular State pension contributory.  The consultants estimated that the typical cost of State pension (contributory) on its own is of the order of 10% to 15%, depending on other factors including rate of average earnings and date of commencing paying PRSI.  Adding in the other benefits referenced, the total Class S rate of contribution to ensure revenue neutrality would be of the order of 20% per annum.</p>  <p>  The findings of the Review play an important role in informing the overall debate on policy developments in relation to the SIF in the years ahead including the financial sustainability of the Fund given the expected demographic challenges and consideration of extending the scope of benefits for workers generally, including the self-employed.  The Actuarial Review provides government with a timely and evidence-led opportunity to undertake a full review of our social insurance system and to consult with stakeholders.</p>  <p>  Work has commenced on preparation of the consultation paper in my Department with a view to adhering to the timetable set out in the Pensions Roadmap.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The aim of the Energy Efficiency Retrofitting Programme is the improvement of energy efficiency and comfort levels in local authority homes, benefitting those at risk of fuel poverty and making a significant contribution to Ireland&rsquo;s carbon emissions reduction targets and energy efficiency targets for 2020. </p>  <p>  The Energy Efficiency Retrofitting Programme is being implemented in a number of phases: Phase 1 commenced in 2013 and is focused on providing attic/roof insulation and the less intrusive cavity wall insulation in all relevant properties while Phase 2 of the Programme, which has been piloted in both Fingal and Westmeath County Councils, will focus on the external fabric upgrade of those social housing units with solid/hollow block wall construction.  Funding may also be provided under Phase 2 to upgrade poorly performing windows and doors in specific circumstances. </p>  <p>  Funding of some &euro;115.7 million has been provided from 2013 to the end of 2017 to improve energy efficiency and comfort levels in almost 64,000 local authority homes. </p>  <p>  The Voids Programme introduced by my Department in 2014, also provides funding for energy efficiency works to local authority housing.  During the period 2014 to 2017, works were carried out on 7,433 units under this Programme supported by funding of &euro;34.5m from my Department. </p>  <p>  In 2018, funding of &euro;35 million is available for energy efficiency works under both programmes.  The main focus of the available funding for the Energy Efficiency Retrofitting Programme will be on the completion of the remaining Phase 1 works and formally rolling out Phase 2.  My Department will, shortly, be asking local authorities to submit details of their work proposals and related funding requirements for this Programme in 2018.</p></reply>

In that context, the focus is on meeting the housing needs of those in the lower income categories, particularly those in need of social housing supports and other households that are most challenged from an affordability perspective, particularly first-time buyers.  The significant progress being made in these areas is outlined on the Rebuilding Ireland website at <i>www.rebuildingireland.ie</i>.</p><p>In addition, the Government has taken a number of steps to assist homeowners who wish to 'up-size' from the starter home they purchased but find themselves in negative equity.

I want to see local authorities realise new social and affordable homes from their lands without delay, with particular emphasis on prioritising those sites with the greatest potential to deliver housing at scale, in the short to medium term.</p><p>The active management of the publicly owned housing land bank is part of a range of complementary actions being progressed under the Rebuilding Ireland: Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, designed to accelerate and increase housing output.  Details of some 1,700 hectares of land in local authority and Housing Agency ownership have been published on the Rebuilding Ireland Housing Land Map as available at</p><p><i>. </i></p><p>To date, State-led residential construction has been primarily to help meet the needs of households in the lowest income brackets, i.e. for social housing.  With increased investment to deliver 50,000 new social homes by 2021, the significant expansion of the social housing build programme is evident in the Quarter 4 2017 Social Housing Construction Status Report, which was published on 19 April.  The programme includes 850 schemes (or phases) at the end of last year, delivering over 13,400 homes, a very substantial increase on the 8,430 homes in the programme a year earlier.  At end 2017, 2,512 social housing homes were completed, with another 3,650 under construction and a further 1,912 homes about to go on site, with the remaining 5,300 progressing through the various stages of planning, design and procurement.  The full report can be accessed at</p><p><i><font color="#2F2F2F"></font></i><i><font color="#2F2F2F">.</font></i></p><p>The social housing Public Private Partnership (PPP) programme, provides for an investment of &euro;300 million and is expected to deliver 1,500 social housing units in total, via three bundles.  The first bundle comprises six PPP sites, delivering over 500 units in the Greater Dublin Area.  Two of the sites are located in Dublin City, with one each in South Dublin, Kildare, Wicklow and Louth.  The second bundle, comprising eight PPP sites, will deliver over 450 units across the country.  Three of the sites are located in County Cork, with one each in the cities of Galway and Waterford, and further sites in Counties Clare, Kildare and Roscommon.  Sites for the third bundle are currently being identified and will be announced in the coming months.</p><p>Work is ongoing to update the Rebuilding Ireland Housing Land Map to reflect the relevant elements of the Q4 2017 Social Housing Construction Status Report and the PPP Programme and details will be published on the Map, at the link referred to above, once finalised. </p><p>I have now advised all local authorities of their minimum Social Housing Targets both for 2018 and also for the multi-annual period to 2021, details of which can be accessed on my Department's website at:</p><p>. </p><p>In relation to the delivery of affordable homes, I am providing funding of &euro;25 million, over 2018 and 2019, to unlock local authority-owned lands specifically for affordable homes to buy or rent.  I intend to issue a call for proposals shortly in this regard.  Overall, initial estimates suggest that in the region of 3,000 new affordable homes can be made available through a range of schemes and initiatives, with the long-term ambition for some 10,000 additional affordable homes to be provided for sale or rent, as the full range of initiatives are rolled out. </p><p>Dublin City Council already has two sites, at O'Devaney Gardens and Oscar Traynor Road, being procured on the basis of a 30% social; 20% affordable purchase and 50% private market housing mix.  Dublin City Council is progressing the procurement of these sites as a top priority.  In total, the two sites will deliver over 1,200 new build homes.  Around 240 will be available for affordable purchase.  South Dublin County Council is also progressing one of its major sites, capable of yielding almost 1,000 new homes, at Kilcarberry in Clondalkin, on a 30% social and 70% private mix.</p></reply>

My Department supports the fire authorities through setting general policy, providing a central training programme, issuing guidance on operational and other related matters and providing capital funding for priority infrastructural projects.</p>  <p>  Donegal County Council, in partnership with my Department, has made substantial progress in modernising fire stations in County Donegal and has replaced 12 of the 15 fire stations following investment of some &euro;11 million by my Department.  The following towns in County Donegal are now served by modern fire stations with full facilities: Milford (1998); Buncrana (2000); Letterkenny (HQ) and An F&aacute;l Carrach (both in 2003); Carndonagh and Donegal Town (both in 2004); Killybegs (2005); An Cloch&aacute;n Liath, Glenties and Moville (all in 2007); and most recently Gaoth Dobhair and Stranorlar (2009).  My Department has channelled significant investment to fire authorities over the last number of years and as a consequence, the high quality of Ireland&rsquo;s fire service infrastructure is now widely acknowledged.</p>  <p>  In February 2016, my Department announced a five-year Fire Services Capital Programme with an allocation of &euro;40 million, based on the current annual &euro;8 million allocation, to be used for the purchase of fire appliances and specialist equipment, building or upgrading of prioritised Fire Stations, an upgrade of the Communications and Mobilisation system and improvements to Training Centres. </p>  <p>  The provision of a new fire station in South Donegal has been the subject of discussions for a number of years.  While a station is not included in the five year programme referred to above, my Department is liaising with Donegal County Council and has indicated clearly that it will consider a proposal for advancing a fire station project in the south of the county to finalise the fire station programme in Donegal.  I understand that the Council is currently undertaking a process to inform a fire station proposal, with a view to its submission to my Department thereafter.</p>  <p>  In further considering any proposal, my Department will have regard to established national priorities for funding in this area and the totality of requests from fire authorities countrywide, as well as the value for money offered by the proposal.  </p></reply>

Recognising that people want a choice of affordable purchase and rental, depending on their stage of life and circumstances, we are progressing both.  </p><p>On 22 January, I announced a package of initiatives to help alleviate affordability pressures faced by households, particularly in those areas of high housing demand and high accommodation costs.  The measures announced include the establishment of the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan, the re-introduction of an affordable purchase scheme, and the introduction of cost rental projects.  Further details on the suite of initiatives announced on 22 January can be found at</p><p><i>.</i></p><p>The Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan is designed to enable credit-worthy first-time buyers to access sustainable mortgage lending to purchase new or second-hand properties in a suitable price range.  The scheme is targeted at first-time buyers who have access to an adequate deposit and have the capacity to repay a mortgage, but who are unable to access a mortgage sufficient for them to purchase their first home.  In order to be eligible for the scheme, single applicants must not be earning more than &euro;50,000 per annum and the combined income of joint applicants must not be greater than &euro;75,000 per annum.</p><p>In terms of affordable purchase, the new Scheme will be based on the relevant provisions of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, which will be commenced shortly, and enabling regulations which are in preparation.  The income thresholds will be the same as for the home loan and other criteria will be set out in the regulations.  The elected members of each local authority will be responsible for determining the order of priority to be accorded to eligible households, in line with the framework of the national scheme. </p><p>Dublin City Council already has two sites, at O'Devaney Gardens and Oscar Traynor Road, being procured on the basis of a 30% social, 20% affordable purchase and 50% private market housing mix.  Dublin City Council is progressing the procurement of these sites as a top priority. In total, the two sites will deliver over 1,200 new build homes. </p><p>In addition, the Government is determined to make cost rental a major part of the Irish housing system, similar to the role it plays in many European countries.  Under this approach, rents are set at levels to recover the construction costs and to facilitate the management and administration of developments, but with only a minimal profit margin included.  A pilot project is currently being progressed by D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, at Enniskerry Road, Dundrum, in conjunction with the Housing Agency and Approved Housing Bodies (AHB), using land owned by the Agency.  This pilot is providing very valuable learning to inform the wider roll-out. We are now working with the EIB and other stakeholders with a view to announcing the first major cost rental project in Dublin shortly, with a cost rental programme across Dublin and other cities to follow.</p><p>Importantly, the new measures announced in January of this year are specifically targeted at delivering more affordable homes from our State land bank in urban areas where affordability issues are greatest, and have the potential to deliver more than 3,000 new affordable homes to buy or rent initially, with a target delivery of at least 10,000 new affordable homes across all initiatives in the longer term. </p><p>Recognising that there may be enabling infrastructure requirements on some sites, I am also providing Exchequer funding of &euro;25 million, over 2018 and 2019, as a key contribution towards the delivery of more affordable housing. Applications for this funding will be invited shortly.</p></reply>

The day-to-day operation of the social housing system is a matter for the relevant local authority.  The allocation of social housing support is a matter for the relevant local authority in accordance with the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 and associated regulations.  Section 22 of the Act requires all housing authorities, as a reserved function, to make an allocation scheme determining the order of priority to be accorded in the allocation of dwellings to households qualified for social housing support and to households approved for a transfer, the allocation of which would, in the opinion of the authority, meet the accommodation needs and requirements of the households.</p><p>Under the Housing Acts 1966 to 2009, I, as Minister, have no function in relation to the assessment of individual housing applications and the allocation of accommodation to eligible households, which are matters solely for housing authorities.  Section 6 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 specifically provides that the Minister&rsquo;s power to issue policy directions and guidelines to housing authorities in relation to their housing functions shall not be construed as enabling him or her to exercise any power or control in relation to any individual case with which a housing authority is or may be concerned.  More particularly, section 22(17) of the 2009 Act provides that the Minister&rsquo;s statutory power to issue directions to a housing authority regarding the operation of its allocation scheme shall not be construed as enabling him or her to direct the allocation of a dwelling to a specific household.</p><p>In terms of meeting the need of households on waiting lists across the country, there are a range of social housing supports which qualified households may avail of in order to meet their housing needs.  In addition to traditional social housing built and provided directly by local authorities, support is also provided via the private rental sector through the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) and Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) and through the voluntary sector via approved housing bodies. </p><p>Rebuilding Ireland set ambitious targets for social housing delivery.  I have made it clear to local authorities that the delivery of social housing supports must be focussed on and consistent with their assessments of housing need, a process which now takes place on an annual basis. </p><p>Last year, an additional &euro;500 million was secured during Budget 2018 negotiations, to increase the social housing delivery ambition from 47,000 to 50,000 social housing homes by end 2021.  Combined with the target to deliver 88,000 tenancies under the HAP and RAS, this means that our total investment of &euro;6 billion will meet the needs of over 138,000 individuals and families over the lifetime of the Rebuilding Ireland plan. </p><p>The implementation of Rebuilding Ireland is well underway and significant progress is being made with just under 45,000 households having had their social housing need met by the end of year 2 of the Plan, some 33% of those targeted.  Details of output by local authority and by scheme are available on the statistics page of my Department's website at the following link:</p><p><i></i></p></reply>

A reduction of 10% per annum is given for each full year of occupancy between 10 and 20 years and after 20 years of full occupancy, no refund would be due to the local authority.</p>  <p>  However, where a person is selling an affordable home and the clawback amount payable would reduce the proceeds of resale below the initial price actually paid, the legislation provides for the amount of the clawback payable to be reduced to the extent necessary to avoid that result.</p>  <p>  In terms of new affordability initiatives, the Government is committed to ensuring that housing is affordable to buy or rent for households on low to moderate incomes.  With regard to affordable purchase, I intend to establish a new scheme, to be based on the relevant provisions of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, which will be commenced shortly, and enabling regulations which are in preparation. In this regard, the inclusion of households as "eligible" for the purpose of the new scheme, including those that have purchased under previous affordable housing schemes, but whose current accommodation needs require the household to relocate to a different dwelling, are under active consideration.</p></reply>

The new loan enables credit-worthy first-time buyers to access sustainable mortgage lending to purchase new or second-hand properties in a suitable price range.  The low rate of fixed interest associated with the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan provides first-time buyers with access to mortgage finance that they may not have otherwise been able to afford at a higher interest rate. </p>  <p>  As with previous local authority house purchase loan finance, the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan is available to first-time buyers only. This is to ensure the effective targeting of limited resources and there is no change in this regard. </p>  <p>  The low interest rates for the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan have been secured through the raising of &euro;200 million by the Housing Finance Agency (HFA) on a fixed-rate basis for periods out to thirty years' maturity.  Based on the pricing achieved, local authorities can offer a first tranche of fixed-rate annuity finance to eligible borrowers at rates of 2.0% and 2.25% per annum, for terms of up to 25 and 30 years respectively, up to an aggregate maximum of &euro;200 million.</p>  <p>  As such, these conditions are solely available to new applicants under the specific terms and conditions of the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan.

In this regard, I recently wrote to all local authorities setting out their individual social housing targets across build, acquisition and leasing for 2018 and also for 2018-2021. Details of these are available on the Rebuilding Ireland website at the following link:</p><p><i>.</i></p><p>Rebuilding Ireland, together with initiatives announced on foot of the targeted review of progress which was undertaken last year, as well as additional measures announced under Budget 2018, provides a robust framework for addressing the housing and homelessness challenges we face.  My Department's focus, and that of all delivery agents, will remain on implementation and delivery to ensure that the range of objectives and targets set are achieved. A wide range of delivery mechanisms and a funding commitment of &euro;6 billion over the lifetime of Rebuilding Ireland have been put in place to support the achievement of these targets. </p><p>In terms of setting and publishing targets for 2018 and 2018-2021, I want to drive transparency and also accountability at local authority level. Rebuilding Ireland is modelled on blended delivery across the main programmes of build, acquisition and leasing. While it is recognised that the pace of delivery, particularly under build activity, may vary from local authority to local authority, the range of delivery options available, combined with the support structures outlined, provide the necessary resources for local authorities and I expect all stakeholders to be fully mobilised towards meeting the target for 2018, and subsequent years.</p><p>In respect of build targets for 2018, a strong pipeline is already in place for local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies to deliver on these targets. The 2018 build target is for the delivery of 4,969 additional social housing homes, including 3,819 local authority and Approved Housing Body build units. The Quarter 4 2017 Construction Status Report, available on the Rebuilding Ireland website at the link below, provides project detail on the existing pipeline in place, which will support the delivery against this target. The report is based on activity up to end 2017 and, over the course of the first quarter of 2018, further projects will have been moving through from approval to on-site, with additional projects also being added to the pipeline. These will be reflected in the next quarterly report.</p><p><i></i>.</p><p>My Department will continue to work with local authorities to maximise delivery and also harness appropriate opportunities to deliver on additional build units in 2018, including through turnkey schemes.</p></reply>

It will provide a sustainable and modern flagship venue aimed at promoting Irish culture in a key global city, engaging our large diaspora in America and in turn further deepening the strong bilateral relationship with the US, which are key strategic priorities for Ireland.  </p>  <p>  The most recent capital grant support for the centre which totalled &euro;2.128m was announced by the Taoiseach in March 2018.  &euro;1m of this award came from the subhead A15 of the Vote of the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and &euro;1.128m was awarded by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  </p>  <p>  The Government looks forward to the completion of the centre and to deepening the relationship with the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht through the ongoing partnership with Culture Ireland, which has supported the centre's annual programme of Irish arts. Culture Ireland funding for the presentation of Irish artists in the centre's programme in 2018 is &euro;220,000.</p></reply>
