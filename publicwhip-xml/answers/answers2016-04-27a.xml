Mindful of the current and ongoing discussions on Government formation any further development of policy will be a matter for the incoming Government.</p>  <p>  The current position is that the department has a cohort of jobseeker customers who are classified as casual jobseekers.  These are in-work customers who can claim a jobseekers payment for 2 to 3 days per week or who work week on/week-off.  These customers are paid by cheque each week.  Not all customers will be paid every week due to their changeable work patterns.</p>  <p>  I want to emphasise that these customers have been paid by cheque due to the changing nature of their work/claiming patterns and the short turn-around time to issue payments.  It is important to note that they are not paid via post offices under the department&rsquo;s existing cash payments contract with An Post.  </p>  <p>  In line with the National Payments Plan, my department is seeking to reduce its usage of cheques as a payment method; this is not only a matter of decreasing the significant costs associated with cheques in the department and wider economy but also of moving to a more secure method of payment and enhancing customer convenience.</p>  <p>  When paid by cheque, customers have the option of lodging them direct to their accounts or negotiating them at banks or the Post Office.  The evidence available to the department is that the vast majority of the department&rsquo;s customers paid by cheque choose to lodge them direct to their accounts. </p>  <p>  The department has developed its payment capacity in respect of changing work and claiming patterns and is able to offer payments direct to accounts in financial institutions for casual Jobseeker customers thereby increasing customer convenience.  This is in line with wider departmental policy where the focus is on ensuring that in-work customers are paid by the most convenient method possible.</p>  <p>  Consequently the department has written to its casual Jobseeker customers asking them to provide their account details to enable direct payments to financial institutions.</p>  <p>  I want to emphasise that the department does not issue these cheque payments to Post Offices; they are issued directly to the department&rsquo;s customers.  This process does not reduce the number of existing cash payments through Post Offices under the current contract between the department and An Post. </p>  <p>  I want to reiterate that what the department is doing is moving customers from cheque payments to the much more secure, customer convenient and cost effective payment method of payment directly into accounts in financial institutions.  This is entirely consistent with the National Payments Plan and in line with payment methods that now prevail across the economy.  The department must consider the most efficient payment method for our customers who are in employment most of whom get their salary payment into bank accounts.  To have weekly income (work + welfare) payable in two different ways is a highly inappropriate and costly way of dealing with people in employment. The department&rsquo;s focus must be on our customers.</p>  <p>  Customer choice will be maintained.  Customers, if they wish, may continue to receive cheque payments in the medium term.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-04-27a.22.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016042700051#WRA01500"><p>I am advised by Revenue that interest is a statutory charge that is applicable where tax payments are received after the relevant due date. </p>  <p>  Interest is collected in the course of late payment intervention programmes and is always a component of tax audit, of tax debt enforcement activity and of phased payment arrangements.  It is designed to compensate the Exchequer for loss of revenue through late payment of tax, to encourage timely payments in future and to ensure equity for the majority of taxpayers who pay on time.  For the years 2011 to 2015 Revenue collected interest amounts of &euro;83m, &euro;63m, &euro;92m, &euro;88m and &euro;101m respectively under these programmes. </p>  <p>  The current rate of interest  in respect of late payment of Income Tax, Corporation Tax, Capital Gains Tax, Capital Acquisition Tax, Local Property Tax and Stamp Duty liabilities is 8% per annum (0.0219% per day), while the rate in respect of all other taxes, for example PAYE/PRSI and VAT, is 10% per annum (0.0274% per day).</p>  <p>  The only circumstance where tax is written out (forgone) is, where a business/taxpayer is adjudicated insolvent, has ceased to trade with no assets, where collection is uneconomic to pursue, or where collection would cause undue hardship.  Where tax is written out in these circumstances, the associated interest automatically falls but could be reinstated along with the tax if the taxpayer's financial circumstances subsequently improved.</p>  <p>  Statistics on the amount of interest forgone on foot of the primary charge to tax being written out are not maintained by Revenue. However, for the years 2011 to 2015, Revenue wrote out tax amounts of &euro;321m (115,760 cases), &euro;287m (124,641 cases), &euro;263m (151,204 cases), &euro;228m (150,824 cases) and &euro;170m (159,144 cases) respectively.  For each year, the vast majority of the write outs (approx. 94%) are lower value amounts of between &euro;1 and &euro;100 that were forgone on grounds of being 'uneconomic to pursue'. </p></reply>

Under this provision, pension contributions that are not relieved from tax in the year in which they are paid, due to a restriction on the maximum percentage of an employee's yearly remuneration in respect of which relief can be granted, are carried forward to a subsequent tax year or years and treated as having been paid in the later year or years.  I set out full details of the operation of the annual restriction on pension contributions and the carry-forward procedure in my response to the Deputy's previous questions in this matter on 20 April last. </p>  <p>  While details of amounts carried forward in the manner described are not separately identifiable, the cost of the relief for such amounts is captured in the overall figure for relief in respect of payments made, and treated as made, in each year.</p></reply>

The consistent feedback from developers and builders is that this specialist form of residential development lending is needed to kick start the housing market.</p>  <p>  In terms of drawdown profiles, as well as the value and pricing of specific loans, this is commercially sensitive information and not for disclosure.  However we can confirm that the interest rate for each project will reflect the level of risk taken on by Activate.  The Activate base lending rate is in the order of 10% approximately.  As would be expected for projects of this nature, there is participation in equity upside if projects are successful so that the fund, and by extension taxpayers, share in any gains alongside the project promoter.</p></reply>

Local authorities are also responsible for maintaining flood alleviation works they undertake.  The Office of Public Works operates a Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme.  This administrative Scheme's eligibility criteria, including a requirement that any measures are cost beneficial, are published on the OPW website, <i><i>www.opw.ie</i></i>.  It is not available for repair of damaged infrastructure or for maintenance of existing flood defence or coastal protection assets.

Following the finalisation of the flood mapping and the identification of preliminary flood risk management options, the final output from this important project will be integrated Flood Risk Management Plans containing specific measures that can address in a comprehensive and sustainable way the significant flood risks identified in the Shannon River Basin District.  The Plans will include a prioritised list of measures, both structural and non-structural, that can address flood risk in an environmentally sustainable and cost effective manner.  Further information on the Programme is available on <i><i>www.cfram.ie</i></i>. </p><p>The Government recently announced increased levels of investment in the area of flood relief as part of the overall Capital Investment Plan 2016-2021 and this investment programme will allow for consideration of measures arising from the Flood Risk Management Plans.</p></reply>

These exemption threshold increases remove PSPR entirely from a significant number of pensions with relatively lower values, while those pensions which continue to be impacted by PSPR receive a boost of &euro;400 per year.</p>  <p>  On 1 January 2017, additional PSPR amelioration, acting principally via further exemption threshold increases, will fully remove PSPR from another significant tranche of public service pensioners, while at the same time boosting those pensions which remain affected by PSPR by &euro;500 per year. </p>  <p>  On 1 January 2018, the third stage of PSPR amelioration will ensure that all PSPR-impacted pensions with values up to &euro;34,132 will be fully restored, meaning that PSPR will no longer affect such pensions, while those pensions which continue to be impacted by PSPR will get a boost of, in most cases, &euro;780 per year.</p>  <p>  These PSPR changes under FEMPI 2015 deliver on my commitment to restore the pensions of retired public servants as early as economic and fiscal progress allowed, with an initial focus on those receiving relatively lower pensions.  This pension restoration across the public service will cost an estimated &euro;90 million on an annual basis and, when fully implemented, will ensure that only the top 20% higher value public service pensions will continue to be impacted by the PSPR.</p></reply>

The functions of the Tribunal have, since 1 October 2015, been taken over by the new Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court under the provisions of the Workplace Relations Act 2015.

The mechanism for enforcing determinations of the Employment Appeals Tribunal is also prescribed in the relevant legislation and, generally, this involves an application to the Circuit Court for an order directing compliance, or instituting proceedings in the District Court as the case may be. </p><p>The legislation also prescribes who may apply to the courts to enforce the determinations.  In most cases, determinations are enforced by or on behalf of the complainant.  However, in some instances the Minister for Jobs Enterprise and Innovation may, if he considers it appropriate, apply on behalf of a party when requested to do so.  The Inspection and Enforcement Division of the Workplace Relations Commission initiate these proceedings on behalf of the Minister and parties should contact the Commission for further information.</p><p>A comprehensive guide to the various appeals and implementation procedures open to employees who are in receipt of decisions from the Employment Appeals Tribunal can be found on the Workplace Relations website, in a document called &ldquo;2016 Employee Decision Notes&rdquo; on the Employment Appeals Tribunal web page.

The levy was payable by the milk producers who contributed to the overrun of the national milk quota.  Such an over production occurred in the 2014/2015 milk quota year - the final year of the milk quota regime.  Given the very high volumes of milk produced across the EU in that final year, the consequent high levels of super levy incurred, and the declining milk prices, the EU Commission introduced a provision whereby Member States were permitted to facilitate the payment of the super levy by the milk producers in three annual instalments, without interest, on the understanding that the full amount of the levy was paid to the Commission by the Member State in year 1.  In recognition of the burden on Irish milk producers to pay the high levies, I asked my Department to put in place a Super levy Instalment Scheme.</p>  <p>  The Scheme, introduced last June and which is backed by EU and national legislation, allowed applicants to pay at least one third of their levy by October 2015 and the Exchequer would pay the remaining on the understanding that applicants would, as per a signed written agreement, reimburse the Exchequer in ten equal instalments from the months of May to September in 2016 and 2017. </p>  <p>  The person named by the Deputy was an applicant under this Scheme.</p>  <p>  I raised the possibility of extending this scheme at the Council of Ministers.

At the outset <i>emergency feedstuff was made available through the provision of supplementary concentrate feed, including over the Christmas period.  A Fodder Aid scheme was also introduced to replace fodder supplies damaged or lost in floods. </i>Support under this scheme applied to the loss of stored fodder such as silage, hay, straw and concentrates.</p><p><i>Loss of production potential of grassland due to flood damage was not eligible for support under either the Fodder Scheme or a subsequent Emergency Flood Damage Relief Measure.  The latter provided for targeted support to those that bore the brunt of the flooding through loss of livestock, movement of livestock off-holding or damage to farm buildings and fittings.</i></p><p>The risk of flooding is an ongoing problem for farming on the banks of the river Shannon.  To develop solutions to this problem the Government approved the Terms of Reference for the Shannon Flood Risk State Agency Co-ordination Working Group under the chairmanship of the Office of Public Works.  This group brings together in a co-ordinated manner, all statutory organisations and functions that involve the Shannon Catchment.</p><p>At national level, the Office of Public Works, in close partnership with all Local Authorities, is working to deliver on the objectives of the Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management programme.  This programme covers the assessment of flood risk, planning of flood risk management and implementation of flood-mitigation measures in all areas potentially affected by future flooding.</p></reply>

That Plan includes 24 actions to drive the sustainable development of the aquaculture sector.  Implementation of the Plan is supported through two dedicated schemes under the EMFF Seafood Development Operational Programme, which I launched on 14 January 2016, which have a combined investment budget of almost &euro;30 million.  These are a Knowledge Gateway Scheme and a Sustainable Aquaculture Scheme.</p>  <p>  The Plan targets an increase of 45,000 tonnes in output from the aquaculture sector by 2023.  I am aiming to achieve this growth from a combination of increased and or restored productivity from the existing aquaculture licence portfolio and from a limited number of new licences.  The make-up of this increased output will include shellfish, finfish, novel species and seaweed in a variety of different production systems, both intensive and extensive. </p>  <p>  Given the very wide variability of production systems and the large number of species being farmed, with more to be added into the future, the Plan notes that it is not feasible to offer a meaningful prediction of precisely which species and which production systems will yield the projected increases in specific years.  However, I have included in the Plan a specific target of a 30% increase in production derived from recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS).</p>  <p>  Considerable international developmental effort is being put into determining the commercial viability of land based RAS systems for the large scale production of salmon.  There appears to be a market niche for such a product if the current technological challenges associated with an economically viable production system can be overcome.  The two schemes I mentioned earlier are promoting and incentivising applied research into RAS and private investment in RAS production.  I would welcome an increase beyond the 30% target, but the ultimate increase achieved from RAS will be determined by market forces, the pace of technological development in the industry and the extent of private investment in RAS.</p></reply>

I have continuously raised the issue with Commissioners Malmstr&ouml;m and Hogan, both within the Council of Agriculture Ministers and in written form.  I also continue to monitor the situation closely in co-operation with my Member State colleagues, as well as with my Government colleagues, particularly the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, and the Taoiseach.  These efforts are being reinforced at official level through similar contacts with other Member States and with the Commission, particularly through the Special Committee on Agriculture and the Trade Policy Committee.</p>  <p>  Ireland has already expressed its very strong concerns in relation to the latest developments in these negotiations.  These concerns have been reinforced by the large number of Member States who have spoken on this issue at recent Council and Commission meetings.  They have also been expressed in joint papers presented by large groupings of Member States (including Ireland) at these meetings, and in written correspondence from Member State Ministers (again, including Ireland) to the Commissioners for Trade and for Agriculture.</p>  <p>  In the course of such contacts Ireland has pointed out that an exchange of offers is premature, and that any movement in these negotiations must be undertaken with great caution, and following a period of careful reflection and analysis.  This analysis must take into account the cumulative impact of concessions granted under other FTAs and the current forecasts for EU beef consumption. We are also trying to ensure that tariff rate quotas are not dealt with at this early stage of the negotiations, and that when they are ultimately addressed, it will be in a manner that mitigates to the maximum possible extent the potential impact on the beef sector.</p></reply>

The Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme is the largest single programme administered by my Department - this provides free pre-school care and education to all children before they commence primary school.  This programme has ensured that children from disadvantaged backgrounds who would previously have been unable to access pre-school services are in a position to avail of quality pre-school education.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2016, the Government announced additional annual funding of &euro;85 million for childcare - this included a major expansion of the ECCE programme to a total of &euro;233 million in 2016, as well as funding for 8,000 extra places under the Community Childcare Subvention programme to help low income and disadvantaged families access quality childcare.</p>  <p>  The expansion of the ECCE scheme from September of this year will mean that children can enroll in the programme at three entry points from the time they turn three until they make the transition to primary school.  This will increase the current 38 weeks of free preschool provision by an average of 23 weeks (total of 61 weeks on average), and up to 88 weeks, depending on the child's date of birth and the age at which he or she subsequently starts primary school. This extension of free pre-school will increase the number of children benefiting from free pre-school from the current 67,000 per annum to 127,000 in a given programme year.</p>  <p>  In addition to the ECCE programme, the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme mentioned above, and the Training and Employment Childcare (TEC) programmes, are implemented by my Department and focus on children from low-income families.  In excess of &euro;78 million is provided for these programmes, which support the provision of highly subvented, part-time or full-time, childcare and education.  In February 2016, I announced the expansion of the CCS programme to private providers to enable all eligible children/parents to access this programme even if they lived in an area with no community service.  CCS funding is targeted to ensure that the parents with the greatest need obtain the greatest level of financial support. In addition to the measures funded by DCYA, the Department of Education and Skills funds 40 Early Start centres in DEIS schools in areas of socio-economic disadvantage, which offer teacher-led pre-school education to participants for 2.5 hours per day.</p>  <p>  The DCYA cannot currently provide funding  to provide additional educational classes on top of the above. </p></reply>

Since 2012, the Government has provided additional funding ring-fenced for mental health. In 2012, the Mental Health budget was &euro;711m. Today, it is &euro;827m, an increase of &euro;116m, or 16%, over this period. Overall, approximately 1,550 new posts have been approved for the mental health services since 2012 although some existing posts in that time have also been lost due to retirements and normal attrition.</p><p>Ongoing developments that occurred under the term of the outgoing Government include the development of the Counselling in Primary Care Service (CIPC) for adults over 18 years who are medical card holders; a greater awareness of fostering mental health promotion in society through campaigns like the 'Let's Talk' campaign and 'The Little Things'; the publication last year of the Expert Review Group Report on the Mental Health Act 2001 and the new Suicide Prevention Strategy <i>'Connecting for Life';</i>reducing Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) waiting lists for those waiting over 12 Months; commencing works for the new National Forensic Hospital to replace Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum; the development of counselling services across both primary and secondary care, including early intervention at primary care level, and five new Jigsaw youth mental health services planned for Cork (2), Dublin (2) and Limerick and development of Perinatal Mental Health Services.</p><p>In addition, funding has been made available to facilitate the transfer of some patients from the Forensic Mental Health Services to the community, investment in high observation in acute mental health units, the improvement of  24/7 services through additional liaison psychiatry services, new clinical programmes for dual diagnosis and adults with ADHD, provision of additional clinical space in community services and more funds for clinical programmes directed at eating disorders, self-harm in Emergency Departments and early intervention in psychosis.</p></reply>

The Act obliges the HSE to assess whether a person is unable, without undue hardship, to arrange general practitioner services for himself or herself and his or her family, having regard to his or her overall financial position and reasonable expenditure and every application must be assessed on that basis.  Under the legislation, having a particular illness, in itself, does not establish eligibility for a medical card and therefore, the medical conditions of applicants for this scheme are not monitored on that basis.  Where the applicant's income is within the income guidelines, a medical card or GP visit card will be awarded.</p><p>Every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to support applicants in applying for a medical card and, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines.  In certain circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds his or her income threshold, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness.  Social and medical issues are considered when determining whether undue hardship exists for an individual accessing general practitioner or other medical services.  The HSE affords applicants the opportunity to furnish supporting information and documentation to fully take account of all the relevant circumstances that may benefit them in the assessment, including medical evidence of cost and necessary expenses.</p><p>The HSE has a system in place for the provision of medical cards in response to an emergency situation for persons with a serious medical condition in need of urgent or on-going medical care that they cannot afford and persons in palliative care, who are terminally ill.  With the exception of terminally ill patients all medical cards, granted on an emergency basis, are issued on the basis that the patient is eligible for a medical card on the basis of means or undue hardship, and will follow up with a full application within a number of weeks of receiving the medical card eligibility.  These cards are issued within 24 hours of receipt of the required patient details and a letter which confirms the medical condition from a doctor or consultant. For terminally ill persons, no means test applies and the cards are not reviewed.</p><p>The Deputy may be aware of the &quot;Keane&quot; <i>Report of the Expert Panel on Medical Need for Medical Card Eligibility,</i>which made a recommendation that a person&rsquo;s means should remain the main qualifier for a medical card.  It also recommended that it is neither feasible nor desirable to list conditions in priority order for medical card eligibility.</p><p>On foot of the Keane Report, the HSE established a Clinical Advisory Group to develop clinical oversight and guidance for the operation of a more compassionate and trusted medical card system.  The Director General of the HSE, on accepting an interim recommendation of the Group, made a decision to award medical card eligibility to all children under 18 years of age with a diagnosis of cancer from 1 July 2015, with the card to be held for a period of five years.  The Clinical Advisory Group is continuing its work on the development of guidance on assessing medical card applications involving significant medical conditions.</p><p>It is clear that there are people with medical needs and it is important that they should be able to access necessary assistance in a straight forward manner.  Greater discretion is being exercised by the HSE as evidenced by the number of discretionary medical cards in circulation, which has increased from about 52,000 in mid-2014 to over 103,000 at 1 April 2016.</p><p>I can clarify for the Deputy that Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p></reply>

The GIS uses data from the Central Statistics Office, Ordnance Survey Ireland, the Department of Social Protection and my Department's own databases.  With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises at primary and post primary level to determine where additional school accommodation is needed.  The outcome of the latest demographic exercises was that in November 2015, I announced the establishment of 13 new schools to open nationwide in 2017 and 2018.</p>  <p>  The school planning areas in County Kildare are experiencing some demographic growth, however, not to such an extent that would currently warrant new school provision.  These areas are being kept under ongoing review by my Department to take account of updated enrolment data and also the impact of existing and planned capacity increases to existing schools in the school planning areas.</p>  <p>  I also announced, in November 2015, the major school projects, including those for Kildare, that will commence construction from 2016 - 2021 as part of my Six-Year Programme.  The programme aims to prioritise new building projects and major extensions, including special schools, in areas where significant demographic need has been established.  The Programme also provides for devolved funding for additional classrooms for schools outside the plan where an immediate enrolment need has been identified, such as the appointment of an additional teacher.  In addition, the Programme prioritises projects that have a major deficit of mainstream accommodation capacity for current enrolments, require major refurbishment and replacement of poor accommodation and projects to provide additional accommodation to meet increases in enrolments.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that extensions to two primary schools in Clane were approved under the 5-Year Plan.  One project has been completed and the other is progressing through architectural planning.  Also, in recent years four new schools have opened in County Kildare, comprising two new primary schools which opened in 2012 and 2013 and two new post-primary schools which opened in 2014 and 2015.</p>  <p>  The current status of all projects, including those in County Kildare, may be viewed on my Department's website at www.education.ie and this will be updated regularly throughout the year.</p></reply>

The phased roll out of the HAP pilot scheme has proved to be an effective approach and my Department maintains regular contact with the pilot local authorities in order to learn from their experience of the scheme, and to address operational issues as they arise.</p><p>I believe the HAP scheme is operating well, with more than 8,700 households currently in receipt of housing support under the scheme. I am committed to the continued rollout of HAP and in that regard, I expect some 10,000 additional households to be accommodated through HAP in 2016. Plans for the roll out of the scheme to the remaining local authority areas are currently being considered. Until such time as HAP becomes operational in the remaining local authority areas, Rent Supplement will continue to be available to those households requiring support in meeting their housing needs in the rental market.</p><p>The maximum rent limits for different household classes that apply in each local authority where HAP has been commenced are set out in Regulations and are generally based on the Rent Supplement limits as set out by the Department of Social Protection (DSP).  In prescribing these limits, household size and prevailing rents in the relevant areas are taken into consideration. The Department works closely with DSP and monitors data which it gathers, along with PRTB data, and data gathered through HAP pilot authorities, in relation to the rent limits applying.</p><p>The current table of maximum monthly rent limits for the Housing Assistance Payment is set out in the <i>Housing Assistance Payment (Amendment) Regulations 2016</i>. These regulations are available online on the electronic Irish Statute Book website at: .</p><p>In recognition of the need for additional discretion in areas of high rental demand, the <i>Housing Assistance Payment (Amendment)(No.4) Regulations 2015</i>provide for an additional 20% flexibility above the maximum rent limits that apply for the purposes of HAP in the administrative areas of Cork City Council, Cork County Council, Galway County Council, Kildare County Council and Meath County Council. Levels of support provided under the pilot scheme for Homeless Households, which operates across the four housing authorities in the Dublin Region, were also increased from 20% above to 50% above the current Rent Supplement levels by these regulations. The additional 20% flexibility was also provided to Galway City Council under the <i>Housing Assistance Payment (Amendment) Regulations 2016</i>when they commenced the scheme in February 2016. This additional flexibility facilitates a greater number of qualifying households to source suitable accommodation in these local authority areas. This approach mirrors the approach already taken by the Department of Social Protection in the operation of the discretion available in the context of the Rent Supplement scheme. My Department has provided the relevant local authorities with guidance on the appropriate use of this increased flexibility.</p><p>I will continue to keep HAP rent limits under review.</p></reply>

My Department&rsquo;s role in relation to homelessness involves the provision of a national framework of policy, legislation and funding to underpin the role of housing authorities in addressing homelessness at local level; statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of services for homeless persons rests with individual housing authorities.</p>  <p>  The Homelessness Pilot of the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme has been operational since February 2015 across the four housing authorities in the Dublin Region, including Dun Laoghaire Rathdown County Council, and is being implemented through the Dublin Region Homeless Executive. The focus of the Pilot is to transition qualified households from emergency accommodation into private rented tenancies. While eligible households may source accommodation for themselves with support of the pilot scheme,   a dedicated placement team, the Dublin Place-Finder Service, is also in place which engages directly with property-owners and supports qualified households to find suitable tenancies and to ensure that any additional supports that may be needed are put in place. A publicity campaign is in place on an ongoing basis in order to raise the profile of the scheme and to attract landlords to the initiative.</p>  <p>  While securing accommodation under the HAP scheme can be challenging in areas where there is a shortage of supply, the numbers of households securing accommodation under HAP continues to rise. Levels of support available under the pilot scheme for Homeless Households were increased following Budget 2016 to 50% above the current Rent Supplement levels. This increased level of support has improved the capacity of the Pilot which has been securing, on average, more than 20 tenancies a month since the enhancement, with more than 200 households currently supported by the scheme.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied with the increased number of households being accommodated with the support of the homeless HAP pilot scheme, particularly given the current constrained supply in the private rented market in the Dublin region. I and my Department continue to monitor the performance of the scheme.</p></reply>

Under the programme, funding will be distributed by Local Action Groups to rural communities in line with the local development strategies that are currently being developed within each sub-regional area in Ireland. As the value of the LEADER element of 2014-2020 Programme is less than the LEADER element of the 2007-2013 Programme, the allocations made on a county basis under the new Programme have inevitably reduced.</p><p>In determining the county allocations for the 2014-2020 LEADER programme, three objective criteria were used, namely, minimum allocation, population density and a Resource Allocation Model (RAM).  Each county was given a minimum allocation of &euro;3 million to ensure that each received a viable level of funding.  However, Cork County was allocated &euro;6 million as a minimum in order to ensure a viable allocation to each of the three administrative districts within the county, as the overall population outside of the city is almost twice that of any other county.</p><p>The methodology used to calculate the allocations was designed to ensure that the available funding was weighted towards the most rural populations and those experiencing most rural disadvantage. Using this methodology, which I am satisfied is fair and consistent, each county was allocated a proportionate share of the funding available through the LEADER elements of the RDP 2014-2020.</p><p>In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s specific queries, my Department has introduced a number of additional measures to support rural Ireland, including the Rural Economic Development Zone (REDZ)<b></b>pilot scheme currently underway and the Town and Village Enhancement scheme, which is due to be rolled out in the near future, and which will see an investment package of &euro;30 million to support the revitalisation of towns and villages with a view to improving the living and working environment in communities and enhancing their potential to support increased economic activity into the future.</p><p>These measures, coupled with increased coordination at a local level, will ensure that the impact of all available funding will be maximised to support the sustainable development of our rural communities.</p><p>In relation to the CL&Aacute;R programme, the majority of CL&Aacute;R measures were closed to new applications in 2008. While some measures accepted applications in 2009 and 2010, all were subsequently closed to new funding requests. There are no plans to reopen the CL&Aacute;  R programme or to establish a Rural Development Fund at this time.</p></reply>

Holders of a licence issued by another EU Member State may drive here on that licence and, if they take up residence here, may exchange it for the Irish equivalent.  With some non-EU countries, we have agreements on mutual exchange of driving licences.  People in this situation can drive here for up to a year on a visitor basis on their own licence.  If they take up residence, they will be able to apply to exchange their licence for the Irish equivalent.</p>  <p>  In cases where people come from a country with which we do not have an exchange relationship - and this includes the USA - once again, people may drive here for up to a year on their own licence on a visitor basis.  If they stay for longer, they will need to acquire an Irish licence.  This involves - taking a theory test; applying for a learner permit; completing the mandatory 'Essential Driver Training' course of 12 lessons; and passing the driving test.  Normally before taking the driving test, a learner must hold a learner permit for 6 months, but this is waived in the case of qualified drivers from non-exchange countries.</p>  <p>  It is not correct that a person is required to have a 2-year learning period, or a further 2 years before applying for the driving test.</p></reply>
