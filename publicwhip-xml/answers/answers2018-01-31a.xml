My speech to the European Parliament took place in Strasbourg on 17 January.</p><p>In my intervention, I spoke about the achievements of the European Union, the benefits for Ireland of EU membership, and my thoughts about how best the Union should evolve for the future. I also spoke in some detail about the Brexit negotiations. </p><p>I stressed the importance of our values and how we need to keep these to the fore as we respond to the challenges and the opportunities of the 21st century. </p><p>I said that Europe needs a forward-looking agenda with ambition and direction. Rather than looking for great institutional changes, we should focus on implementing what we have already agreed. This should include completing the Single Market, the Digital Single Market, the Capital Markets Union and Banking Union, with a view to delivering concrete benefits for our citizens in areas that directly affect their lives.</p><p>I outlined Ireland's 'Citizens&rsquo; Dialogue on the Future of Europe' which I launched last November and which will run until 9 May, Europe Day. Our aim with this is to facilitate an open and wide-ranging debate with our citizens. </p><p>On Brexit, I highlighted the unique challenges this poses for Ireland. I thanked the European Parliament for its strong support and solidarity in the negotiations to date, and stressed the need to ensure that the commitments and principles agreed in December are translated into the Withdrawal Agreement. I also noted our ambition for a close and comprehensive future relationship between the EU and the UK. </p><p>In their interventions, MEPs reiterated their support for Ireland in relation to Brexit.  I welcome President Juncker's statement that &quot;we are all Irish&quot; as well as the Commission&rsquo;s commitment to propose continued PEACE funding beyond 2020. </p><p>In addition to the debate itself, I had a bilateral meeting with President Tajani. I thanked him for his support for Ireland in relation to Brexit. We exchanged views about the future of Europe, and I expressed appreciation for his initiative in bringing forward the series of debates in the European Parliament.</p><p>I also had a bilateral meeting with the European Parliament&rsquo;s Chief Brexit Coordinator, Guy Verhofstadt. We discussed developments since our last meeting in September and I expressed my sincere appreciation to Mr. Verhofstadt for his understanding and commitment to ensuring that Ireland's unique concerns are addressed.</p><p>I also attended a lunch hosted by the First Vice President of the Parliament, which was attended by party group leaders and other MEPs. </p><p>I met briefly and exchanged a few words with Commission President Juncker and the Head of the Brexit Task Force, Michel Barnier, although I did not have a formal bilateral meeting with either. </p><p>I had a short bilateral meeting with Commission Vice President Katainen in relation to Mercosur. I emphasised our commitment to free trade generally but highlighted our strong concerns around the beef sector, and our views on what should and should not be potentially included in any agreement.</p></reply>

This included &euro;1 million investment in sports facilities and projects; &euro;700,000 spent on local community projects targeting children and youths; &euro;100,000 for drugs related projects; and over &euro;3 million   on physical improvement works including, roads, housing areas, parks, lighting, and refurbishment of Sean McDermott Swimming Pool. </p>  <p>  The &euro;2.5m provided in 2017 was allocated for a range of projects across the four key priority areas of crime and drugs; education, training and employment opportunities; services for families and young people; and physical improvements. Most of these projects are well underway including, an outreach project targeting street dealing; a focused programme of street clean-up and litter prevention; a construction skills course and dedicated employment and career guidance service; enhanced counselling and related services for young people; further physical improvements including installing of CCTV at key locations and delivery of cross-community events and small grants to local projects.   </p>  <p>  Government has also provided funding under the Department of Rural and Community Development's RAPID subhead for 2018 on the same basis as 2017. This will provide another &euro;2.5 million mixture of capital and current funding to be allocated by the NEIC Board. In addition, funding has also been provided in 2018 to support the development of a pilot social employment scheme, details of which is currently being developed under the direction of the NEIC Board.</p>  <p>  The Board will shortly publish its 2017 Report, including comprehensive details of spending to date.</p></reply>

Combined with the target to deliver 88,000 tenancies under the Housing Assistance Payment  and Rental Accommodation Schemes, this means that we will meet the needs of over 138,000 individuals and families over the lifetime of the Rebuilding Ireland plan. </p>  <p>  I recently published details of the 2017 provisional social housing outputs in 2017. During last year,  just under 26,000 households had their social housing need met, well ahead of the target of just over 21,000. It should be noted that to date under Rebuilding Ireland, just under 45,000 households have had their social housing need met. We will continue to maintain a clear focus  on delivery each year to 2021, ensuring that the ambitious targets set out in Rebuilding Ireland are fully achieved.</p></reply>

However, Rebuilding Ireland is focused on accelerating delivery of housing across all tenures and a comprehensive programme of action is well underway. </p>  <p>  One of the most significant areas of the Government's attention has been on social housing, which will see investment of more than &euro;6 billion to deliver 50,000 social housing homes through build, refurbishment, acquisitions and leasing, over the period to 2021. In relation to social housing developments, the latest status report at end Q3 2017 for construction projects is available on my Department's website. The report shows a significant level of activity being undertaken by Wexford County Council, in conjunction with Approved Housing Bodies, across 38 projects, delivering in the region of 390 homes. In addition, the Council is undertaking feasibility work on  a number of further  projects, with the potential to deliver almost 180 additional homes.</p>  <p>  In relation to full year outputs for 2017, provisional details on the number of social housing homes delivered across the country, were published on 15 January 2018. A breakdown of these homes in terms of build, refurbishment, acquisitions and leasing, across all local authority areas, including Wexford, will be made available shortly, following completion of the necessary validation process.</p>  <p>  In addition to the provision of adequate funding, the availability of suitable lands for development is key to ensuring the delivery of sufficient housing supply.  All local authorities have been requested to prepare Strategic Development and Management Plans for residential lands in their ownership to ensure they are brought forward for development at the earliest opportunity. The Plans for Wexford will be reviewed by my Department once received.</p></reply>

Local authorities were allowed to proceed to design phase on all of these projects, pending final approval and sign-off of a grant agreement between my Department and Local Authorities.</p><p>To date, I have given final approval for 29 of the 34 infrastructure projects which will activate supply of almost 18,000 housing units on previously inaccessible sites, and grant agreements in respect of those projects have been signed.  The cost of these projects is &euro;177 million, of which &euro;133 million will be funded by my Department and &euro;44 million will be funded by local authorities.  Discussions on the remaining projects are being finalised or have been moved for consideration under LIHAF 2 later in 2018.</p><p>While it will not be possible to publish the local agreements reached by local authorities with developers regarding all of the associated sites, due to the commercially sensitive nature of that information, I intend to publish summary details on all the approved and advancing projects in February, once final positions regarding the remaining projects in the first tranche have been reached.</p><p>My Department is monitoring the progress of the projects and most are at the planning stage with regard to design, planning and public procurement of the public infrastructure that is being funded.  Construction works commenced for one project (Donabate Distributor Road) in December 2017 and I expect other projects to commence construction this year.  </p><p>Funding of &euro;1.67 million was drawn down in respect of projects in 2017 which was mainly in respect of design costs and it is expected that this will increase substantially in 2018 as projects move to the construction stage.  Funding for LIHAF is ring-fenced within the overall housing budget and will be available for local authorities to drawdown over the lifetime of the projects.  Through proactive management of the broader housing programme, the LIHAF underspend in 2017 was diverted to other housing activities, ensuring that the funding available in 2017 was fully applied to housing priorities.</p><p>Within the 18,000 new homes being advanced on LIHAF sites, it is expected that increased numbers of social housing over and above the 10% under Part V will be provided. Subject to the planning process and the eventual development applications made, it is estimated that approximately 3,000 of the 18,000 new homes will be for social housing purposes, made up of Part V units and additional social housing which will be provided on the 13 State-owned sites benefitting from the LIHAF-funded enabling infrastructure.  In addition, it is estimated that 1,500 affordable homes will be provided.</p><p>As required under the scheme criteria and conditions, a key focus has been to ensure that there is a proportionate dividend for the State&rsquo;s investment in infrastructure, as demonstrated by either provision of housing at scale at certain prices, a proportionate reduction in house prices across all of the homes being facilitated or a specified number of homes which will benefit from a larger price reduction. In relation to the 29 sites for which grant agreements have been signed, and subject to completion of the planning process, the number of houses committed to be delivered on each site will be set out in the following table.</p><p>Based on the information provided by the local authorities in their local agreements and analysis of current house prices in the areas concerned, and recognising the commercial sensitivity around some of the details in the agreements reached, the approved projects outside Dublin are projected to have new homes for sale towards the lower end of the bands identified, while the projects in Dublin are projected to have starter homes available towards the upper end of those bands.</p><p>Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund<table><tr><th>Local Authority</th><th>Project name</th><th>Total Cost</th><th>Projected housing delivery by 2021</th></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>Claureen, Ennis</td><td>3.66</td><td>200</td></tr><tr><td>Cork City</td><td>Old Whitechurch Road</td><td>9.89</td><td>600</td></tr><tr><td>Cork City</td><td>South Docks</td><td>15.50</td><td>620</td></tr><tr><td>Cork County</td><td>Midleton (Water-rock)</td><td>5.50</td><td>520</td></tr><tr><td>Cork County</td><td>Carrigaline</td><td>0.60</td><td>400</td></tr><tr><td>Cork County</td><td>Glanmire</td><td>5.90</td><td>300</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin City</td><td>Dodder Bridge</td><td>15.75</td><td>1500</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin City</td><td>Belmayne Clongriffin</td><td>3.00</td><td>850</td></tr><tr><td>Dun Laoghaire Rathdown</td><td>Cherrywood</td><td>15.19</td><td>2000</td></tr><tr><td>Dun Laoghaire Rathdown</td><td>Clay Farm</td><td>4.70</td><td>350</td></tr><tr><td>Dun Laoghaire Rathdown</td><td>Woodbrook Shanganagh</td><td>4.16</td><td>1242</td></tr><tr><td>Fingal</td><td>Donabate Distributor Road</td><td>15.50</td><td>1200</td></tr><tr><td>Fingal</td><td>Oldtown Mooretown</td><td>4.90</td><td>800</td></tr><tr><td>Fingal</td><td>Baldoyle Stapolin </td><td>6.18</td><td>500</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare </td><td>Sallins</td><td>0.93</td><td>250</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>Naas</td><td>6.00</td><td>800</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>Maynooth</td><td>14.50</td><td>800</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td>Ferrybank</td><td>0.62</td><td>200</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td>Western Environs</td><td>6.76</td><td>530</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>Mungret</td><td>10.50</td><td>400</td></tr><tr><td>Louth </td><td>Newtown Drogheda</td><td>1.22</td><td>200</td></tr><tr><td>Louth </td><td>Mount Avenue Dundalk</td><td>3.33</td><td>212</td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td>Ratoath</td><td>3.15</td><td>266</td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td>Farganstown, Navan</td><td>5.68</td><td>400</td></tr><tr><td>South Dublin</td><td>Kilcarbery / Corkagh Grange</td><td>4.39</td><td>1000</td></tr><tr><td>South Dublin</td><td>Clonburris SDZ</td><td>3.00</td><td>1000</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford City and County Council</td><td>Gracedieu</td><td>1.32</td><td>200</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford City and County Council</td><td>Kilbarry</td><td>3.39</td><td>400</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath</td><td>Brawny Road, Athlone</td><td>1.83</td><td>200</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Accordingly, under the vacant site levy provisions, there will be a cumulative effect associated with not activating a site for development purposes for each year that a site remains vacant or idle.</p>  <p>  Planning authorities are presently engaging in the necessary preparatory work, prior to the application of the levy with effect from January 2019 in respect of sites identified on their vacant site registers in 2018.  As required under the Act, this includes the identification of specific vacant sites for entry on the register, the registered owners of the sites in question and undertaking site valuations of the registered sites. </p>  <p>  My Department does not maintain a central register of vacant sites as each local authority administers the vacant site register in respect of their functional area. However, on foot of a recent review of the on-line vacant site registers across all local authority areas, I understand that there are collectively 238 sites currently on the local registers. 219 of these sites were entered on the local vacant site registers on 1 January 2018 and will therefore be subject to the levy in 2019, unless development works are activated in the interim.  In the Dublin area, 98 sites will, as things stand, be subject to the levy in January 2019. </p>  <p>  My Department has actively engaged with local authorities in relation to the implementation of the vacant site levy, holding information seminars for local authorities on 25 May 2016 and 8 November 2017, and issuing a circular letter to planning authorities on the detailed arrangements in relation to  implementation of the levy on 1 July 2016.  My Department will continue to monitor implementation of the levy to ensure that it is being fully used, in line with its intended purpose of incentivising the development of vacant or under-utilised sites in urban areas and so that the full potential of the measure can be realised.</p>  <p>  Following a commitment given in Budget 2015, a public consultation was conducted by the Department of Finance on the issue of unused zoned and serviced land with a view to examining what taxation measures might be taken to penalise land owners who do not develop such land.  On considering the outcome of the public consultation and further to the enactment of the Urban Regeneration and Housing Act 2015, the Department of Finance determined that no new tax intended to encourage the development of residentially zoned and serviced land - separate to the vacant site levy - would be introduced at that time. </p>  <p>  However, as announced in the recent Budget 2018, it is proposed to increase the rate of levy from 3% to 7% of the market valuation of relevant sites with effect from January 2020 in respect of sites included on the local vacant site registers in 2019. Legislative provision for this increase will be tabled by way of Seanad amendment to the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2016, which is presently at D&aacute;il Report Stage.</p></reply>

However, acknowledging that some households on the waiting list, who avail of HAP, have expectations that they would receive a more traditional form of social housing support, Ministerial directions have issued to ensure that, should they so choose, HAP recipients can avail of a move to other forms of social housing support through a transfer list.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, local authorities were also directed that HAP recipients, who apply to go on the transfer list, should get full credit for the time they spent on the waiting list and be placed on the transfer list with no less favourable terms than if they had remained on the waiting list. The practical operation of transfer lists is a matter for each local authority to manage, on the basis of their own scheme of letting priorities.  The setting of such schemes is a reserved function of the local authority and as such is a matter for the elected members.</p></reply>

The on-going costs of these agreements are funded by my Department under the SHCEP. </p>  <p>  In addition, AHBs can direct lease dwellings from private owners, and subsequently enter into a P&amp;A agreement directly with a local authority to make that dwelling available to that local authority for social housing purposes. My Department recoups the cost of these P&amp;A agreements with AHBs to the local authorities under the SHCEP. </p>  <p>  The level of payment to AHBs under P&amp;A agreements may be set at up to 92% of market rent and is agreed through negotiation with the local authority. In the case of the acquisition or construction of apartment complexes, where there are service charges that would result in a net additional cost to the AHB, the availability payment may be set at up to 95% of market rent. An availability payment in excess of 95% of market rent may be approved by my Department on a case by case basis in exceptional circumstances where there are additional costs accruing to the AHB in respect of the management and maintenance of the units.  The rent discount is applied to take account of the fact that the property owner is paid for vacant unoccupied periods, rent is paid in advance and the normal landlord tasks associated with filling voids are eliminated. </p>  <p>  At end 2017, the number of AHB dwellings in respect of which my Department is making a payment under a P&amp;A agreement at 92% of market rent is 1,740; payments in respect of a further 979 dwellings are made at the rate of 95% of market rent. These figures include dwellings funded by my Department under the Mortgage to Rent scheme.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) is a social housing support, operating since 2005, targeted at households who have been in receipt of Rent Supplement long term (i.e. greater than 18 months) and have been assessed as having a social housing need. The scheme is delivered by local authorities who, under the RAS model, source accommodation from the private market and, in general, enter into a tenancy agreement with the landlord and the RAS recipient. AHBs can also contribute to the scheme; in some instances, an AHB may either lease a property directly from a private owner and enter into a RAS agreement with a local authority, or alternatively, an AHB may own the property and similarly make it available to the local authority for a RAS tenant, under a RAS contract with the local authority. Where possible under RAS tenancies, as per guidelines set out by my Department, an 8% discount on market rent is secured on the basis of the security of the RAS payment. At end December 2016, there were 4,467 AHB tenancies existing under RAS. A breakdown of the exact discounts secured in respect of individual tenancies is not available. </p>  <p>  The Government is committed to continuing to support AHBs to contribute to the delivery of increased social housing and the achievement of the targets set out in Rebuilding Ireland.</p></reply>

It will outline a high-level, national vision for Ireland for 2040 and will provide the framework and principles to manage future population and economic growth over the next 20 years (catering for 1 million extra people, 600,000 extra jobs and over 500,000 extra homes).</p>  <p>  The forthcoming NPF is about empowering all areas to play their distinct roles in securing overall optimal national and regional development, and sets out a growth strategy to help achieve this.  In doing so, the NPF presents a long-term framework that sets out how Ireland can move away from the &lsquo;business as usual&rsquo; pattern of development.</p>  <p>In setting out a context for targeting future growth, the Framework does not seek to cap or limit the potential of places but to enable a co-ordinated and plan-led, rather than development-led, approach to their progression. The NPF identifies the need for a strategic strengthening of Ireland&rsquo;s overall urban structure, building on the recently published ESRI research paper, entitled Prospects for Irish Regions and Counties: Scenarios and Implications  .</p>  <p>  Importantly, where a settlement is not specifically identified or referenced in the Framework, there is no intention to preclude such settlements from future growth or investment. Such issues will be further considered at a regional scale as part of the Regional Spatial and Economic Strategies and at the local scale as part of the City and County Development Plan process and Local Economic and Community Plans, consistent with the general targeted pattern of development of the NPF.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the general targeted pattern of development and growth under the NPF does not mean that individual settlements or rural areas cannot exceed the targeted rate of growth, rather that not every place can exceed the targeted growth rate, which needs to be balanced on a regional and county basis.</p>  <p>  My Department has engaged regularly with the Northern and Western Regional Assembly (NWRA) throughout all stages of the preparation of the NPF, as well as with a wide range of other stakeholders. Over 1,000 submissions were received by my Department in the context of the draft NPF and all of these submissions, including the matters raised by the NWRA, will be considered in completing the final NPF.</p></reply>

The draft standards have been piloted in a number of selected services across the country and positive feedback has been received. </p>  <p>  I understand that the DRHE is preparing a final draft quality standards framework for formal submission to my Department.  On receipt of this, along with any recommendations with regard to implementation from the DRHE and the advisory group, I will give consideration to how such standards could be applied on a national basis by housing authorities.</p></reply>

There are currently more than 32,000 households having their housing needs met via HAP. </p>  <p>  Following the commencement of the provisions in the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014, HAP is considered to be a social housing support and consequently households are not eligible to remain on the main housing waiting list. However, acknowledging that households on the waiting list who avail of HAP might have expectations that they would receive a more traditional form of social housing support, Ministerial directions have issued to ensure that, should they so choose, HAP recipients can avail of a move to other forms of social housing support through a transfer list.</p>  <p>  Local authorities were also directed that HAP recipients who apply to go on the transfer list, should get full credit for the time they spent on the waiting list and be placed on the transfer list with no less favourable terms than if they had remained on the waiting list. </p>  <p>  The practical operation of transfer lists is a matter for each local authority to manage, on the basis of their own scheme of letting priorities.  The setting of such schemes is a reserved function of the local authority and as such is a matter for the elected members.</p></reply>

The Q3 2017 report details 772 schemes recently completed, on site, or undergoing planning, design or procurement, which will deliver some 12,300 homes.  The Report is available on my Department's website at the following weblink:</p><p><i>http://rebuildingireland.ie/news/quarter-3-social-housing-construction-status-report/ .</i></p><p>The Report includes details of the significant level of activity being undertaken by Fingal County Council in conjunction with Approved Housing Bodies across 34 projects, which will deliver in the region of 850 homes. Some of these projects are located in the specific areas identified.</p><p>In addition to the provision of adequate funding, the availability of suitable lands for development is key to ensuring the delivery of sufficient housing supply and it is therefore crucial that the State's housing land bank is developed as soon as possible. To this end, details of some 1,700 hectares of land in local authority and Housing Agency ownership were published on the Rebuilding Ireland Housing Land Map, with these lands having the potential to deliver some 42,500 homes nationally. The map also includes details of some 300 hectares of land in ownership of other State or semi-State bodies, with the potential to deliver a further 7,500 homes. All of the mapped sites, including sites notified by Fingal County Council, can be viewed at the following link:</p><p><i></i>.</p><p>All local authorities have been requested to prepare Strategic Development and Management Plans for residential lands in their ownership to ensure they are brought forward for development at the earliest opportunity.  The Plans, including that submitted by Fingal County Council, are currently being reviewed by my Department.

To be eligible, tenants must meet certain criteria, including having a minimum reckonable income of &euro;15,000 per annum and having been in receipt of social housing support for at least one year.</p>  <p>  The financing of any house sold under the Tenant (Incremental) Purchase Scheme is a separate matter from the eligibility criteria for the scheme.  If the tenant is deemed eligible under the scheme, he or she may fund the purchase of a house from one, or a combination, of his / her own resources or a mortgage provided by a financial institution or a local authority house purchase loan. </p>  <p>  The minimum reckonable income for eligibility under the scheme is determined by the relevant local authority in accordance with the detailed provisions of the Ministerial Direction issued under Sections 24(3) and (4) of the 2014 Act. In the determination of the minimum reckonable income, local authorities include income from a number of different sources and classes, such as from employment, private pensions, maintenance payments and certain social welfare payments, including pensions, where the social welfare payment is secondary to employment income. </p>  <p>  In determining reckonable income, the income of all tenants of the house, including adult children that are joint tenants, is included, as is the income of the spouse, civil partner or other partner / co-habitant of a tenant who lives in the house with them, thus ensuring the appropriate level of discount is applied to the purchase price.</p>  <p>  It was for reasons of ensuring the sustainability of the scheme, that the minimum income was introduced.  This was in order to demonstrate an applicant had an income of a long-term and sustainable nature, to ensure that the tenant purchasing the house is in a financial position, as the owner, to maintain and insure the property for the duration of the charged period, in compliance with the conditions of the order transferring the ownership of, and responsibility for, the house from the local authority to the tenant.</p>  <p>  In line with the commitment given in the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, a review of the first 12 months of the Tenant Purchase Scheme&rsquo;s operation has been undertaken. The review has incorporated analysis of comprehensive data received from local authorities regarding the operation of the scheme during 2016 and a wide-ranging public consultation process which took place in 2017 and saw submissions received from individuals, elected representatives and organisations.</p>  <p>  The review is now complete and a full report setting out findings and recommendations has been prepared.  I expect to be in a position to publish the outcome of the review shortly.</p></reply>

The most recent summary, which was carried out in 2017, details the number of households on all local authority waiting lists, as at 28 June 2017 and can be accessed on my Department's website at the following link.</p><p><i>.</i></p><p>The 2017 summary, which was published recently, shows that 85,799 households were assessed as being qualified for and in need of social housing support.  This represents a decrease of 5,801 households or 6.3% compared to the 2016 summary.</p><p>In terms of meeting the need of households on waiting lists across the country, Rebuilding Ireland set ambitious targets for social housing delivery and there is an accelerated delivery programme in place for 2018 and the years beyond.  Last year, I secured an additional &euro;500 million during Budget 2018 negotiations, to increase the social housing delivery ambition from 47,000 to 50,000 social housing homes by end 2021. Combined with the target to deliver just under 88,000 tenancies under the Housing Assistance Payment  and Rental Accommodation Schemes, this means that we will meet the needs of just under 138,000 individuals and families over the lifetime of the Rebuilding Ireland plan. </p><p>I recently published details of the 2017 provisional social housing outputs in 2017. During last year, just under 26,000 households had their social housing need met, well ahead of the target of just over 21,000. Details are available on my Department's website at the following link: </p><p><i>.</i></p><p>It should be noted that to date under Rebuilding Ireland, just under 45,000 households have had their social housing need met. Indeed, I recently published details of the social housing delivery ambition to 2021 against the delivery achieved at end 2017; this information is available at the following weblink:</p><p><i>.</i></p><p>In relation to social housing construction activity, my Department publishes comprehensive status reports on a quarterly basis, in relation to social housing construction schemes for all local authority areas, showing details, such as their locations and a range of information relating to their advancement.  The most recent of these reports covers the period up to the end of quarter 3 of 2017. It includes information on the delivery of over 12,000 new social housing homes, which were approved and progressing through planning, design, and construction, or have been completed in 2016 and to the end of quarter 3 of 2017. The report also showed that there were over 3,600 new homes on site and under construction and a further 2,000 new homes with approval to appoint contractors and move onto the construction phase. The report can be accessed on my Department's website at the following link: </p><p><i>.</i></p><p>In relation to the Deputy's query regarding delivery in 2018, the table below sets out the main programmes of social housing delivery for 2018. <table><tr><th>Delivery Method</th><th>2018 Targets</th></tr><tr><td>Build</td><td>4,969</td></tr><tr><td>Acquisitions</td><td>900</td></tr><tr><td>Leasing</td><td>2,000</td></tr><tr><td>RAS</td><td>600</td></tr><tr><td>HAP</td><td>17,000</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>25,469</td></tr></table></p><p>It should be noted that at the second Housing Summit, held on January 22nd, I asked each Local Authority Chief Executive to furnish a report by mid-February, confirming and setting out how their Local Authority will deliver on its social housing targets over the coming years. It is my intention that the targets will be published as soon as possible thereafter, and progress made by each local authority in terms of delivery against these targets will then be published on an ongoing basis, providing greater accountability and driving delivery.</p></reply>

This involves the submission of a report to Government and the Oireachtas on potential measures to boost local government leadership and accountability, and to ensure that local government funding, structures and responsibilities strengthen local democracy.  The Programme also references some specific issues to be considered such as the concept of directly elected mayors in cities, devolution of new powers to local authorities, reducing the size of local electoral areas, and town council status. </p>  <p>  It is intended that proposals to address the PPG requirements will be submitted to Government shortly, following which the matters involved will be referred to the Oireachtas for consideration.  Among the issues being addressed in this context is the scope to strengthen the decision-making role and capacity of the elected members at municipal district level, particularly in relation to budgetary and local development matters, and capacity to promote economic and social development of towns.  It should also be noted that municipal district members already have significant powers in the planning area, including responsibility for the adoption of local area plans.</p></reply>

Furthermore, the Residential Tenancies Board was established as an independent statutory body to operate a national tenancy registration system and to resolve disputes between landlords and tenants. </p>  <p>  Under the Acts, where a tenant has been in occupation of a dwelling for a continuous period of six months, and no notice of termination has been served, the tenancy is established for the remainder of the four year period; this is referred to in the Act as a &lsquo;Part 4&rsquo; tenancy.  Where a Part 4 tenancy is being terminated, the landlord must state the reason in a termination notice. The termination will not be valid unless that reason is one of those set out in the Acts - for example, that vacant possession is required for substantial refurbishment of the dwelling. Notice periods for the termination of a tenancy by the landlord vary, depending on the duration of the tenancy, but periods of up to 224 days are provided for. </p>  <p>  Threshold, the housing charity, operates the Tenancy Protection Service (TPS) which is a national service providing advice and support to households living in private rented accommodation who are experiencing tenancy problems, including where a tenancy is at risk of termination. The TPS seeks to protect existing tenancies, keeping people in their home and preventing them from having to access homeless services. Threshold&rsquo;s Tenancy Protection Service (TPS) helpline on free-phone 1800 454 454 is available from Monday to Friday, 9am to 9pm. Further information is also available at www.threshold.ie.</p>  <p>  I also intend to introduce legislation as soon as possible in 2018 to make it an offence to implement rent increases that contravene the Rent Pressure Zone limits. The Residential Tenancies Board will be given the powers and resources to investigate and prosecute landlords who implement such increases.</p>  <p>  With regard to mortgage repossessions, while the circumstances of each case may vary, depending on the terms of the mortgage or charge under which a receiver is appointed, the appointment of a receiver does not affect the statutory or contractual rights of tenants under the Residential Tenancies Acts.  </p>  <p>  The Strategy for the Rental Sector, which was published in December 2016, recognises that receivership and repossession processes can cause confusion and distress for tenants.  It also committed my Department to establishing an Inter-Departmental Working Group to explore the scope to provide for greater protection of tenants&rsquo; rights during the receivership process by ensuring that persons appointed as receivers will be required to fulfil the obligations of a landlord. The Working Group is expected to finalise its report later in Q1 2018.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to supporting households in long-term mortgage arrears to remain in their homes where possible.  There are currently two Mortgage to Rent (MTR) schemes funded by my Department.  One of the schemes provides that a local authority can acquire ownership of properties with unsustainable local authority mortgages, thus enabling the household to remain in their home as a social housing tenant.  The second scheme provides that an Approved Housing Body (AHB) can acquire ownership of a property with an unsustainable private mortgage from a lender, while also allowing the household to remain in their home as a social housing tenant.  Both schemes are part of the overall suite of social housing options and an important part of the mortgage arrears resolution process.  These schemes target only the most acute arrears cases where a mortgage is clearly unsustainable.</p></reply>

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade adheres to the principle of competitive tendering in respect of its contracting for services, supplies and works.  The applicable law and guidance is set out in the Public Sector Procurement Regulations published in 2016 under S.I. 284 of 2016, which implemented the European Directive (2014/18/EC) as well as the Circulars and Guidelines issued by Government.  Implementation of these policies and principles ensures the Department gets best value for money and ensures that in general, a competitive process is carried out in an open, objective and transparent manner.  The Department is also required to use central Government frameworks when available.</p>  <p>  The contract for the provision of Irish passport booklets and other travel documents for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade was awarded to DLRS Group, following a competitive tendering process conducted in 2012-2013.</p>  <p>  Given the contract value and specialist service requirement, a restricted two stage process was openly published in the Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU).  The initial requirement sought a response to a pre-qualification questionnaire from the open market regarding financial and technical capacity and applying a set selection criteria.  Following evaluation, eleven Tenderers qualified under the pre-qualification questionnaire selection criteria and were invited to submit a full tender proposal to meet the requirement.  These tenders were assessed against the weighted award criteria issued to invitees in advance of evaluation.  The contract was awarded to the highest scoring Tenderer under the most economically advantageous tender method having regard to the contract award criteria set out in the Tender Notice.</p>  <p>  The contract with DLRS Group was signed on 16 January 2014 (&ldquo;Agreement relating to the supply of goods pursuant to request for tenders for the provision of Irish Passport Booklets&rdquo;).</p>  <p>  The contract is for an initial five year period, with an option to extend the contract on an annual basis for a maximum of two further years.</p>  <p>  To allow for introduction of the Passport Card in October 2015 - and in keeping with the provision in the original contract foreseeing provision of other travel documents, including cards, in addition to passport books - a contract change request was agreed and signed with DLRS on 16 January 2015 for production of the Passport Card (&ldquo;Irish Passport Card, Change Proposal December 2014&rdquo;).</p>  <p>  The term of the contract is for the duration of the Passport Booklet contract.  The cost of the contract for the production of the passport card is in the region of &euro;1.5 million annually.</p></reply>

I have scheduled weekly meetings with my officials, and often discuss the issues with them between those meetings, and am in any case kept continually updated of issues as they develop.</p><p>At a political level, EU27 Ministers met at the General Affairs Council (Art. 50) on 29 January.  I was unable to travel on account of other pressing business and Ireland was represented by the Minister of State, Helen McEntee.  Michel Barnier updated Ministers on the overall state of play of negotiations and Ministers also adopted supplementary negotiating directives, mandating the European Commission Taskforce to open negotiations with the UK on a transitional arrangement.</p><p>I welcome that the EU is proposing a status quo transitional arrangement after the UK leaves the EU in March 2019.  Such an arrangement will provide certainty and limit disruption for our citizens and businesses.  Under such an arrangement the UK will be expected to continue to apply the full EU acquis.</p><p>As concerns the duration of such a transition, the Government agrees that in the interests of long term certainty, and to accelerate agreement on the future relationship agreement, it must be time bound.  This is the overall view of both the EU and of the UK.  Therefore a date of 31 December 2020 has been set for the end of the transition period.  But equally, as the negotiations progress, the overriding objective on both sides must be to avoid any gaps and any cliff edge effects.  It is therefore welcome that the General Affairs Council agreed to keep the Directives in all their aspects under constant review, taking account of developments in the Brexit negotiations.<i></i>This provides the flexibility required.</p></reply>

Feeding into this process, the European Commission&rsquo;s White Paper on the Future of Europe published last March and the Leaders' Agenda adopted by the European Council last October have prompted a debate across Member States on the future of Europe.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to contributing to the debate and ensuring greater engagement with the public around the future of Europe.  To this end, the Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar TD, and I, along with the Minister of State for European Affairs, Helen McEntee TD, launched a Citizens&rsquo; dialogue on the Future of Europe on 15 November last.</p>  <p>  It is essential that the EU addresses the key concerns of its citizens and the aim of the Government&rsquo;s Future of Europe initiative is to promote a meaningful debate on the future direction of the EU and at the same time to promote better awareness of the EU, its role, values and achievements.</p>  <p>  Minister of State McEntee is leading this process and has participated in a number of engagements already and recently announced a schedule for the Future of Europe Citizens' Dialogues.  The purpose of these dialogues is to engage with citizens to hear their views, opinions and insights about the European Union so that we can help to shape a better Europe for all.  This will be primarily a listening exercise, focussed on the needs and concerns of our citizens.  We do not want to be prescriptive and we want to draw on these sessions to help formulate our contribution to the broader European debate.  I would encourage everyone to get involved.</p>  <p>  Dialogue events will be held in Galway on 8 February, Cork on 22 February, Donegal on 8 March and Meath on 19th April.  They will conclude on 9 May next (Europe Day) with an event in Dublin.  The cost of each meeting is estimated at approx. &euro;10,000.  This was not the subject of a tender process as European Movement Ireland, which is our partner in organising the Dialogues, is in receipt of ongoing funding from the Department.</p>  <p>  The grant of &euro;250,000 annually for three years to EMI from my Department is to carry out work on the basis of a proposal it submitted, which includes an extensive programme of work on communications and outreach activities including these Citizens Dialogues.</p></reply>

The war has now been ongoing for over one thousand days, and has had devastating consequences for civilians, with allegations of violations of human rights and international humanitarian law, and significant loss of life.</p>  <p>  I have not met with any Saudi Ministerial counterparts since taking up my role as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade last year.  However, my predecessor, Minister Flanagan, raised concerns about the conduct of the war in Yemen and the humanitarian impact with Ministerial counterparts in Saudi Arabia and UAE on a number of occasions.  More recently, officials from my Department met with the Saudi Embassy in Dublin late last year, and passed on my strong concerns in relation to humanitarian access.  There have also been EU contacts with Saudi Arabia on this issue.  At the Foreign Affairs Council on 11 December, I urged stronger EU action on humanitarian access in Yemen, and I will continue to raise these concerns with all appropriate interlocutors whenever opportunities arise.</p>  <p>  At the Human Rights Council in September 2017, Ireland was part of a small core group of countries that drove forward the adoption by consensus of a Resolution on Yemen.  This Resolution established a group of eminent international and regional experts to carry out a comprehensive investigation of all alleged violations and abuses of international human rights since September 2014.  In December 2017, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights announced the names and appointment of its members.  The Group is expected to travel to Yemen soon and, as per the Resolution, will report back to the Human Rights Council in September of this year on its findings.  I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate my full support for the work of the Eminent Experts, and my commitment to ensuring accountability for all violations and abuses that have taken place in Yemen.</p>  <p>  Ireland has also provided over &euro;11 million in humanitarian assistance to Yemen since 2015, and we are committed to maintaining support.  Furthermore, the EU is the largest humanitarian donor to Yemen and has provided over &euro;170 million in aid since the conflict began, to which Ireland contributes via the EU Development Budget.  I believe that the only way to bring about a long-term sustainable improvement in the situation for the Yemeni people is through a negotiated end to this conflict, and Ireland fully supports UN efforts in this regard.</p></reply>

The legislation set out limits on lending over 5 years and over 10 years.  Following commencement of the Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012 (2012 Act) these &ldquo;Section 35&rdquo; restrictions in relation to long-term lending are set out in Central Bank regulations which commenced on 1 January 2016. </p>  <p>  The Credit Union Advisory Committee, CUAC, in its 2016 report, recommended a full review of lending limits and concentration limits, including the basis of the calculation of the limits together with the liquidity requirements attaching to same.  It was acknowledged that any changes arising would need to be assessed in conjunction with the risk profile of credit unions together with an assessment of skills, capabilities and asset and liability management. </p>  <p>  To that end, the CUAC Report Implementation Group, which was established to implement CUAC&rsquo;s recommendations, submitted a scoping paper to the Central Bank in November 2017.  The paper details a range of proposals for consideration in the Central Bank review of Section 35 which could provide for a material increase in long-term lending for those credit unions that would have the capability to do so.  The paper provides a range of considered proposals which would, if implemented, offer a roadmap for increasing long-term lending capacity in the credit union sector, while recognising the potential risks involved. </p>  <p>  I recently wrote to the Governor of the Central Bank to outline my strong support for this very important matter being progressed in early 2018.  I am advised that the Central Bank has undertaken a preliminary review of the paper provided by the Implementation Group and that work plans for 2018 reflect the Registry of Credit Union&rsquo;s intention to progress this matter during the year.</p></reply>

ARFs were introduced by Finance Act 1999 to provide control, flexibility and choice to holders of personal pensions and to proprietary director members of occupational pension schemes in relation to the drawing down of benefits from their pension plans.  Prior to that Act, any person taking a pension from a Defined Contribution (DC) scheme or a Retirement Annuity Contract had no choice but to purchase an annuity with their remaining pension pot after drawing down the permissible tax-free retirement lump sum. The ARF arrangement extended the options at retirement so that, in addition to the annuity option, the balance of a pension fund could be taken in cash (subject to tax, as appropriate) or be invested in an ARF, subject to certain conditions. </p>  <p>  The ARF option was extended, in Finance Act 2000, to the part of an employee&rsquo;s occupational pension fund built up from Additional Voluntary Contributions (AVCs) and in Finance Act 2011 it was further extended to cover an employee&rsquo;s entire pension fund where the fund is a defined contribution (DC) occupational pension scheme. </p>  <p>  Distributions from an ARF fall within the charge to Class S self-employed PRSI, or where the recipient of a distribution is a modified class contributor, Class K. </p>  <p>  I do not currently have plans to amend this position, however all tax measures are kept under review by my Department as a matter of course.  As I announced in Budget 2018 a working group has been established to plan the process of amalgamating USC and PRSI and all aspects of PRSI will be considered by the working group.  </p></reply>

The Programme involves the production of predictive flood mapping for each location, the development of preliminary flood risk management options and the production of Flood Risk Management Plans. </p>  <p>  The CFRAM Programme focussed on 300 Areas for Further Assessment (AFAs) including 90 coastal areas, mainly in urban locations nationwide, identified as being at potentially significant risk of flooding.  The proposed feasible measures, both structural and non-structural, identified for AFAs are outlined in the Flood Risk Management Plans.  </p>  <p>  Seven areas in County Sligo were identified as AFA&rsquo;s, Ballymote. Ballysadare, Coolooney. Coolaney, Gorteen, Riverstown and Sligo town.</p>  <p>  The Draft Flood Risk Management Plans were published for public consultation in 2016 and a significant volume of submissions were received for consideration.  In Summer 2017, the OPW finalised all Plans and each Plan was submitted to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for an independent review of the environmental assessments.  This independent review is nearing completion, after which the Final Plans will be formally submitted to the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform for approval, in accordance with the statutory requirements. </p>  <p>  I would hope in the coming weeks to seek the approval from the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform for the Flood Risk Management Plans developed under the CFRAM process.  </p>  <p>  The Office of Public Works (OPW) carries out a programme of Arterial Drainage Maintenance to a total of 11,500km of river channel and approximately 730km of embankments nationally.  These maintenance works relate to arterial drainage schemes completed by the OPW under the Arterial Drainage Acts 1945 and 1995, whose purpose was primarily to improve the drainage of agricultural lands. </p>  <p>  The Owenmore River does not form part of an arterial drainage scheme.  The OPW therefore has no responsibility for the maintenance of the channels in the Owenmore Catchment.  Statutory responsibility for the maintenance of the Owenmore Drainage District rests with Sligo County Council.</p></reply>

The requirements of the Code are based on employing good practices at all stages of the expenditure life cycle.  Departments and other public service bodies need to satisfy themselves that the expenditure practices they employ are of an acceptable standard, and that they consistently maintain these standards.  All projects over &euro;20m, which would include all PPPs, should be subjected to a Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) or Cost Effectiveness Analysis (CEA).  </p>  <p>  In addition, all public investment projects valued at &euro;20m or above must also be referred to the NDFA for advice in terms of the best way of financing the projects, which would also include all PPP projects.</p>  <p>  PPPs will continue to be a procurement method available for appropriately structured projects which demonstrate value for money over a traditional procurement option and which meet the robust and rigorous tests for project appraisal that apply to all public investment projects under the Public Spending Code.</p></reply>

In accordance with international best practice, PPP contracts already typically include detailed provisions that apply in the event of the liquidation of a consortium member of the PPP company, or an entity under the contract, to protect the public interest and ensure that the project proceeds to completion.</p>  <p>  Under the terms of such PPP contracts, in the case of liquidation of a consortium member, or an entity under the contract, the PPP consortium&rsquo;s funders and remaining shareholders are required to intervene and implement rectification measures to ensure that the project is completed to the satisfaction of the State.</p>  <p>  This process is underway in the case of the Schools Bundle 5 PPP (as a consequence of the Carillion plc liquidation).  Liquidation of a company involved in delivering a public infrastructure project, such as Carillion plc, is an unfortunate development but would impact on any project where a supplier became insolvent during the delivery process, regardless of whether the project was being procured by PPP or by traditional means.  The issue, therefore, is not PPP-specific, but where it arises in a PPP project, the provisions of the PPP contract ensure that the public interest is protected. </p>  <p>  The contractual mechanisms within a PPP project agreement are designed to limit the State&rsquo;s financial exposure in such a scenario.  An important feature of PPPs (which does not arise in traditional procurement) is that no payments are made until the facilities are handed over to the State and are operational.  Once facilities are operational, payments to the PPP company are linked to service performance and availability of the facilities over the lifetime of the contract, with deductions applying when the facilities are not performing or are unavailable.  The latter payment mechanism is not a feature of a traditional model which has regular milestone payments during construction.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware I established an Inter-Departmental/Inter-Agency Group last year to review Ireland's experience of using PPP and to make recommendations on the future role of PPPs, in the context of the new 10 year capital plan.  I would expect the Group's deliberations to take account of any implications for future national PPP policy of the development referred to in the Deputy's question.  It is currently intended that the outcome of the review will be published alongside the new capital plan.</p></reply>

I negotiated a 15-22% pay increase for new teachers.  The agreements to date have restored an estimated 75% of the difference in pay for more recently recruited teachers and deliver full equality at later points in the scale.</p>  <p>  As a result of these changes and taking into account the new pay measures under the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020, the current starting salary of a new teacher is &euro;35,958 and from 1 October 2020 onwards will be &euro;37,692.  If full equalisation was achieved the starting salary for a post-primary teacher from 1 October 2020 would be &euro;43,879 and for a primary teacher would be &euro;41,511. </p>  <p>  Differential pay scales for public servants were introduced by the then Government in 2010.  It must be borne in mind that the pay reduction for post-2011 entrants to the public service applied to all public servants and not just teachers, and that any restoration of these measures in respect of teachers would be expected to be applied elsewhere across the public service.  While I am not in a position to provide an estimate of the total cost of restoring all post-1 January 2011 entrants in all of the public service to the pre-2011 pay scale arrangements, I can say that in the case of education and training sector employees, including teachers, the estimated current full year cost would be in the order of &euro;130 million.  The cost across the entire public service is estimated to be over &euro;200 million. </p>  <p>  To have gone further than the pay increases that have been negotiated for 2018 would mean I would have had less money available to hire over 1,000 extra SNAs in 2018, and over 1,000 extra teachers in 2018. </p>  <p>  Any further negotiation on new entrant pay is a cross sectoral issue, not just an issue for the education sector.  The Government also supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants. </p>  <p>  A commitment is included in the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 to consider the issue of newly qualified pay within 12 months of the commencement of the Agreement.  That process has now commenced with a first meeting on 12 October 2017.  The three teacher unions attended that first meeting.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017 provides that within 3 months of the passing of the Act, my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform will prepare and lay before the Oireachtas a report on the cost of and a plan in dealing with pay equalisation for new entrants to the public service. </p></reply>

This can be due to significant difficulties in areas such as behaviour or sensory needs which have not been ameliorated, even with appropriate intervention, in mainstream.  Others may have such complex needs that they are best placed in a special school.</p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through its network of Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), co-ordinates special needs education provision at local level and arranges for the delivery of special educational supports to schools.  It is also the role of the NCSE to make appropriate arrangements to establish special classes in schools in communities where the need for such classes has been identified.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2016 was published in July 2016.  The Bill which passed Committee Stage on 28 June 2017 and will shortly proceed to Report Stage is an important piece of legislation which strives to create a new more parent-friendly, equitable and consistent approach to how school admissions policy operates for the almost 4,000 primary and post-primary schools in this country. </p>  <p>  The Bill provides an over-arching framework for greater transparency and consistency in school enrolment generally and thereby gives greater confidence to parents that the admission criteria laid down by schools and the procedures used by them are legitimate, reasonable and fair.</p>  <p>  The Bill provides that where a school has places available it must admit all applicants.  The Bill also contains a provision for the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) to designate a school for a child who has no school place for reasons related to the child&rsquo;s special educational needs.</p>  <p>  At Committee Stage of the Bill last June I indicated that I intend, at Report Stage, to include in this Bill a provision that will provide, based on reports and advice from the NCSE, the Minister with the power to require a school to open a special class or to increase the number of special classes in schools.  </p>  <p>  My Department officials are currently engaging with the Office of the Attorney General on the development of legislative proposals on this matter which I hope to bring forward to Government for approval shortly.   </p></reply>

In these cases, the prior complaints were made to a school authority, not a State authority, and the prior complaints arose in relation to abuse in different schools, not the schools in which the 6 Plaintiffs were abused.  </p><p>In these cases, the State&rsquo;s liability was settled but the 6 plaintiffs are pursuing their High Court claims against the congregation and the State is pursuing its claim against the congregation.  The settlement offers are not part of any redress scheme.</p><p>It is not appropriate to comment on the type of abuse suffered by the plaintiffs.</p><p>The plaintiffs were in 3 different schools - the schools involved were Our Lady Queen of Angels/Ballyfermot National School, Naomh Mhuire/Walsh Island National School and Presentation Convent National School, Castlecomer.  All were victims of the one abuser.</p><p>The source of information on prior complaints in these 6 cases is Chapter 14 of the Report from the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse, the Ryan report.</p><p>I would like to explain to the Deputy what actions were taken to implement the recommendations of the ECtHR judgement referred to.</p><p>The State Claims Agency (SCA) manages school child sexual abuse litigation being taken against the State.  In December 2014, the Government authorised the SCA to offer &ldquo;out of court&rdquo; settlements to persons taking High Court cases of school child sexual abuse against the State where their cases come within the terms of the ECHR judgment in the <i>O&rsquo;Keeffe </i>case and are not statute barred.</p><p>Separately and in addition, in July 2015, the Government agreed that it would respond to those who instituted legal proceedings against the State in relation to school child sexual abuse but had discontinued their cases by offering <i>ex gratia</i>payments.  It was decided that such payments would be offered to those persons whose cases were not statute barred prior to their proceedings being discontinued and where the person can demonstrate that their circumstances involved sexual abuse of a school child by a primary or post-primary school employee in respect of whom there was a prior complaint of sexual abuse to a school authority (including an authority of a school in which the employee had previously worked) prior to the issue of the Department of Education guidelines to primary and post-primary schools in 1991 and 1992 respectively.</p><p>For the purposes of the settlement of litigation and the Government&rsquo;s <i>ex gratia</i>scheme, there is no strict interpretation as to what constitutes a &ldquo;prior complaint.&rdquo;  The State must be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that there was a prior complaint but the State does not insist on a strict evidential standard in assessing the material put forward by an applicant.  A holistic analysis of the case is undertaken and a flexible approach is adopted.</p><p>In assessing whether a settlement will be offered or whether an applicant comes within the <i>ex gratia </i>scheme, the State will consider instances of abuse which occurred in both primary and post-primary schools.  </p><p>In assessing a case or application, the State works on the basis that a prior complaint includes not only complaints made to teachers but also complaints made to any person(s) in authority in a school.  There are no time limits to the submitting of an application and if new evidence subsequently comes to light, even where an application had been declined, a further application can be submitted at any stage.</p><p>Following all of the above steps and consideration of all relevant materials, the SCA makes its decision on the ex-gratia scheme application.  </p><p>There has been consistent legal advice to the effect that the approach being taken by the State is legally sound.</p><p>While the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse has completed its work, allegations of abuse should always be referred to the appropriate authority for a full and proper investigation.</p></reply>

In 2018, almost 1.8 billion will be invested in Special Education, nearly one fifth of the overall Education budget, and up 43% since 2011.</p><p>During the worst years of the recession we not only protected supports for children with special educational needs but grew them. </p><p>This funding includes provision for over 13,400 Special Education Teaching posts in mainstream primary and post primary schools for the 2017/2018 school year, providing additional teaching support to pupils with special educational needs, and approximately 1,300 special classes, with 169 new Special Classes opened to date for the 2017/18 school year.  This compares to 548 special classes in 2011.  </p><p>My Department's policy aims to ensure that all children with Special Educational Needs, including those with autism, can have access to an education appropriate to their needs, preferably in school settings through the primary and post-primary school network.</p><p>Such placements facilitate access to individualised education programmes which may draw from a range of appropriate educational interventions, delivered by fully qualified professional teachers, with the support of Special Needs Assistants and the appropriate school curriculum.  </p><p>Some students, although academically able to access the curriculum in mainstream, may find it too difficult to manage full-time placement there.  This can be due to significant difficulties in areas such as behaviour or sensory needs which have not been ameliorated, even with appropriate intervention, in mainstream.</p><p>Other children may have such complex needs that the recommendation in their professional reports state that they are best placed in a special school. </p><p>With regard to County Wexford, the most recent figures available to me indicate that 1,908 students with special educational needs were accessing supports in County Wexford during the 2016/17 school year, comprising 1,545 in mainstream classes, 125 in special classes and 238 students in special schools.</p><p>The number of ASD special classes in County Wexford has more than doubled from 17 in 2011 to 41 in 2017/18 school year.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of Special Needs Organisers (SENOs), for fulfilling the functions of the NCSE Council within a designated area in relation to the identification of and delivery and co-ordination of education services to children with disabilities, including the establishment of special classes.</p><p>The NCSE, in looking to open special classes, must take into account the present and future potential need for such classes, taking particular account of the educational needs of the children concerned.  The NCSE will also take account of location and sustainability in looking to establish special classes in certain areas.  </p><p>The NCSE has informed my Department that they will continue to monitor demand and review the requirement for special class places in the Wexford area.  </p><p>My Department continues to work with the NCSE to ensure that there is appropriate planning in place to ensure that all children who require special class placements can access such placements in schools within their communities.</p><p>Parents/guardians of children with special needs who may need advice or are experiencing difficulties in locating a school placement should contact their local Special Educational Needs Organiser (SENO) as soon as possible for information on available places.  The local SENO contact details are available on<i>www.ncse.ie</i>.</p></reply>

No other part of the public service has seen this sort of growth, which is testament to the Government&rsquo;s commitment to education and its importance in fulfilling our national ambitions.</p><p>I have already announced a number of measures to increase the pool of teachers available to schools, in particular to fill short-term vacancies, including informing all teachers retiring in 2017 that in order to remain eligible for employment in a State-funded teaching post for a period of more than five consecutive days or to supervise the State examinations, a teacher must maintain his or her registration with the Teaching Council.  I have also recently announced the temporary suspension of the limits for employment for a teacher on career break.  </p><p>At post primary level certain initiatives have been taken to address some of the supply pressures in particular subject areas.  These include, as part of the implementation of the Policy on Gaeltacht Education, increasing from 2018/19 the number of places available on the existing Irish medium post primary initial teacher education programme in NUIG.  The number of students admitted to St. Angela&rsquo;s, Sligo to follow the Home Economics initial teacher education (ITE) programme has also increased from 85 to 101 in the current year, with further expansions in future years being considered.  <b></b></p><p>Other measures under consideration include:</p><p>- How to introduce subject quotas for post primary PME ITE programmes, targeted at areas of shortage</p><p>- Expansion of the undergraduate route to becoming a post primary teacher</p><p>- Development of innovative ways to meet areas of shortage including consideration of top up&rdquo; or conversion courses to upskill existing teachers to teach in subject areas of shortage.</p><p>I will shortly be announcing the establishment of a Teacher Supply Steering Group to develop a strategy for teacher supply.  As part of its remit, the Group will consult with key stakeholders.  </p><p>I will also ask the Teaching Council to review subject criteria and processes for assessing out of state qualifications, including further engagement with the Migrant Teacher Project and to engage more with graduate fairs, and final year students</p><p>Separately, I will be also be working with employers, school management bodies and higher education institutions to achieve progress in this space.</p><p>The Deputy may wish to note that the numbers of graduates from ITE programmes have remained broadly constant.  Over 8,000 primary and 7,800 second level teachers have graduated in the last five years and in 2018 it is estimated that approximately 1,870 primary and 1,523 post primary teachers will graduate.  In addition, the number of applicants for primary school teaching (both undergraduate and postgraduate) and for second level teaching at undergraduate level have remained broadly constant.  However, I acknowledge that there has been a fall in applications to the second level PME.  I will be asking the Teacher Supply Steering Group how the post primary PME can be made more attractive and I will also consider whether we can use financial incentives to improve the uptake of certain courses.</p></reply>

The scheme operated on the basis of an additional full-time teacher being allocated to a school to cover certified sick leave absences in that school and a cluster of neighbouring schools.  If the teacher was not required on a given day to cover sick leave absences they generally assisted with other work in their school such as administrative duties. </p>  <p>  A value for money review of the scheme was published in July 2006.  The review found that approximately 60% of these teachers' time was used to cover sick leave absences with the balance on various other school duties.  This reflected the unpredictable nature of sick leave absences.  Teachers assigned to &lsquo;base schools&rsquo; or as part of a &lsquo;cluster&rsquo; were often not available to schools within the cluster, due to the needs or decisions of the base school which retained control over the teaching resource.  In addition, teachers who were confined to a cluster were not available to schools outside of the cluster.  The scheme proved to be an inefficient use of resources and further restricted the number of teachers available for substitute work across the wider school system.   </p>  <p>  According to the value for money review, the more efficient and cost effective use of teaching resources is to use the normal substitution arrangements that apply to all other schools to cover sick leave absences instead of having a cohort of full-time teachers "on call" in these schools to cover sick leave absences that may or may not arise.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is probably aware, I will shortly be announcing the establishment of a Teacher Supply Steering Group to develop a strategy for teacher supply.  As part of its remit, the Group will consult with key stakeholders. It is intended that the Group will have a comprehensive terms of reference and consider the many issues that relate to teacher supply, including the use of supply panels.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.</p>  <p>  Ballyfermot Garda Station forms part of the Clondalkin District.  I am informed by the Commissioner that on 31 December 2017 there were 194 Garda&iacute; assigned to the Clondalkin District of whom 83 were assigned to Ballyfermot Garda Station.  In terms of Community Garda&iacute; there are 15 assigned to Clondalkin of whom 7 are assigned to Ballyfermot.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. </p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  To make this a reality for all the Government has in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. We are making real, tangible progress on reaching this goal.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just under 1,600 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, 137 of whom have been assigned to the DMR West Division. Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 - a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016.</p>  <p>  I am also pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track.  This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College.  Also, 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year, which will see Garda numbers reach more than 14,000 by the end of 2018.</p>  <p>  In addition, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front line operational duties.  There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training early in 2018.</p>  <p>  This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division, including the DMR West Division.</p>  <p>  Community policing is at the heart of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It provides a means of recognising that every community &ndash; both urban and rural &ndash; has its own concerns and expectations.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that the Garda National Model of Community Policing plays a key part in responding to crime by taking into account and responding to local conditions and needs.  Clear objectives are set, such as high visibility in the community, ease of contact by members of the public, and enhanced support for crime prevention strategies. Community policing is not, of course, confined to dedicated Community Garda&iacute;, all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in community policing in carrying out their duties.  In addition, the National Community Policing Office, attached to the Garda Community Relations Bureau, captures best practice in community policing initiatives and disseminates these practices through its communication network.  </p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 places a strong emphasis on developing and supporting the community policing ethos of the organisation and enhancing the current delivery model so that Garda&iacute; spend more time in the community, gaining public confidence and trust and providing a greater sense of security.  </p>  <p>  Undoubtedly, the on-going recruitment process will support all Garda activities and will enhance Garda visibility within our communities and the provision of effective community policing across all Garda Divisions including the DMR West Division.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-01-31a.340.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018013100075#WRN01700"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 190 and 191 together.</p><p>As the Deputy will appreciate, it is the Garda Commissioner who is responsible for the distribution of resources, including personnel, among the various Garda Divisions and I, as Minister, have no direct role in the matter.  Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. </p><p>Kevin Street and Kilmainham Garda Stations form part of the Dublin Metropolitan Region (D.M.R.) South Central Division, Ballyfermot forms part of the D.M.R. West Division with Crumlin Garda Station forming part of the D.M.R. South Division.  The Garda strength of the D.M.R.  South Central Division on 31 December 2017 was 622 with 37 Garda Reserves and 63 Garda civilian staff attached to the Division.  The total Garda strength of the D.M.R. West Division on 31 December 2017 was 672 with 26 Reserves and 52 Garda Civilian staff and the total strength of the D.M.R. South Division on 31 December 2017 was 532 with 20 Reserves and 36 Garda civilian staff.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. </p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, this Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal. </p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just under 1,600 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, of whom 141, 137 and 118 have been assigned to the D.M.R. South Central, D.M.R. West and D.M.R. South Divisions respectively.  I am pleased to say that Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 - a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016. </p><p>I am also pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track.  This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College. Also 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, reach 14,000 by the end of 2018.</p><p>In addition, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties.  There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training in 2018. </p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Division, including the DMR Divisions. </p><p>In so far as the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute; is concerned, this is a matter for the Garda Commissioner.  I am assured by the Commissioner that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of resources.  However, it is important to keep in mind that newly attested Garda&iacute; have a further 16 months of practical and class-room based training to complete in order to receive their BA in Applied Policing.  To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required training and development structures and resources in place, including trained Garda tutors and access to a permanently appointed supervisory Sergeant who is thoroughly familiar with their responsibilities under the training programme.<b></b></p><p>I am advised by the Commissioner that the number of Garda&iacute;, by rank  attached to Crumlin, Kilmainham, Kevin Street and Ballyfermot  Garda Stations in each of the years 2007 to 2017 and the number of probationer Garda&iacute; assigned to these stations since the reopening of the Garda College are as set out in the following tables.</p><p><b>CRUMLIN GARDA STATION 2007-2017</b><table><tr><th>YEAR</th><th>GD</th><th>SG</th><th>IN</th><th>SU</th><th>CS</th><th>TOTAL</th></tr><tr><td>2007</td><td>82</td><td>18</td><td>5</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>108</td></tr><tr><td>2008</td><td>78</td><td>20</td><td>5</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>106</td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>84</td><td>16</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>104</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>82</td><td>17</td><td>5</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>107</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>80</td><td>16</td><td>4</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>102</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>75</td><td>16</td><td>4</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>98</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>71</td><td>18</td><td>5</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>97</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>69</td><td>17</td><td>5</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>94</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>69</td><td>17</td><td>4</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>94</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>71</td><td>22</td><td>6</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>102</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>76</td><td>17</td><td>5</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>101 </td></tr></table></p><p><b>BALLYFERMOT GARDA STATION 2007-2017</b></p><p><table><tr><th>YEAR</th><th>GD</th><th>SG</th><th>IN</th><th>TOTAL</th></tr><tr><td>2007</td><td>74</td><td>12</td><td>1</td><td>87</td></tr><tr><td>2008</td><td>81</td><td>16</td><td>1</td><td>98</td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>84</td><td>10</td><td>1</td><td>95</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>84</td><td>13</td><td>2</td><td>99</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>83</td><td>11</td><td>2</td><td>96</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>80</td><td>11</td><td>2</td><td>93</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>76</td><td>9</td><td>2</td><td>87</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>73</td><td>11</td><td>1</td><td>85</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>74</td><td>11</td><td>1</td><td>86</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>72</td><td>12</td><td>1</td><td>85</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>72</td><td>9</td><td>1</td><td>83</td></tr></table></p><p><b>KEVIN STREET GARDA STATION 2007-2017</b></p><p><table><tr><th>YEAR</th><th>GD</th><th>SG</th><th>IN</th><th>SU</th><th>TOTAL</th></tr><tr><td>2007</td><td>119</td><td>14</td><td>5</td><td>1</td><td>139</td></tr><tr><td>2008</td><td>133</td><td>15</td><td>5</td><td>1</td><td>154</td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>135</td><td>11</td><td>5</td><td>1</td><td>152</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>136</td><td>13</td><td>6</td><td>1</td><td>156</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>135</td><td>11</td><td>6</td><td>1</td><td>153</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>123</td><td>15</td><td>4</td><td>1</td><td>143</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>114</td><td>17</td><td>3</td><td>1  </td><td>135</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>102</td><td>15</td><td>4</td><td></td><td>121</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>99</td><td>14</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td>117</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>96</td><td>15</td><td>5</td><td>1</td><td>117</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>89</td><td>11</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td>104</td></tr></table></p><p><b>KILMAINHAM GARDA STATION 2007-2017</b></p><p><table><tr><th>YEAR</th><th>GD</th><th>SG</th><th>IN</th><th>TOTAL</th></tr><tr><td>2007</td><td>70</td><td>16</td><td>1</td><td>87</td></tr><tr><td>2008</td><td>72</td><td>15</td><td>1</td><td>88</td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>71</td><td>15</td><td></td><td>86</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>67</td><td>16</td><td></td><td>83</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>58</td><td>16</td><td></td><td>74</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>65</td><td>12</td><td>1</td><td>78</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>66</td><td>12</td><td>1</td><td>79</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>58</td><td>14</td><td></td><td>72</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>62</td><td>13</td><td></td><td>75</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>62</td><td>11</td><td></td><td>73</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>59</td><td>8</td><td></td><td>67</td></tr></table></p><p><b>Number of Probationer Garda&iacute;

This describes measures already taken and outlines future initiatives that will help ensure that Irish businesses are as prepared as possible for the UK's withdrawal from the European Union. </p>  <p>  Our State Agencies have been particularly active in helping firms here prepare for the post-Brexit commercial environment.  InterTrade Ireland - aided by additional funding that has been provided by my Department - has initiated an awareness raising campaign and launched services to assist companies to plan for Brexit.  This includes the provision of "Start to Plan" vouchers, which helps companies get access to the specialist advice they need.  </p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland, meanwhile, launched a "Brexit SME Scorecard" - effectively a new interactive platform which can be used by Irish companies to self-assess their exposure to Brexit.  The Agency has also introduced a "Be Prepared Grant" that helps SME clients meet the costs of implementing a plan to mitigate risks arising from Brexit.  Furthermore, the Local Enterprise Office Network are hosting information events around the country about Brexit.</p>  <p>  While progress has been made in helping many different businesses prepare, we know much more work remains to be done.  That is why we will remain absolutely focused on our Brexit-related initiatives and will continue to explore new avenues and means of helping our companies plan for the future.</p></reply>

Subsequently, due to the severe economic situation in Ireland, in July 2008, the Government decided to cap all increases at 5% and announced that all of the pending increases for Ministerial and Parliamentary Office holders and other senior public servants would not be implemented.  The Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2)  Act was also passed which restricted the power to pay remuneration above the rate determined in accordance with the terms of the Act.</p>  <p>  My Department submitted a business case for the application of pay adjustments to certain senior managers in the HSE to the Minister for Finance (now Finance and Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform).

Legislation will be necessary to effect these changes and the General Scheme of a Bill was also approved by Government at that time.  Minister Donohoe has indicated that he would ask the Attorney General to prioritise the drafting of this legislation so that the new compulsory retirement age would become effective as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  The Government also agreed, in advance of the legislation coming into effect, that interim arrangements could be introduced, for serving public servants who reach the age of 65 years between the date of the Government Decision and the coming into effect of the necessary legislation.  These arrangements enable such public servants to be retained until they reach the age of eligibility for Contributory State Pension, which is currently age 66 years.  My Department has advised the HSE and other agencies of these interim measures.</p></reply>

Securing access to existing and new and innovative medicines is a key objective of the  health service.  However, the challenge is to do this in an affordable and sustainable manner.  The medicines bill for the community drugs schemes &ndash; primarily the GMS, Long Term Illness and Drugs Payment schemes and the High Tech Arrangement &ndash; was approximately &euro;1.8 billion in 2017. </p><p>To ensure patients receive the highest quality care, resources invested in medicines must be used efficiently and effectively.  This requires an integrated approach to secure best value for money for all treatments, greater efficiencies in the supply chain and the use of the most cost-effective treatments.</p><p>Lidocaine 5% medicated plaster is licensed for the symptomatic relief of neuropathic pain associated with previous herpes zoster (shingles) infection, known as post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN), in adults.  It has been reimbursed in the community drugs schemes since 2010.  The projected budget impact on introduction was low due to the specific licensed indication but total expenditure has increased significantly, from &euro;9.4 million in 2012 to over &euro;30 million in 2016, mainly from off-licence use for pain not associated with shingles. </p><p>An HSE Medicines Management Programme (MMP) review of this product highlighted that the clinical evidence for its use in PHN is limited due to lack of comparative data, and its value is uncertain for all other types of pain.  The National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics estimated that, in Ireland, only 5-10% of prescribing of this product has been for the licensed indication of PHN. </p><p>Following the MMP review, the HSE introduced a new reimbursement system for the product from 1 September 2017.  This process supports its appropriate use, ensuring that PHN patients continue to receive this treatment.  The HSE estimates that this protocol will reduce annual expenditure on this product by approximately 90%.</p><p>Under the protocol, all patients who were receiving antivirals for shingles were automatically approved for the lidocaine medicated plaster for three months.  No action was required by GPs and the patient&rsquo;s pharmacy was notified of his or her approval status.</p><p>These patients were identified and automatically registered on the HSE-PCRS system for three months and continued to receive the treatment from their pharmacy until 30 November 2017.  However, since 1 December 2017, non-shingles patients no longer receive this item under the community drugs schemes.  The HSE has produced information leaflets for patients and advised GPs on treatment alternatives. </p><p>In exceptional circumstances, the product may be approved for supply through the community schemes for unlicensed indications.  GPs apply for reimbursement for unlicensed indications through the online system.  The MMP reviews applications before a decision is made and communicated to the GP.</p><p>Full details of the review are available on the HSE website at</p><p><i>.</i></p><p>This decision is a matter for the HSE.  However, I fully support the objectives of the HSE Medicines Management Programme.</p></reply>

The Expert Group has drawn up clinical guidance for healthcare professionals treating patients through the Access Programme.  Officials in the Department of Health are working on legislation to underpin the Access Programme.  This work is well advanced but will take some further time to complete.</p><p>In the meantime, medical practitioners who wish to prescribe cannabis-based products containing THC may apply under the Misuse of Drugs Act for a licence to do so.  The Chief Medical Officer has advised that the granting of such a licence must be premised on an appropriate application being submitted to the Department of Health, which is endorsed by a consultant who is responsible for the management of the patient and who is prepared to monitor the effects of the treatment over time.</p><p>To date four licences in respect of four individual patients have been granted.  </p><p>Valid applications received by the Department are assessed and responded to without delay.</p><p>If the patient&rsquo;s consultant requires further information or clarification in relation to the licence application process, he or she should contact the Department of Health directly.</p></reply>

The HPRA has a post market role where they monitor the medical devices on the market.  As Minister for Health, I have no role in the approval, licensing and certification process for medical devices.</p>  <p>  To place a medical device such as a vaginal mesh implant on the Irish or EU market, the manufacturer must be authorised to do so following an assessment conducted by a notified body for medical devices.  There are currently just over fifty such notified bodies based in Europe (one in Ireland &ndash; NSAI) and the manufacturer can choose any designated notified body to which it can apply for assessment and the award of a CE mark.  Following its assessment and once satisfied that the device meets the relevant requirements, the notified body will issue a certificate for the medical device.  This entitles the manufacturer to affix a CE mark to the device and thereafter market the product throughout Europe.  The HPRA has advised that, to their knowledge, the NSAI has not certified a transvaginal mesh device at any time. </p>  <p>  No regulatory action has been taken to date by Competent Authorities in any European country in respect of these devices.  The Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) advises that they are not aware of scientific evidence which concludes these devices are unsafe when used in line with their intended use.  The HPRA continues to liaise closely with European Competent Authorities, the European Commission and with International regulatory agencies in relation to the international evidence relating to these devices. </p>  <p>  As Minister for Health, I want to ensure that both the current use of mesh implants in urogynaecological procedures in Ireland, and the on-going clinical management of women who have had these procedures in the past, are in line with international best practice and emerging evidence. </p>  <p>  At my request, the Chief Medical Officer is preparing a report on the many clinical and technical issues involved, including the issues raised by the Deputy.   </p>  <p>  This work involves engagement with national and international bodies, the professional colleges and others.  This work is underway and will take a number of months to complete. </p>  <p>  The Department strongly advises that any woman who experiences or suspects that she has experienced a complication associated with TVMI surgery should discuss this with her GP or with the hospital from which she received the implant.  The Department also advises that women considering surgery involving TVMIs should thoroughly discuss with their doctors the indications, alternatives (surgical and non-surgical), benefits and risks involved in their personal circumstances.</p></reply>

The analysis has established two extremes that define the indicative range and scale of potential capacity needs up to 2031 and the level of reforms involved.  The key findings and recommendations of the report recognise this and outline further work required, including:</p>  <p>-assessing the optimum reform strategy that takes account of workforce, the whole life cost of services, eligibility arrangements and their impact on implementing reforms, the feasibility of delivering infrastructure, and impact on operational services in the timeframe. It would also need to take account of the wider implications arising from major reconfigurations of services across hospitals;</p>  <p>- consideration of the Capacity Review in the context of the forthcoming National Development Plan; and</p>  <p>- an important next step noted in the report is to consider how additional capacity should be planned and delivered at a regional level based on population need.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, costing is an important and complex process in its own right.  For example, it is important to state that there is no one cost for a hospital bed.  The cost is dependent on the nature of the bed, such as inpatient, daycase, critical care, the specialty and where the bed will be delivered, for example, an existing hospital, an extension, or a new development.  Therefore, the steps I mentioned will be examined in the context of both the forthcoming National Development Plan and the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Plan.</p>  <p>  As a final point, I would just reiterate what I have stated previously, that adding additional capacity cannot be the only answer.  In tandem with this, we need fundamental reform of our health system - with significant development of the primary and community care system. Sl&aacute;intecare provides the blueprint for this.</p></reply>

Waiting times are often unacceptably long and I am conscious of the burden that this places on patients and their families.</p>  <p>  Budget 2018 allocated a total of &euro;55 million for the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, and more than doubles the 2017 allocation of &euro;20 million.  The HSE and the NTPF are currently preparing 2018 waiting list action plans for 2018, with a specific focus on reducing the number of patients waiting the longest for inpatient and daycase procedures. </p>  <p>  In addition, Budget 2018 also announced funding under the winter measures in 2017, which facilitated the roll out of further waiting list initiatives.  In this context, the HSE has targeted key areas and specialties where there are patients in need of complex high-cost care.  This includes additional funding to support the purchase of equipment and consumables for bariatric surgery in St Vincent's University Hospital which will provide the basis for provision of additional activity in 2018. </p>  <p>  I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly in respect of the particular issues raised.</p></reply>

Securing access to existing and new and innovative medicines is a key objective of the  health service.  However, the challenge is to do this in an affordable and sustainable manner.  The medicines bill for the community drugs schemes &ndash; primarily the GMS, long-term illness and drugs payment schemes and the high tech arrangement &ndash; was approximately &euro;1.8 billion in 2017. </p><p>To ensure patients receive the highest quality care, resources invested in medicines must be used efficiently and effectively.  This requires an integrated approach to secure best value for money for all treatments, greater efficiencies in the supply chain and the use of the most cost-effective treatments.</p><p>Lidocaine 5% medicated plaster is licensed for the symptomatic relief of neuropathic pain associated with previous herpes zoster (shingles) infection, known as post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN), in adults.  It has been reimbursed in the community drugs schemes since 2010.  The projected budget impact on introduction was low due to the specific licensed indication but total expenditure has increased significantly, from &euro;9.4 million in 2012 to over &euro;30 million in 2016, mainly from off-license use for pain not associated with shingles. </p><p>An HSE Medicines Management Programme, MMP, review of this product highlighted that the clinical evidence for its use in PHN is limited due to lack of comparative data, and its value is uncertain for all other types of pain.  The National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics estimated that, in Ireland, only 5-10% of prescribing of this product has been for the licensed indication of PHN. </p><p>Following the MMP review, the HSE introduced a new reimbursement system for the product from 1 September 2017.  This process supports its appropriate use, ensuring that PHN patients continue to receive this treatment.  The HSE estimates that this protocol will reduce annual expenditure on this product by approximately 90%.</p><p>Under the protocol, all patients who were receiving antivirals for shingles were automatically approved for the lidocaine medicated plaster for three months.  No action was required by GPs and the patient&rsquo;s pharmacy was notified of his or her approval status.</p><p>These patients were identified and automatically registered on the HSE-PCRS system for three months and continued to receive the treatment from their pharmacy until 30 November 2017.  However, since 1 December 2017, non-shingles patients no longer receive this item under the community drugs schemes.  The HSE has produced information leaflets for patients and advised GPs on treatment alternatives. </p><p>In exceptional circumstances, the product may be approved for supply through the community schemes for unlicensed indications.  GPs apply for reimbursement for unlicensed indications through the online system.  The MMP reviews applications before a decision is made and communicated to the GP.</p><p>Full details of the review are available on the HSE website at</p><p><i></i></p><p>This decision is a matter for the HSE.  However, I fully support the objectives of the HSE medicines management programme.</p></reply>

It was reopened briefly in September 2009, with limited additional funding, to accommodate farmers who had applications completed or close to completion at the time of suspension.  I can confirm that as there is no funding available for a new Early Retirement Scheme at this time, I have no plans to re-open this scheme or introduce another similar scheme.  </p>  <p>  In recent years the priority of my Department has shifted to the encouragement of generational change for farmers.  There are a number of supports specifically available for young farmers under my Department schemes in order to incentivise this generational renewal.  For example, under the 2014 - 2020 Rural Development Programme there is for an enhanced capital investment scheme for young trained farmers. </p>  <p>  This new Scheme provides grant aid at a rate of 60% of the cost of the investment, compared to the standard grant rate of 40%, and I believe it is an important support and encouragement to young farmers starting in agriculture for the first time.</p></reply>

The Directive imposes a legal obligation on Member States to achieve new savings each year, from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2020, equivalent to 1.5% of the annual energy sales to final customers of all energy distributors and all retail energy sales companies.  The EEOS places obligations on energy suppliers and distributors, who sell more than 600 gigawatt hours (GWh) of energy per year, to deliver savings from energy efficiency measures.Obligated Parties are required to deliver their savings across all sectors, with 75% to come from the non-residential sector, 25% from the residential sector. Of the 25% residential target , 5% of savings must come from energy poor dwellings.  In 2018 the combined obligated target for all Parties is 700 GWh of energy savings.</p><p>Supported by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI), which administers the scheme, there are a number of ways in which my Department engages with the Obligated Parties. I issue each obligated party with an Energy Efficiency Notice that details their annual targets and sectorial breakdown, and penalties for non-compliance. SEAI provides reports to the  Obligated Parties and the Department on progress to target.  Senior representatives of the Obligated Parties meet with my officials and the SEAI at quarterly EEOS Governance Group meetings, which are chaired by a senior official of the Department and cover the operation and governance of the scheme. Obligated parties meet regularly on an informal basis with the SEAI to discuss their progress on the scheme, and with my Department as part of regular stakeholder engagement with the energy sector. Where changes are proposed to the scheme, Obligated Parties are invited to workshops by SEAI and are also invited to submit written proposals. </p><p>As regards the methods Obligated Parties use to achieve to achieve energy savings, in the non-residential sector, these include, upgrades to lighting, ventilation and air conditioning, heating systems, motors, drives and pumps etc.  In the residential sector, most of the measures are fabric upgrades (insulation) or heating and control upgrades. Since the scheme commenced in 2014, obligated parties have delivered a large number of electric-based heating projects,  which include the installation of Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plants towards non-residential targets and the installation of heat pump systems towards residential targets. There have also been a number of transport projects focusing primarily on<font color="#2C2C2C"> e</font>co-driving, fleet and energy management<font color="#2C2C2C">.</font>This year, some Obligated Parties are proposing to carry out a number of projects to promote the uptake of electric vehicles and the installation of charging infrastructure, particularly in the commercial sector. </p><p>The objective of the Scheme is to incentivise a competitive market to deliver energy savings. While Obligated Parties do report the measures they carry out to the SEAI and to my Department  for monitoring and reporting purposes, the measures they choose to carry out to meet their targets are a commercial decision for them. ​</p><p>Energy efficiency is the first step in reducing our dependence on fossil fuel. The less energy we use, and the more flexibly we use it, the easier it is to integrate low carbon generation, transport and heating technologies. By the end of 2020, the scheme is required to deliver 4,375 GWh of savings.  As of the end of 2017 the obligated parties have delivered just over 2,600 GWh in savings under the scheme. This demonstrates the crucial importance of the scheme for Ireland's progress to its 2020 energy efficiency target - a crucial milestone in our path to a low carbon energy future. </p></reply>

In that regard, the Government has introduced a range of policy measures and schemes to incentivise the use of renewable energy and deliver energy efficiency. While funding of the energy transition will be primarily through commercial and household investment and charges on energy use, it is being strongly supported by Government initiatives as well as EU funding.     Ireland's first statutory National Mitigation Plan, which I published in July 2016, provides a framework to guide investment decisions by Government in domestic measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  Decisions on the funding of particular measures will be a matter for Government consideration in the context of expenditure planning in the Estimates and Budgetary processes, and in the forthcoming National Development Plan. Individual investment or expenditure decisions will also, in the normal course, be subject to appropriate appraisal in line with the Government's Public Spending Code.</p>  <p>  Budget 2018 marked a step change in efforts to achieve Ireland&rsquo;s energy efficiency targets and renewable energy objectives. Funding this year will increase by 43% over 2017 levels, moving from a base at the formation of this government of &euro;84 million in 2016 to &euro;154 million in 2018, supporting energy efficiency programmes as well as schemes to incentivise renewable heat, electric vehicles and increase energy research.</p></reply>

The Commission for Regulation of Utilities, following a public consultation process, published its independent regulatory decision in relation to electric vehicle charging infrastructure in October 2017, providing clarity regarding the ownership, operation, maintenance and investment required in the public EV charging network.</p><p>A key outcome of the decision is that the charging network should not form part of the regulated asset base and expansions of the network should not be funded from network charges.  This is in keeping with the proposals set out by the European Commission in the Clean Energy for All Europeans package which was published in 2016.  While the regulatory decision envisages the sale of the infrastructure by ESB Networks in the long-term, the continued ownership of the charging network by ESB Networks for a transitional period of up to ten years is provided for in order to safeguard those who rely on public electric vehicle charging infrastructure and result in as little impact to the network as possible in the short to medium term.  </p><p>In terms of developing public charging infrastructure for electric vehicles in the future, the decision sets out the need for charging infrastructure to operate on a commercial basis.Currently, recharging electric vehicles at public charge points is free and unlimited.  This provision of free fuel for electric vehicles, funded by electricity consumers, is not sustainable in the longer term particularly as the number of EVs increases.  At the same time, it is important that if payments for use of public charge points are introduced in the future, they are at a level which does not disincentivise the uptake of electric vehicles.  </p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">I secured additional funding in Budget 2018 to support the provision of public charging.  The Low Emissions Vehicle Taskforce, which is co-chaired by my Department and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, is considering a range of options for effective and efficient EV charging. The key objectives are supporting the operation of the existing charging network and facilitating the expansion of the network, with a particular focus on increasing the number of fast chargers.  The Taskforce held a stakeholder workshop in November 2017 to explore issues related to the future requirements for the public charging infrastructure. This workshop included representatives of EV owners, the motor industry, local authorities and other key stakeholders. Invaluable feedback was provided which will assist the taskforce in devising a sustainable policy framework for effective and efficient electric vehicle charging.</font></p></reply>

The design of the new scheme has included an extensive independent economic appraisal. This appraisal compared the cost of supporting a range of commercial renewable technologies, at various scales including micro-generation, to ensure that the new scheme delivers value for money for energy users whilst also delivering on the energy pillars of sustainability and security of supply.<font color="#1F497D"> </font>A public consultation on the new Scheme, which closed in November 2017, resulted in over 1,250 responses which are being analysed currently.  A cornerstone of the new scheme will be the provision of pathways for increased community ownership and participation in and benefit from renewable electricity projects in line with the 2015 Energy White Paper commitments. Communities and citizens are effectively being designed into the fabric of the new scheme and a comprehensive assessment of polices and support measures to underpin this ambition has been undertaken.  </p><p>One of the highest ranking community measures proposes a separate &lsquo;community-led&rsquo; category for projects that are initiated or majority owned by individuals or groups within the local community. I will also ensure that structures are put in place to support citizens and community groups, who may wish to develop their own project or participate in a developer-led project, overcome legal, financial and technical barriers to renewable electricity generation.</p><p>Micro generation was also appraised as part of the RESS economic assessment. The analysis identified a number of challenges that may need to be addressed before a support scheme for micro generation can be developed. Notwithstanding this, I am committed to further exploring opportunities for supporting micro generation, as I believe that micro-generation could have an important role in Ireland&rsquo;s transition to a low carbon economy, in assisting Ireland meet its renewable electricity targets, and increasing social acceptance of renewable energy projects right across the country. </p><p>In October 2017 my Department and SEAI hosted a workshop on micro generation which discussed a number of these challenges with relevant stakeholders. On foot of this workshop, I have asked the SEAI to conduct a short study to assess the likely demand for and impact of micro generation among the public.  It is my intention to launch a grant aided pilot scheme this summer for solar PV micro generation initially targeted at self-consumption and for domestic properties. My Department will work with the micro generation sector and the SEAI to better understand how to validate and further develop these policies in a fair and cost effective manner. </p><p>Following on from the RESS public consultation and review, a final design proposal will be brought to Government for approval in the coming months, including the overall costs and technologies to be supported.

The name was changed to the Irish Coast Guard (IRCG) in 2000 and the division was subsequently transferred to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport in 2006.</p>  <p>  The IRCG have a number of functions, which include Search and Rescue (SAR) and Maritime Pollution Prevention and Response. SAR functions are provided for in International Conventions promulgated by both the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) and the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), Ireland is a contracting State to both organisations.</p>  <p>  As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport I am empowered, through National and EU Legislation, to appoint authorised officers to carry out certain functions. In relation to Maritime Pollution, there is a suite of legislation, The Sea Pollution Acts 1991-2006 under which I have appointed officers of the IRCG as authorised officers to enable them to carry out their duties.</p>  <p>  Further powers are provided for in The Merchant Shipping (Salvage and Wreck) Act 1993 whereby officers are authorised for the purposes of saving shipwrecked persons, a vessel in distress or the cargo or apparel of the vessel.</p>  <p>  Additionally, European Communities (Vessel Traffic Monitoring and Information System) Regulations 2010, give the IRCG powers to act in relation to Places of Refuge incidents and the monitoring of hazardous ships.  </p>  <p>  Finally, Annexe 12 (Standards &amp;amp; Recommended Practices Search &amp;amp; Rescue) (Designation Of Authorities) Order, 1995, designated the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications as the authority responsible for execution of powers under Annex 12 to the Chicago Convention, other than in relation to Aviation Rescue Co-ordination Centres and Rescue Co-ordination Sub-Centres, which are the responsibility of the Irish Aviation Authority. This search and rescue function, where it relates to aviation accidents at sea, is carried out on my behalf by the IRCG.</p></reply>

In order to do this efficiently, the trustees will want to achieve as high a rate of return as possible, but only if risks are kept to an acceptable level.  On the other hand, the lower the target rate of return, the higher the contribution required will be.  The fundamental challenge of setting the investment strategy is balancing the need for adequate returns with the ability of the scheme to tolerate risk.</p>  <p>  The Pensions Authority has published guidelines for setting investment strategy for pension schemes.  These guidelines are based on the Occupational Pension Schemes (Investment) Regulations, 2006 made under the Pensions Act 1990, as amended.  Trustees are also required to check the relevant clause in their trust deed to ensure that any investment which might be planned is permissible.</p>  <p>  The Regulations state that scheme assets must be invested in a manner designed to ensure the security, quality, liquidity, and profitability of the portfolio as a whole so far as is appropriate having regard to the nature and duration of the expected liabilities of the scheme.  Furthermore the assets of the scheme must be properly diversified in such a way as to avoid excessive reliance on any particular asset, issuer or group of undertakings and so as to avoid accumulations of risk in the portfolio as a whole.</p>  <p>  To date, neither I nor my Department have discussed relaxing the current Occupational Pension Scheme (Investment) Regulations with the Pensions Authority.  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

For the first time, this has given the self-employed access to the safety net of State income supports if they become permanently incapable of work as a result of an illness or disability without having to go through a means test. When deciding to extend access to this benefit to the self-employed, Government wanted to ensure that it was on a similar basis to that of those in employment.  This is a real advance in the level of cover available to the self-employed.</p>  <p>  Invalidity pension (IP) is a payment for people who are permanently incapable of work because of illness or incapacity and who satisfy the pay related social insurance (PRSI) contribution conditions.  To qualify for IP a claimant must, inter alia, have at least 260 (5 years) paid PRSI contributions since entering social insurance and 48 contributions paid or credited in the last or second last complete contribution year before the date of their claim.  Only PRSI classes A, E, H or S contributions are reckonable for IP purposes.  Class S contributions are those paid by self-employed people.</p>  <p>  Voluntary contributions paid by formerly self-employed people are not reckonable for IP; they are reckonable for State Pension Contributory, Guardian&rsquo;s Contributory Payment and Widow&rsquo;s, Widower&rsquo;s and Surviving Civil Partner&rsquo;s Contributory Pension.</p>  <p>  A person who applied for Invalidity Pension in 2017 must have the required 260 paid PRSI contributions and also have 48 paid or credited class A, E, H, or S contributions in either 2015 or 2016 to meet the contribution conditions of the scheme.  This is a legislative requirement and contributions outside of the reference period cannot be assessed for the purposes of establishing the required 48 paid or credited contributions.</p>  <p>  The Department received a claim for IP for the gentleman concerned on the 29 December 2017.  He was refused IP on the grounds that the contribution conditions for the scheme are not satisfied.  Specifically, he does not have any qualifying contributions paid or credited in the reckonable years 2015 &amp;amp; 2016.  He was notified on the 12 January 2018 of this decision, the reason for it and of his right of review and appeal.</p>  <p>  On foot of your representation a review of the decision of 12 January 2018 has been completed and it has been decided that there is no change to the original decision.  The gentleman concerned was notified on 29 January 2018 of the outcome of the review and of his right to appeal the decision to the independent Social Welfare Appeals Office within 21 days.</p>  <p>  In line with the original objective of this measure, any proposed changes to the current scheme conditions would have to be considered for other social insurance contributors including employed contributors. Therefore, any changes on the lines proposed would be expected to have significant financial implications and any decision to improve these provisions would be a matter for Government to consider in the context of the Budget.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the issue for the Deputy.</p></reply>

According to the records of my Department, the person has a social insurance record of 1,688 reckonable contributions and credits during that period.  The person concerned is in receipt of the correct rate of contributory pension based on this social insurance record.  The person was notified in writing of their pension award on 31 January 2017.  Attached to that letter was a copy of their contribution record, as held by my Department and upon which their entitlement was calculated.  If the person concerned considers they have additional unrecorded contributions or credits, it is open to them to forward relevant documentary evidence and my Department will review their entitlement.</p>  <p>  In addition to the person&rsquo;s Irish record, they have 522 recorded UK contributions for the tax years 1971/72 to 1972/73 and 1975/76 to 1983/84 inclusive.  The person&rsquo;s entitlement to a state pension (contributory) EU pro rata has also been examined.  As the person&rsquo;s entitlement to this pension is at a lower rate, the person concerned is financially better off on their existing (standard) state pension (contributory) and has been notified of this decision in writing on 21 August 2017.</p>  <p>  The person concerned appealed the decision and a letter of clarification about the decision was issued to them on 26 September 2017.  If the person is not satisfied with the clarification they have received, they should contact the Social Welfare Appeals Office.</p>  <p>  Last week the Government announced proposals that pensioners who qualified for state pension (contributory) since September 2012, and whose rate of entitlement was impacted by the 2012 rate band changes, may apply for a review to have their entitlement considered under a new Total Contribution Approach (TCA).  It will take some time to draft and pass the necessary legislation, and then develop the systems and procedures necessary to administer the new pension entitlement option.  It is not necessary for any individuals to contact the Department at this juncture as the Department will contact them once the legislation, processes and systems have been developed.  Therefore, it is expected that these pensioners will start receiving invitations from my Department in Q4 2018 to apply for a review under the new pension eligibility arrangements and to notify any periods spent caring for which HomeCaring credits may be due.  Review applicants will be notified of the outcome of their review and the higher rate of entitlement, where applicable, will be paid to them. Where an increase is awarded, it will be backdated to 30 March 2018.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the performance of his functions under the Acts and the making of valuations for rating is his sole responsibility. The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government has no function in decisions made in this regard. The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority.</p>  <p>  The Commissioner for Valuation has responsibility for valuation matters, including the revaluation of properties. The Valuation Acts provide for the revaluation of all rateable property within a rating authority area so as to reflect changes in value due to economic factors such as business turnover, differential movements in property values or other external factors and changes in the local business environment. This is a welcome and positive development which is long overdue and on which considerable progress has been made in recent years. Having a modern valuation base is very important for the levying of commercial rates on a fair and equitable basis across all economic sectors.</p>  <p>  The general outcome of the revaluations conducted to date by the Valuation Office has been that about 60% of ratepayers have had their liability for rates reduced following a revaluation and about 40% have had an increase, a pattern which is expected to be replicated elsewhere as the revaluation programme advances.</p>  <p>  Commercial rates form an important element of the funding of all local authorities. The principle of local authorities levying rates based on an independent valuation is well established and I have no plans to change this. However, the legislative basis for the levying of rates is spread over a number of enactments, some dating back to the 19th century. My Department has developed legislative proposals to modernise and consolidate the legislation governing commercial rates. In this regard, the Government last year approved the drafting of a Rates Bill. The General Scheme of the Bill is currently with the Attorney General&rsquo;s office for drafting, with a view to its introduction as soon as possible.</p></reply>

They found that 14 of the 16 largest AHBs should be re-classified as falling within the public sector, under the broad local government classification.</p>  <p>  While a final decision has yet to be taken by Eurostat regarding this matter, detailed analysis of the potential impacts on the Government debt and expenditure is underway. My Department is examining the implications of this decision by the CSO in detail, in close collaboration with my colleague, Minister Donohoe's Departments.</p>  <p>  To inform these considerations, the CSO is currently engaged in collecting the required data to compile the end-March 2018 Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP) notification tables that cover  general government deficit and debt. At the same time, the Department of Finance is also preparing the Stability Programme Update 2018. This will take full account of the figures published by the CSO as part of the government finance statistics release.</p>  <p>  The on-going work aims to identify what measures can be taken to manage or mitigate the potential impacts on the capacity of the AHB sector in the supply and management of social housing. I intend to bring proposals to Government with a view to exploring the options available to us that will ensure that the commitment to the AHB sector's role in contributing to delivery of social housing under Rebuilding Ireland is met.</p></reply>

The pyrite remediation scheme is a scheme of &ldquo;last resort&rdquo; and is limited in its application and scope.  The full conditions for eligibility under the scheme are set out in the scheme which is available on the Board&rsquo;s website, <i>www.pyriteboard.ie</i>.</p><p>In accordance with the provisions of the Act, the Board is independent in the performance of its functions, and as Minister, I have no role in the operational matters (including sampling and testing) pertaining to the implementation of the scheme.  The Board may be contacted by phone at Lo call 1890 252842 or by email to info@pyriteboard.ie or alternatively at oireachtasinfo@pyriteboard.ie.</p><p>The scheme is applicable to dwellings, which are subject to significant damage attributable to pyritic heave, established in accordance with I.S. 398-1:2013 - Reactive pyrite in sub-floor hardcore material &ndash; Part 1: Testing and categorisation protocol.  In this regard, it is a condition of eligibility under the scheme that an application to the Board must be accompanied by a Building Condition Assessment with a Damage Condition Rating of 2.  Dwellings which do not have a Damage Condition Rating of 2 are not eligible to apply under the scheme.  This ensures that, having regard to the available resources, the focus of the scheme is on dwellings which are most severely damaged by pyritic heave.  I have no proposals to amend this eligibility criterion.</p><p>The Report of the Pyrite Panel (June 2012) recommended a categorisation system as a means of prioritising pyrite remediation works in recognition of the expensive and intrusive nature of pyrite remediation and the unpredictability of pyritic heave. The independent Pyrite Panel was clear in its view that only dwellings with significant damage due to pyritic heave should be remediated and that it would be unreasonable to expect dwellings not exhibiting such damage to be remediated.</p><p>Dwellings which have no significant damage but have reactive pyrite in the hardcore material should be monitored and only remediated if they display significant damage due to pyritic heave.  This remains the position with regard to dwellings which do not display significant pyritic damage.</p><p>On foot of this recommendation of the Pyrite Panel, the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) published I.S. 398-1:2013 Reactive pyrite in sub-floor hardcore material Part 1: Testing and categorisation protocol in 2013. The standard provides the means by which dwellings that may be affected by pyrite can be tested and categorised.</p><p>In late 2015, the NSAI commenced a review of I.S. 398-1:2013 in the light of practical experience since the standard was first introduced in January 2013.  The standard was updated and revised to reflect the on-site experiences and evidence gathered by technical experts, such as engineers, geologists, professionals providing sampling and testing services and other technical experts, who have been using the standard over the past four years and was published on 4 August 2017.</p><p>I welcome the revised standard published by the NSAI and in this context I signed the Pyrite Resolution (Standard for Testing) Regulations 2017 (S.I. No. 556 of 2017) on 6 December 2017. These Regulations provide that pursuant to section 14(9)(a) of the Pyrite Resolution Act 2013, the &ldquo;standard for testing&rdquo; for the purpose of the Act shall be Irish Standard 398-1:2017 Reactive pyrite in sub-floor hardcore material &mdash;Part 1: Testing and categorisation protocol, as published by the National Standards Authority of Ireland on 4 August 2017.</p><p>My Department is in regular contact with the Pyrite Resolution Board and the Housing Agency with regard to the implementation of the scheme. Any amendments, which the Board consider are required to the scheme as a result of the revised standard will be given full consideration should they be submitted to me in accordance with the requirements of the Act.</p><p>The latest figures available indicate that a total of 1,963 applications have been received under the pyrite remediation scheme.Of the 1,963 applications received so far, 1,523 dwellings have been included in the pyrite remediation scheme and the applicants notified accordingly.</p><p>A further 110 applications have been validated and referred to the Housing Agency for the Assessment and Verification Process, while another 218 applications are at the initial Application and Validation Process. 112 applications under the scheme were not successful.</p><p>Of the 1,523 dwellings that have been included in the pyrite remediation scheme: 343 are at remedial works planning stage; 96 are at tender decision; 139 are under remediation; and 945 are complete.</p><p>With regard to funding, a sum of &euro;25 million was expended on the operation of the pyrite remediation scheme in 2017.  This funding facilitated the remediation of some 400 additional dwellings.</p><p>An increased amount of &euro;30 million was announced under Budget 2018 to fund the operation of the pyrite remediation scheme in 2018.  This allocation will facilitate the remediation of some 430 additional dwellings this year and is a clear signal of the continuing importance attached by Government to addressing the issue of significant pyritic damage in private dwellings.</p><p>Ultimately, the Pyrite Remediation Board, together with the Housing Agency, will arrange for all eligible dwellings to be remediated to a high standard and at no additional cost to the affected homeowners. Remediation works will continue to be carried out at the earliest possible opportunity having regard to the existing demands of the scheme and the optimum use of available resources.</p></reply>

Through releasing the value of their land, the cost of providing rental units can be reduced by lowering the initial investment and development costs for providers.  These providers could be Approved Housing Bodies or private entities.</p>  <p>  One of the main objectives of the Affordable Rental Scheme is to enhance the capacity of the rented sector to provide quality and affordable accommodation for households currently paying a disproportionate amount of disposable income on rent.  Cost rental has similar objectives but is much broader in scope, with the model based on rents that reflect the cost of delivery of a home, rather than based on the prevailing market rent. Rents are set at levels to recover the construction costs and to facilitate the management and administration of developments, but with only a minimal profit margin included. This provides greater certainty around the rent, regardless of what is happening in the market.</p>  <p>  The piloting of the Affordable Rental Scheme, by the Housing Agency and D&uacute;n Laoghaire Rathdown County Council at Enniskerry Road, provides an opportunity to prove some of the key concepts underpinning cost rental more broadly, constituting a vital step in the longer-term objective of developing a cost rental option for the wider rental sector. The cost rental sector can provide accommodation in mixed-tenure developments for social tenants, who receive rent support, and other tenants who pay the full cost rent.</p>  <p>  I expect local authorities to be proactive in developing and bringing forward innovative concepts regarding the use of their land for the delivery of both affordable homes for purchase and rent.  Therefore, I have asked each local authority to furnish a report to me by mid-February, setting out their plans for delivery, especially those in main urban centres. </p>  <p>  In terms of the timeline for delivery, like all publicly funded construction projects, the development of local authority sites for cost rental homes must comply with the Government&rsquo;s Capital Works Management Framework and procurement rules, the objectives of which are to ensure greater cost certainty, better value for money and financial accountability.</p></reply>

After preliminary consideration, local authorities have requested the persons having control of 231 of these buildings to have detailed fire safety assessments carried out.</p>  <p>  A guidance note &ndash; Fire safety Guidance Note 01 of 2017 Assessing Existing Cladding Systems in Buildings of More than Six Storeys, or More than 18m in Height &ndash; has been circulated to fire authorities and placed on my Department&rsquo;s website as a support for those undertaking assessments of cladding in medium to high rise building.</p>  <p>  In relation to providing information to crews in local fire stations, it is expected that information garnered by each local authority on the medium to high rise buildings in their functional area will be used as part of the basis for prioritising Pre-Incident Planning in each fire station area.  Pre-Incident Familiarisation involves the crews in each fire station visiting the highest risk premises (for example, hospitals, nursing homes, institutions, industrial / Seveso plants, shopping complexes, etc.) in their station area, to familiarise themselves with the overall layout of the building(s) and the specific risks and fire safety features associated with the premises.  A prelude to such visits usually involves the harvesting of information and preparation of site-specific &ldquo;Pre-Incident Plans&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  Pre-Incident Planning and Familiarisation work is generally managed on a fire station-by-station basis, and selection of priority buildings for Pre-Incident Planning in each fire station area is best left to local judgement.  However, additional information on medium-to-high rise buildings has been identified as part of the surveys carried out by fire authorities following the devastating fire at Grenfell Tower in London.  While it is expected that many medium to high rise buildings would already be included in current pre-incident planning priorities of local fire stations, it is expected that any additional information on fire safety arising from the fire safety assessments will be factored into on-going Pre-Incident Planning programmes at local level.</p></reply>

KCS is based on the internationally used systemic risk management approach and places emphasis on fire prevention and fire protection facilities in buildings, as well as on fire service response.</p><p>For the first time KCS sets national norms, standards and targets for the provision of safe and effective fire services in Ireland.  Further, KCS identifies priorities and sets ambitious targets for reductions in annual fire loss, including fire deaths and reasserts the principle of the nearest available fire appliance being deployed to an emergency incident, irrespective of administrative boundaries.</p><p>Following the publication of KCS, each fire authority was requested to undertake an initial Area Risk Categorisation process for its functional area, using a process set out in Chapter 7 of KCS, and to prepare a short report on the process and outcomes.  The Area Risk Categorisation process results in the area to which the first response is sent by each fire station, known as the &lsquo;fire station ground&rsquo;, being assigned a Risk Category(s) Grading, ranging across five grades, from very high, high, medium, low to very low risk.</p><p>Over the course of 2014/2015, the National Directorate&rsquo;s Management Board's External Validation Group (EVG) visited every local authority in the country as part of a new external validation process on area risk categorisation in Ireland arising from implementation of KCS.  In April 2016, the Board published the first EVG Report titled &ldquo;Local Delivery - National Consistency&rdquo;.  The report concluded, inter alia, that:</p><p>- Fire Services are applying and refining internationally recognised risk management approaches to reduce the fire risk and the annual toll of life and property loss caused by fire.</p><p>- Local authorities are matching the assessed fire risk in their individual fire station areas with services based on both full-time and retained fire service models, with a comprehensive support infrastructure, and applying a range of appropriate fire prevention and fire protection approaches.</p><p>- Local authorities have prioritised and maintained the financial and personnel resources in their fire services at a time when they have implemented significant reductions in all other areas.</p><p>- Local authorities have benchmarked their fire services against national standards and national norms, and a strong degree of consistency, linked to area risk categorisation, now exists in fire service provision; all local authorities are using, or are working towards, national norms as minimum standards.</p><p>A copy of this report is available on my Department's website at the following link: .</p><p>A consultation exercise with staffing interests was commenced on 10 March 2016 with a view to identifying potential enhancements to the ARC process.  It is intended to commence a second round of Area Risk Categorisation and associated external validation in 2018.</p></reply>

My Department supports the fire authorities through setting general policy, providing a central training programme, issuing guidance on operational and other related matters and providing capital funding for priority infrastructural projects.</p>  <p>  The information requested by the Deputy is not available in my Department.  It is the understanding of my Department that the front-line fleet consists of approximately 280 Class B fire appliances and sixty other special appliances, including aerial appliance and emergency tenders.  However, the Department is aware that fire authorities have further fire appliances in their fleets which are put to a variety of uses.  Management of the number, type and age of fire appliances are a matter for each of the local authorities who have responsibility for the assessment of their individual fire cover needs, including the provision and management of a fleet adequate to their requirements.</p></reply>

It is for the management of the building to implement the design strategy for fire safety and put procedures in place, including procedures for evacuation of the building, where necessary in the event of fire, and to ensure that all building occupants are aware of the arrangements in place.</p>  <p>  In most buildings and circumstances, the safest approach and the default option is for all occupants of the building to evacuate in the event of fire or alarm.  Special provisions are necessary for buildings, such as hospitals or nursing homes, where evacuation of patients or residents may not be feasible or advisable.  Buildings containing flats are intended to have a degree of fire resistance, and in most circumstances fires won't spread further than one or two rooms beyond the room of origin.</p>  <p>  In the case of buildings containing flats, the current fire safety guidance provides for two-stage fire detection and alarm.  Firstly, each flat should be provided with its own internal domestic detection and alarm system, which gives an initial warning only within the flat when fire or smoke is detected.  The strategy is that residents should evacuate, closing doors behind them, in the event of fire or alarm in their own flat.  Secondly, for protection of the shared areas of the building, a fire detection and alarm system is provided to detect fire or smoke arising in the shared escape routes, or a developing fire in an individual flat which may begin to threaten the shared escape routes.  This second system will give warning to residents throughout the building.  Generally, where residents receive warning of a fire in the building, outside their own flat, they should evacuate the building. </p>  <p>  In the case of very large or high rise buildings containing flats, there is provision for the fire detection and alarm system to initially  warn the occupants in the areas of the building most likely to be affected by fire.  In this way, a phased evacuation can be provided for; this helps to minimise disruption and to avoid congestion where large numbers of people are using stairways at the same time.  Following the initial warning, the fire detection and alarm system can give warning in areas more remote from the fire. </p>  <p>  Residents of premises containing flats should be informed regarding the strategy and arrangements in place in their particular building. </p>  <p>  Where fire services attend a fire in a building containing flats, the Incident Commander may decide to instruct an evacuation of the building, or, where it is considered that a fire is small, with localised effects, and can be readily brought under control, they may advise residents to stay in place while the fire is brought under control.</p></reply>

Any member of the public who is concerned about fire safety in a building should contact the person having control of the building in the first instance and their local Fire Service if the concerns remain unresolved.</p>  <p>  Local authority staff, including fire services staff, have powers of inspection, and where necessary enforcement, under the Building Control Act 1990 and the Fire Services Acts 1981 and 2003 and may undertake different forms of inspection for different purposes specified in the legislation referred to. Typically, in carrying out inspections under the Fire Services Act some or all of the following aspects will be reviewed:</p>  <p>  - The passive or inbuilt fire safety features in a building, such as the layout and escape routes from the building and the construction of the building; the required passive fire safety features relating to the use of the building and the scale and occupancy.  These features are generally set out in relevant guidance documents and codes of practice rather than in specific legislation or regulation;</p>  <p>  - The active fire safety features, such as fire detection and alarm systems, which alert persons on the premises to the danger of fire and enable them to use the means of escape;</p>  <p>  - The management of the building, including management of fire safety, to prevent fires occurring in the first place and to manage building services and fire safety to ensure that safety is not compromised. </p>  <p>  Guidance documents and codes of practice for various sectors set out generic fire safety management requirements. This generally includes dealing with issues such as assignment of staff responsibilities, providing information on fire safety in the premises, training staff for those responsibilities, putting management/ oversight arrangements in place, holding evacuation drills/ reviewing incidents to practice/ learn fire safety, maintaining a fire safety register in respect of the premises etc.</p>  <p>  A fire authority may require a 'person having control' over a building, or an owner or occupier of such a building, to carry out a fire safety assessment of such building and to notify the fire authority of such assessment. In such instances, the 'person having control' over a building may engage professional advisors to carry out these inspections and to assist with discharging their statutory duties; however, ultimate responsibility for fire safety in the building remains with the 'person having control'.</p></reply>

PDAs are the instructions given by a Chief Fire Officer (CFO) to the relevant Regional Communications Centre for the initial fire service response to a call for assistance. These include:</p><p>- Address PDAs - a listing of the order in which fire service response will be mobilised to any address;</p><p>- Incident specific PDAs (e.g. for Domestic Fires, Road Traffic Collisions etc.) setting the numbers and types of appliances to be mobilised to that category of incident; </p><p>- Specific Risk Premises PDAs (such as institutional buildings, Airports, Seveso/industrial etc.) listing the number and sequence of appliances for initial dispatch to the specific building.  </p><p>All PDAs may be varied by the Incident Commander in light of information available regarding the particular circumstances.  Part of the function of the three fire service Regional Communications Centres is to mobilise any additional resources ordered by the Incident Commander.  </p><p>A suite of national fire service PDAs  were set out in Appendix A of the national policy document &ldquo;Keeping Communities Safe&rdquo;.

The review involved discussions with the National Federation of Group Water Schemes, the representative body of the group water sector.  Discussions concluded in December, when I approved revised subsidy levels.  The new subsidy arrangements, endorsed by a special delegate conference of the Federation on 13 December 2017, came into effect on 1 January 2018.  </p>  <p>  The changes implement the recommendation contained in the report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services (JOCFFDWS), endorsed by both Houses of the Oireachtas in April 2017, that there be equity of treatment and equivalent financial support between households using public water services and those availing of private water services.  </p>  <p>  The revised subsidy levels are as follows:</p>  <p>  1) For the annual subsidy towards the operation and maintenance costs of group water schemes providing a supply of water for domestic purposes (knows as &lsquo;Subsidy A&rsquo;): </p>  <p>  The maximum subsidy per house in private group water schemes has increased from &euro;140 per household to &euro;231.  An increased maximum subsidy of &euro;281 per household is available for small schemes of less than 100 houses that are willing, in the interests of providing in the long-term a more sustainable water supply to their members, to progress towards rationalisation or amalgamation with other schemes.  </p>  <p>  The maximum subsidy per house for public group water schemes has increased from &euro;70 per household to &euro;115.  These are schemes that supply their members with water that is provided by Irish Water.  </p>  <p>  The portion of costs than can be recouped by group water schemes has also increased.  Typically up to 60% of costs have been covered by the subsidy payments.  This has increased to 85%.  There are also changes and simplifications to how these costs are assessed.  </p>  <p>  2) For the additional subsidy that is paid towards the costs of group water schemes that have long-term Operation and Maintenance Contracts (for example, as part of a Design Build Operate project) for the delivery of water (known as &lsquo;Subsidy B)&rsquo;: </p>  <p>  There has been an increase in the level of volumetric costs incurred by group water schemes operating under these contracts that is recoupable, from 60% to 85%.  This will allow for a greater portion of costs to be included within the subsidy payment.</p>  <p>  In addition to the above, my Department is currently finalising proposals to increase the level of grant support for users of private wells, details of which I will be announcing shortly.  </p>  <p>  Separate to the initial review of group water scheme subsidy levels and also in fulfilment of the JOCFFDWS recommendations, I will shortly be establishing a working group to conduct a wider review of investment needs and rural water services.  The review will focus on issues such as governance, supervision and monitoring of the sector, and capital investment requirements.  It is anticipated that this group would engage with relevant stakeholders and will aim to complete its work by mid-2018.  </p>  <p>  Cognisance will be taken in this regard of any required measures to support the implementation of the finalised River Basin Management Plan 2018-2021, which I plan to finalise and publish early this year.  </p></reply>

The most recently published statutory SSHA relates to the assessment carried out in June 2017.  This exercise recorded the number of households on all local authority waiting lists, as at 28 June 2017.  The figures reported in the SSHA refer to &lsquo;net need&rsquo; which is the number of applicants who are qualified for social housing support but whose need is not being met.  This figure excludes duplicate applications or those applicants whose need has been met but are on a transfer list.  </p><p>The results of the 2017 summary show that there were 85,799 households deemed qualified for, and in need of, social housing support, which is a decrease of -6.3% (-5,801) in net need compared to the 2016 summary.  </p><p>Full details in relation to the 2017 assessment are available on my Department's website, at the following link: </p><p><i></i>.</p><p>It is important to note that social housing is a demand led service and for that reason it is difficult to predict the degree to which housing lists will decrease or increase over the next 12 months.  The number of units delivered by local authorities in a given time period does not necessarily equate to the &lsquo;net need&rsquo; for social housing support reducing by an equivalent number.  The nature of the list is dynamic in that, as households are added to it, the needs of others are met and further households will leave the list for various reasons including the households themselves indicating that they no longer require State support.  </p><p>In terms of meeting the need of households on waiting lists across the country, Rebuilding Ireland set ambitious targets for social housing delivery.  Last year, an additional &euro;500 million was secured during Budget 2018 negotiations, to increase the social housing delivery ambition from 47,000 to 50,000 social housing homes by end 2021.  Combined with the target to deliver 88,000 tenancies under the Housing Assistance Payment  and Rental Accommodation Schemes, this means that we will meet the needs of almost 138,000 individuals and families over the lifetime of the Rebuilding Ireland plan.  </p><p>Details in relation to activity during 2017 were recently published and is available at the link below</p><p><i></i>.  </p><p>During last year, just under 26,000 households had their social housing need met, well ahead of the target of just over 21,000.  It should be noted that to date under Rebuilding Ireland, just under 45,000 households have had their social housing need met. We will continue to maintain a clear focus on delivery each year to 2021, ensuring that the ambitious targets set out in Rebuilding Ireland are fully achieved, including in 2018, when we have set a target to meet the social housing support needs of some 25,589 households.</p></reply>

To this end, details of some 1,700 hectares of land in local authority and Housing Agency ownership were published on the Rebuilding Ireland Housing Land Map, with the potential to deliver some 42,500 homes nationally.  This includes circa 135 hectares in the functional area of Kildare County Council.  These mapped sites can be viewed at the following link:</p><p><i></i>.  </p><p>In addition to this mapping exercise, all local authorities, including Kildare County Council, have been requested to prepare Strategic Development and Management Plans for housing lands in their ownership, with particular emphasis on prioritising those sites with the greatest potential to deliver housing at scale, in the short to medium term.  I want to see local authorities realise new social and affordable homes from their lands without delay.  Following the Housing Summit with local authority Chief Executives on 22 January, I have asked each Chief Executive to furnish a report to me by mid-February, setting out their plans for delivery.  </p><p>With regard to the social housing construction programme already underway for County Kildare, this can be seen in the Social Housing Construction Status Reports that my Department publishes quarterly.  The last such report reflects the position at end-Quarter 3 of 2017 and is available on the Rebuilding Ireland website at the following link:</p><p><i></i>.  </p><p>This latest report shows projects to deliver over 340 new social homes in Kildare that are either on site, recently completed or undergoing design and planning, with funding approval in place.  More projects are being approved on an ongoing basis for delivery as part of the Rebuilding Ireland targets and I have assured all local authorities that funding is in place to support delivery as soon as possible.  </p><p>The delivery of additional social and affordable housing will rely on the State developing the full potential of its residential land bank.  In the context of my Department's role in driving and co-ordinating housing delivery, I am establishing a dedicated Residential Land Management and Development Group to oversee this important work.</p></reply>

Under Pillar 2 of the Action Plan, 50,000 new social homes will be delivered by 2021, supported by &euro;6 billion in Exchequer funding.  Of these, 33,500 homes will be provided through direct construction and refurbishment.  Significant progress has been made in increasing the build programmes of local authorities and approved housing bodies and there are over 12,000 new homes in the social housing construction pipeline, which is being added to on a weekly basis.  </p><p>With the funding made available in Budget 2018, the aim is to meet the housing needs of almost 25,500 households during 2018.  Central to this delivery will be the construction of 3,800 new homes by local authorities and approved housing bodies, through direct build, turnkey developments, rapid delivery and regeneration programmes.  This construction programme underpinned by a multifaceted Action Plan is, I believe, the correct way to make a fast and sustainable response to the housing crises.  </p><p>The Social Housing Construction Status Reports, which I now publish quarterly, provide information on the construction programme underway for each local authority area.  The last published report, which sets out the position at the end of September 2017, shows that there were over 3,600 new social homes on site and under construction and a further 2,000 new homes with approval to appoint contractors and move onto the construction phase.  That report is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link:</p><p><i></i>.  </p><p>It will be these schemes that will form the bulk of the housing starts and delivery of the 3,800 homes targeted through new builds in 2018.  The precise timing for the advancement of each of these projects, including completion dates and tenanting, is a matter in the first instance for the relevant local authorities and approved housing bodies.  However, my Department is working closely with the local authorities on delivery, including through a new Delivery Office and through quarterly meetings to address challenges and delays that can and do arise with individual projects.  </p><p>Through these contacts, my Department working with the local authorities and approved housing bodies, is ensuring that the necessary quantum of projects is in place to meet our 2018 construction delivery targets.  Further project approvals are being added to the construction programme as they are developed and these will also form part of the delivery for 2018 and beyond.  </p><p>My Department does not hold comprehensive information on the planning process in the case of all social housing construction projects as this is a matter for the local authority.  In the interests of expediting projects, it is common for the planning process and my Department's approval process to operate in parallel rather than in sequence.  The information on social housing projects at the various stages of advancement that is published in the quarterly reports includes those that are at 'Stage 2' or 'pre-planning'. Projects beyond that stage will have secured planning approval.  </p><p>Projects that are at Stage 4 and beyond have been approved by my Department to appoint contractors and I look forward to seeing the homes involved completed and families receiving keys as soon as possible.</p></reply>

However, since 1 January 2016, a person cannot be discriminated against when renting because they are in receipt of certain housing related payments, including HAP.  If a person feels that they have been discriminated against by a landlord or their agent, they can make a complaint under the Equal Status Acts to the Workplace Relations Commission.</p>  <p>  Misunderstanding of the scheme is often to blame for discrimination and it highlights the need for the State to continue to explain and outline the many benefits of HAP to landlords.  My Department and local authorities have been involved in a range of national and local actions to clarify the operational benefits of HAP to landlords and agents.</p>  <p>  In order to highlight the benefits of HAP and to provide information on the scheme to interested parties, my Department has taken a number of targeted communications actions during 2017, including the provision of a dedicated HAP website which provides prospective HAP landlords and tenants with the information they need to understand how the HAP scheme works.  Local authorities are promoting the scheme locally, and engaging with letting agents and landlords who might be interested in entering into a HAP tenancy, while my Department is promoting the scheme by engaging directly with landlord representative bodies and fora.</p>  <p>  The Homeless HAP Place Finder Service operating in the Dublin local authorities, and in Cork City Council, is a targeted support for homeless households who are finding it difficult to secure HAP tenancies.  The Place Finder Service has been successfully utilised by the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive (DRHE) across the Dublin local authorities since February 2015, with more than 2,000 households currently being supported by the Homeless HAP scheme.  A similar service began operating in Cork City in 2017.</p>  <p>  In order to further assist homeless households in exiting emergency accommodation the Homeless HAP Place Finder Service, with effect from 19 January 2018, can now be made available in each of the 31 local authorities.  All local authorities are now being provided with the options to pay deposits and advance rental payments for any households in emergency homeless accommodation, in order to secure accommodation via the HAP Scheme.</p>  <p>  The day-to-day operation of the HAP scheme is a matter for individual Local Authorities.  My Department does not hold details on the processing times for HAP applications or payments.  The earliest date a HAP payment will issue to a landlord is the date a complete and valid HAP application has been received by the local authority.</p>  <p>  Limerick City and County Council provide a highly effective transactional shared service on behalf of all HAP local authorities.  This HAP Shared Services Centre (SSC) manages all HAP related rental transactions for the tenant, local authority and landlord.  Once a HAP application has been received and confirmed as valid by the relevant local authority, it is then processed by the HAP SSC.  On average, HAP applications are processed by the HAP Shared Service Centre within 1 working day of receipt.  Any rental payment arising for a given month will then be made to a landlord on the last Wednesday of that month.</p>  <p>  Over 32,000 eligible households are currently being supported through HAP, with over 20,000 individual landlords and agents providing accommodation via the scheme and receiving housing assistance payments.  HAP will continue to be a flexible support available to assist people with their long term housing needs immediately their need arises.  My Department continues to keep the operation of the HAP scheme under review.  In general, I am satisfied with the operation of the HAP and I consider it to be a key vehicle for meeting housing need and fulfilling the ambitious programme outlined under the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness.</p></reply>

Further details on the suite of initiatives announced on 22 January can be found at</p><p><i></i>.</p><p>The cost rental model, currently under development through a pilot initiative, provides that rents will be set at levels to recover the construction costs and to facilitate the management and administration of developments, but with only a minimal profit margin included.

The work was guided by a Steering Group, chaired by my Department and comprising representatives from local authorities, the Departments of the Taoiseach and Finance, as well as the Affordable Homes Partnership.  A copy of this report is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link:</p><p><i></i>.</p><p>The 2007 report made a number of recommendations and suggested a fundamental change in the manner in which affordable housing was operated.  It also recommended substituting an equity share arrangement in place of the time limited claw-back that existed when discounted affordable houses were sold.</p><p>Following on from the review process, the statutory framework was put in place, through the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, to provide for the introduction of a new type of affordable homes purchase scheme, based on an equity share approach.  A Regulatory Impact Analysis was conducted as part of that process.  The relevant provisions of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 were not commenced at the time, as affordability had eased so significantly during the economic downturn, and as such the programme of affordable housing initiatives were suspended in 2011.  However, I believe this is the opportune time to reintroduce an affordable purchase scheme that is streamlined, equitable and sustainable and it is my intention to commence the relevant provisions of the 2009 Act shortly.</p><p>In addition, the Housing Agency conducted in 2014 a review of the operation of Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.  Following on from that review, the Urban Regeneration and Housing Act 2015 was enacted which provided several amendments to remove the payment of cash in lieu of homes, the transfer of sites or parts of sites, so as to ensure that the remaining options are focused on the delivery of completed homes.  The focus of Part V is currently on the delivery of social housing only.</p></reply>

The paper is available on the ESRI's website at the following link: .</p><p>The finalisation of the NPF along with the 10-year Capital Investment Plan will be followed through by tasking our three Regional Assemblies to bring forward complementary Regional Spatial and Economic Strategies (RSESs), linking strategic national planning and investment with regional-scale physical planning and the local economic and community development functions of local authorities. </p><p>Development of the regions will be further considered as part of the RSESs and at the local scale as part of the City and County Development Plan process and Local Economic and Community Plans, consistent with the general targeted pattern of development of the NPF.</p></reply>

It will provide a sustainable and modern flagship venue aimed at promoting Irish culture in a key global city, engaging our large diaspora in America and in turn further deepening the strong bilateral relationship with the US, which are key strategic priorities for Ireland.  </p>  <p>  To-date, the Government has announced grant funding of &euro;4.3 million from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s support should be seen also in the context of the commitment to double our global footprint &ndash; culture is an important part of Ireland&rsquo;s footprint in the world. In this context the 2 Departments have worked closely with the Irish Arts Centre in relation to completing the funding package for the centre and a further announcement will be made in this regard in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  The funding provided by Government should also be seen in the context of the funding committed by the City of New York for the project (more than $35 million), by the State of New York (some $6 million) and by private donors. </p>  <p>My Department is coordinating the Government support for the project with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Both Departments are kept closely informed on developments and progress through the Consulate General in New York, and in this regard it is understood that ground-breaking on the now vacated 11th Avenue site will begin in the second quarter of 2018, subject to completion to final regulatory approvals.  This is a development project involving multiple public, private and community stakeholders, funding sources, regulatory bodies, and participants and the Irish Arts Centre schedules are best estimates and subject to revision.  </p>  <p>  The importance and future potential of having a state of the art flagship cultural institution in a key global city like New York should not be underestimated.  The Government looks forward to the completion of the New Irish Arts Centre and to deepening of our relationship with this important cultural institution into the future.</p></reply>
