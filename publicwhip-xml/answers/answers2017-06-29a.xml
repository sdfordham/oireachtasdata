    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-06-29a.7.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017062900065#WRA00600"><p>Given the extent of North-South trade, I am very conscious of the particular challenges faced by companies operating in close proximity to the border, many of which trade freely on both sides of the border.</p>  <p>  Current trade between Ireland and Northern Ireland is extensive and far-reaching. South to North trade in goods was valued at &euro;1.65 billion in 2016 and North to South trade was &euro;1.05 billion.  This trade is particularly significant for SMEs &ndash; over 15% of Irish SME exports are destined for the Northern Ireland market.  </p>  <p>  A recent study undertaken for InterTrade Ireland by the ESRI analyses a so-called &ldquo;worst-case scenario&rdquo; whereby WTO tariffs would apply to the trade of goods between the UK and the EU&rsquo;s Member States.  The report&rsquo;s key findings are that the imposition of WTO tariffs alone would have an effect of reducing cross-border trade by 9%.  In addition to the imposition of WTO tariffs, if the cost of Non Tariff Barriers, e.g. administrative and regulatory requirements were included, this would reduce cross-border trade by 16%.  The possible imposition of customs duties on cross border trade could also represent a significant impediment to such trade.  </p>  <p>  The Irish Government is engaged at every level in the Brexit negotiations and our trade, economic ties and our land border with the UK are central to these talks and every effort will be made to minimise the impact on the border.  You will recall that at the start of the formal talks between the EU and the UK on the 19 June, the EU&rsquo;s chief negotiator Michel Barnier specifically referenced the centrality and sensitivity of Ireland&rsquo;s border with the UK to the negotiations.</p>  <p>  Since the UK referendum, the State agencies under my remit - Enterprise Ireland (EI), the Local Enterprise Offices and Inter Trade Ireland - have been active in supporting companies in assessing and addressing their exposure to Brexit. </p>  <p>  EI&rsquo;s current &ldquo;#Prepare for Brexit&rdquo; campaign includes a Brexit Scorecard available to all companies to self-assess their preparedness for Brexit across all aspects of their business and which generates a report suggesting appropriate responses.  A &euro;5,000 &lsquo;BePrepared&rsquo; grant is also available to clients to prepare a Brexit action plan.</p>  <p>  My Department is providing InterTrade Ireland with additional funding this year to establish a new Brexit Advisory Service, which will provide factual advice, supports for capability building and other specialist expertise to SMEs.</p>  <p>  Each of the Local Enterprise Offices in the border counties can offer advice, training and mentoring to address Brexit challenges.  Each LEO can now offer financial assistance to clients to examine export options, to improve product innovation and improve the competitiveness of their business in the face of Brexit.</p>  <p>  I secured new resources, including an extra &euro;52Min Capital funding and funding for the agencies, extra staffing, in Budget 2017 to assist businesses to maintain and grow export markets.</p>  <p>  Based on significant analysis and stakeholder consultation, my Department is currently working on further measures targeted at the needs of companies in the wider economy around working capital and business development. </p>  <p>  The Regional Action Plan for Jobs for the Border region contains a large number of actions aimed at strengthening the enterprise sector in the region.  In particular, the new Regional Enterprise Development Fund of up to &euro;60m was launched on 29th May.  This Fund is aimed at supporting collaborative approaches to grow and sustain indigenous enterprise and jobs across the regions of Ireland.</p></reply>

The objective of publishing such a report is to provide the public with a continuing enhanced level of transparency about exports of controlled goods and services.  Export controls are of particular importance to my Department in ensuring compliance with the highest international standards in accordance with international law.  Our policy of free trade and open markets must conform with the core principles of security, regional stability and human rights which underpin export controls.  </p>  <p>  In 2015, 81 military licences were issued for exports to 16 countries.  In 2016, 128 military licences were issued for exports to 20 countries.  The increase in the value of licensed military exports between 2015 and 2016 is due mainly to increases in exports to Germany, USA and Singapore. </p>  <p>  The EU has a range of sanctions in place in respect of countries engaged in conflicts.  All licence applications are considered having regard to these measures.  Sanctions can include arms embargoes and various restrictive measures including prohibitions on the provision of targeted goods and services.  My Department observes all arms embargos and trade sanctions when considering export licence applications.</p>  <p>  All export licence applications, whether for Dual-Use or Military Goods are subject to rigorous scrutiny.  My officials seek observations on any foreign policy concerns that may arise in respect of a proposed export; such factors are subject to review in the light of developments in a given region and having regard to the 2008 EU Common Position on Arms Exports.  Any observations which may arise from this examination are considered in the final assessment of any licence application.</p>  <p>  My Department may refuse an export licence, following consultation with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and other EU and Non-EU export licensing authorities, as appropriate. </p>  <p>  The Control of Exports Act 2008 provides the legal basis for export controls, the licensing regime and the overall regulatory environment relating to the export of dual-use and military goods.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-06-29a.14.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017062900065#WRA01300"><p>As was announced previously, my Department will soon be commissioning an independent review of the Succeed-in-Ireland programme.  That review, which will be carried out after details of the initiative&rsquo;s full and final costs are available, will equip us with a thorough understanding of the programme&rsquo;s results and its contribution to employment generation in the State.  This is in the interests of good governance and ensuring value for money for the taxpayer. </p>  <p>  On the 20th of April my Department launched a public consultation calling for observations on the draft terms of reference for that review.  The consultation period ended on 26 May.  I am pleased that the consultation process elicited 17 different submissions. </p>  <p>  The responses that we received came from a broad range of stakeholders, including public representatives and the general public.  Many of the submissions provided general observations on the Succeed-in-Ireland initiative and its perceived strengths.  Others provided specific observations on the draft terms of references themselves.  All were welcome contributions that will help guide our approach in the time ahead. </p>  <p>  There has been no delay in finalising the terms of reference.  My Department is completing the examination of all the responses to the public consultation, a process which will help - as I have indicated - to shape the final text. </p>  <p>  I want to take this opportunity to acknowledge that the Succeed-in-Ireland initiative has contributed to the Government&rsquo;s ongoing efforts to win more foreign direct investment (FDI) and jobs for the people of this country.  Securing more FDI will remain a key priority of mine as Minister for Enterprise and Innovation. I look forward to working, together with my Department and its Agencies, to attract more overseas investment and employment to Ireland.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-06-29a.17.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017062900065#WRA01600"><p>The Department of Education and Skills is responsible for education and training provision.  This includes ETBs and several Institutes of Technology that are running courses supplying chefs. </p>  <p>  Failte Ireland has a primary function &ldquo;To support the training and education and development of persons for the purposes of employment within the Tourism Industry&rdquo;.  Failte Ireland falls under the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport. </p>  <p>  My Department has responsibility for the employment permits system.  Changes to that system are made on the basis of research undertaken by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN) in tandem with wider consultation. </p>  <p>  Chefs with expertise in a non-EEA cuisine at the level of executive chef, head chef, sous chef and specialist chef are eligible for employment permits and some 83 permits were issued to chefs this year.  In 2015 the EGSFN carried out a study on the future skills needs of the hospitality sector.  The EGFSN report provides a clear and coherent framework for the development of talent in the hospitality sector in the years ahead to help drive employment growth. </p>  <p>  The Study assessed skills demand at all NFQ levels, with a particular focus on career progression opportunities for those at lower skilled levels to help fill anticipated job openings.  The report provides a set of recommendations designed to address the skills requirements of the sector over the period to 2020.  While the emphasis is on developing skills in the resident labour market, the report recommends that the role migration can play should be kept under review.  </p>  <p>  The lists of highly skilled and ineligible occupations are reviewed twice yearly.  The current review will be completed in September.  I will then be in a position to determine, based on the evidence available, if any changes are required to the categories of chefs that are eligible for employment permits.</p></reply>

The information gathered during these engagements has provided my officials with a comprehensive understanding of the potential benefits of membership and therefore it has not been necessary for my department to hold further formal discussions with the European Southern Observatory since March.</p>  <p>  While the potential benefits of membership of the European Southern Observatory are significant, the cost of membership is also significant.</p>  <p>  The case for membership is being assessed in the context of other research and innovation priorities.  The cost of membership of the European Southern Observatory comprises a once-off payment of circa &euro;14 million (which may be spread over a number of years) and a recurrent annual cost of circa  &euro;3 million.  My objective is to ensure that we obtain the best overall return on our investment in research and innovation.</p></reply>

Since the first Plan was launched in early 2012, over 225,000 more people are at work.</p>  <p>  My Department does not gather data but uses the official data published by the CSO.  I assume the Deputy is referring to the CSO's Quarterly National Household Survey (QNHS), the official source of employment data in the State.  My Department uses the QNHS data, which is also used by Eurostat, to monitor performance against our employment targets.  The most recent figures available are for Q1 2017. </p>  <p>  Census 2016 was taken on the 24th April 2016 and measures employment at a moment in time only.</p>  <p>  According to Census 2016, there were 2,006,641 people at work in April 2016.  The CSO&rsquo;s most recent QNHS data release shows that almost 70,000 new jobs were created in the year to Q1 2017, bringing total employment in the State to 2,063,900. </p>  <p>  The CSO highlights the differences in methodology between the QNHS, the official source of employment data in the State, and Census 2016.  The main differences are that there is a greater degree of precision on the employment status of individuals in the QNHS, than in the Census form.  The Census uses a broad definition of whether unemployed or not, while the QNHS asks if the person, in the week before the survey was without work and available for work within the next two weeks, and had taken specific steps in the preceding four weeks, to find work.  In addition, the Census form is completed by the head of household while the QNHS is by face to face interview and the census is a complete enumeration while the QNHS is a sample survey. </p>  <p>  My priority is to work closely with Ministerial colleagues to keep us on track to achieve our goal to have an additional 200,000 people at work by 2020, with 135,000 outside Dublin.</p></reply>

If I am satisfied that the process provided for in the 2015 Act has been complied with by the Labour Court, I can then make the Order.  Where such an order is made it is known as a Sectoral Employment Order (SEO), will be binding across the sector to which it relates, and will be enforceable by the Workplace Relations Commission. </p>  <p>  To-date five applications for SEOs have been made to the Labour Court &ndash; one was withdrawn and one was rejected.  The remaining three are being considered by the Labour Court.  I am informed that no application has been made on behalf of workers or employers in the teaching English as a foreign language Sector.</p></reply>

WRC inspectors can also be asked to investigate certain breaches.  Complaints can be made on a single complaint form available at the WRC&rsquo;s website www.workplacerelations.ie.  Should the Deputies be aware of specific cases where there are breaches of employment laws they may wish to contact the WRC directly. </p>  <p>  There are existing mechanisms in place to determine the employment status of individuals or groups.  WRC Inspections are undertaken on the basis of risk analysis which identifies certain sectors, as a result of complaints received and on a routine basis.  Where the WRC inspection service receive complaints in relation to bogus self-employment, they are forwarded to the Revenue Commissioners and/or the Department of Social Protection (Scope Section) for investigation either solely by the recipient, or jointly with the Workplace Relations Commission. </p>  <p>  It is important that individuals are correctly designated regarding their employment status so that those who ought to be designated as employees are not deprived of their employment rights.  This is particularly the case for vulnerable workers who may not feel in a position to object to certain arrangements.  However, it is also important to remember that some individuals may be correctly categorized as self-employed.</p>  <p>  In most cases it will be clear whether an individual is employed or self-employed.  Where there is doubt in relation to the employment status of an individual the relevant Departments and Agencies will have regard to the Code of Practice for Determining Employment or Self-Employment Status of Individuals.  This Code was drawn up and agreed in 2007 by the relevant Government Departments with ICTU and IBEC.</p></reply>

The IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook published this month shows Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness ranking has improved for the third year in a row.  We are now ranked the 6th most competitive economy in the world and 2nd most competitive in the Euro area.  This is our best performance since 2000.  It reflects significant and continuous improvements in rankings related to economic performance, business efficiency, government efficiency and infrastructure.  It is an important signal to international  investors.  The UK is ranked 19th, a fall of one place since last year.</p>  <p>  In 2016, Ireland's ranking improved from 24th to 23rd out of 138 countries in the 2016 World Economic Forum Global Competitiveness Report.  The World Bank's Ease of Doing Business report shows Ireland is ranked 18th, ahead of the UK in terms of ease of starting a business and paying tax but behind in the overall rankings.</p>  <p>  Brexit means we must do more to enhance our attractiveness as a location to start and grow a business.  Recent reports by the National Competitiveness Council have highlighted the need to continually enhance competitiveness performance.  I share the Council&rsquo;s view that to further improve competitiveness we must preserve fiscal sustainability, maximise investment in infrastructure and talent, maintain cost competiveness, and drive innovation and productivity across all economic sectors. </p>  <p>  As Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, my focus is on ensuring Ireland enhances its competitiveness as a location in which to run a business.  Through the Action Plan for Jobs, my Department is working to improve the ease and cost of doing business, increase enterprise innovation capacity and productivity.  We are driving the implementation of our research strategy, Innovation 2020.  We are putting more people on the ground in foreign markets to attract investment, assisting Irish businesses which export to the UK and helping others diversify into new products and markets.

The wider area is home to 56 multinational companies, 17 of which are located in Meath.  The County's proximity to transport hubs and population centres are amongst its key strengths.  The IDA is working hard to secure new investment for Meath and it continues to draw the attention of investors to the County. </p>  <p>  As regard the business park in Droghda, the IDA is actively marketing the facility to existing and potential clients.  Currently the park is home to one Agency client that employs approximately 250 people.

The employment permits system is intended to offer a solution for employers where specific skills prove difficult to source within the EEA.  The system offers a conduit into the Irish labour market for non-EEA nationals with in-demand skills and is operated as a vacancy-led system.</p>  <p>  Statutory lists set out which occupations are deemed highly skilled eligible occupations and which are ineligible for consideration for employment permits.  Occupations not included on either list are considered eligible occupations but are subject to a labour market needs test.  Changes to access to the Irish labour market for specific occupations via the employment permits system are made on the basis of research undertaken by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN) in tandem with a consultation process, as part of a package of measures to meet those skills needs.  </p>  <p>  Currently, chefs with expertise in a non-EEA cuisine at the level of executive chef, head chef, sous chef and specialist chef are eligible for employment permits.  My Department&rsquo;s policy with regard to providing employment permits for these specific categories of chefs is that it is recognised that having a wide range of cuisines in the restaurant sector supports Ireland being an attractive destination for tourists. </p>  <p>  In 2015 the EGSFN carried out a study on the future skills needs of the hospitality sector.  The EGFSN report, which was published in November 2015, provides a clear and coherent framework for the development of talent in the hospitality sector in the years ahead to help drive both hospitality business and employment growth, one of the key goals of the Government&rsquo;s Tourism Policy Statement &ndash; People, Place and Policy-Growing Tourism to 2025.  </p>  <p>  The Study assessed skills demand at all NFQ levels, with a particular focus on career progression opportunities for those at lower skilled levels to help fill anticipated job openings.  The report provides a set of recommendations designed to address the skills requirements of the sector over the period to 2020.  While the emphasis is on developing skills in the resident labour market, the report recommends that the role migration can play should be kept under review.  </p>  <p>  The lists of highly skilled and ineligible occupations are reviewed on a twice yearly basis.  The current review is nearing completion and consideration is being given by my officials to submissions received, including those from the hospitality sector, as part of the public consultation in April.  This review process will be completed in September and I will then be in a position to determine, based on the evidence available, if any changes are required to the categories of chefs that are eligible for employment permits.</p></reply>

It is enabling the Department and, primarily, our Agencies recruit some 40 to 50 additional staff to supplement existing staffing numbers.  These numbers may grow as Agencies allocate additional Own Resource Income, by agreement with the Department, to recruit further staff to work on "Brexit-related" activity.  My Department is proactively engaged with the Agencies most notably Enterprise Ireland (EI), IDA Ireland, Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) and the Health and Safety Authority (HSA) in relation to the individual sanction and recruitment processes.  To date, EI has recruited 13 additional staff, IDA Ireland have recruited an additional four staff, while SFI and the HSA are progressing their recruitment processes.</p>  <p>  In so far as InterTradeIreland (ITI) is concerned oversight and funding of ITI is a joint responsibility of my Department and the Northern Ireland Department for the Economy.  My Department provided additional funding for ITI for Brexit related work in 2017. We have not however received any formal requests for additional staff resources this year.  My Department will continue to engage with ITI and with our counterpart Department in Northern Ireland on resourcing issues in the time ahead. </p>  <p>  As we progress the 2018 "estimates" process, and on an ongoing basis, my Department will keep under review the adequacy of resources available for staffing having regard to the other demands on my Department and family of Agencies given our wide remit.</p></reply>

I am very much aware that an important part of unlocking the potential of regional Ireland is ensuring that foreign direct investment (FDI) is spread as evenly as possible across the country.  The IDA is committed to increasing FDI in each region of Ireland and I welcome the progress made so far in boosting FDI-driven job creation outside of our main urban areas.  In 2016, for example, over half of all IDA Ireland supported jobs created were based outside of Dublin.</p><p>While the IDA always highlights the benefits of investing in the regions to prospective investors, it is important to note that a company's decision on where to locate can be influenced by a number of factors.

I understand that the CIF and SIPTU had reached an agreement.  I further understand that Unite the union has lodged a pay claim for its members.  I understand Unite served notice of industrial action on Monday June 19th with intermittent rolling strikes to hit a number of construction sites on June 27th.  As well as the pay claim there is, I understand, a dispute between UNITE and SIPTU in relation to representation rights in relation to the workers concerned.</p>  <p>  The hourly rate for cane drivers was previously set by an old Registered Employment Agreement (REA).  While that system was found to be unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in 2013 and could no longer be enforced by Ireland's labour inspectorate, it remained as an employment agreement between the parties. </p>  <p>  The Industrial Relations Act 2015, was subsequently put in place to restore a system for Sectoral Employment Orders on a constitutional basis.  This legislation provides a mechanism whereby at the request of an employer organisation or a Trade Union that is substantially representative of employers or workers in the Sector, the Labour Court may examine the terms and conditions relating to the remuneration and any sick pay scheme or pension scheme of workers in a Sector and make a recommendation to the Minister who may subsequently make a Sectoral Employment Order.  The Minister must be satisfied that the Court has complied with the provisions of the Act. </p>  <p>  It is reassuring to note that the Construction Industry Federation lodged an application for the Labour Court to examine the terms and conditions of craftsmen, construction operatives and apprentices in the Construction Sector.  This proposal for a Sectoral Employment Order is being progressed with all parties.  The Labour Court had a hearing on the matter on Monday last June 26th.  </p>  <p>  I understand that the dispute regarding the trade union representation rights has been referred to ICTU.  On the pay issue I hope you can join me in encouraging all the parties involved to make every effort to reach a resolution by agreement.  The State's industrial relations mechanisms are available to assist the parties if required. </p></reply>

EI offers clients a &lsquo;Be Prepared&rsquo; grant of up to &euro;5,000 towards the cost of preparing a Brexit Action Plan.  The Scorecard is also available through the Local Enterprise Offices.</p>  <p>  Since its launch in March 2017, the Scorecard has been accessed by over 1,200 businesses and is increasing all the time, indicating that a growing number of companies is thinking and acting in response to Brexit. </p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland and the LEOs are also working directly with clients and offer a range of supports, including training, mentoring, export research, key skills, innovation and business competitiveness, to help companies to address Brexit-related challenges.  In Budget 2017, my Department secured extra funding and staff resources to allow EI and the LEOs to provide the necessary supports. </p>  <p>  Bord Bia launched a similar analytical tool for Food companies last March and are in turn working directly with clients to devise Brexit strategies.</p>  <p>  At the wider economy level, my Department recently published the findings of a survey taken in January of over 1,000 SMEs on the challenges posed by Brexit.  The survey indicated that, while only 37% felt that there was some immediate impact, 61% expected to be impacted over the following 18 months.  Currency, costs and financial issues were the key concerns.  </p>  <p>  In response, the Department is currently working on further measures targeted at the needs of companies around working capital and business development and will be re-surveying companies in the near term.</p>  <p>  Against that background, the InterTrade Ireland survey interviewed 750 SMEs on both sides of the Border in the period January to March 2017 which, while of interest, is a relatively small sample.  My Department has provided InterTrade Ireland with additional funding this year to establish a new Brexit Advisory Service, which will provide factual advice, supports for capability building and other specialist expertise to SMEs. </p>  <p>  I am confident therefore that my Department and its agencies are closely monitoring the evolving situation and are providing the information and supports to help those companies threatened by Brexit to plan their response. </p></reply>

There have been 13 fatalities in the sector in Ireland so far this year.  </p>  <p>  The Health and Safety Authority (HSA, is adopting both a prevention approach and an enforcement approach in relation to improving safety on farms.  </p>  <p>  The &ldquo;prevention approach&rdquo; seeks to involve all stakeholders in the development and provision of sector specific information and guidance on all major areas of risk in farming.  This is being primarily rolled-out through the Farm Safety Partnership Advisory Committee which is an advisory committee to the HSA.  Membership of the Farm Safety Partnership is drawn from all of the main farming organisations such as IFA, ICMSA, Farm Relief Services, Macra na Feirme, Teagasc, Irish Cattle and Sheep Association, Coillte, Farm Relief Services Network, Irish Rural Link etc.  </p>  <p>  Its current Farm Safety Action Plan runs from 2016 to 2018 and has set out six goals as follows:</p>  <p>  - To achieve cultural behavioural change in health and safety of persons working in the agricultural sector through Research, Education and Training;</p>  <p>  - To develop programmes which will foster Innovative Approaches and deliver Engineering Solutions to reduce the risks to persons working in Agriculture;</p>  <p>  - To reduce the level of death and injury arising from Tractor and Machinery use;</p>  <p>  - To establish initiatives to reduce the level of death and injuries arising from working with Livestock; </p>  <p>  A cornerstone to the prevention approach is the Farm Safety Code of Practice (Code of Practice for Preventing Injury and Occupational Health in Agriculture) which is a simplified approach to on-site farm management of occupational safety and health.  This Code of Practice has recently been updated by the HSA to reflect modern farm risks.  Access to quality assurance schemes and farm modernisation grants, available from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, are now being linked to compliance with this Farm Safety Code of Practice.  </p>  <p>  In addition the Farm Safety Partnership has developed extensive user friendly guidance on all farm safety issues which is being brought to the attention of farmers through farm walks, Knowledge Transfer Groups, articles in the farming media and through farm TV at all major marts, through major events such as the Tullamore Show &amp;amp; National Ploughing Championships as well as dedicated farm safety campaigns.  </p>  <p>  The enforcement approach by the HSA involves farm visits and inspections to assess compliance standards.  These inspections are being carried out throughout the year but particularly during three targeted inspection campaigns in 2017.  The March campaign focused on Livestock Safety, the recent May campaign focused on Tractors &amp;amp; Machinery and the forthcoming November campaign will focus on Falls from Height and Falling Objects.  These visits and inspections are carried out in a cooperative approach seeking buy in from the farmer on the fundamental importance of safe farm practices.  These inspections are well received even though in about 50% of inspections some level of enforcement action will be taken by the inspector.  These include written advice, legal Improvement Notices and Prohibition Notices all of which legally must be complied with.  </p>  <p>  In addition to the activities of the HSA my colleague the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine has advised me that Teagasc is also re-focusing its efforts to assist the farming community to improve safety standards in the following ways;  </p>  <p>  - Teagasc Advisory and Education and Training staff  are highlighting the current trend in fatal farm accidents at all Teagasc events and classes and highlighting preventative measures;</p>  <p>  - Teagasc recently provided training on farm health and safety to all Knowledge Transfer Programme Facilitators operated by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  This training was conducted in association with Health and Safety Authority staff and focused on adapting farms to make them safer places in which to both work and live;</p>  <p>  - Teagasc provides an on-going programme on Occupational Health and Safety which includes Research, Advisory and Education and Training components and is conducting  a national survey of farm accident levels to gain knowledge on the level of non- fatal farm accidents;</p>  <p>  - Teagasc issues media releases, and monthly newsletters to keep farmer up-to-date with current health and safety trends and practices;</p>  <p>  - Teagasc will include a major health and safety exhibit at the upcoming National Dairy Open Day on 4th July at Moorepark Dairy Research Centre (Cork) </p>  <p>  Both the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Michael Creed T.D. and the Minister for Small Business and Employment, Pat Breen T.D., recently convened a meeting of the main farming representative organisations to express their concern at the ongoing high level of farm accidents and deaths and to call on the farming community to collectively, and individually, re-double their efforts to reduce and eliminate farm accidents and fatalities.  </p>  <p>  It was agreed at the meeting that it is farmers themselves, along with their families and their Communities, who can play the most vital role in putting adequate farm safety measures in place in the first instance.  All attendees were invited to submit proposals and suggestions on cross cutting actions that can be taken at farm level to complement the work being done by at a national level by the HSA and Teagasc and on how attitudes and behaviours can realistically be changed to ensure that health and safety considerations in farm work become much more prominent, automatic and widespread. </p></reply>

The aim is to ensure that the national minimum wage is adjusted incrementally over time having regard to changes in earnings, productivity, overall competitiveness and the likely impact on employment and unemployment levels. </p>  <p>  The Commission made its first recommendation in July 2015 when it recommended that the rate be increased to &euro;9.15 per hour.  That increase came into effect on 1st January 2016.  The Commission&rsquo;s second recommendation that the rate increase to &euro;9.25 per hour was made in July 2016.  It was subsequently accepted by Government and came into effect on 1st January last. </p>  <p>  The Commission is currently working on its next recommendation and will report to me on the matter in July.

Relying on an independent body such as the Low Pay Commission is the most appropriate approach to achieving the right balance and yearly adjustment to the national minimum wage levels.</p>  <p>  It is important that Ireland&rsquo;s statutory National Minimum Wage and the Living Wage concept are not conflated.  The Living Wage is a voluntary societal initiative centred on the social, business and economic case to ensure that, wherever it can be afforded, employers will pay a rate of pay that provides an income that is sufficient to meet an individual&rsquo;s basic needs, such as housing, food, clothing, transport and healthcare.  The Living Wage is voluntary and has no legislative basis and is therefore not a statutory entitlement.  It is different to the National Minimum Wage which is a statutory entitlement and has a legislative basis. </p>  <p>  I have no plans to bring forward proposals outside of the work of the Low Pay Commission. </p></reply>

All attendees were invited to submit proposals and suggestions on cross cutting actions that can be taken at farm level to complement the work being done by at a national level by the HSA and Teagasc and on how attitudes and behaviours can realistically be changed to ensure that health and safety considerations in farm work become much more prominent, automatic and widespread</p></reply>

The aim is to ensure that the national minimum wage is adjusted incrementally over time having regard to changes in earnings, productivity, overall competitiveness and the likely impact on employment and unemployment levels. </p>  <p>  The Commission made its first recommendation in July 2015 when it recommended that the rate be increased to &euro;9.15 per hour.  That increase came into effect on 1st January 2016.  The Commission&rsquo;s second recommendation that the rate increase to &euro;9.25 per hour was made in July 2016.  It was subsequently accepted by Government and came into effect on 1st January last. </p>  <p>  The Commission is currently working on its next recommendation and will report to me on the matter in July.  Any recommendation the Commission makes will then be considered by Government in the context of Budget 2018.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Partnership Government provides that the Government will rely on the annual recommendations of the Low Pay Commission.  Relying on an independent body such as the Low Pay Commission is the most appropriate approach to achieving the right balance and yearly adjustment to the national minimum wage levels.</p>  <p>  It is important that Ireland&rsquo;s statutory National Minimum Wage and the Living Wage concept are not conflated.  The Living Wage is a voluntary societal initiative centred on the social, business and economic case to ensure that, wherever it can be afforded, employers will pay a rate of pay that provides an income that is sufficient to meet an individual&rsquo;s basic needs, such as housing, food, clothing, transport and healthcare.  The Living Wage is voluntary and has no legislative basis and is therefore not a statutory entitlement.  It is different to the National Minimum Wage which is a statutory entitlement and has a legislative basis. </p>  <p>  I have no plans to bring forward proposals outside of the work of the Low Pay Commission. </p></reply>

My Department also ensures that companies can access the right type of funding, appropriate to their stage of development.  This ranges from microfinance right through to seed and venture capital, development capital and risk-sharing credit guarantees through the banks.</p>  <p>  Following significant analysis and stakeholder consultation, my Department is currently working on measures targeted at the needs of companies across the economy around working capital and business development. </p>  <p>  The objective of Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s new &ldquo;Global Ambition&rdquo; strategy 2017-2020 is to support enterprises across the economy to grow into strong Irish international companies, developing world-leading products and services and exporting them all around the world. </p>  <p>  These programme supports include management capability, leadership and marketing/sales skills, as well as promoting innovation and R&amp;D. Investment in these areas is the key to developing bigger and better Irish companies that can compete globally. </p>  <p>  In the context of Brexit, the &ldquo;Brexit SME Scorecard&rdquo; launched by Enterprise Ireland (EI) in March 2017, is a new interactive online platform which can be used by Irish companies to self-assess their exposure to Brexit.  In addition, Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s #PrepareforBrexit communications campaign includes a &ldquo;Be Prepared Grant&rdquo; that supports the costs of EI&rsquo;s SME clients in preparing a plan to mitigate risks and optimise opportunities. </p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Offices are the &ldquo;first stop shop&rdquo; for advice and guidance on starting or growing a business.  As well as providing training, mentoring and financial support in some instances, the LEOs can refer business clients to other sources of support. </p>  <p>  Finally, our 8 Regional Action Plans for Jobs are building on the jobs potential of each region.  The Plans bring together the public and private sector interests in each region to deliver upon a suite of actions in support of enterprise. </p>  <p>  To further support this work, my Department launched a new Regional Enterprise Development Fund in May to support collaborative approaches to grow and sustain indigenous enterprise and jobs across the regions.  Funding of up to &euro;60m will be available over a period of four years to 2020.  </p>  <p>  The Fund will support significant collaborative regional initiatives to build on specific industry sectoral strengths and improve enterprise capability, thereby driving job creation.  Competitive Feasibility funding to support the development of high quality regional projects is also available as part of this initiative. </p></reply>

A key objective of each of the plans is to have a further 10 to 15 per cent at work in each region by 2020, with the unemployment rate of each region within one per cent of the national average.  </p>  <p>  Progress to date is good and employment continues to grow strongly.  Encouragingly, the unemployment rate has fallen in all regions in the past year while, during the same period, more than three out of every four new jobs created were outside Dublin.</p>  <p>  In 2016, almost two thirds of new jobs created by Enterprise Ireland supported companies, and over half of those created by IDA supported companies, were outside Dublin. </p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s strategy for 2017-2020 aims to create a further 60,000 jobs, while sustaining existing ones, which will make an important contribution to jobs and economic growth across all regions of Ireland; IDA will continue to target a minimum increase in investment of 30% to 40% in each region outside Dublin to 2019.</p>  <p>  The 31 Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) are the &lsquo;first-stop-shop&rsquo; State support service for micro and small businesses in each local area.  The LEOs are providing advice and direction, covering all government supports and requirements, to anyone who wishes to start or expand a business.  Last year's LEO annual jobs survey results highlighted three consecutive years of local jobs growth throughout the country: in 2016 there was a net increase of 3,679 jobs and total direct employment among LEO client companies stood at 34,634.</p>  <p>  To further support enterprise development across all regions, additional funding of up to &euro;60m is being rolled out by Enterprise Ireland over the next 4 years to support the development and implementation of collaborative and innovative projects that can sustain and add to employment at a national, regional and county level.  This regional competitive fund will support the ambition, goals and implementation of the Regional Action Plans for Jobs.</p>  <p>  In addition, additional funding of &euro;150m is being made available to the IDA to support its Regional Property Programme and drive job creation in the multi-national sector.</p></reply>

Consequently, our Regional Action Plan for Jobs initiative is working to promote regional and rural job creation by bringing different stakeholders in each of the eight regions together to identify innovative and practical actions, to be taken across a range of Departments and agencies, with clear timelines for delivery over the period 2015 &ndash; 2017.  The focus of my Department is on the delivery of the Regional Action Plans as the approrpiate level of policy and operational focus and we do not operate a programme of 'special' development areas or zones. </p>  <p>  The Plans are being monitored and driven in each region by Implementation Committees, comprising representatives from the Enterprise Sector, as well as the Local Authorities, Enterprise Agencies, and other public bodies in the region.  Collaboration between the private and the public sector has been a core element in each plan&rsquo;s development, and will be central to each plan&rsquo;s delivery.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, my Department is working closely and continuously with the Department of  Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government on the development of the new National Planning Framework (NPF).  This engagement, informed by Enterprise 2025, relates to a number of issues including the role of enterprise, the factors that shape the potential of each region, the need to cater to the differing development potential and requirements across regions to optimise potential for growth and the importance of investments in economic infrastructure (and combinations of infrastructures) to support economic development. </p>  <p>  The most recent figures from the CSO also show that over 70% of all jobs created in the past year were created outside Dublin.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-06-29a.160.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017062900067#WRC03600"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 64 and 67 together.</p>  <p>  My Department recognises the key role that innovation has played in Ireland&rsquo;s economic recovery to date.  It contributes significantly to job creation, exports and investment, and the competitiveness of the indigenous enterprise base, and also to embedding the foreign direct investment base in Ireland. </p>  <p>  It is clear that a strong interdependence exists therefore between science, technology and innovation policy and enterprise policy.  My Department has developed its Innovation 2020 strategy for Research and Development, Science and Technology and its Enterprise 2025 policy side by side.  A critical objective for my Department is delivering on the actions and commitments set out in Innovation 2020. </p>  <p>  A report published by my Department in October 2016, Economic and Enterprise Impacts from Public Investment in R&amp;D in Ireland, focuses on the public R&amp;D investments that are aimed at achieving enterprise impacts.  These relate to investments by this Department, through Enterprise Ireland (EI), IDA Ireland, Science Foundation Ireland, and also through the Irish Research Council and the Higher Education Authority. </p>  <p>  This study has shown that investment in R&amp;D translates into improved job creation and enterprise performance.  Among the findings are:</p>  <p>  - Firms that invested in R&amp;D grew employment by 14% between 2000 and 2014 while those that did not invest in R&amp;D saw employment decline by 40% </p>  <p>  - R&amp;D performing companies grew exports by 181% between 2003 and 2014 compared to a loss of 42% in exports for non-R&amp;D performing companies over the same period </p>  <p>  - R&amp;D activity was identified as being one characteristic of Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland client firms that has driven growth in sales and exports since 2003.  During the recession these firms exhibited greater resilience than non-R&amp;D active firms and have increased their contributions to sales, exports and employment </p>  <p>  - For Enterprise Ireland client firms funded through its R&amp;D Fund scheme, there was an 8% growth in net employment (22,003 jobs to 23,739 jobs) between 2002 and 2012.  In comparison there was a 6.2% decline in employment in the total Enterprise Ireland client base over the 2002 to 2012 period (131,144 jobs to 119,935 jobs).</p>  <p>  EI has played a particularly important role in supporting job creation in Ireland.  Between 2014 and 2016 employment in EI backed companies reached 200,000.  In its new strategy 2017 - 2020, Building Scale, Expanding Reach, EI is aiming to increase this further with a new target to create an additional 60,000 new jobs by 2020. </p>  <p>  The Strategy also aims to drive innovation in Irish enterprise to unprecedented levels through new supports to reach the target of &euro;1.25bn in R&amp;D expenditure by its client companies per annum by 2020. </p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland operates a range of supports to help companies engage with third level researchers to undertake collaborative research for the benefit of companies.  Again, evidence shows that R&amp;D active firms who collaborate with the Higher Education sector do significantly better in terms of job creation and exports than those that do not collaborate. </p>  <p>  A further aspect of Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s work is to extract maximum value from Ireland&rsquo;s investment in the research system &ndash; the objective is to secure commercial purpose, leading to jobs and sales by transferring technologies and ideas developed in Irish research institutions out into firms.  Knowledge Transfer Ireland is instrumental in this area.</p>  <p>  Going forward, in order to support companies to increase job creation and exports, EI will continue funding its critical existing programmes along with new supports for Innovation such as:</p>  <p>  -The Business Innovation Initiative (BII) aimed at driving innovation beyond selling products based on technical innovations, providing more customer focussed process and service solutions;</p>  <p>  - The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Initiative which is a cross-government process that allows public bodies to use public procurement to source R&amp;D and innovative solutions to solve identified &lsquo;challenges&rsquo;.  This provides significant business opportunities for innovation focused companies; </p>  <p>  - New initiatives to equip graduates and researchers in the higher education system with the key skills required by the enterprise base.</p>  <p>  As the outcome of the Brexit vote forces Irish companies to employ R&amp;D in a bid to protect their current exports in the UK and to explore different markets, innovation will continue to play a central role in growing exports as well as employment.  To address this and in addition to the new supports listed above, Enterprise Ireland will also:</p>  <p>  - Help companies develop their internal innovation capabilities and capacities through training and assistance with new key Hires and access to Innovation expertise and capabilities at home and abroad. </p>  <p>  - Help companies increase their investment in Innovation (up by 50% by 2020) with the introduction of the new Innovation toolkit which includes:</p>  <p>  - Redevelopment of EI Research, Development &amp;amp; Innovation (RDI) Offer</p>  <p>  - The Health Innovation Hub &ndash; a new support to unlock and focus the Irish Healthcare system&rsquo;s ability to drive healthcare Innovation through access to companies </p>  <p>  - Support to provide Multinational Sub supply and partnering opportunities for SMEs.</p>  <p>  - Increased focus on assisting young Irish disruptive technology companies to access the significant EU H2020 SME instrument.</p>  <p>  - Support to enable Irish companies to access funding support and contracts from H2020 and the European Space Agency respectively.  </p>  <p>  - Extensions of the Campus Incubation facilities (In Athlone, Waterford and Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology) to provide more support for regional start-ups.</p>  <p>  - Access to key talent: Enterprise Ireland will help with finding, hiring, growing and reaching impactful innovation people particularly through the Marie Curie Co-Fund which will enable 50 leading edge international researchers to work for Irish companies and a new offer to better condition new Graduates to work in industry so that they can contribute to companies growth more quickly and effectively. </p>  <p>  IDA Ireland&rsquo;s main objective is to encourage investment into Ireland by foreign-owned companies.  The Agency reported a second, consecutive record year in 2016. 199,877 people are now employed in IDA Ireland supported client companies, up from 188,035 in 2015.  This is the highest level of employment in the Agency&rsquo;s history. </p>  <p>  The area of RDI is of strategic importance to IDA Ireland.  A company decision to invest in RDI may be to support improvement in productivity; to develop a strengthened reputation for quality or to develop new products and services. </p>  <p>  IDA Ireland&rsquo;s strategy Winning FDI 2015-2019 outlines a plan to support clients in creating 80,000 new jobs and increase employment in the client portfolio to 209,000 by 2019.  Support for RDI will be key to achieving these targets.  Research, development and innovation investments not only embed existing FDI operations and employment but pave the way for future investment, job creation and export growth.  As the global battle for FDI intensifies, investment in research and development will become even more critical to attracting and retaining FDI companies. </p>  <p>  The increase in RDI investment since 2000 has improved our attractiveness as an FDI location.  60% (just under &euro;60m in 2015) of IDA&rsquo;s total grant-aid budget is allocated to RDI projects each year.  This investment leverages RDI expenditure of &euro;600m by IDA clients for these approved projects and an overall annual spend by IDA supported companies of &euro;1.53bn per annum on RDI.  This has the effect of anchoring FDI clients and securing sustainable employment and related benefits to the Irish economy. </p>  <p>  The National Support System for Horizon 2020, the EU Framework Programme for research and innovation, is coordinated by Enterprise Ireland.  Horizon 2020 is one of seven flagship initiatives in Europe 2020, the European Union's ten-year jobs and growth strategy.  It has a budget of almost &euro;75 billion and runs over the period 2014-2020.  Horizon 2020 includes a programme tailored specifically to the needs of SMEs, namely the SME Instrument, which has &euro;3 billion in funding available over the period 2014-2020.  The SME Instrument helps high-potential SMEs to develop ground-breaking innovative ideas for products, services or processes that are ready to face global market competition.</p>  <p>  Companies in Ireland (both foreign-owned and Irish-owned) that compete successfully for funding from Horizon 2020 will boost their innovative capability and competitiveness which in turn will deliver strong national economic impacts, including job creation.</p>  <p>  Ireland has won &euro;424 million from 2014 to May 2017 in competitive, EU funding from Horizon 2020.  Higher Education Institutions accounted for &euro;233 million of the total and companies, &euro;151 million.  The funding for companies included &euro;94 million awarded to SMEs.  Ireland has the highest success rate in Europe for the Horizon 2020 SME Instrument with a 16% success rate, compared to a European average of 6%. </p>  <p>  A budget of &euro;30 billion has been allocated to the final three years of Horizon 2020, which will provide significant funding opportunities for companies in Ireland that participate in the programme over the period 2018-2020.</p>  <p>  The recent national ex-post evaluation of the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development (FP7) estimated that the European Commission contribution of &euro;625M to Ireland from 2007 to 2013 would lead to an estimated 2,000 jobs created per year.  It is expected that such figures will grow considerably in the context of Ireland&rsquo;s current target to double participation in the period 2014-2020. </p></reply>

Innovation can lower costs, increase productivity and add value to a company's products or services.  A competitive advantage is necessary for success in global markets, which for a small open economy like Ireland, is necessary for creating sustainable, quality employment.</p>  <p>  Innovation 2020, the national strategy for Research and Innovation, which was launched in December 2015, sets out the Government's ambition for Ireland to become a global innovation leader.  International cooperation is an integral part of that strategy.  International cooperation maximises the impact of international and national investment in research and innovation.  It contributes to the development of Ireland as a research and enterprise partner, underscoring and enhancing the excellence of our research and innovation system and facilitating engagement with the Irish diaspora.  A key plank of our engagement in international cooperation is participation of our researchers and enterprise in the EU Framework Programmes for Research and Innovation.</p>  <p>  Horizon 2020 is the current Framework Programme for Research and Innovation.  It is one of seven flagship initiatives in Europe 2020, the European Union&rsquo;s ten-year jobs and growth strategy.  H2020 has a budget of &euro;75 billion and runs from 2014 to 2020.  H2020 funding (grant aid) is awarded on a competitive basis to researchers and companies across three main pillars: Excellent Science; Leadership in Industrial Technologies; and Societal Challenges. </p>  <p>  Ireland has won &euro;424 million from 2014 to May 2017 in competitive, EU funding from Horizon 2020.  Higher Education Institutions accounted for &euro;233 million of the total and companies, &euro;151 million.  The funding for companies included &euro;94 million awarded to SMEs.</p>  <p>  A dedicated SME Instrument within Horizon 2020 has a budget of &euro;3 billion to support high-potential SMEs to develop ground-breaking innovative ideas for products, services or processes that are ready to face global market competition.  Irish SMEs have recorded the highest success rate in the SME Instrument at 16%, compared with an EU average of 6%.</p>  <p>  My department chairs the Horizon 2020 High Level Group, a cross-Government committee tasked with coordinating Ireland's participation in Horizon 2020.  In addition, Enterprise Ireland leads a National Support System that assists researchers and companies to participate in the programme.</p>  <p>  In the autumn the European Commission will launch the Horizon 2020 work programme for 2018-2020.  This will have a total budget of &euro;30 billion and will provide significant funding opportunities for companies in Ireland.  The National Support System is actively preparing for that programme in order to maximize the participation by researchers and companies.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-06-29a.166.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017062900067#WRC04200"><p>Addressing Ireland&rsquo;s cost competitiveness remains a key economic priority for Government, therefore we continue to monitor Ireland's cost competitiveness on a regular basis. </p>  <p>  The National Competiveness Council publishes the Costs of Doing Business in Ireland every year.  In its Report of June 2017, the National Competitiveness Council found that Ireland&rsquo;s cost base has improved across a range of metrics over the last five years (e.g. the cost of starting a business, communications costs and average income taxes).  This has made Irish firms more competitive internationally and made Ireland a more attractive location for firms to base their operations in.  However, despite these improvements Ireland remains a relatively high cost location and already the return to sustained levels of growth has resulted in upward pressures in property, labour and business service costs.  </p>  <p>  Ireland is particularly vulnerable to negative economic shocks which are outside the influence of domestic policymakers.  A number of short and medium term downside risks have already emerged that could undermine national competitiveness.  Over the past 12 months, we have seen the challenges created for Irish firms exporting to the UK as a result of Brexit, resulting from the weakness of sterling on international currency markets.  The international price of oil has almost doubled over the past 12 months and the low international energy prices, which to date have countered increases in other domestic costs, is now dissipating.  To pre-empt such threats we must improve our cost competitiveness.  In this regard, costs are paramount: a competitive cost base helps to create a virtuous circle between inflation, wage expectations and cost competitiveness.</p>  <p>  Government is committed to take action to address unnecessarily high costs (i.e. cost and price levels not justified by productivity) wherever they arise.  A range of initiatives, as set out in the Action Plan for Jobs, are in train across Government Departments to improve the ease of doing business, reduce the administrative burden, enhance our cost competitiveness and increase productivity and drive greater efficiencies across the enterprise base.  The issue of rising cost residential property will be addressed through a suite of measures in Rebuilding Ireland - Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness.  The Cost of Motor Insurance Action Plan provides measures to help reduce the cost of insurance cost. </p>  <p>  The National Competitiveness Council and my Department and its agencies are continually engaged with relevant stakeholders on the particular policy needs required to support cost competitiveness.  The stakeholders include other Government Departments, regulatory bodies and public and private bodies.  In this regard, there is a role for both the public and private sectors alike to proactively manage the controllable portion of their respective cost bases, drive efficiency and continue to take action to address unnecessarily high costs.  Such actions will ensure that improvements in relative cost competitiveness are more sustainable, leaving Ireland better positioned to cope with external shocks. </p>  <p>  As part of these engagements, my Department, the Department of Finance, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Enterprise Ireland and the SBCI are working on developing of Brexit Working Capital Guarantee Scheme and to scope out the need for a longer term Business Development Loan Scheme which would assist Irish firms in investing for a post-Brexit environment and increase their competitiveness.  Development of these proposed responses is at an early stage, and is subject to resources being agreed as part of the annual budget process, and with due regards to State aid rules.</p></reply>

Recent EGFSN reports have anticipated future job opportunities arising from both expansion and replacement demand for a range of occupational roles, including in biopharma, ICT, data analytics, hospitality, manufacturing, medical devices, pharmaceuticals, food and beverages, international sales and marketing, project management, freight transport, distribution and logistics.</p><p>The EGFSN also provides information on employment trends, job opportunities and demand for skills through the annual &ldquo;<i>National Skills Bulletin&rdquo; </i>and the &ldquo;<i>Vacancy Overview&rdquo; </i>reports.  It also provides information on the supply of skills from the Irish education system through the &ldquo;<i>Monitoring Ireland&rsquo;s Skills Supply&rdquo; </i>publication.  The EGFSN also publishes reports on specific sectoral, or cross-sectoral skills needs, as well as &ldquo;<i>Regional Labour Markets Bulletins&rdquo;</i>which assist in informing regional education and training provision.</p><p>The development of ICT skills is one example which this Department has examined and worked closely with the Department of Education and Skills to deliver on.  ICT skillsets are important in both the manufacturing and services sectors.  The 2013 EGFSN report on &ldquo;<i>Addressing Future Demand for High-Level ICT Skills&rdquo; </i>indicated that the continuing strong demand from employers for people with high-level ICT skills across the economy could lead to 44,500 new job openings arising from expansion and replacement demand over the period to 2018.  To achieve this jobs potential, the report noted that all available policy levers would need to be utilised to increase high-level ICT skills supply. </p><p>In this context, the Government has initiated an ICT Action Plan, now in its second iteration, which provides an integrated response within the education system to increasing the domestic supply of high level ICT skills.  The aim of the Plan is to support the flow of people into ICT education, training and careers.  Overall implementation of the Plan is driven by a High Level Steering Group which my Department co-chairs with the Department of Education and Skills.</p><p>The skills needs in other areas of the economy are being addressed through the Further and Higher education system, through Springboard+ courses which help to upskill or re-skill unemployed people, and through the enterprise-led Training Networks Programme run by Skillnets.  This year, Skillnets will deliver over 43,000 training places for those in employment, in a range of sectors and regions across over 63 training networks who will identify training needs and source provision to ensure it is aligned to the needs of workers and enterprise.</p><p>In the Higher Education Sector, the primary objective of Springboard+ in 2017 is to provide upskilling and reskilling courses to develop the talent base in Ireland in key growth sectors of the economy including ICT; hospitality; biopharma, medical device technologies and manufacturing; financial services; and entrepreneurship.  This year the eligibility criteria has been expanded to include homemakers and those in employment who wish to upskill or reskill in specific high demand skills areas such as in Biopharma. </p><p>The Governments Action Plan for Education 2016 &ndash; 2019 provides a key statement on the reform agenda across the education and training system.  The Plan contains a range of actions to be implemented with particular focus on disadvantage, skills needs, and continuous improvement within the education service. </p><p>The Governments National Skills Strategy 2025 has over 120 Actions involving over 50 stakeholders.  The purpose of the Strategy is to provide a framework for skills development that will help drive Ireland&rsquo;s growth both economically and societally over the next decade</p><p>Within the Further Education and Training (FET) sector, significant improvements have been made in the planning and funding of provision since the publication of the FET Strategy in 2014.  Education and Training Boards engage in a service planning process annually against a range of detailed parameters set by SOLAS.  This process has been refined and improved each year and includes the use of strengthened labour market data provided by the SLMRU to ensure that the skill needs of learners and enterprise are met. </p><p>In 2015, the Minister for Education and Skills announced the development of 25 new Apprenticeships which cover a wide range of sectors such as manufacturing and engineering, tourism and sport, financial services, information technology, transport distribution and logistics, and business administration and management.</p><p>Earlier this year, the Government launched an Action Plan to expand Apprenticeship and Traineeship in Ireland 2016-2020 was launched, setting out how state agencies, education and training providers and employers will work together to deliver on the Programme for Government commitments on the expansion of apprenticeship and traineeship in the period to 2020.  The Plan sets out how the pipeline of new apprenticeships already established through the first call for proposals in 2015 will be managed to provide for the needs of all sectors.</p><p>In May 2017, the Apprenticeship Council's announced the second call to employers for proposals for new apprenticeship programmes, where areas where apprenticeships have not traditionally existed will be targeted, so as to offer robust new career pathways and options to at least 20% of school leavers.  The call is a key action in the plan to double the number of annual apprenticeship and traineeship registrations in 120 different schemes so that by 2020, 50,000 people will be registered on apprenticeship and traineeship programmes.</p><p>In April 2017 the National Skills Council and nine Regional Skills Fora were established - both of which are key elements of the new skills architecture as set out in the National Skills Strategy 2025.  Working together with Government Departments and agencies along with education and training providers, the work of the Council and fora, will ensure that we can anticipate and respond to current, future and rapidly changing skills needs across all sectors of the economy.</p><p>The Council had its first meeting on the 15th May 2017.  The Council will oversee research and advise on prioritisation and delivery of identified skills needs.  Skills information from the EGFSN, the SLMRU and the Regional Skills Fora will feed into the work of the Council. </p><p>Co-operation between employers and the education and training system has proven to be crucial in developing effective responses to skills needs, and this co-operation is being strengthened through the Further and Higher education and training systems, including via the new Regional Skills Fora put in place by the Department of Education and Skills to connect employers, enterprise development agencies and education and training providers. </p><p>The Governments Action Plan for Jobs has proven to be an effective mechanism for coordinated cross government action focused on job creation and on creating an environment that is conducive to entrepreneurship, investment and enterprise growth.  The existing process will continue to ensure the required focus on the achievement of sustainable full employment on an annual basis in the context of considerable international uncertainty.</p><p>The ambition in Enterprise 2025 is to achieve sustainable full employment by 2020.  The required actions to achieve sustainable full employment were set out in Enterprise 2025, in terms of building the resilience of the enterprise base through productivity, innovation and market diversification.  These are to be delivered by DJEI and the enterprise development agencies and also by a number of government departments that have a role to play in ensuring we have a supportive and internationally differentiated business environment.</p><p>The delivery of the right skills and talent is essential for the in terms of building up the enterprise base and the Department of Enterprise and Innovation will continue to work closely with the Department of Education and Skills to ensure a supply of the right skills which will support continued job creation and productivity growth.  Enterprise also has an important role to play investing in the skills development of its workforce aligned to their strategic business plan.</p></reply>

The scheme should serve to significantly boost innovation and investment in research and development in Ireland and to generate economic benefit and jobs.</p>  <p>  The KDB complements the existing suite of initiatives and supports available to companies that undertake R&amp;D activities in Ireland across the lifecycle of research and development - including R&amp;D tax credits, RD&amp;I grant supports, support for technology acquisition (S291A), significant state investments in National Research Centres and knowledge transfer infrastructures, and advisory supports for accessing Horizon 2020 funding - providing a competitive proposition for business investment. </p></reply>

This is the nineteenth quarter in succession where unemployment has declined on an annual basis.  Employment is up in the industry sector, as well as in key services sectors such as transportation, construction, wholesale/retail, professional/scientific/technical activities, and tourism-related services.  All of this demonstrates a resilience in manufacturing and services sectors despite uncertainties arising from Brexit and other developments. </p>  <p>  Every effort will continue to be made by my Department and Agencies to maximize employment across all sectors and regions.  My Department, through Enterprise Ireland (EI) provides a range of supports to help Irish manufacturing and services companies start, grow and export.  There are now over 201,000 people employed by EI supported companies across the country, an all-time high for the Agency.  IDA Ireland reported a second consecutive record year in 2016.  199,877 people are now employed in IDA Ireland supported manufacturing and services companies, up from 188,035 in 2015.</p>  <p>  Regarding opportunities arising from Brexit, my responsibility, as Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, is to ensure that Ireland as a whole is best placed to capitalise on potential foreign direct investment opportunities that may emerge on account of Brexit.  We will continue to focus on assisting Irish owned companies to build capabilities and to enter new geographic markets with innovative products and services.  That is why I secured significant additional funding for both agencies, to help  better respond to the challenges and opportunities Brexit may present.</p></reply>

Our Regional Action Plan for Jobs initiative is working to promote regional and rural job creation by bringing different stakeholders in each of the eight regions together to identify innovative and practical actions, to be taken across a range of Departments and agencies, with clear timelines for delivery over the period 2015 &ndash; 2017.</p>  <p>  The Plans are driven in each region by Implementation Committees, comprising representatives from the Enterprise Sector, as well as the Local Authorities, Enterprise Agencies, and other public bodies in the region.  Collaboration between the private and the public sector has been a core element in each plan&rsquo;s development, and will be central to each plan&rsquo;s delivery.</p>  <p>  The most recent figures from the CSO also show that 70% of all jobs created in the past year were created outside Dublin.  The ambition set out in Enterprise 2025, launched as recently as November 2015, is to ensure that unemployment in the regions is within 1% of the State average.  Considerable progress is being made, and as of the first quarter of this year five of the seven regions outside of Dublin have met that objective - with the Border region marginally outside of our ambition at 1.1%  greater than the State average.</p>  <p>  In addition, my Department is working closely with the Department of  Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government on the development of the new National Planning Framework (NPF).  This engagement, informed by Enterprise 2025, relates to a number of issues including the role of enterprise, the factors that shape the potential of each region, the need to cater to the differing development potential and requirements across regions to optimise potential for growth and the importance of investments in economic infrastructure (and combinations of infrastructures) to support economic development.</p>  <p>  Access to finance is the life-blood of any business, and we continue to support new start-ups and our SMEs' efforts to deepen market penetration, diversify to new markets, invest in RD&amp;I and in plant, machinery and technologies.  My Department continues to engage with enterprise and to work  with the Department of Finance and SBCI to identify and address the specific needs of business - particularly as they face greater challenges in light of Brexit.</p></reply>

The only change would be to the ratio itself, from the dominator effect, arising from a change to GDP as part of a sensitivity analysis.</p></reply>

The credit provides a significant benefit to small business-owners right across the country including small retailers, publicans, farmers and tradesmen.  It is estimated that approximately 147,500 income earners would currently be in a position to benefit from the credit.</p>  <p>  As part of the Budget 2017 expenditure package, improvements to the social welfare benefits available to the self-employed were announced.  These include extending access to the invalidity pension and to treatment benefits, and allowing earlier access to the Back to Work Enterprise Allowance.</p>  <p>  With regard to Capital Gains Tax, a revised entrepreneur relief which applied a 20% rate of CGT to disposals of qualifying assets up to a limit of &euro;1 million in chargeable gains was introduced in Budget 2016.  Budget 2017 further reduced the applicable rate to 10%.</p>  <p>  It was also announced in Budget 2017 that work has commenced on the development of a new, SME-focussed, share-based incentive scheme to be introduced later this year in Budget 2018.  Employee participation in their company&rsquo;s ownership and profits has been shown to increase competitiveness and support employment growth.  The new incentive will support Irish SMEs when competing with larger companies to attract and retain key staff.</p></reply>

This assessment must include a consideration of the specific needs of more vulnerable consumers and those especially affected by the change.  Firms must also ensure that all customers are fully informed in a timely way of the proposed changes and be assisted, as appropriate and reasonable, to adopt the changes or to switch providers.</p><p>Due to statutory confidentiality requirements, the Central Bank may not publicly disclose much of its supervisory engagement with individual firms and therefore I am not in a position to provide details of the engagements with notifying banks.  That said, individual banks have made a number of public announcements regarding planned closures.</p></reply>

These Regulations apply to any term in a contract concluded between a seller of goods or supplier of services and a consumer which has not been individually negotiated. </p>  <p>  The legislation is designed to protect consumers against unfair terms in particular when they enter into standard form contracts with traders and regulated financial services providers.  Contractual terms may be considered unfair where they cause a significant imbalance in the parties rights and obligations to the detriment of the consumer.  In that context, it could be noted that Schedule 3 of the Regulations sets out an indicative and non-exhaustive list of terms that may be regarded as &ldquo;unfair&rdquo;.  Some examples of contractual terms that may be considered unfair include:</p>  <p>  - terms unreasonably limiting the liability of the trader or regulated financial services provider to the consumer;</p>  <p>  - terms unreasonably restricting the rights of the consumer;</p>  <p>  - terms unreasonably allowing the trader or regulated financial services provider to terminate or alter the contract or alter the product/services to be provided under the contract without recourse to the consumer; and</p>  <p>  - terms which are not expressed in plain, intelligible language.</p>  <p>  The legislation provides the Central Bank with powers to protect consumers from unfair contract terms where they relate to regulated financial services providers such as banks, insurance companies and retail intermediaries.  Under the legislation, certain supervisory powers are available to the Central Bank to ensure compliance with the legislation by regulated financial services providers.  These powers mean that the Central Bank may require amendments to consumer contracts.  In certain circumstances, the Central Bank may seek a court order preventing the use of contract terms that are considered to be unfair or use other regulatory tools, including the Administrative Sanctions Procedure, to combat the use of unfair contract terms in consumer contracts.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank Consumer Protection Code 2012 (the Code) will also be relevant.  The Code provides that a regulated entity must ensure that in all its dealings with customers and, within the context of its authorisation, it acts honestly, fairly and professionally in the best interests of its customers and the integrity of the market.  In particular, provision 3.8 of the Code provides that a regulated entity must not, in any communication or agreement with a consumer (except where permitted by applicable legislation), exclude or restrict, or seek to exclude or restrict:</p>  <p>  - any legal liability or duty of care to a consumer which it has under applicable law or under the Code;</p>  <p>  - any other duty to act with skill, care and diligence which is owed to a consumer in connection with the provision to that consumer of financial services;</p>  <p>  - any liability owed to a consumer for failure to exercise the degree of skill, care and diligence that may reasonably be expected of it in the provision of a financial service.</p>  <p>  Chapter 10 of the Code also sets out the framework to deal with any complaint a consumer may have with a regulated entity. </p>  <p>  The Central Bank has advised that it is difficult to comment further on the above mentioned clause based on the limited information provided.  However, the Bank has indicated that should the Deputy provide them with additional information they will consider the matter further.</p></reply>

At the time, the Government had a limited role in the banking system. However, by the introduction of the second Finance Bill in 2013, this measure was considered to have outlasted its initial purpose.  As the State then had substantial holdings in the banking sector, constituting 99.8% of AIB shares and 15% of Bank of Ireland shares, Section 396C TCA 1997 was deemed to be acting against the State&rsquo;s interests. </p>  <p>  Section 396C TCA 1997 was repealed to:</p>  <p>  1. Reduce the State&rsquo;s role as a &lsquo;backstop&rsquo; provider of capital; and</p>  <p>  2. Improve the value of the State&rsquo;s equity and debt investments. </p>  <p>  It is important to highlight that the provision to allow the carry-forward of tax losses for set-off against future trading profits is available not only for banks but for all Irish corporates.  Accordingly, the removal of Section 396C TCA 1997 put the covered banks in the same position as other corporates including other banks operating in Ireland.</p>  <p>  I would further note that the net impact on tax receipts is a timing measure largely and should not impact on the State&rsquo;s total Corporation Tax take over time.</p>  <p>  However to recognise the part that the banks played in the financial crisis, in 2013, the Government also decided that the banking sector should make an annual contribution of approximately &euro;150 million to the Exchequer for the period from 2014 to 2016.  In Budget 2016, the payment of this levy was extended until 2021.  The bank levy is expected to raise &euro;750 million over five years.</p></reply>

Stage 2 is the Claims Stage, wherein applicants that decide to proceed with purchasing or building a qualifying property must provide documentary evidence of the relevant property transaction or their mortgage draw down.</p><p>As of Friday 16 June 2017, Revenue has received 7,275 Applications for the HTB scheme, of which 4,691 have been approved.  The published statistics at 16 June 2017 also show that 2,252 claims have been made, of which 1,679 have been approved.  The total estimated cost to the Exchequer of these verified claims is &euro;24.5 million, of which &euro;11.4 million represents retrospective claims (home purchases and self-builds in the period 19 July to 31 December 2016).  The average value of claims is &euro;14,592.  </p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, during the Committee Stage debate on Finance Bill 2016, I agreed to commission an independent impact assessment on the effects of the Help to Buy incentive for completion prior to Budget 2018.

The State also granted an additional over-allotment option over a further 3.75% of AIB's ordinary share capital as part of this transaction.

This is standard market practice in an IPO.  I would therefore expect no further sale of AIB shares in 2017.  After this period, I and officials in my Department will continue to monitor the performance of the bank, its prospects, its share price and equity markets more broadly to determine the best route to retrieve the optimal return of value for the Irish taxpayer.  Under the Programme for a Partnership Government any future sale of AIB shares contemplated before the end 2018 would need to be approved by the Government.</p>  <p>  Similarly, I and my officials continue to monitor the performance of Permanent TSB and Bank of Ireland and plan for exit opportunities, however I have no immediate plans to sell any of the State's shares in these banks either at this time.</p></reply>

Ireland was one of 76 countries that participated in the signing ceremony in Paris with 67 of those countries signing the MLI.</p>  <p>  The purpose of the MLI is to enable existing tax treaties to be modified in order to implement the tax treaty-related measures that were agreed as part of the OECD Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project.  The measures comprise minimum standards, to which all countries participating in the BEPS project committed, as well as optional best practices.  At the signing ceremony in June, Ireland indicated its provisional approach to the options provided for in the MLI.  My Department published a summary of this provisional approach which is available on the Department of Finance website.  The full detail of Ireland's provisional approach has been published by the OECD, along with the provisional approach of each signatory country.  Ireland will have to confirm its final binding approach to the options in the MLI when it is ratified in Irish law.  It is intended that the first steps to ratify the Instrument would be taken as soon as possible with a view to completing the ratification process during 2018.</p>  <p>  Ireland has 72 tax treaties in effect and the MLI will enable the majority of these treaties to be updated to ensure that they are compliant with the BEPS recommendations, without the need for separate bilateral negotiations for each treaty concerned.  However, no treaty will be changed until both Ireland and the relevant treaty partner have each fully ratified the MLI under domestic law.  Also, a provision of a treaty cannot be changed unless both treaty partners agree to the amendment by making matching MLI choices in relation to the provision.  Because of this, the potential implications will vary from treaty to treaty.  However, the principal MLI changes include:</p>  <p>  - introducing general anti-avoidance clauses into tax treaties;</p>  <p>  - preventing differences in countries&rsquo; tax laws being exploited by hybrid mismatch arrangements;</p>  <p>  - new rules on how much presence a company must have in a country to create a taxable presence there; and</p>  <p>  - allowing a taxpayer to seek mandatory binding arbitration if the two countries that are parties to a treaty cannot agree on how the treaty should be applied in the taxpayer&rsquo;s particular case.  </p>  <p>  Some 50 of Ireland&rsquo;s treaty partners signed the MLI on June 7 in Paris.  Approximately 10 treaty partners are not yet members of the group that developed the MLI.  Also, a small number of Ireland&rsquo;s treaty partners have expressed a preference to implement the anti-BEPS minimum standards by way of bilateral protocol, instead of through the MLI.  I am informed by Revenue that negotiations are ongoing with two OECD countries that are co-signatories of the MLI, to agree protocols to implement MLI measures for existing treaties, and that this number will rise if other treaty partners&rsquo; domestic ratification procedures require the agreement of a protocol.</p>  <p>  Tax treaties are bilateral agreements which are negotiated between individual countries rather than being negotiated at OECD or EU level.  Renegotiations of existing treaties with three OECD countries are underway.  These general renegotiations may result in the implementation of anti-BEPS measures bilaterally, instead of through the MLI.</p>  <p>  With regard to the extension of Ireland&rsquo;s tax treaty network, a first round of negotiations has been held in 2017 with one European country and efforts to initiate negotiations with other countries are ongoing.  Two other negotiations with non-European or OECD countries are at a very advanced stage.  Additionally, Government approval has previously been granted to sign three additional new treaties which have not yet been signed.  Finally, a new treaty with Kazakhstan was signed on 26 April 2017 but has not yet been ratified by the Oireachtas.</p>  <p>  The basis for Ireland&rsquo;s treaty negotiations is the Irish model treaty, which is based on the OECD model treaty but also includes provisions of particular relevance to Ireland&rsquo;s interests.  This Irish model is updated as necessary.  The general approach to treaty negotiations is to work in a spirit of cooperation to build a treaty that is fair, workable in practice, and beneficial to both sides.  Treaty negotiations are confidential and this limits the scope for the engagement of outside groups in the process.  Notwithstanding this general limitation on engagement with outside groups, the publication of a new US Model Treaty enabled my Department to undertake a consultation process in 2016 in advance of the ongoing renegotiation of Ireland&rsquo;s tax treaty with the United States.</p></reply>

In that response I explained that NAMA is required, under Section 10 of the NAMA Act 2009, to obtain the best financial return from its acquired loans.  I also explained in my previous response that, among the measures adopted to achieve this statutory objective, NAMA enters into arrangements with some co-operative debtors which involve measures to motivate debtors to maximise the return to NAMA from the workout of the assets controlled by these debtors.  NAMA must operate as a commercial entity and I am advised that, in the absence of arrangements with debtors, the return achieved on the assets securing NAMA loans would fall short of the best achievable financial return required under Section 10.</p>  <p>  I am advised by NAMA that, in return for concessions which improve NAMA&rsquo;s return, arrangements agreed with debtors include compromises of personal guarantees, debt compromise, potential profit share arrangements and debt restructuring.  The details of such arrangements vary according to the particular circumstances of each debtor connection and no two arrangements are the same.  The Deputy will be aware that NAMA is prohibited under sections 99 and 202 of the NAMA Act from disclosing confidential debtor information, including information on debtor arrangements which could identify particular debtors.  I am advised that concessions are conditional on the achievement of agreed milestones and on meeting stretch targets.  In such cases, the debtor may share a small proportion of surplus proceeds.  Such arrangements are particularly appropriate and necessary where facilities are non-recourse or where there is limited recourse.</p>  <p>  Under arrangements agreed with debtors, the concessions granted to NAMA by debtors include charges over unencumbered assets, improvement in NAMA&rsquo;s legal priority over charged assets, the perfection of legal security deficiencies by the debtor, cooperation with professional practitioners and the completion of development projects aimed at enhancing debt recovery.  It is a matter of public record that, as part of the loan acquisition process, NAMA encountered difficulties with some of the legal documentation received from the participating institutions, including items of security not actually taken, guarantees not confirmed on the granting of new facilities and development loans with no security over work-in-progress or step-in rights.  Other issues included defective land registry dealings and missing original documents (such as title).  In many cases, the co-operation of debtors was required to ensure remediation of these issues.</p>  <p>  I am advised by NAMA that such arrangements have been agreed with 34 debtor connections to date.  It should be remembered that NAMA acquired the loans of almost 800 debtor connections and 5,000 borrowing entities from the participating institutions.  I am further advised that NAMA remains in ongoing negotiation with at least 20 other debtor connections in relation to prospective arrangements, debtor concessions and the requisite cooperation which would enable NAMA to maximise debt recovery.  It is not certain that agreement will be reached in all of these negotiations.</p>  <p>  The fundamental principle underlying any arrangement is that NAMA&rsquo;s return under the arrangement exceeds the return that would apply in the absence of the arrangement.  I am advised that the adoption of agreed arrangements with debtors has been an important mechanism to enable NAMA to ensure ongoing debtor co-operation in cases where otherwise debtors would refuse to cooperate and would opt instead for an insolvency process which would ultimately yield a lower net return to NAMA, particularly when enforcement costs are taken into account.  NAMA advise that many debtors would not have maintained their co-operation unless they had clarity as to the long-term benefit to them of that co-operation.</p>  <p>  I am advised by NAMA that the information sought by the Deputy in relation to the number and value of incentives is confidential and that disclosure of this information would compromise NAMA&rsquo;s negotiating position and thereby place it at a commercial disadvantage in its ongoing negotiations with debtors.  This would ultimately be to the detriment of the financial return that NAMA could generate from the acquired loan portfolio.  Under Section 202 (1) (d) of the NAMA Act 2009, &lsquo;confidential information&rsquo; is defined as including &lsquo;information the disclosure of which would tend to place NAMA, a NAMA group entity or the NTMA at a commercial disadvantage&rsquo;. </p></reply>

The subsequent report is published on the Department of Finance website.  The assessment found a comprehensive range of available restructuring solutions being offered and delivered by both bank and non-bank entities and noted considerable progress in addressing mortgage arrears since the peak.  The Central Bank noted further that  there is strong evidence that both banks and non-banks look to exhaust available restructure options before moving to the legal process.  In addition, the Central Bank considered the range of restructures offered by banks to be broadly appropriate in balancing consumer protection imperatives, and maintaining a mortgage market for all borrowers, and a functioning banking system. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2015 has been enacted to fill the consumer protection gap where loans were sold by the original lender to an unregulated firm.  This legislation ensures that relevant borrowers, whose loans are sold to third parties, maintain the same regulatory protections they had prior to the sale.  </p>  <p>  Latest Central Bank Residential Mortgage Arrears Data for Q1-2017 indicates that mortgages in arrears for more than 720 days continued to decline for the seventh consecutive quarter and there has been a decline of 7.9 per cent in this maturity cohort in the past year.  Central Bank data also shows a decline in short-term  restructure arrangements and increases in longer-term arrangements such as split mortgages.    </p>  <p>  This indicates that where borrowers actively engage with their lender under the CCMA, it is more likely that an equitable arrangement will be found and that the borrower will be able to remain in their family home. </p></reply>

In addition, the Department of Finance expects that the Central Bank, as regulator of credit servicing firms, will be vigilant in this area and raise any specific instances where they have found consumers have not had their protections upheld or that their positions have been disadvantaged. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-06-29a.269.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017062900069#WRE03100"><p>The two key pillars of the Preventive Arm of the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) are the Balanced Budget Rule, which uses the structural balance and the expenditure benchmark.  A deviation in excess of 0.5 per cent of GDP from either or both of the rules may lead to a warning of a significant deviation from the European Commission following an overall assessment that takes all relevant factors into account.  If a warning of a significant deviation is made to Ireland by the European Commission, then the Government has two months to prepare a corrective action plan and present it to the D&aacute;il.  It would only be in the event that Ireland takes no effective action to correct the significant deviation in line with Council recommendations that the issue of sanctions arise in the form of an interest bearing deposit of up to 0.2 per cent of GDP.  Importantly, a warning of a significant deviation requires it to be an observed outcome, i.e. it must be ex-post.  This means that any warning in relation to 2017 or 2016 and 2017 taken together could only be made following the assessment of the 2018 Stability Update Programme that will be submitted at the end of April 2018.</p>  <p>  The European Commission's Spring Economic Forecasts project a structural balance improvement of 0.6 per cent of GDP in 2017, which is the required level of improvement.  Taking 2016 and 2017 together, the Commission forecasts a risk of some deviation but well below the level of a significant deviation.  My Department forecasts a structural improvement of 0.3 per cent in 2017, which does not constitute a significant deviation.  Importantly, my Department estimates that Ireland remains on track to achieve our medium-term objective (MTO) of a structural deficit of 0.5 per cent of GDP in 2018.  Achievement of the MTO represents an important milestone in ensuring the sustainability of the public finances.</p>  <p>  With regard to the expenditure benchmark, my Department estimated that there would be a deviation in 2017 at Budget time last October due to the increase in the EU Budget contribution.  Based on the forecasts in the SPU, this projected deviation has increased to c.&euro;450 million (0.16 per cent of GDP) for a number of reasons.  The key one is that the expenditure outturn for 2017 came in lower than projected in Budget 2017.  Taking 2016 and 2017 together, my Department is forecasting a small deviation (c.0.1 per cent of GDP).</p>  <p>  On the other hand, the European Commission is forecasting a risk of a significant deviation under the expenditure benchmark taking 2016 and 2017 together.  The background to this is that the commission is retrospectively applying an amendment to assessment of compliance that was agreed in late 2016.  This new methodology will take one-offs into account in the assessment process.  Retrospective application removes the AIB share transaction in 2015 from the assessment, thus changing the 2016 assessment from a positive deviation to a negative deviation, albeit not a significant one.</p>  <p>  In my view, this methodological change cannot be retrospectively applied and should not affect the 2016/2017 average compliance.  The Commission have admitted that there may be legal uncertainty with the approach taken in its assessment methodology and my officials continue to engage bilaterally with the Commission on this issue.</p></reply>

They came into operation for regulated lenders (other than credit unions) on 1 July 2016 and, in the case of credit unions, on 1 January 2017. </p>  <p>  The aim of the Code and these Regulations is to facilitate access to credit, promote fairness and transparency, and provide a framework for dealing with financially difficult cases.  These revised SME Regulations introduce specific requirements for regulated lenders, including:</p>  <p>  - greater transparency for borrowers around the application process;</p>  <p>  - contacting SME borrowers who have been in arrears for 15 working days;</p>  <p>  - reasons for decline that are specific to an SME borrower&rsquo;s application;</p>  <p>  - greater protections for guarantors;</p>  <p>  - a warning for SME borrowers who are in danger of being classified as not co-operating;</p>  <p>  - expanded grounds for appeal.</p>  <p>  Under these SME Regulations, regulated financial services firms must also have a complaints handling procedure in place.  </p>  <p>  The Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 (Section 48) (Lending to Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises) Regulations 2015 addresses the procedures for dealing with arrears, sets out policy for financial difficulties, provision of standard information for borrowers in financial difficulties and how to communicate with borrowers in financial difficulties for micro and small enterprises in Part 2 and for Medium enterprises in Part 3 of the SME Regulations.  The full SME Regulations can be found on the Central Bank website.</p>  <p>  The Government also remains committed to the SME sector, as reflected in the Programme for a Partnership Government, and sees it as a key engine of ongoing economic growth.  Consequently, my Department and the Credit Review Office, working with the other relevant Departments and Agencies, will continue to monitor the availability of both bank and non-bank credit on both a macro and sectoral basis in order to ensure that sufficient access to finance is available to facilitate participants in the SME sector to reach their full potential in terms of growth and employment generation.  In this context, the Action Plan for Jobs 2017 includes a dedicated chapter and associated integrated set of actions to support the financing for growth in the SME sector.</p></reply>

Following the decision to commit &euro;2.2 billion of this amount in support of the Government's Action Plan on Housing and Homelessness, and other public capital commitments made in Estimates  2017, there is approximately &euro;2.6bn in uncommitted additional capital funding over the period 2018 to 2021 which will be allocated following the completion of the review of the Capital Plan.</p>  <p>  As part of the capital review submissions were received from Departments and a public consultation has also taken place.  Analysis being carried out as part of the review includes an infrastructure capacity and demand analysis which will help inform decisions by Government in the context of Budget 2018 on the required levels of investment for the provision of critical infrastructure across the different sectors of the economy.</p>  <p>  I expect that the approach I have set out in relation to the review of the Capital Plan will help ensure that our national public infrastructure is maintained and enhanced over the remaining period of the Capital Plan to 2021, and beyond. </p>  <p>  As set out in the Estimates 2017, it is projected that Exchequer capital expenditure will increase by almost 75% between 2016 and 2021.  The Government is therefore ensuring that our continued strong economic performance is reflected in increased capital expenditure over the coming period.</p></reply>

The National Skills Council oversees research from a number of sources including, the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs the Skills and Labour Market Research Unit in SOLAS and the Regional Skills Fora.</p>  <p>  The Apprenticeship Council continues to develop a wide range of new apprenticeships to meet skills needs in the economy.  The Insurance Practitioner Apprenticeship, the first of the new programmes developed through the Apprenticeship Council&rsquo;s first call for proposals, launched in September 2016 and an Industrial Engineer Apprenticeship commenced in November 2016.  13 further new apprenticeships are due to launch later this year in various sectors.  Additional programmes have been also put in place to address specific skills needs across a number of sectors, through the Springboard+ programme and the ICT skills initiatives.</p></reply>

Building on this commitment, the Action Plan for Education states that we will enrol 50,000 people on apprenticeship and traineeship programmes in the period to 2020.  This represents a near doubling of current activity.  </p>  <p>  In January this year, I published the Action Plan to Expand Apprenticeship and Traineeship 2016-2020 which sets out a series of detailed actions and annual targets on how the commitments set out in both the Programme for Government and the Action Plan for Education will be met.  The plan sets out a clear 10 step critical path for the development of an apprenticeship and also sets an overall timeline of 12-15 months.  My Department, its agencies and the Apprenticeship Council are working in close collaboration with the combined aim of delivering these targets.  </p>  <p>A second call for proposals, a key action in the plan, opened on the 4 May with a deadline of 1 September for submission of proposals to develop new apprenticeships.  </p>  <p>  As the deputy is aware, the Apprenticeship Council is currently overseeing the expansion of the apprenticeship system into a range of new sectors of the economy.  Following its first call for proposals in 2015, the Apprenticeship Council has been working closely with consortia to develop their proposals into sustainable apprenticeships.  Last year we saw the first of these new programmes with the Insurance Practitioner Apprenticeship launching in September and the Industrial Electrical Engineer Apprenticeship getting underway in November. </p>  <p>  Earlier this month a further three new apprenticeships commenced, with the launch of apprenticeships in the occupations of Manufacturing Engineer and Manufacturing Technician in the medical device area and Processing Technologist in the polymer manufacturing area.  Subject to successful validation, ten further new programmes are scheduled to commence in 2017, in various occupations including Commis Chef, Accounting Technician, Software Developer and Network Engineer and roles in the international financial services sector.</p></reply>

As part of Budget 2014, SOLAS have ceased making payments to Institutes of Technology (IoTs) and apprentices pay the full pro rata Annual Student Contribution.  These arrangements mean that apprentices are treated the same, on a pro rata basis for the proportion of a full academic year they spend in IoTs, as full time students in terms of the annual student contribution.  Typically an apprenticeship block is one third of an academic year, meaning that most apprentices pay &euro;1,000 (one third of the full ASC of &euro;3,000) as their ASC for that period.</p>  <p>  However, unlike full time students, apprentices are paid a training allowance by SOLAS for phases of their training spent in IoTs.  This allowance ranges from &euro;293 to &euro;647 per week depending on the trade and phase of the apprenticeship programme.  This is the equivalent to their net take-home pay on the job, and is not subject to tax or PRSI.  Such allowances are not available to students in the IoTs. </p></reply>

The 2017 scheme includes an amendment to the income threshold for the special rate of grant which has increased from &euro;22,703 to &euro;23,000.  This change reflects the recent budget increases to the Old Age Contributory Pension and ensures that qualifying families dependent on welfare, will continue to qualify for the highest grant support possible.</p><p>The Student Grant Scheme provides for different levels of income thresholds where families have (i) less than 4 dependent children (ii) between 4 and 7 dependent children and (iii) 8 or more dependent children.  In 2017, the highest income threshold for a family of less than 4 dependent children, is &euro;54,240.  In addition to this and in recognition of the additional cost to families where more than one person is attending college, income thresholds may be increased by a further &euro;4,980 for each additional family member attending college at the same time.</p><p>The income thresholds and rates of maintenance grant under the Student Grant Scheme are announced annually as part of the Budget process.  No changes to the rates or thresholds were included in Budget 2017.  However, in line with the Programme for Government commitment, provision was made to reintroduce maintenance grants for the most disadvantaged postgraduate students.</p><p>I am also reintroducing, from September 2017, the maintenance grant for postgraduate students who meet the qualifying conditions for the special rate of grant.</p><p>The highest income threshold, for a family of less than 4 dependent children, is &euro;54,240.  This will qualify a student for 50% of the student contribution.  The highest level of maintenance grant is &euro;5,915 (non-adjacent special rate of maintenance grant). </p><p>The 2017 Student Grant Scheme was published recently.

The HEA allocates this funding as a block grant to the institutions.  As autonomous bodies, the internal disbursement of this funding, along with any funding it receives from private sources, is a matter for the individual institution.</p>  <p>  My Department also provides a range of services for students in HEA funded higher education institutions, including supports provided by Access Offices.  In particular these offices co-ordinate pastoral and academic supports for students from disadvantaged backgrounds.  Among the supports administered by the access offices, in conjunction with student services is the Student Assistance Fund.</p>  <p>  The Student Assistance Fund is managed by the HEA on behalf of my Department.  The Fund is allocated annually to the universities, the institutes of technology, the colleges of education and a number of other higher education institutions.  The objective of the Fund is to provide financial assistance to full-time undergraduate or postgraduate students in need of such support.  The Fund is intended to support students whose participation in higher education would otherwise be at risk as a direct result of financial difficulties.</p>  <p>  The Fund is designed to support students from socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds with on-going needs for financial support and students with other circumstances giving rise to short or longer-term financial difficulties, including family responsibilities, bereavement, family difficulties, accidents or health problems.  In all cases, institutions are responsible for targeting the available resources at those students most in need.</p>  <p>  Student services and associated activities are an integral part of the whole student experience at third level.  Student services support each individual student achieve his/her intellectual, cultural and social potential while supporting and complementing the formal academic programme.  Student services can fall under a number of headings, particularly &lsquo;Welfare and Guidance&rsquo; which includes counselling services, health promotion, careers service, multi-faith, racial and ethnic cultural support.</p>  <p>  AHEAD, the Association for Higher Education Access and Disability is an independent non-profit organisation working to promote full access to and participation in further and higher education for students with disabilities and to enhance their employment prospects on graduation.</p>  <p>  The HEA supports AHEAD with an annual grant towards the cost of the activities of the organisation.  In 2016, AHEAD, in partnership with the National Learning Network (NLN), published a report called &lsquo;Mental Health Matters&rsquo;.  This report is a study into the experiences of students with mental health difficulties in higher education in Ireland and a mapping of best practices in supporting these students.  The report found that the majority of HEIs have services supporting students with mental health difficulties and some institutions have dedicated services for students.  It also found that students were generally positive about their experience of these services.  Some key recommendations from the report were:</p>  <p>  - A whole of campus strategic response is required to meet the needs of students with mental health difficulties.</p>  <p>  - The promotion of mental health awareness should be as part of induction for students.</p>  <p>  - The provision of mental health awareness training at an institutional level for academic and all other staff including part-time/adjunct staff.</p>  <p>  - A move towards a flexible approach to teaching across programmes to bring greater flexibility to learning and assessment to improve access for all students.</p>  <p>  Implementation of recommendations is being progressed by AHEAD and partners and a follow-on conference/seminar is planned for later this year.</p>  <p>  Fund for Students with Disabilities </p>  <p>  The Fund for Students with Disabilities allocates funding to further and higher education colleges for the provision of services and supports to full-time students with disabilities from PLC up to doctoral level.  The Fund aims to ensure that students can participate fully in their academic programmes and are not disadvantaged by reason of a disability.  It also supports students from Ireland to study on approved courses in in Northern Ireland, the UK and other EU countries.  </p>  <p>  The total allocated under the FSD in 2015-16 was &euro;10.4m.  There were a total of 10,486 students supported under the fund. </p>  <p>  Beneficiaries of the Fund for 2015-16 with a mental health condition were as follows:</p>  <p>  - 91 out of 1362 total students in Further Education and</p>  <p>  - 956 out of a total of 8920 students in Higher Education.</p></reply>

I also had the opportunity to speak with Mr Barnier in the margins, which provided a timely opportunity to reiterate Ireland&rsquo;s key priorities and concerns. </p>  <p>  Overall, the EU has set out its negotiating position clearly.  This includes strong and explicit acknowledgment of the need to address the issues arising from Ireland's unique situation as a negotiating priority. We are grateful for the support and understanding of the EU institutions and of our partners.  At both political and official level we continue to work intensively to ensure that Ireland-specific issues are successfully resolved in the EU-UK negotiations. </p>  <p>  The importance of unity within the EU 27 has been strongly stated on many occasions, most recently at last week&rsquo;s meeting of the European Council.  We are absolutely committed to playing our part in ensuring a united approach.</p>  <p>  We have also made clear to EU partners, to third countries, and to business and civil society, that Ireland&rsquo;s place is at the heart of the European Union.  The Irish people are strongly committed to EU membership &ndash; in the most recent poll, 88% agreed that Ireland should remain a part of the EU. Our economic, social and political interests are best served by our continued membership of the European Union. </p></reply>

For instance, Tourism Ireland and InterTradeIreland are playing continuing and central roles in supporting the all island economy.</p>  <p>  Tourism Ireland is driving record tourism numbers and spend to this island.  InterTradeIreland is building vital exporting capacity among our small and medium enterprises and assisting SMEs in navigating the challenges of Brexit through its new advisory service and carrying out important research into various trade scenarios.</p>  <p>  I am currently representing the Government at the ongoing talks in Belfast and am hopeful that there will shortly be agreement on the restoration of the devolved institutions.  This will allow meetings of the North South Ministerial Council to recommence next month to enable further important engagement on progressing all-island cooperation in general and in particular addressing the challenges of Brexit.</p>  <p>  Discussions on sectoral priorities and on new and expanded areas of cooperation have been taking place within the NSMC.  While there is always scope for exploring the expansion of areas of cooperation and of the work of the North South Bodies, in line with the Good Friday Agreement, such expansion must of course obtain the agreement of the Northern Ireland Assembly.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that the Government has in the Programme for Partnership Government committed to a number of actions to facilitate greater North-South cooperation.</p>  <p>  Full and timely implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and subsequent agreements, including the 2015 Fresh Start Agreement, is a key priority for the Government, as reflected in the Programme for a Partnership Government.  The Agreements, and the principles and values underpinning them, are at the core of the Government&rsquo;s approach to peace, reconciliation and prosperity on this island.  The Government will continue to work tirelessly for the full implementation of the Agreements in both letter and spirit.  </p>  <p>  Despite the political challenges of recent months in Northern Ireland, there has been sustained progress with implementation of the Fresh Start Agreement, with each administration actively pursuing the necessary work to fulfil the respective commitments.  In order to have continued progress it is critically important to see devolved Government working effectively in the interests of the people of Northern Ireland.  As a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, the Government is determined to uphold its principles and protect its institutions.  Effective devolved Government, underpinned by a genuine spirit of partnership, is what the people of Northern Ireland voted for in 1998 and what they expect their politicians to deliver. </p>  <p>  The Fresh Start Agreement provided for the establishment of the Joint Agency Task Force on cross-border crime.  That Task Force was launched in Dublin in December 2015, and has quickly become fully operational, progressing its work to tackle cross-jurisdictional organised crime and bring to justice those involved in it. </p>  <p>  At the Plenary meeting of the NSMC on 18 November 2016 in Armagh, the NSMC considered an update by a group of Senior Officials from relevant Departments, North and South, on the progress being made on implementing the commitments set out in Section E of the Fresh Start Agreement, to provide support and funding for North-South infrastructure projects.  The review is ongoing and a further report will be presented at a future Plenary meeting.</p>  <p>  A key element of the Fresh Start Agreement relates to the ending of the legacy of paramilitarism.  On 13 September 2016, Minister Flanagan signed an international agreement with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland to establish the Independent Reporting Commission (IRC).  The IRC will report annually on progress towards ending continuing paramilitary activity connected with Northern Ireland.  Following the December review meeting, both Governments and the Northern Ireland Executive announced the appointees to the IRC.  The IRC Bill, which will establish the IRC in this jurisdiction, was published by the T&aacute;naiste and then Minister for Justice and Equality, Frances Fitzgerald, on 7 June and it is intended that it will be brought forward by Minister Flanagan in the weeks ahead. </p></reply>

These services include free financial advice and assistance from a Personal Insolvency Practitioner (the &lsquo;PIP Service&rsquo;),</p>  <p>  The procedure for accessing help under Abhaile is straightforward. MABS (the Money Advice and Budgeting Service) acts as the gateway to all Abhaile services.  To apply, a person can contact MABS, either via the MABS helpline or by calling to their local MABS office.  Full details are provided on the MABS website at www.mabs.ie, and the helpline is open 9 am to 8 pm, Monday to Friday. </p>  <p>  MABS will check that the person qualifies for Abhaile.  He or she is eligible if they are a homeowner, unable to pay their debts as they fall due, and at risk of losing their home due to mortgage arrears. </p>  <p>  MABS will also advise them on the help most suited to their individual needs and situation.  Where this includes the PIP Service, MABS will provide the eligible person (&lsquo;the borrower&rsquo;) with an Abhaile voucher which they can exchange for that advice and assistance.  The borrower can then choose a PIP from the Abhaile panel of participating PIPs, and provides the voucher to the PIP at their consultation meeting.</p>  <p>  The  PIP Service is a fixed service which includes:</p>  <p>  1. a personal consultation with the borrower,</p>  <p>  2. preparation of a Prescribed Financial Statement, which is a detailed analysis  of the borrower&rsquo;s income, assets and liabilities, in accordance with section 50 of the Personal Insolvency Acts,</p>  <p>  3. assessment of the borrower's individual financial situation,</p>  <p>  4. advising the borrower, in accordance with the PIP&rsquo;s detailed obligations under section 52 of the Personal Insolvency Acts, on the range of options available to resolve their financial difficulties and on the best options available in their individual circumstances (with priority to keeping the borrower in their home), and</p>  <p>  5. confirming that advice to the borrower in writing.</p>  <p>  A PIP participating in the Abhaile panel has agreed to provide the PIP Service described above for a set fee of &euro;500 (plus VAT if applicable).  That fee is paid by Abhaile, in return for the PIP submitting the voucher and evidence of provision of the required service.  There is no charge to the borrower.</p>  <p>  If the PIP recommends that the borrower apply for a Personal Insolvency Arrangement, and the borrower instructs them to act on their behalf, the PIP will normally have to undertake further work to prepare a Personal Insolvency Arrangement and to seek the agreement of creditors.  However,  it is expected of all Abhaile panel PIPs that in normal course, PIP fees for any such further work will be charged as part of the terms of the Personal Insolvency Arrangement. </p>  <p>  If the PIP recommends that bankruptcy is the best solution in the borrower&rsquo;s individual circumstances, the PIP will also provide the borrower with the written statement required by the bankruptcy judge, confirming that the borrower has first been advised regarding their options under personal insolvency, as part of the PIP Service. </p></reply>

To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves.</p><p>Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 by 2021 will require some 2,400 new Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next three years in addition to the 2,000 that will have been recruited by the end of this year since the re-opening of the Garda College in September 2014. </p><p>I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that since the reopening of the College, that just under 1,000 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide.  I am also informed that there are 605 student Garda&iacute; attending the <font color="#2F2F2F">College for phase 1 training  who </font>are scheduled to attest this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - an increase of 500 since the end of 2016.  Two further intakes of 200 Garda trainees to the College are planned for August and November which will bring the total intake to 800 this year.</p><p>Progress on reaching the target of 15,000 is proceeding apace.  In order to ensure that it is reached it will require a continuous pipeline of suitable candidates.  In this regard I am pleased to say that the recruitment campaign launched by the Public Appointments Service on behalf of the Commissioner last May, again received a strong response with more than 5,000 people applying. </p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources she needs to allow her to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division. </p></reply>

During this period approximately 2.5 million registered land parcels, made up of approximately 15 million line entities were digitised from 36,000 PRA paper map sheets. </p>  <p>  Having completed the digitisation of the PRA map record a comprehensive assessment of the quality of the data capture was carried out by the PRA and this study revealed an error rate of 0.18%.  I am advised that it is the PRA&rsquo;s view that this error rate is well within the acceptable range given the complexity of the project.  It should be noted that the Digital Mapping Project was much more than just a matter of transferring the registered land parcels from a paper map record to a digital map record.  Factors that contributed to the complexity of the challenges associated with the project included: moving all registrations, from the defunct County Series and Irish Grid map projections to the latest Irish Transverse Mercator map projection; development schemes mapped on the PRA paper based record found to be at variance with the more accurate &ldquo;As Built&rdquo; layout presented by Ordnance Survey Ireland; transferring registrations from Western seaboard counties, which were up until the Digital Mapping Project, predominantly mapped on 1/10560 or 6&rdquo; Ordnance Survey mapping which had not benefited from any revisions for decades; deciphering map data on old paper maps, some of which were 100 years old; and deciphering map data on badly damaged paper maps.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that prior to the data capture element of the project the process was validated by eminent International Mapping/Land Administration experts.</p>  <p>  I am assured by the PRA that it has in place robust structures whereby the registered owners of properties or their representatives can engage with the PRA in relation to matters pertaining to the mapped representation of the registration.  The PRA also has a longstanding and valued relationship with Solicitors, Surveyors, Engineers and Architects in all matters pertaining to property registration.  The PRA&rsquo;s experience has been such that many of the queries received, once investigated, do not indicate any registration error.  Many of the perceived errors do not emanate from the PRA, but in fact originate from inaccuracies in the application map lodged for registration.  It should be noted that the responsibility for the accuracy of the application map lodged rests with the applicant.</p>  <p>  There needs to be due recognition given to the fact that the PRA Digital Mapping Project resolved many thousands of pre-existing issues and anomalies that existed in the paper based map system.  Being proactive in the adoption of Ordnance Survey topographical detail, during digitisation, has absolved many property owners of the need to incur costs in an effort to perfect or amend the Land Register to reflect the actual position on the ground.</p></reply>

The Programme is based on agreed priorities established by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Garda authorities are working in close cooperation with the Office of Public Works, which has responsibility for capital expenditure in this area, to deliver the projects.  The Programme does not include provision for any significant building works at Ballyhaunis station.</p><p>I am informed by the Garda authorities that Ballyhaunis Garda station is in the Claremorris District which forms part of the Mayo Division.  As of 31 May 2017, the latest date for which figures are readily available, the strength of Claremorris District was 90.  There are also 5 Garda Reserves and<b></b>1 civilian attached to the District.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. </p><p>Garda personnel assigned throughout the country, together with the overall policing arrangements and operational strategies are continually monitored and reviewed.  Such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of Garda Resources and the best possible Garda service is provided to the general public.  Furthermore, when allocations are taking place, comprehensive consultation is carried out with local Garda management during which all factors are taken into consideration.  Where a deficiency in resources is identified the matter is considered fully and addressed accordingly.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the Programme for Government commits the Government to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  A cornerstone of this commitment is the Government plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  This year, the Government has provided funding for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves.  In order to continue to ensure seamless ongoing recruitment it is expected that a new competition for trainee Garda will be announced shortly.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.  I am informed by the Commissioner that in regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Garda Division.  It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his/her Division.</p><p>The Commissioner has advised that all Garda&iacute;, not simply designated Community Garda&iacute; have a role to play in addressing community policing issues as and when the need arises and, in that sense, community policing involves far more than a single unit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p><p>I am further informed by the Commissioner that Malahide, Swords, Balbriggan and Lusk Garda stations form part of the Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR) North Division and as of the 31 May 2017, there were 664 Garda.  There are also 49 Garda Reserves and  40 civilians attached to the DMR North Division.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. </p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  This year, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves.</p><p>This plan is progressing apace.  I am informed by the Commissioner, since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, that just under 1,000 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide 75 of whom have been assigned to the DMR North Division.  I am also informed that another 600 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end -  an increase of 500 since the end of 2016.</p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources she needs to allow her to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; including Community Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division in the coming years. </p><p>This investment in personnel is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.

Under this programme, the Government has pledged to accept a total of 4,000 persons into the State, 2,622 through the EU relocation mechanism established by two EU Council Decisions in 2015 to assist Italy and Greece, 1,040 under the UNHCR-led refugee resettlement programme currently focussed on resettling refugees from Lebanon (519 by the end of 2016 and the remainder in 2017)  and the balance through a variety of mechanisms.  Some elements of this intake, such as the relocation strand, come with a time limit of two years and other elements are not time limited.  </p>  <p>  As regards the resettlement strand of the Programme, Ireland had taken in 519 of the original commitment of 520 by the end of 2016, a year ahead of schedule.  Last year the Government doubled its commitment under resettlement to 1,040 and the number of persons who have arrived from Lebanon under refugee resettlement now stands at 785.  The remaining 255 persons to arrive under resettlement have been selected and assessed and are expected to arrive later in the year.  </p>  <p>  In terms of the relocation aspect of the IRPP, allocations under the relevant EU Council Decisions are composed of three elements:</p>  <p>  - an intake from Greece of 1,089 asylum seekers</p>  <p>  -  an intake from Italy of 623 asylum seekers and</p>  <p>  -  an allocation of 910 asylum seekers which has not yet been assigned to either Italy or Greece.</p>  <p>  Ireland will meet in full its commitment to Greece.  459 of the allocation of 1,089 are already in the State and a further 357 have been assessed and are awaiting transportation.  A further mission to Athens this month interviewed 99 persons.  Missions to fill the remaining places under this strand of the Programme have been scheduled with the Greek authorities between now and September 2017.  However, Italy, unlike Greece, will  not permit security assessments to be undertaken by other States on its territory.  Accordingly, Ireland has been unable to undertake security assessments on its territory of the cohort eligible for relocation to Ireland.  It has therefore not been possible for Ireland to take asylum seekers from Italy.  However, Intensive efforts remain ongoing to try to resolve this impasse.  Contacts and meetings continue to this end, both bilaterally with Italian counterparts at official, diplomatic and Ministerial level, and at EU level, including through the European Commission.  </p>  <p>   In terms of the unallocated portion contained in the two EU Council Decisions referred to above, which in the case of Ireland amounts to  910 persons,  Ireland cannot access this component until a decision is taken at EU level to allocate these numbers as between Greece and Italy.  It is understood that the European  Commission are examining allocating this "unassigned" portion and if they do Ireland will immediately work towards relocating them. </p>  <p>  Ireland is doing everything it can to give effect to the EU relocation Decisions and what can unambiguously be said is that, should it be the case that despite all Ireland's efforts, the relocation mechanism does not permit Ireland to take in sufficient numbers of asylum seekers under relocation, then the Government commitment to take in 4,000 people remains and Ireland will take in these numbers through other mechanisms should this prove necessary.</p></reply>

This year, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost.  The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate setting.</p><p>Participants in the Scheme contribute up to 80% of their assessable income and a maximum of 7.5% per annum of the value of assets held.  In the case of a couple, the applicant&rsquo;s means are assessed as 50% of the couple&rsquo;s combined income and assets.  The first &euro;36,000 of an individual&rsquo;s assets, or &euro;72,000 in the case of a couple, is not counted at all in the financial assessment.  The capital value of an individual&rsquo;s principal private residence is only included in the financial assessment for the first three years of their time in care. </p><p>The value of a person&rsquo;s principal residence is only included in the financial assessment for the first three years that the person receives care services.  This is known as the three year cap.  In accordance with the legislation, a person&rsquo;s principal residence is assessed on the basis of its estimated market value less allowable deductions as set out in the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act, 2009.  Under the Act, allowable deductions in respect of a person&rsquo;s principal residence are borrowings incurred specifically for the purchase, repair or improvement of the asset concerned to such an amount that has not been repaid.  The HSE must be satisfied that the purpose of incurring the borrowings was for the purchase, repair or improvement of the asset concerned.</p><p>The value of the allowable deduction in respect of a person&rsquo;s principal residence is the value of the outstanding borrowings concerned.  This amount can be deducted from the estimated market value of the property as part of the financial assessment.  It is also open to a person to choose to avail of the allowable deduction in respect of their assessed weekly income should this option be more beneficial to them. <font color="#004080"> </font>The allowable deduction in respect of a person&rsquo;s income is processed by either deducting interest on borrowings for the purchase, repair or improvement of the principal residence, or, the full weekly value of mortgage repayments from the person&rsquo;s weekly income. </p><p>It is important to note that where an individual chooses the option to deduct the full weekly value of mortgage repayments from his or her income, he or she cannot also seek to offset the same mortgage against the value of the asset concerned by claiming the same deduction under the assessment of the value of the principal residence.  In such cases the full estimated market value of the principal residence is included in the financial assessment. </p></reply>

The Head of PAD reports directly to the Director General. </p>  <p>  The PAD processes a very significant volume of PQs representations and other queries from members of the Oireachtas.

The safety of all medicines, including vaccines, is an important matter and there are robust regulatory and monitoring systems in place at both EU and national level to ensure that the medicines we use are safe and effective.   </p>  <p>  The Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) is responsible for monitoring the safety and quality of all medicines that are licensed in Ireland.  The HPRA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in Europe continually monitor adverse events to vaccination.  </p>  <p>  As part of its monitoring of the safety of medicines, the HPRA operates an adverse reaction reporting system, with healthcare professionals and patients encouraged to report adverse reactions they consider may be associated with their treatment, through the range of options in place for reporting.  All reports received are evaluated and considered in the context of the safety profile of the product concerned, with reports followed up as necessary for further information, that may assist in the assessment of the case.    </p>  <p>  In addition, pharmaceutical companies are obliged, as a condition of the authorisation to market a medicine, to submit reports of adverse reactions received directly, to the HPRA.  In accordance with its reporting obligations, the HPRA provides anonymised details of reports received to the EMA, the WHO and to the relevant pharmaceutical companies.  The fact that a suspected adverse reaction has been reported does not necessarily mean that the medicine has caused the observed effect, which may have also been caused by the disease being treated, a new disease the patient developed, or by another medicine that the patient is taking.  Further data are usually needed to complete the picture.</p>  <p>  In the context of monitoring the safety of medicines, new information on a possible risk is called a signal.  Signals may arise from various data sources, including spontaneous reports, clinical trials and epidemiological studies.  Once a signal has been identified, investigations are undertaken to consider the likelihood that a medicine may have caused or contributed to the effect, try to identify risk factors and estimate the frequency of occurrence.  Following the assessment, a decision on the most appropriate regulatory action is taken by the competent authorities.  The regulatory action is communicated to healthcare professionals, patients and the general public through established channels, and timelines reflect the degree of urgency.  </p>  <p>  The majority of reports received by the HPRA have been consistent with the expected pattern of adverse effects for the vaccines, as described in the product information (Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet).  Vaccination related events, occurring at the time of vaccine administration, such as syncope (faints) has been among the most commonly reported effects.  Other commonly reported symptoms include gastrointestinal symptoms, malaise, headache, dizziness and injection site reactions.</p>  <p>  There is no indication or signal of a causal link between the symptoms suffered by the young women and administration of the HPV vaccine.  However, this does not mean that their symptoms do not have a physical basis and it is important that any conditions they may have are properly diagnosed and receive appropriate treatment.  The families of any girls suffering symptoms following HPV vaccination are advised to seek medical advice from their family doctor in the normal manner and be referred to consultants familiar with these syndromes for appropriate diagnosis and management.  </p>  <p>  The EMA completed a detailed scientific review in November 2015 of the evidence surrounding reports of two conditions: complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS).  The Agency&rsquo;s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use concurred that the available evidence does not support that CRPS and POTS are caused by HPV vaccines.  It therefore did not recommend any changes to the terms of licensing or the product information for these medicines.  On 12 January 2016 the European Commission endorsed the conclusions of the European Medicines Agency, that there is no change to the way HPV vaccines are used, or to amend the current product information.  This final outcome by the Commission applies in all members states.</p>  <p>  I am aware of claims of an association between HPV vaccination and a number of conditions experienced by a group of young women.  An illness that occurs around the time a vaccine is given and is already known to be common in adolescence does not imply the vaccine caused the problem.  It appears that some girls first suffered symptoms around the time they received the HPV vaccine, and understandably some parents have connected the vaccine to their daughter&rsquo;s condition.  It is important to reassure people that anyone who is suffering ill health is eligible to seek medical attention, and to access appropriate health and social care services, irrespective of the cause of their symptoms.  The individual nature of the needs of some children may require access to specialist services and the HSE are currently working to put in place a clinical care pathway appropriate to the medical needs of this group.</p></reply>

Assessment and interventions need to be tailored to the individual. </p>  <p>  Treatment for ME is initiated based on the individuals&rsquo; symptoms.  In general these treatments are delivered within the context of primary care, with referrals into secondary care for specialist interventions in the areas of Neurology, Rheumatology, Pain Specialists, Endocrinology, Immunology and Cardiology.  These services are generally accessed through out-patient clinics at secondary care level by the relevant specialty. </p>  <p>  Rintatolimod (brand name Ampligen) is an experimental medicine in development for the treatment of a variety of chronic diseases and viral disorders, including Chronic Fatigue Syndrome or ME.  The medicine is not currently authorised in the European Union.  Before a medicine can be placed on the Irish market the manufacturer has to seek an authorisation from the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) or in the case of certain medicinal products, the European Medicines Agency (EMA).  In the case of Ampligen, because of the biotechnology nature of the active substance involved, any application for a marketing authorisation must be made to the EMA.  I have no information on whether or not such an application has been received by the EMA.</p>  <p>  Should the medicine receive marketing authorisation, it would then be open to the marketing authorisation holder to make the medicine available in Ireland and to apply to the HSE to have the product reimbursed under community drugs schemes.</p></reply>

It recognised that the spreading of slurry can, depending on the timing of the application and the weather conditions, result in nitrogen loss from slurry to the atmosphere through ammonia volatilisation.  That Department will conduct a thorough examination of all submissions received as part of its consultation phase.  No decision has been taken by this Department on a total ban.  My Department continues to liase closely with colleagues in DCCAE on this matter.</p>  <p>  Interestingly On foot of farmer demand to improve the utilisation of slurry as a fertiliser, my Department is assisting farmers under TAMS in the purchase of Low Emission Slurry Spreading equipment where to date 539 applications have been received for trailing shoe, 394 applications for the dribble bar and 14 applications for shallow injection.  Overall across all low emissions technologies over 1,058 applications have been received which is above expectations.  In addition more than 4752 farmers have applied under the GLAS scheme to apply slurry using low emission equipment. </p>  <p>  This is being driven by farmers themselves wanting to maximise the value of the slurry on their own farms, rather than as a regulatory requirement.  Recently, the Association of Farm and Forestry Contractors of Ireland also identified their support for this technology.</p>  <p>  However, I fully understand that this technology is not suitable for all farms.</p></reply>

It identifies the opportunities and challenges facing the sector and provides an enabling strategy that will allow the sector to grow and prosper.  Food Wise includes more than 400 specific recommendations, spread across the cross-cutting themes of sustainability, innovation, human capital, market development and competitiveness; as well as specific sectoral recommendations.</p>  <p>  If these recommendations are implemented, the expert committee which drew up the Food Wise 2025 Strategy believes that the following growth projections are achievable by 2025: increasing the value of agri-food exports by 85% to &euro;19 billion; increasing value added in the sector by 70% to in excess of &euro;13 billion; and increasing the value of primary production by 65% to almost &euro;10 billion.  With regard to employment, Food Wise foresees the creation of 23,000 additional jobs in the agri-food sector all along the supply chain from primary production to high value added product development.  Realising these growth projections will be challenging, but I am confident that they can be achieved. </p>  <p>  In July last year, I launched the first annual progress report of Food Wise 2025: Steps to Success 2016. Food Wise Steps to Success showed that, of the 330 detailed actions which were due to commence in 2015 or 2016, 28% have been achieved or substantial action has been undertaken; and a further 67% have commenced and are progressing well.  I believe that this is a good start and I will press on to get as many actions as possible completed within the next year.</p>  <p>  Next month, I will launch the second annual progress report of Food Wise 2025: Steps to Success 2017.</p></reply>

We are also insisting that the timing and content of any beef TRQ offer is handled appropriately, and in a manner that safeguards the interests of the Irish and European beef sector in particular. </p>  <p>  This must also take into account the findings of the Commission&rsquo;s recent cumulative impact assessment, which strongly reinforce Ireland&rsquo;s position in relation to beef.  They are also a very effective reminder of the need for great caution in our approach to the issue of beef TRQs. </p></reply>

The Scheme gives the dairy sector the capability to both benchmark Irish milk production internationally and to demonstrate the commitment of Irish dairy farms to sustainable farming practices.  The Scheme also allows the sector access to markets and buyers that demand on-farm certification and provide assurance for those customers regarding sustainable production of quality milk.</p><p>The scheme is open to all milk producers with a valid herd registration who supply to milk processors in the Republic of Ireland.  Applications are processed by Bord Bia who then provide an information pack and assign the farm to an auditor.  A farm visit will be conducted by an independent auditor at 18-month intervals at a time and day that suits the farmer.  The purpose of these visits is to audit the farm against the quality assurance criteria and to collect data regarding the sustainability of the farm.</p><p>There are approximately 17,800 dairy farmers in Ireland.  To date over 17,000 applications to join the scheme have been received representing 96% of all dairy farmers.  In total over 83% of all dairy farmers are now certified, meaning that their audit is completed and all corrective actions undertaken.  This Scheme does not have an end date, as is common with all quality assurance schemes of this nature.  It is a matter for processors as to how to deal with milk from suppliers who may choose not to join the scheme. </p><p>The following table outlines applications and current participants in the scheme by county:<table><tr><th>County</th><th>Number of Applicants</th><th>Number of Certified Farms</th></tr><tr><td>Carlow</td><td>174</td><td>144</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan</td><td>657</td><td>575</td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>604</td><td>562</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>4,221</td><td>3,540</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>224</td><td>176</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>24</td><td>21</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>494</td><td>422</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>1,533</td><td>1,424</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>158</td><td>129</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td>912</td><td>820</td></tr><tr><td>Laois</td><td>435</td><td>369</td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim</td><td>47</td><td>42</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>1,470</td><td>1,333</td></tr><tr><td>Longford</td><td>143</td><td>131</td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td>164</td><td>142</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td>364</td><td>317</td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td>504</td><td>393</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan</td><td>553</td><td>482</td></tr><tr><td>Offaly</td><td>349</td><td>301</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon</td><td>109</td><td>90</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td>159</td><td>144</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary</td><td>1,747</td><td>1,501</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>779</td><td>670</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath</td><td>268</td><td>241</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>816</td><td>687</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>233</td><td>182</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>17,141</td><td>14,838</td></tr></table></p></reply>

This approach to the reform of the CAP was one which is recognised as being the most suitable approach to take, on the basis that the best interests of farmers were served by allowing them the flexibility to calibrate production to market demand without compromising income from the Basic Payment Scheme. </p>  <p>  The report referenced by the Deputy clearly emphasises the economic importance of the cattle sector within  EU agriculture and stresses the importance of further product differentiation at EU level, increased export opportunities as well as compensation for environment services to support extensification within the beef sector.  I agree with the general thrust of this and the work that I and my Department carry out in relation to the beef sector very much reflects these goals.  I have recently returned from successful trade missions to the USA and Mexico.  I have also hosted a number of high level visits from other countries outside of the EU including China and Vietnam.  These missions will serve to improve our existing levels of market access and promote Ireland&rsquo;s reputation as a producer of high quality, safe and sustainably produced meat.</p>  <p>  With regard to compensation for environment services to support extensification the Rural Development Programme already provides significant supports which include a range of supports available to the Suckler sector.  From an environmental perspective GLAS provides support to all participating farmers including suckler farmers to farm in an environmentally sensitive manner.</p>  <p>  The introduction of a voluntary coupled support specifically for suckler cows in disadvantaged areas raises a number of issues.  First, the funding of any supports from existing Pillar I funding would require a redistribution of existing payments within Pillar I to all farmers.  A further consideration would be the effect introducing supports for suckler cows in disadvantaged areas would have on the wider suckler cow sector especially those producers in non disadvantaged areas.  I am of course conscious of the unique challenges faced by all farmers regardless of sector, in disadvantaged areas.  However it should be noted that the report also states the benefits of not limiting such supports to land type.</p>  <p>  Another important factor to consider would be the impact that funding of voluntary coupled supports in Pillar II of the CAP would have on the various commitments already made across a range of schemes and supports provided for under the RDP.  Indeed through Pillar II of the CAP some &euro;300 million of funding over a six year period has been targeted at the Irish suckler herd through the Bovine Data Genomics Programme (BDGP).  In response to significant demand, earlier this year I reopened the BDGP programme for new entrants.  This clearly reflects the success of the programme. </p>  <p>  Several other supports are in place for suckler farmers under the RDP, notably GLAS, ANCs and Knowledge Transfer groups.  I am of the view that the current range of supports available to suckler farmers is the most appropriate way to support the continued development of this sector at this time.</p></reply>

Neither I nor the Department have a statutory authority to direct eir in this regard. </p><p>Quarterly updates on progress of the eir 300k rollout will be published on the Departments website.  The Q1 figures have been verified by my Department and the eir rollout is in line with the Commitment Agreement.</p><p>In April I published an updated High Speed Broadband Map which is available at<i>www.broadband.gov.ie</i>.  This map finalises the State Intervention Area for the procurement process and is an important milestone in the procurement process.  The Map shows the extent of  the State Intervention area and also the areas targeted for commercial services.</p><p>The BLUE areas represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or have indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services,  </p><p>The AMBER areas on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the areas that will require State Intervention and are the subject of the current procurement process. </p><p>The map shows that  100% of the townland of Tarmon East, Co Kerry and 100% of the townland of Corkeragh, Co Kildare falls within an AMBER area and will be part of the State led Intervention under the NBP.  Individuals can themselves check whether their premises is in a BLUE or an AMBER area by accessing the High Speed Broadband Map and entering their Eircode at<i>www.broadband.gov.ie.</i></p><p>A formal procurement process is in train to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area.  The procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years.  The finalisation of the State Intervention Area for the procurement process is an important milestone as it means that bidders can progress their business plans and the Department can move to the next stage of the procurement.  The three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution. A fibre-to-the-home solution means that householders and businesses may get speeds not just of 30 Megabits per second but much higher, potentially up to 1000 Megabits per second. </p><p>The State Intervention network will be a wholesale network and retail service providers will be able to use the network to provide enhanced broadband services to their customers.  The timeframe for the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders, during the procurement process. During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated a 3-5 year timeline to rollout a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP, once contracts are in place. </p><p>However, I am aware that the rate of demand for data services has increased exponentially in the last four years and this presents a continuing challenge for telecommunication operators, regulators and policy makers both in Ireland and internationally.  Recognising this challenge, I specifically included in the Programme for Government a commitment to a Mobile Phone and Broadband Task force.  In July 2016, I established the Task Force together with Minister Humphreys to identify immediate solutions to broadband and mobile phone coverage deficits and investigate how better services could be provided to consumers, prior to the full build and roll-out of the network planned under the National Broadband Plan State intervention. </p><p>The report of the Task Force was published in December and is available on both Departments' websites.  In producing this report, the Task Force worked with Departments, local authorities, ComReg, State agencies, the telecoms industry and other key stakeholders.  The report contains 40 actions that will alleviate some of the telecommunications deficits across Ireland and the implementation programme on mobile phone and broadband access identifies 19 of these actions as areas where immediate and direct action by Departments and State agencies can ensure accelerated benefits to consumers.</p><p>In order to maintain momentum created by the Task Force, I established an Implementation Group to drive and monitor the implementation of the actions, bringing together all key stakeholders identified in the Task Force report with responsibility for delivery.  This group will be formally reporting every 90 days on progress made on all actions.  I published the first such quarterly progress report on 13th June 2017, which is available on my Department's website at <i>http://www.dccae.gov.ie/documents/Taskforce%20Q1%20Progress%20Report.pdf </i>and which shows that considerable progress has been made, particularly in relation to the implementation of actions identified for Q1 2017.  The work of the Task Force will also assist local authorities in preparing for the roll-out of the new NBP network once contracts are in place.</p><p>In addition, following regulations which I signed last year, ComReg recently announced the results of its auction for the 3.6GHz radio spectrum band, which means an 86% increase in spectrum capacity to meet the growing demand for mobile and wireless broadband services across rural and urban areas.  The Regulator has awarded 15 year licences for the rights of use in this band which will provide a degree of stability and create future investment certainty.  Spectrum was also awarded in lots covering 9 urban and rural regions across the country.</p><p>In my Department's Estimates for 2017, I have secured an &euro;8 million provision for RTE to allow it to free up the 700 MHz spectrum band.  ComReg in turn will make plans to allocate this spectrum to provide for significantly enhanced mobile coverage.  The 700 MHz band is particularly suited to rural environments where the signal can travel long distances. </p><p>These initiatives should assist in enhancing the quality of mobile phone and data services across Ireland and particularly in rural Ireland.</p></reply>

Ireland is committed to achieving this target through meeting 40% of electricity demand, 12% of heat and 10% of transport from renewable sources of energy.</p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">The Programme for Government contains a commitment to facilitate the development of solar energy projects in Ireland.  This builds on the commitment in this area in the 2015 Energy White Paper.</font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">With respect to renewable electricity, my Department is currently developing a new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) which will be designed to assist Ireland in meeting its renewable energy contributions out to 2030.  Analysis is on-going against a range of commercial renewable technologies at various scales and includes an assessment of the cost of supporting Solar Photovoltaics (PV) - both rooftop and ground-mounted.  The assessment also includes analysis of the optimum financial support mechanisms for renewable technologies, in line with the 2014 EU State Aid Guidelines.</font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">My Department will shortly publish a public consultation on the design of the new support scheme.  Following the outcome of this public consultation, and before any new scheme is introduced, it will need to secure Government approval and state aid clearance from the European Commission.  Subject to this, it is expected that the new scheme will become operational in 2018.</font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">My stated position is that while solar has a role to play in Ireland&rsquo;s energy future, we cannot have a situation where a new support scheme leads to a disproportionate increase in people&rsquo;s electricity bills through the Public Service Obligation levy.  In designing the new RESS, the cost implications for people and businesses will, therefore be a high priority and I will ensure that the new scheme is designed in a cost efficient manner and will take advantage of falling renewable costs.</font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">Finally, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland currently provides supports for the use of solar thermal heating technology to both large industry and SMEs.  Households can also avail of grant support for investment in renewable energy installations, including solar thermal, under the Better Energy Homes Scheme.</font></p></reply>

However, I am aware that some retailers are charging surcharges to top-up payments for Pay As You Go meters for electricity and I deplore this practice.</p>  <p>  Officials in my Department have previously met with the providers of these systems, retail representative groups and a number of Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs), particularly the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) and Society of Saint Vincent de Paul (SVP) specifically on this topic. </p>  <p>  Payment providers have assured my officials that the practice of surcharging is explicitly forbidden in the contract retailers must sign on accepting a payment terminal.  Additionally, they advise that the level of customer complaints they receive is low but that they are working with energy suppliers to investigate and address persistent problems.  They are also working to mitigate the problem through proactive support of those retailers who aren&rsquo;t engaging in the practice.  They do this through the provision of promotional material that can encourage customers to use retailers who do not apply surcharges and in the case of repeat offenders, payment providers have the ability to withdraw a payment terminal. </p>  <p>  The CER continues to monitor this matter and has engaged with energy suppliers and payment providers to address this.  The CER has written to suppliers to remind them of their obligations to prevent this practice.  My officials have requested that the aforementioned NGO's keep the Department appraised of any growth in the practice of surcharging with a view to monitoring the need for further engagement with the industry.</p></reply>

Following referral of any report of concern that fraud or wrongful claiming may have occurred, an investigation is undertaken.  A determination of fraud can only be made after a detailed investigation by a social welfare inspector and the making of a revised decision under the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 2005 by a deciding officer.  The decision is communicated to the person concerned, including the value of any overpayment assessed, and that person is also advised of their right of appeal to the Social Welfare Appeal Office if they dispute the outcome.</p>  <p>  Decisions of this nature follow an investigation and where is has been determined to the satisfaction of a deciding officer that the person concerned made false or misleading statements in a material respect or wilfully concealed material facts that impacted on their eligibility for an entitlement or the rate of payment due to them.  </p>  <p>  It is difficult to give precise time scales for the conduct of investigations as they relate to the complexity of each particular case, the co-operation, or lack thereof, of the person concerned and the time taken to access evidence and other information.

There is no automatic entitlement to a payment or pre-determined amounts under the scheme.  ENPs are payable at the discretion of the officers administering the scheme taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case.  Government has provided &euro;31.5 for the ENP scheme in 2017.</p>  <p>  Basic weekly SWA may be paid to customers awaiting the outcome of a claim or an appeal for a primary social welfare payment.  In certain circumstances if a person is not eligible for other social welfare payments and their weekly income is below the SWA rate for their family size, a payment may be made to bring their income up to the appropriate SWA rate.  Apart from a number of excluded categories, anyone in the State who satisfies a habitual residence condition and a means test, has registered for employment (unless they have a physical or mental disability) and can prove unemployment may qualify for SWA.  ENPs are not subject to the habitual residence condition and may be considered in exceptional circumstances to meet essential needs of people who do not qualify for other social welfare payments as they do not meet this condition.</p>  <p>  Statistics are not maintained on the numbers of ENPs made in cases where a person has no other source of income.  If the Deputy has concerns in respect of a particular case he should bring the details to the attention of the Department.  </p>  <p>  Any persons who consider that they have an entitlement to a basic weekly SWA payment or an ENP scheme should contact the Community Welfare Service of the Department at their local Intreo centre. </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Outside the main urban area counties, the rate of increases varies in line with market trends with the highest increases of 25% in Roscommon and Laois.  In addition, my Department continues to implement a targeted, flexible, case-by-case approach where rents may exceed the maximum limits. Some 11,600 persons at imminent risk of homelessness have been supported through increased rent supplement payments since this flexible approach was introduced in 2014.</p><p>Insofar as increases for pensioners are concerned, Budget 2017 provided for increase of &euro;5 in the maximum weekly rate for all social welfare recipients, including pensioners, and these increases were brought into effect in March of this year. </p><p>Also with effect from March 2017, alongside the weekly increase of &euro;5 in the rate of Farm Assist, an enhanced assessment of means from farming was introduced, whereby 70% of farm income is now assessed as means (down from 100%).  Additional income disregards for claimants with children were also introduced.  These changes mean that the Farm Assist means test has reverted to the position which applied prior to Budget 2012.500 additional places have also been provided for on the Rural Social Scheme in 2017.All of these measures are designed to support farm families.</p><p>Finally, Budget 2017 provided for significant changes for self-employed social insurance contributors. Entitlement to Treatment Benefits was extended to the self-employed from March 2017, and alongside other social insurance contributors, they will gain from improvements in the Treatment Benefits scheme from October 2017.  Self-employed workers will also have access, for the first time, to the Invalidity Pension scheme from December 2017.</p><p>I trust this clarifies the position for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Under the Act each Government Department is required to produce a Sectoral Plan which outlines actions to ensure that people with a disability have access to the quality public services that underpin life choices and experiences.  Pursuant to Section 36(1)(d) of the Act, my Department is obliged to prepare a Sectoral Plan for people with disabilities which includes housing and accommodation for persons with disabilities. </p>  <p>  The Sectoral Plan of my Department, which was developed in consultation with people with disabilities, outlines the steps to be taken to improve provision of services to people with a disability by the Department and Local Authorities and sets out national objectives and guidelines for access to services and built facilities.  It also includes measures to be taken in the areas of the building and planning codes.</p>  <p>  National Guidelines for the Assessment and Allocation Process for Housing Provision for People with a Disability, were developed by my Department and adopted for implementation by housing authorities with effect from November 2014.  Furthermore, housing authorities have established Housing and Disability Steering Groups, which also include representatives from the Health Services Executive and disability representative organisations.  The objective is to achieve a coordinated and integrated approach to meeting the housing needs of people with disabilities at a local level including, among other things, addressing accessibility requirements in new social housing stock.  It should be noted that a number of Local Authorities have also developed their own Strategic Plans for Housing People with a Disability. </p>  <p>  In addition, under my Department&rsquo;s Capital Assistance Scheme (CAS), funding of up to 100% of project costs may be advanced by local authorities to Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) to provide accommodation for people with specific categories of need, including people with disabilities. </p>  <p>  Finally, it should be noted that all dwellings, including social housing, must comply with the Building Regulations 1997-2017, and in particular Part M, which requires dwellings to be visitable for people with disabilities. </p></reply>

Some 8,000 households benefitted under this Scheme in 2016, and with the additional funding available this year, this should increase to 10,000.  I have no plans to increase the upper limit of the Housing Adaptation Grant for People with a Disability from &euro;30,000.  The average individual amount paid under these grants is already lower than the &euro;30,000 upper limit and the current arrangement, therefore, serves to spread the benefits of the available funding to a higher number of recipients.</p>  <p>  The income limits for the scheme were revised in 2014 arising from the recommendations of a review group and I have no plans to revise them further.  A priority for the scheme is to spread the benefits as widely as possible and to ensure fairness and value for money in its operation.  The scheme is therefore more sharply focussed towards households with greatest needs, especially lower income households.</p></reply>

However, given the unique nature of building defects this period was extended to twelve months in the Building Control Act and additional flexibility was provided so that the twelve month period does not begin until the defects are discovered.  This is subject to the overarching proviso that the offence must be prosecuted no later than five years after the date of the completion of any building works in respect of which the offence is alleged to have been committed.</p>  <p>  The Building Control reform agenda has focussed on addressing the key deficits identified in the regulatory regime in 2011 namely the lack of involvement of construction professionals on site and lack of accountability in relation to compliance with the Building Regulations.</p>  <p>  In parallel, improving the effectiveness and efficiency of the oversight by Building Control Authorities is a key priority and safeguard to ensuring compliance with the Building Regulations.  In this context my Department will, among other things, be reviewing the 5 year restriction on enforcement action under the Building Control Acts.</p></reply>

The draft Plan is currently undergoing six months public consultation.  Formal consultation on the draft Plan will close on the 31 August 2017 and the plan will be finalised towards the end of this year.  A copy of the draft Plan can be found at the following link:  .  The assessment carried out for the purposes of the draft Plan shows that the level of risk due to abstraction pressures in Ireland is low. </p><p>Notwithstanding this, Ireland is obliged to comply with the provisions of the Water Framework Directive in relation to the abstraction of water.  This requires as a minimum that we maintain a register of water abstractions and have in place a requirement for prior authorisation for all significant water abstractions.  Existing Irish law in relation to abstractions goes back to 1942 and is not sufficiently comprehensive to address modern day needs.  My Department is currently reviewing these needs and, as set out in the draft River Basin Management Plan, I will be bringing forward proposals to establish a comprehensive and maintained register of water abstractions greater than 25 cubic meters per day and also examining options for developing a proportionate and risk-based framework for the licensing of larger scale abstractions to ensure continued sustainable use of our water resources.</p></reply>

The current SICAP programme will come to an end on 31 December 2017, and the successor programme (SICAP 2) is due to roll out in January 2018. </p>  <p>  My Department has undertaken a number of measures which will assist in strengthening the next iteration of the Programme.  In early 2017, a targeted consultation process was initiated involving national and regional sessions, surveys and a number of focus groups in which feedback was sought from the key stakeholders involved in SICAP.  The consultation process offered a platform to consider how the programme could be refined in order to strengthen it from 2018, and many of the issues raised during this process will be addressed in the new Programme.  Funding for the Programme will be finalised in the context of the annual Estimates process.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Partnership Government also gave a commitment to develop a new Community Development Scheme.  In that regard, a Communities Facilities Scheme, which is targeted at disadvantaged urban and rural areas, but not exclusively so, was  launched on 10   March 2017.  An allocation of &euro;2 million has been made available for the Scheme in Budget 2017.  The funding will relate to capital projects only and is intended to help grass roots community projects get underway or take the next step towards completion.  The Scheme will fund projects that seek to enhance communities, address disadvantage and improve social cohesion at a local level.  Arrangements are currently being made in my Department to issue these funds to the Local Authorities, who will administer this Scheme on behalf of the Local Community Development Committees (LCDCs), in each area.</p>  <p>  The Community Facilities Scheme will operate in a complementary manner with other schemes or programmes being operated in communities, including in particular, the SICAP, RAPID and CL&Aacute;R Programmes, adding value to those and other front-line schemes. It will also seek to address some of the difficulties local community groups face in terms of accessing very often small scale levels of funding to match their own fundraising efforts, in order to get community projects off the ground.</p></reply>

Section 13(2) of the Army Pensions Act, 1923, as amended, provides that &ldquo;Any compensation which may be received from or on behalf of the person alleged to be responsible for the act which caused the wounding may be taken into consideration in fixing the amount of any pension, allowance or gratuity which might be awarded under this Act to or in respect of such person and if such compensation is received after the award of any such pension or allowance the Minister may review the award and, having regard to the amount of such compensation, either terminate or reduce the amount thereof.&rdquo;  The underlying objective of section 13(2) is to take into consideration compensation paid &lsquo;on the double&rsquo; for the same disablement. Compensation of the kind in question would usually result from a civil action for damages against the Minister for Defence, but compensation received from any other source is not excluded.</p>  <p>  In April 1986 the person in question was awarded a disability pension under the Army Pensions Acts in respect of an injury that he sustained while serving in the PDF.  The person in question also instituted civil proceedings in respect of the same injury and was awarded compensation by the High Court.  The disability pension payable was therefore reviewed under the provisions of section 13(2) of the 1923 Act and it was decided to reduce it by the annuity value of the total compensation which he had received.   </p>  <p>  Subsequently, the person in question applied to the High Court for a judicial review of the decision to reduce the disability pension. The High Court quashed the decision to reduce the disability pension and ordered that the matter be considered anew. A fresh review of the disability pension was accordingly undertaken.  All aspects of the case (including, in particular, representations made by his solicitors) were fully considered and in March 1988 it was decided to reduce the disability pension payable by the annuity value of the total compensation received by him.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the disability pension in this case has been properly determined in accordance with the relevant statutory provisions and I do not believe that a further review would be appropriate.</p></reply>

One of the main principles of the Dignity at Work Policy, which was launched in 2015, is that every member of staff has a right to work in an environment free of any form of bullying, harassment, or sexual harassment.  Following its Launch in 2015 the Policy was circulated to and publicised for all staff members in my Department and is now included in the induction pack for all new personnel   . </p>  <p>  In relation to Civilian Employees in my Department the document &ldquo;A Positive Working Environment&rdquo; sets out the policy on harassment, sexual harassment and bullying for State industrial employees. The policy, agreed at National Joint Industrial Council for State Industrial Employees (JIC), is designed to ensure compliance with the codes of practice issued under various pieces of legislation. The policy applies to all State industrial employees including employees on contract. Experience has shown that it has been effective in dealing with issues in the workplace, particularly in resolving issues at local level in accordance with the agreed procedures under the policy. </p>  <p>  It is considered that these arrangements are sufficiently robust to deal with allegations of bullying and harassment in the civilian workplace. All civilian staff, as well as Employing Officers, are fully aware of their responsibilities in this area. On appointment all civilian employees are provided with a Civilian Employee Information Handbook. This Handbook deals with, among other things, Sexual Harassment, Bullying in the Workplace, Grievance Procedures and Dispute Resolution Procedures. Under each of these headings, the Department&rsquo;s policy and the procedures to be followed, should an employee wish to have a particular issue or incident dealt with or investigated, are set out. All Employing Officers are copied with the Handbook which is updated when required. </p>  <p>  A Positive Working Environment - the anti harassment, sexual harassment and bullying policy, is available to all Civilian Staff. An update of this document, the Dignity at Work Policy is currently with the various Trade Unions (circulated at the Joint Industrial Council for State Industrial Employees) for their observations.</p>  <p>  A confidential Counselling support service is also available for all civilian employees.</p>  <p>  A formal grievance procedure is also in place. This code covers all State industrial employees who come under the remit of the JIC, which operates under the aegis of the Workplace Relations Commission. This document is also readily available to all employees and sets out the procedures and options available should an employee wish to pursue a complaint or grievance.   </p>  <p>  The only State body currently under the aegis of the Department of Defence is the Army Pensions Board. The Army Pensions Board is staffed by a civil servant from the Department of Defence.</p>  <p>  In the past five years one case of alleged bullying and harassment has resulted in compensation being paid out to a civilian employee by the Department. The case was settled in 2015 and the terms of the settlement, including the amount of compensation, decreed that it was confidential to the parties involved.</p>  <p>  As regards the procedures in place within the Defence Forces to deal with bullying I would like to reiterate that it is Defence Forces policy that all personnel have a right to be treated with respect, equality and dignity and to carry out their duties free from any form of bullying, harassment or sexual harassment. While military life entails robust and effective military training, such training must, however, take place in a professional service environment that fully respects individual human dignity.  Bullying and harassment of any kind are wrong and are not tolerated within the Defence Forces. They are entirely unacceptable in themselves and wholly incompatible with a successful and modern organisation.     </p>  <p>  All known incidents of such behaviour are properly investigated bearing in mind the need for due process which requires fairness to all parties to the complaint. Through the induction process and general notifications, the non-tolerance of unacceptable behaviour is stressed to all members of the Defence Forces. The formal and informal procedures in force are there to encourage any individual who wishes to make a complaint. Procedures for dealing with complaints of Bullying, Harassment and Sexual Harassment are set out in Defence Forces Regulations. Complaints of unacceptable behaviour can be dealt with at different levels, either in an informal approach or formal manner. The overall aim is to ensure that the complaint is dealt with, in the first instance, at the lowest level possible. Informal complaints can be resolved directly by the complainant with the assistance of a third party if required. Such third party can include any member of the Defence Forces who has the trust and confidence of the complainant. Specially trained Designated Contact Persons (DCPs) are also available to assist complainants.</p>  <p>  The formal procedure requires that a complaint is made in writing. These are dealt with by the military chain of command either through the legal/disciplinary process or by administrative action.</p></reply>
