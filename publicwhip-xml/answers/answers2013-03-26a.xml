This amount includes an allocation of EAFRD funding of &euro;2.94Bn. Since the launch of the RDP expenditure under the programme up to the end 2012 amounted to &euro;3.74bn.<b> </b>This represents close on 77.6% of the total value of the Programme and 83% of the EAFRD amount.  Axes 1 and 2 of the Rural Development Programme are administered by my Department while Axes 3 and 4 are delivered by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government. Details of the allocation and expenditure per measure under the RDP up to the end of 2012 are set out in the table below. This table does not include funds already committed but not as yet claimed.</p><p>The programme, like all national spending, is subject to ongoing budgetary constraints but is configured to maximise all available EU funding. Ireland's draw down rate under the Programme has been among the highest of EU Member States over the lifetime of the current Programme.</p><p>Spending under a number of measures may continue until the end of 2015 and this will provide considerable scope to allow all measures to spend up to their full allocation. Adjustments have already been made to the RDP financial plan and will continue to be made to the end of the Programme in order to achieve the fullest possible draw down of available funds.</p><p><table><tr><th><div>Axis / Measure</div></th><th><div>Total<br /><br />RDP<br /><br />Allocation<br /><br />&#8364;m</div></th><th><div>EAFRD and Exchequer Expenditure<br /><br />2007 &#8211;2012<br /><br />&#8364;m</div></th><th><div>Of which EAFRD spend</div></th><th><div>Of which Exchequer spend</div></th></tr><tr><td><div>AXIS 1 &#8211; Competitiveness</div></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div>Vocational training (REPS)</div></td><td><div>5,675,440</div></td><td><div>7,133,733</div></td><td><div>4,040,626</div></td><td><div>3,093,107</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Installation Aid</div></td><td><div>12,261,081</div></td><td><div>12,892,430</div></td><td><div>6,504,938</div></td><td><div>6,387,492</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Early Retirement</div></td><td><div>219,188,239</div></td><td><div>212,653,617</div></td><td><div>112,687,662</div></td><td><div>99,965,955</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Farm Modernisation</div></td><td><div>154,570,446</div></td><td><div>78,194,859</div></td><td><div>45,671,306</div></td><td><div>32,523,553</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>TOTAL AXIS 1</div></td><td><div>391,695,206</div></td><td><div>310,874,639</div></td><td><div>168,904,532</div></td><td><div>141,970,107</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Axis 2 &#8211; Environment and land management</div></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div>Less Favoured Areas</div></td><td><div>1,617,984,198</div></td><td><div>1,288,821,995</div></td><td><div>708,852,098</div></td><td><div>579,969,897</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Natura 2000</div></td><td><div>528,582,998</div></td><td><div>84,365,076</div></td><td><div>47,134,930</div></td><td><div>37,230,146</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Agri-environment</div></td><td><div>1,922,493,570</div></td><td><div>1,898,093,784</div></td><td><div>1,057,028,093</div></td><td><div>841,065,691</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>TOTAL AXIS 2</div></td><td><div>4,069,060,766</div></td><td><div>3,271,280,855</div></td><td><div>1,813,015,121</div></td><td><div>1,458,265,734</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Axis 3</div></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div>Broadband</div></td><td><div>17,884,000</div></td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>0</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>TOTAL AXIS 3</div></td><td><div>17,884,000</div></td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>0</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Axis 4</div></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div>Competitiveness &#8211; Food Projects.</div></td><td><div>5,000,000</div></td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>0</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Implementing Local Development Strategies &#8211; Quality of Life</div></td><td><div>265,470,511</div></td><td><div>110,674,473</div></td><td><div>72,544,133</div></td><td><div>38,130,340</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Co-operation Projects</div></td><td><div>7,878,000</div></td><td><div>1,902,011</div></td><td><div>1,316,225</div></td><td><div>585,786</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Running of LAGS</div></td><td><div>62,464,000</div></td><td><div>49,506,681</div></td><td><div>31,197,141</div></td><td><div>18,309,540</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>TOTAL AXIS 4</div></td><td><div>340,812,511</div></td><td><div>162,083,165</div></td><td><div>105,057,499</div></td><td><div>57,025,666</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Axis 5 &#8211; Technical Assistance</div></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div>Technical Assistance</div></td><td><div>6,000,000</div></td><td><div>1,441,575</div></td><td><div>720,788</div></td><td><div>720,788</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>OVERALL RDP</div></td><td><div>4,825,452,483</div></td><td><div>3,745,680,234</div></td><td><div>2,087,697,940</div></td><td><div>1,657,982,294</div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

The Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) under the aegis the Minister for Health has overall responsibility for the enforcement of food safety in Ireland.  It carries out this remit through service contracts with my Department and other agencies including the Health Service Executive (HSE), Local Authority Veterinary Service and the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority.</p><p>  All food business operators are already obliged to report any information that indicates the food they have placed on the market may be injurious to human health. This obligation stems from EU food law (Regulation (EC) No 178/2002, the general food law). This regulation is given effect in Ireland by SI No 432 of 2009 (for farmers and for processors of animal-origin foods) and by SI No 747/2007 (for retailers and for processors of non-animal origin food). Significant penalties are set for breaches of this legal requirement.</p><p>  Additionally, processors of animal-origin food approved by my Department have other obligations to report results of microbiological testing.</p><p>  The finding in January by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland of equine-DNA adulteration of frozen beef burgers led to the subsequent findings in Ireland and across Europe of wide-spread contamination of beef products.  As a result, the European Commission has launched a specific co-ordinated control programme to investigate the prevalence of horsemeat contamination in beef products and of the associated presence of residues of the horse medicine phenylbutazone (bute) in horses at slaughter.  Results of this programme will be reported, which will include 50 test results from Ireland.</p><p>  Furthermore, the FSAI and my Department met with representatives from the meat processing, retailing and catering sectors and agreed a protocol for DNA testing of beef products to check for adulteration with horse meat.  The following categories of food are being tested &ndash; pre-packaged beef products on sale to the final consumer or to mass caterers, beef products offered for sale without pre-packaging to consumers or to mass caterers and meat ingredients used in processed beef products. The first two sets of results have already been published by the FSAI.</p><p>  In my report to the D&aacute;il on 14 March I stated that one Irish processor did not inform my Department about test results which detected horsemeat in some consignments of beef from another Member State, apparently because it did not consider that the results concerned the safety of the food.  I consider this non-action to be unacceptable.  Hence one recommendation of the report is that EU food legislation should be changed, to introduce a mandatory requirement on food business operators to notify competent authorities about incidences of mislabelling.  I intend to pursue this at EU level.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-03-26a.20.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013032600059#WRB01200"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 112, 118 and 121 together.</p><p>  The negotiations on the reform of the CAP have made considerable progress across a number of fronts in recent weeks. Following the agreement by the European Council on the Multiannual Financial Framework in early February, the European Parliament two weeks ago agreed its position on the CAP reform package. This was followed last week by the successful adoption by the Council of Agriculture Ministers - by a strong qualified majority - of its General Approach on CAP Reform. The latter, in particular, marked a considerable achievement, taking place as it did against a background of lengthy, intensive negotiations with my Member State colleagues across a range of complex and sensitive issues.</p><p>  The achievement of the Council General Approach is a vitally important development. It means that all three institutions are now ready to move on to the final, so-called 'trilogue', stage of the negotiation process, where the Irish Presidency will represent the Council in discussions with the European Parliament and with the Commission. It also means that the overall target of an inter-institutional political agreement by the end of June remains on schedule.  I am hopeful that all participants across all three institutions will maintain their focus and redouble their efforts so that, together, we can bring the reform negotiations to a conclusion by the end of June.</p><p>  Last week&rsquo;s developments were not only a successful outcome for the Irish Presidency. They also represented a very good outcome for Irish farmers. All through the negotiating process, the key issue from an Irish perspective has been the distribution of direct payments within Member States, otherwise known as internal convergence. In order to avoid the very significant transfers of payments that would result from the Commission&rsquo;s flat-rate proposals, I had proposed an alternative, partial, convergence model based on the principle that Member States should have the flexibility to move away from historically-based systems in a more measured way that respected their individual farming conditions. I am very pleased that the Council endorsed this principle and agreed to include the Irish model in the options available for the distribution of direct payments. This enhances the prospect of a more reasonable level of transfers of payments between farmers than would be the case under the Commission&rsquo;s flat-rate proposal. Of course, this issue still has to be negotiated further, and the reality is that the final outcome will be somewhere between the Commission proposal and the Irish proposal. However, the important point is that the Irish model is at the centre of the negotiations, and I will be working to ensure that the final outcome is as close as possible to this model.</p><p>  I was also pleased with the Council&rsquo;s agreement to my proposals on the greening of direct payments.  These proposals bring the necessary flexibility to the Commission&rsquo;s original proposals, so that farmers can practise sustainable agriculture without overly bureaucratic impediments.  The agreement also addresses Ireland&rsquo;s requirements for a greening payment to be applied as a percentage of each farmer&rsquo;s single payment rather than as a flat rate.</p><p>  Another good outcome is the agreement amongst my Council colleagues to end sugar quotas in 2017. This is a good compromise, as it pulls back substantially from the 2020 end date that had been demanded by many Member States.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-03-26a.23.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013032600059#WRB01500"><p>Following on from the successful restructuring of my Department&rsquo;s local office network, which reduced the number of local offices from 58 to 16, my Department has reviewed the business processes and procedures and, in particular, the administrative support requirements, in its 16 Regional Offices. Arising from this review, the Department has recently introduced a number of significant changes to the procedures in relation to the implementation of controls in the context of the TB eradication programme. In light of this and having regard to the significant efficiencies which have already arisen as a result of the investment made by the Department in IT in recent years, the number of staff required to deliver the service in the local offices has been considerably reduced.  The review concluded that further substantial efficiencies would accrue from the centralisation of administrative support and, in light of this, my Department has decided to centralise this support in one or more centralised office(s).</p><p>  Centralising administrative procedures will enable my Department to reduce the number of administrative staff it requires to support Veterinary Office operations and, accordingly, the cost of providing its services. This is in line with Government policy. In addition, the centralisation of administrative functions will facilitate the re-deployment of staff from the regional offices to other State agencies and, thereby, enable the Government to provide services through these agencies more efficiently.</p><p>  I should emphasise that these changes will not negatively impact upon local access and services for local customers. Frontline services will be fully maintained and public access for all of the Departments stakeholders will continue to be available at the 16 regional offices. The Department vets, inspectors and technical officers will remain in place at these offices to service our clients across all of the schemes that are provided from our Regional Offices.</p><p>  In line with my Department&rsquo;s decision to centralise administrative services, administrative functions have already been transferred out of a number of regional offices (notably, Clonakilty and Limerick), without any negative implications for the provision of services to farmer clients. The administrative staff in the Tipperary office will also be transferred to the Garda vetting office shortly. It is not possible for me at this stage to give any indication of the time-frame for the transfer of the administrative functions out of other regional offices because this will depend on the availability of opportunities to redeploy the staff concerned to support other critical public services. However, I can assure the Deputy that administrative support work in the local offices will not be transferred to a central office unless the staff concerned can be redeployed to other State services. Furthermore, I am satisfied that the centralisation of this work will not result in any diminution of the services provides by the local offices to the farming community.</p></reply>

The Irish Presidency therefore proposed amendments to the Commission text which reflected the balance of opinion among Member States that they should be allowed to decide whether to apply reductions to payments exceeding &euro;150,000.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-03-26a.33.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013032600059#WRB02500"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 116 and 120 together.</p><p>  The Deputy is aware that I have been considering introducing a charge for parking facilities within Howth Fishery Harbour Centre for some time, for the following reasons - :</p><p>- to assist in operating Howth Fishery Harbour Centre on a financially-sound basis</p><p>- to provide a source of revenue for further investments in Fishery Harbour Centre facilities</p><p>- as part of an overall traffic management plan to bring order to what has become a source of concern to the Harbour authorities and the emergency services.</p><p>- in order to maximise the return on this significant State asset</p><p>  As I have said many times, Howth Fishery Harbour Centre is first and foremost a working fishery harbour, one of 6 operated by the State, each of whose primary purpose is to provide facilities and services for the fishing industry and fisheries-related activities.  Financing for the upkeep of those facilities comes from the ring-fenced Fishery Harbour Centres Fund, which is financed solely from the income generated by the Fishery Harbour Centres for use of their facilities.  It is used exclusively for day to day operating, management and development costs and is the only source of revenue available for that purpose.</p><p>  There has been significant capital investment in the Fishery Harbour Centres in recent years, underpinning both the fisheries side and their expanding use for leisure and marine tourism and other maritime enterprises.  Howth has a long tradition in both areas.  In the current economic climate, the State must be fully committed to maximising the return on its investment.</p><p>  Moreover, my Department is required to ensure that the Fishery Harbour Centres are run on a financially sound basis.  With over 500 parking spaces within the boundaries of the Howth Fishery Harbour Centre, it is clear that a significant source of revenue exists that could assist in balancing the books, and providing funding for enhancements that would not otherwise be possible.</p><p>  As well as those directly involved in fishing, there are many other users of the fishery harbour&ndash;harbour business customers, yacht club members, sport fishermen, Dart users, tourists, walkers and many others.  All of those users have to use the parking facilities of Howth Fishery Harbour Centre.</p><p>  This combination of uses and wide range of users of the Harbour brings its own inherent dangers and it is essential that all users are accommodated as far as possible in a safe and secure facility.</p><p>  Traffic and parking management within the Harbour itself has been an issue for some time, particularly in the light of concerns raised about safety and emergency access for the Coastguard, the Lifeboat service, and an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  There have been a number of occasions where the volume of cars in the Harbour and the resultant pressure on parking has led to a situation where emergency access has been seriously compromised.  The Harbour authorities have received specific complaints from elements of the emergency services in that regard.  Fortunately no serious incident has arisen yet.</p><p>  Enabling works and upgrading works have been taking place in order to improve traffic management within the Harbour and a number of additional measures are being considered, only one of which is the introduction of pay parking.  All aspects of health and safety within the Harbour are of course kept under constant review and must be paramount in the management of the Harbour.</p><p>  My officials have consulted with officials of Fingal Council, with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na about this and other related matters, and my Department&rsquo;s engineers have met some of the Harbour&rsquo;s business tenants individually about new traffic management and road markings etc.  My officials also attended a recent Harbour Users Forum where pay parking was on the agenda and heard the views of the harbour users at first hand.</p><p>  The introduction of pay parking at Howth Fishery Harbour Centre was originally examined in detail in 2007 in the context of a proposed Howth Traffic and Parking Management Plan, in conjunction with Fingal County Council.  There was widespread public consultation at that time and all of the various views that were expressed and submissions that were made then are still on file.  I am well aware of and acknowledge their concerns.  I am receiving new correspondence on this matter from a wide range of harbour users as well as those local community, business, residents, sporting or cultural organisations based in Howth, Dublin 13, listed by the Deputy.  I am also aware that there is a website dedicated to countering the proposal.</p><p>  I am reviewing all aspects of the matter at present.  I can assure the Deputy that the views of the various harbour users, the potential earnings, the possible impact on the harbour businesses and recreational users, the impact on the local economy, the impact on overall traffic management within the Fishery Harbour, are all matters that I will take into account in coming to a decision. I can also assure the Deputy and all of the Harbour users in Howth that I am committed to continuing investment in and development of Howth.</p></reply>

I decided on a maximum payment of &euro;4,000 per annum for individual applicants which, on the basis of previous experience in implementing the scheme, indicated that up to 6,500 new participants could be accepted into the scheme.</p><p>  The Agri-environment Options Scheme (AEOS III) will build on the success of the Rural Environment Protection Scheme (REPS) and both AEOS 1 and 2 in delivering an annual payment to farmers in return for farming to high environmental standards.</p><p>  The closing date for receipt of AEOS III applications was Friday December 7 and 9,689 applications have been received by my Department. The initial processing of the applications has been completed and acknowledgement letters have issued to all applicants.  The detailed actions listed in each application are currently being recorded and the approval of applicants will be determined by the following priority selection criteria:</p><p>- applicants within a targeted area of the Boora region of Co. Offaly who select Wild Bird Cover Option B (Grey Partridge) will get first access,</p><p>- Applicants with eligible Natura land will get access next,</p><p>- Applicants with at least 0.5 hectares of Utilisable Agricultural Non-Natura Commonage land rank next,</p><p>- Farm Partnerships,</p><p>- Previous Participation in REPS,</p><p>- Farm Size (Favouring smaller holding) based on the utilisable agricultural area,</p><p>- Location of farms in Less Favoured Areas.</p><p>  This process is well advanced and is expected to be completed shortly. During this data entry process it has been noted that a number of applications either do not contain all the necessary information or the information submitted contains errors. In these cases, officials from my Department are making contact with the applicants concerned to obtain the required information in order for the application to be appropriately assessed. My intention is to complete the selection process as quickly as possible and to notify all applicants of the outcome and of the commencement dates under the scheme in the case of successful applicants.</p><p>  Based on the initial processing of applications approximately 4,500 applications have been submitted under the Commonage/Natura option. In the event that these applications fulfil all eligibility requirements of the scheme, these applicants will gain priority access to the scheme. I also expect that a further 2,000 farmers without designated land will be admitted to the scheme.</p><p>  Applicants should note that they should not undertake any actions listed in their application until approved for participation in the scheme as actions undertaken or expense incurred prior to formal approval will not be eligible for reimbursement.</p></reply>

This would, in the case of several Member States (including Ireland), result in significant transfers between farmers.  I believe there is a need for redistribution but I am concerned that moving to a flat rate as proposed would be harmful for the Irish agricultural sector and the Food Harvest 2020 strategy.</p><p>  The reality here in Ireland is that we are facing two sets of demands on this issue.  On the one hand, there are those farmers on low payments per hectare who are arguing for a larger share of the available funding on the grounds of equity and fairness.  On the other hand, there are those farmers on high payments per hectare, who have invested Single Payment funds in improving the productive capacity of their farms and do not want to move back from this position.  Both sets of demands are understandable and reasonable, but difficult to reconcile. We need a solution that is fair to everyone, which will on the one hand represent a real move away from historic payments, which seriously disadvantage some farmers, but which avoids unreasonably large cuts to those on high payment rates.  This is why I have put forward the approximation model, which would give a Member State like Ireland the flexibility to do this.</p><p>  The key will be to reach a fair compromise, which levels the playing field without putting productive farmers out of business.  As is the case with any negotiation, the final position will be somewhere in between my approach and that of the Commission. I am fighting to ensure that the best possible outcome for all farmers is reached, in a balanced and fair way.</p></reply>

This legislation provides that if an equine animal has not been identified within six months of the date of its birth, or by the 31<sup>st</sup> of December in the year of its birth, whichever date occurs later, then the equine animal cannot be admitted to the food chain. S.I. No 357 of 2011 was amended in September 2012 by S.I. 371 of 2012 in order to strengthen the powers of the Minister in relation to approval of an issuing body for equine passports and prosecutions in relation to equine identification and to make it an offence to forge or tamper with an equine passport.</p><p>  With regard to a single registration system for equidae, the position is that Regulation 504/2004 provides that, in the case of equidae which qualify for registration with a breed society, the passport must be issued by the relevant breed society. I have indicated that this regulation should be amended to provide for passports to be issued by a single Passport Issuing Organisation.  I note that the EU Directorate General for Health and Consumers has indicated in its recently published Action Plan for dealing with the fall-out from the horsemeat issue that it intends to submit a proposal to the Council and European Parliament for the transfer responsibility for the issuing of passports from Passport Issuing Organisations to the competent authorities. A formal Commission proposal is expected in the second half of 2013.</p><p>  On the issue of the transfer of ownership, there is no provision in the EU or national legislation on equine identification for recording the transfer of ownership of equines and my Department is currently considering how best to deal with this issue in the absence of an EU legislative basis. However, my Department is developing a central database of horses which will involve migration of selected data from Passport Issuing Bodies to the Animal Identification and Movement database in the Department.  The intention is that this database may be used, as it develops, to facilitate the recording of changes of ownership.  The system for equines will be similar to the approach used for bovines. However,  the recording system on the equine central database will be designed specifically to reflect the specific regulatory requirements in the equine sector which are somewhat different from those in the bovine sector.</p></reply>

Indeed, it was generally considered that the current quota year has advantages over a system based on the calendar year.  </p><p>  In 2008 the CAP &lsquo;Health Check&rsquo; review agreed to the abolition of milk quotas at the end of the 2014/2015 quota year, and provided for a smooth transition by increasing quota for all Member States in the remaining years.  I have been extremely active in seeking to secure a softer landing for all Member States in the lead-up to milk quota abolition in 2015, but the Commission has resisted attempts to reconsider this issue, as it has resisted attempts to revisit the outcome of the 2008 CAP Health Check in an overall sense.  The Commission&rsquo;s view is supported by a number of Member States, some of whom are firmly against any further adjustment to the Health Check agreement.  The second and final interim report on the soft landing was prepared by the Commission last December, and it proposed no further changes to the quota regime.  </p><p>  As only a minority of Member States is likely to be adversely affected by the current quota restrictions, it would not be possible to secure a qualified majority to agree to an adjustment of the current regime.</p></reply>

These are Food Harvest 2020, Our Ocean Wealth, Steering a New Course &ndash; Strategy for a Restructured, Sustainable and Profitable Irish Seafood Industry 2007-2013, the Seafood Development Programme 2007-2013, the Irish Seafood National Programme 2007-2013, The Rising Tide &ndash; A Review of the Bottom Grown Mussel Sector on the Island of Ireland, and Sea Change &ndash; A Marine Knowledge, Research and Innovation Strategy for Ireland 2007-2013.  These documents set high ambitions for the development of aquaculture, identify various opportunities for achieving those ambitions and propose measures to avail of those opportunities.  Both BIM and Foras na Mara would be guided by these public policy documents in developing their own statements of strategy and in their work programmes.</p><p>  In relation Food Harvest 2020 specifically, that report makes two recommendations in relation to aquaculture.  It recommends that my Department should work with other relevant Departments and State agencies to resolve difficulties related to aquaculture licensing.  Secondly, it recommends that the Marine Institute and BIM should work with industry to research and develop inshore and offshore aquaculture and alternative species on a commercial and profitable scale.  The previous Government committed in July 2010 to implementing the recommendations of Food Harvest 2020 and I am equally committed to that aim.

Following the agreement by the European Council on the Multiannual Financial Framework in early February, the European Parliament two weeks ago agreed its position on the CAP reform package. This was followed last week by the successful adoption by the Council of Agriculture Ministers - by a strong qualified majority - of its General Approach on CAP Reform. The latter, in particular, marked a considerable achievement, taking place as it did against a background of lengthy, intensive negotiations with my Member State colleagues across a range of complex and sensitive issues.</p><p>  The achievement of the Council General Approach is a vitally important development. It means that all three institutions are now ready to move on to the final, so-called &lsquo;trilogue&rsquo;, stage of the negotiation process, where the Irish Presidency will represent the Council in discussions with the European Parliament and with the Commission. It also means that the overall target of an inter-institutional political agreement by the end of June remains very much on schedule.  I am very hopeful that all participants across all three institutions will maintain their focus and redouble their efforts so that, together, we can bring the reform negotiations to a conclusion by the end of June.</p><p>  Last week&rsquo;s developments were not only a successful outcome for the Irish Presidency. They also represented a very good outcome for Irish farmers. All through the negotiating process, the key issue from an Irish perspective has been the distribution of direct payments within Member States, otherwise known as internal convergence. In order to avoid the very significant transfers of payments that would result from the Commission&rsquo;s flat-rate proposals, I had proposed an alternative, partial, convergence model based on the principle that Member States should have the flexibility to move away from historically-based systems in a more measured way that respected their individual farming conditions. I am very pleased that the Council endorsed this principle and agreed to include the Irish model in the options available for the distribution of direct payments. This enhances the prospect of significantly lower transfers of payments between farmers than would be the case under the Commission&rsquo;s flat-rate proposal. Of course, this issue still has to be negotiated further, and the reality is that the final outcome will be somewhere between the Commission proposal and the Irish proposal. However, the important point is that the Irish model is at the centre of the negotiations, and I will be working to ensure that the final outcome is as close as possible to this model. </p><p>  I was also pleased with the Council&rsquo;s agreement to my proposals on the greening of direct payments.  These proposals bring the necessary flexibility to the Commission&rsquo;s original proposals, so that farmers can practise sustainable agriculture without overly bureaucratic impediments.  The agreement also addresses Ireland&rsquo;s requirements for a greening payment to be applied as a percentage of each farmer&rsquo;s single payment rather than as a flat rate.</p><p>  Another good outcome is the agreement amongst my Council colleagues to end sugar quotas in 2017. This is a good compromise, as it pulls back substantially from the 2020 end date that had been demanded by many Member States.  I might also mention that, in the case of voluntary coupled support, Ireland will have the option of using up to 7% of our national envelope for such payments.  In addition, the Council agreed to the implementation of new Areas of Natural Constraint and to a change in the proposed reference year for the establishment of payment entitlements.</p></reply>

Coillte is also subject to the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies.

First put in place in 1983, it has been subject to reviews every 10 years, and is currently undergoing a reform process the important elements of which are expected to conclude during the Irish Presidency.</p><p>  The CFP is essentially three separate pieces of legislation, a basic policy regulation, a regulation on the Common Organisation of the Market (CMO) both of which are supported and underpinned by a separate financial instrument the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF).  </p><p>  At the EU Council of Fisheries Ministers in June last year the Danish Presidency were successful in obtaining agreement for a general approach on the CMO and a partial general approach on the basic regulation. At that time it was not possible to achieve political agreement on a way forward for some of the more contentious issues in the basic regulation including dealing with the discard issue.</p><p>  At the October 2012 Fisheries Council the Cypriot Presidency secured agreement on a &#8220;partial&#8221; general approach on the financial instrument the EMFF. However, the PECHE Committee vote on the EMFF has now been delayed until the end of May 2013, and it is considered unlikely given the timeframe that trilogues can commence during the Irish Presidency. </p><p>  At February&#8217;s EU Fisheries Council, I was successful in brokering a political agreement on the outstanding issues from June 2012 on the Basic Regulation  including for the introduction of an EU wide discards ban. </p><p>  February&#8217;s decision in reaching a Common General Approach on all aspects of a reformed basic policy regulation, is important in that it now allows the Irish Presidency, on behalf of the Council, to engage directly with the European Parliament and Commission with a view to reaching overall political agreement on the reformed Common Fisheries Policy during the Irish Presidency.   </p><p>  However, it is worth noting that what was agreed in February is the Councils approach, the European Parliament has also published its&#8217; position which differs in many respects. Some of the differences are minor and it can be expected that political compromise can be achieved relatively easily on these.</p><p>  However there are significant differences of emphasis expressed by the Parliament on some key issues such as the discards ban, arrangements for regionalisation and achieving Maximum Sustainable Yield. Achieving a political agreement between the Council and Parliament on these issues will be a major challenge. </p><p>  A first round of trilogues with Parliament (and European Commission) has taken place on the Common organisation of the market and a negotiation mandate is being prepared for a second round. </p><p>  The trilogues on the Basic Regulation has commenced and there is an intensive programme of meetings arranged for the coming weeks. </p><p>The <b><i>timetable for the Reform</i></b>   is changing on a regular basis. Latest indications are as follows:</p><p>- Basic Regulation: A Council General Approach was finalised at February Fisheries Council. The first trilogues with the EU Parliament took place on the 19<sup>th</sup>   March and a second meeting is being held today with further meetings scheduled. The aim is to have final agreement in June.</p><p>- CMO: The European Parliament has a first reading position, Council have agreed a general approach.  A first round of trilogues took place on 27<sup>th</sup> of February and a  mandate for a second round has been prepared. The aim is to have a final agreement in April <i>.</i></p><p>- EMFF: Following an agreed partial general approach at October Council, the EU PECHE Committee vote is scheduled for late  May, 2013.</p></reply>

Information received in relation to alleged illegal activities in this State is taken seriously and investigated as appropriate by my Department and in certain cases by the Gardai. It must also be noted however that some claims have been made in the public domain in relation to this issue which, when examined by my Department, did not stand up to close scrutiny or warrant further investigation.</p><p>  While my Department does not comment on ongoing investigations, appropriate corrective action is taken if non-compliances are detected. I can advise that during 2011-2012 the Department issued Compliance Notices to two horse slaughter plants under its supervision. This led to temporary suspension of activities while corrective measures were put in place. In addition the approvals of one organisation to maintain a stud book and issue horse passports were revoked during 2012. </p><p>  As the equine mislabelling investigation progressed a separate but parallel investigation was conducted on horse slaughter plants and associated horse traceability. In addition, certain allegations continued to be made that improper practices relating to the availability and presentation of passports at point of slaughter and export were taking place. In this context I decided, with the agreement of the County Managers concerned, that my Department would take direct control over two equine slaughter plants which had hitherto operated under local authority supervision. Following the discovery on 8<sup>th</sup>  March 2013 of irregularities related to identification of horses presented for slaughter at one of these plants, the animals concerned were humanely slaughtered and destroyed and the company has since been suspended from operations. This matter is under ongoing investigation.</p><p>  Under EU law, responsibility for compliance with food safety and traceability requirements rests in the first instance with food business operators (FBOs). This is augmented by official controls, applied at different stages in the food supply chain. My Department implements official controls in relation to horse identification at marts and other sales venues, in abattoirs under its supervision and at points of entry to the country. </p><p>  All equines (which include horses, ponies and donkeys) are required to be identified in accordance with EU and national legislation.  Equines issued with a passport after 1 July 2009 must have a corresponding microchip implanted by a veterinarian, which is recorded in the passport and creates a link between the passport and the animal. The passport includes information on any veterinary medicines administered to equines.  An equine for slaughter for human consumption must be accompanied to the slaughterhouse by its passport and the information on the passport determines whether the animal can be slaughtered for human consumption. Horses treated with certain veterinary medicines such as phenylbutazone, known in the industry as &#8216;bute&#8217;, are permanently excluded from the human food chain in order to protect public health and the passport of the horse in question is endorsed by the prescribing veterinary practitioner to this effect. </p><p>  My Department has detailed procedures for the slaughter of horses in abattoirs under its supervision and has communicated these and the checks required both to its staff and the business operators. It has liaised with passport issuing agencies in Ireland and has developed protocols to allow abattoir operators to check the details of passports with these agencies to seek to ensure that they are valid and that only those horses eligible for slaughter are slaughtered. Where forged or tampered passports accompanying horses to slaughter are detected, it is the policy that such animals are destroyed and removed from the food chain.</p><p>  Ongoing vigilance is maintained in relation to official controls in this area. In that connection, the European Communities (Equine) (Amendment) Regulations, S.I. No. 371/2012,<b></b>  introduced recently, provide for the updating of S.I. No. 357/2011 (European Communities (Equine) Regulations 2011) to strengthen the powers of the Minister in relation to approval of an issuing body for equine passports, authorised officers and prosecutions in relation to equine identification.</p><p>  My Department is establishing a centralized equine database. The intention is that this database will be used at abattoirs to assist in verifying the authenticity of horse passports for the equine presented and to record its date of slaughter.</p></reply>

To start with, the European Council agreement on 7/8 February on the next EU multiannual financial framework secures the necessary funding for the continuation of a strong CAP.  Moreover, the agreement last week of the 27 Member States in the EU Council of Ministers represents an important stepping stone to securing final agreement on this reform.  We are now on target to achieving our June goal of full political agreement between the three institutions of the EU &ndash; the EU Commission, the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament. </p><p>  The four main proposals agreed last week cover the full breadth of the CAP and reflect the Irish priorities of sustainable intensification of production, environmental stewardship and the maintenance of a vibrant rural economy. I am especially pleased to note the progress made in relation to the internal convergence of direct payments, the greening of direct payments and the future of the sugar quota regime. On internal convergence, we have secured the required flexibility from Member States that allows the Irish model of partial convergence to be included in the options available for the distribution of direct payments. On greening, we have ensured that the payment may be a percentage of each farmer&rsquo;s individual payment rather than a flat rate, as well as negotiating a difficult and complex compromise on the implementation of the three greening criteria proposed by the Commission. And on sugar quotas, we have secured an earlier abolition of the regime than originally sought by most Member States.</p><p>  While last week&rsquo;s agreement marks only a step on the road to the ultimate goal of full political agreement between the three institutions by the end of June, I am looking forward to building on the momentum created by last week&rsquo;s decisions to secure that objective.  And this will be good for European farmers and for Irish farmers.</p></reply>

The shares are held by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and myself.  As the Minister with responsibility for forestry, there are a number of powers assigned to me under the Forestry Act 1988. I also respond to Parliamentary Questions on policy matters relating to Coillte. As a State owned body, Coillte is also subject to the Department of Finance &#8216;<i>Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies</i>  &#8217; under which it is obliged to provide information and confirmation to both Ministers in relation to the governance and activities of the company.  As the company is engaged in forestry activities such as harvesting, it is also subject to the provisions of the Forestry Act 1946, the operation of which falls within the remit of my Department.</p><p>  In relation to the possible sale of its harvesting rights, as a member of the Government, I have been involved in the decision making in relation to the State Asset Disposal programme, of which the proposed sale of Coillte harvesting rights is one element.  Further to the Government decision that a concession for the harvesting rights to Coillte&#8217;s forests be considered for sale, my Department has been involved in the consideration process in conjunction with NewERA and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the purpose of which is to identify the forestry assets involved, determine their value and consider the range of issues associated with a possible sale of the harvesting rights.  Coillte has been integral to this process through the provision of data and relevant background information.</p><p>  I am briefed by my officials on an ongoing basis as to the progress of the analysis.

This includes a special allocation of &euro;100 million, over the full period, negotiated in the final stages of the talks. </p><p>  The MFF provides for flexibility regarding the co-financing rates for Pillar 2 support measures and a number of different rates have been incorporated into the proposal. A general co-financing rate of 53% is proposed but this rate may rise to a maximum of 80% for measures such as farm and business development, co-operation activities, Leader projects, and other measures. Environmental type measures may be co-funded up to 75%. </p><p>  The amount of exchequer funding that will be required to draw down the available EU funding will depend firstly on the types of measures that will be included in the Programme and secondly on the co-financing rate that is agreed with the EU Commission for these measures. As the Programme is in the course of being developed at present, no decisions have yet been taken on these issues. It is too early therefore to confirm the level of exchequer funding that will be required for the next round  and this must await finalisation of the new programme.</p></reply>

It is listed in Annex I of the EU Birds Directive, which provides a legislative framework for the conservation of the species. Six Special Protection Areas (SPAs) have been designated under the Birds Directive for the protection of the species in Ireland. </p><p>  The Hen Harrier Working Group was established in 2006 and comprised representatives from the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) of the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, the Forest Service of my Department, landowners and forestry interest groups. A Management Protocol for Hen Harrier SPAs was agreed by the group in March 2007. </p><p>  In 2008, however, the European Commission initiated infringement proceedings against Ireland on foot of complaints received in relation to the protocol. Following further discussions with the Commission on the issue, the Hen Harrier Protocol was suspended in February 2010, and a review initiated with NPWS. However, the scientific basis of the protocol continued to be applied on a case-by-case basis to individual applications.</p><p>  In mid-2011, the Forest Service commenced operation of a procedure agreed with NPWS for the 2011/2012 planting season. This procedure permitted afforestation on certain types of habitats, up to a set maximum level for each SPA, calculated based on the cumulative effects of existing and approved afforestation and windfarms. Full details of this procedure were announced and a working document circulated to all stakeholders in July of 2011. </p><p>  This procedure ceased to operate at the end of the 2011/12 planting season. Due to concerns raised by the European Commission regarding SPA management and within the context of the decline of the population in the SPAs NPWS have initiated the development of a Threat Response Plan (TRP) under Section 39 of S.I. 477 of 2011. This plan will set out measures necessary to preserve, maintain or re-establish a sufficient diversity and area of habitats for the species. NPWS will consult in relation to this Plan.  </p><p>  Forestry, both afforestation and the management of the existing estate, will form a significant element of the TRP. Pending the completion of the TRP, the Forest Service cannot make a determination on the potential impact of afforestation projects on Hen Harriers within the SPA. Nor is it feasible for an individual landowner to provide the level of detail required to enable the Forest Service to make this determination. As such, the Forest Service is not in a position to approve any afforestation projects within the SPA at this time. This position was notified to Stakeholders in January of this year.</p></reply>

However my Department plays an important role in the labelling of food together with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI).</p><p>  In my capacity as Chairman of the EU Agricultural Council I have, together with my ministerial colleagues and the EU Commission, given a high priority to food labelling issues. Consumers should rightly expect not to be misled by inaccurate labelling and must have confidence in knowing what they are eating. Ireland will continue to give leadership in this area and will work with our EU partners to strengthen consumer assurance measures, including more accurate labelling requirements as set out in the Food Information for the Consumer (FIC) Regulation (1169/2011/EC).</p><p>  This legislation extended explicit compulsory origin labelling requirements to meats other than beef, with the detailed rules to be adopted in implementing acts by 13 December 2013, following an impact assessment by the Commission.  </p><p><i>General Food Labelling Rules</i></p><p>  Food labelling used to inform consumers of the properties of pre-packaged food is governed by EU rules. The most important labelling rule is that the consumer should not be misled.</p><p>  The FIC regulation also adopts rules on compulsory labelling where the origin or place of provenance of a food is given and where it is not the same as its primary ingredient.  Insofar as meat as an ingredient is concerned, these rules are subject to the adoption of implementing acts, which must take account of an impact assessment to be carried out by the Commission. As a result of the recent incidents of horsemeat being discovered in beef burgers and other beef products the Commission have now agreed to bring forward their work on this aspect of the regulation to September this year.    </p><p><i>Beef Labelling Rules</i></p><p>  In general, all fresh, frozen or minced beef marketed in the EU (with the exception of offal) is subject to a mandatory system of origin traceability and origin labelling. The purpose of these rules is to ensure that beef on sale can be traced back to the animal or group of animals from which it came. </p><p>  There are two elements to the  beef labelling regime which apply to all parts of the supply chain; the compulsory system, which requires food business operators to label their beef products (unless cooked or processed) with certain prescribed information up to and including the point of sale to the consumer; and the voluntary system, which covers any other labelling claim that processors or retailers wish to make concerning the origin, characteristics or production methods of the beef they are supplying. The claims made on product labels, marketing material or point of sale notices must be clear and cannot be misleading. </p><p><i>Formed meat</i></p><p>  Also in the FIC regulation (Annex VI) in the case of meat products, meat preparations which may give the impression that they are made of a whole piece of meat, but actually consist of different pieces combined together by other ingredients, including food additives and food enzymes or by other means, shall bear the words &#8220; formed meat&#8221; on the label. </p><p><i>Traceability</i></p><p>  The identification and registration of cattle, sheep, pigs, poultry and equines are also governed by EU Regulations and these Regulations have been transposed into national law. </p><p>  The Department&#8217;s Animal Identification and Movement (AIM) database is a generic system that records identification and movement data on cattle, sheep, goats and pigs. The AIM system was developed using Internet-based technology and the majority of interactions with the system are electronic transactions. Work is already advanced on the development of a central database for equines on the AIM system. The AIM system is integrated with the Department&#8217;s corporate systems to record customer data (CCS) and animal health data (AHCS).  The AHCS database holds a record of persons registered as keepers of the different animal species, including equine animals.  </p><p>  The Department is introducing a range of measures to improve traceability systems in the equine sector and is liaising with passport issuing agencies in Ireland in this regard. Protocols to allow abattoir operators to cross check the details of passports with these agencies have been developed, aimed at ensuring that only those horses eligible for slaughter are slaughtered. The Department is also developing a central database of horses which will involve migration of selected data from passport issuing agencies. The database will be populated with information provided from the databases maintained by the agencies, by the Department from records obtained at slaughter plants and knackeries and by local authorities in respect of records maintained at appropriate slaughter plants. The intention is that this database will be used at abattoirs to assist in verifying the authenticity of the passport for the equine presented and to record its date of slaughter.</p><p><i>Pigmeat </i></p><p>  Under the National Pig Identification and Tracing System (NPITS) all pig herds are centrally registered,  all pigs being moved are identified (by means of tag or slap mark) and accompanied by movement documents, and all movements are recorded on a centrally managed database.  Thus the movement of all pigs from farm to factory and to any destination in between is fully traceable.</p><p><i>Poultry</i></p><p>  All poultry keepers are required to register with my Department. Poultry operators are subject to a wide range of EU and domestic legislation and are monitored by inspectors from my Department. Given the vertical nature of the poultry meat sector, most birds are reared under contract to processors. The processors supply the day-old birds in the first instance. The subsequent movement of broilers back to the processing facility is strictly controlled. Furthermore, there is an ongoing Department veterinary presence in poultry plants and this, together with inspections at farm level, underpins a strong domestic regime. </p></reply>

No. 230 of 2006) and the Bass (Restriction on Sale) Regulations 2007 (S.I. No. 367 of 2007). The complete ban for the commercial fishing of sea bass applies to Irish fishing vessels in all areas.   </p><p>  In accordance with the provisions of EU Council Regulation 812/2004 (laying down measures concerning incidental catches of cetaceans in fisheries and amending regulation No 88/98),  the second year of an independent dedicated observer programme of cetacean bycatch in Irish pelagic trawl fisheries was completed in 2012. This covered the 200 mile EEZ around Ireland. A total of 201 days at sea have been carried out as part of this programme across a range of pelagic trawl fisheries from August 2010 to March 2012 and no cetacean bycatch or significant bycatch event of other protected species has been observed as part of the programme. In addition to the independent observer programme, the Irish Sea Fisheries Board (BIM) and Marine Institute (MI) carry out onboard observer work as part of technical trials and surveys under the EU Data Collection Framework (DCF). Figures combined from these programmes show that no cetacean bycatch was observed in 57 days at sea onboard Midwater otter trawl (OTM) vessels targeting small pelagic fish, 168 days at sea onboard Midwater pair trawlers targeting small pelagic fish nor 48 days onboard Midwater pair trawlers targeting large pelagic fish (albacore tuna) in 2011. Apart from 4 common dolphins observed as bycatch by an OTM research vessel targeting small pelagic fish in 2006, no cetacean bycatch incidences have occurred in 703 days of observations onboard Irish pelagic trawlers since 2005.  Data compiled by Ireland and the UK since monitoring commenced in 2005 have demonstrated that cetacean bycatch incidents are very rare in pelagic trawling operations for small fish (mackerel, herring, horse mackerel etc.).    The EU legislation specifically deals with cetaceans in fisheries and does not cover other mammals.  Overall responsibility for marine mammals rests with the National Parks and Wildlife Service of the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.</p></reply>

They also form an important part of the local environment from the point of view of bio-diversity, wildlife, amenities and economic returns e.g. tourism. However, there is a substantial risk of land abandonment as under-grazing become more of a problem. </p><p>  Under-grazing leads to an increase in ineligible land under Direct Aid and Agri-Environment Schemes and leads to risk of financial corrections being imposed by EU Commission. It is vital, therefore, to maintain the commonages in GAEC, or where there is under-grazing, to return the habitat to GAEC. It is my stated aim that this will be achieved by working with the farmers directly managing the lands, relevant State Agencies, the farming organisations and all other interested stakeholders.</p><p>  I readily acknowledge that it will not be an easy task, but it is achievable if we all work in a co-operative basis. If action is not taken now, the areas will continue to deteriorate and will lead to more land abandonment. If this is allowed to happen, we will lose a valuable resource from the point of view of farming, rural economy, bio-diversity and wildlife. While grazing is the only method of managing these lands, the task facing us is how to ensure that these grazing levels are appropriate to the individual commonages.</p><p>  In order to ensure that we achieve this objective, as already stated, we need the input of individual shareholders. Grazing plans, at the level of each commonage, will allow for greater flexibility for shareholders and will enable the active farmers to increase their stock to cater for dormant and inactive persons. It will be matter for agreement between the shareholders &ndash; as was always the case &ndash; to decide how best to reach the stocking levels. Professional assistance will be required, in particular where the commonage has been damaged by under-grazing.     </p><p>  The Grazing Plan will have to cater the traditional farming methods for the area, with provision made for sheep and other animals, such as cattle, providing that they are appropriate to the habitat. An appropriate time-scale will have to be put in place but the Plan should include the incremental steps to achieve GAEC. The whole concept will be output driven, in that the assessment of the Plans will be based on whether the commonage is in GAEC or not or whether the appropriate progress has been achieved.  </p><p>  Apart from ensuring that the Grazing Plan is valid, there are a number of other complications, including:</p><p>- Dormant shareholders &ndash; in the majority of cases, these persons are no longer farming;</p><p>-  Current claimants on the commonages, who do not farm or manage the lands. The issue of whether the latter claimants will continue to be eligible for payment will have to be examined.   </p><p>  There are other issues that will need to be considered. These include the fact that many commonage habitats have been significantly damaged by under-grazing, with resulting problems that must be addressed including land abandonment, spread of scrub and invasive species.</p></reply>

The outcome of one such meeting was the Government decision in February 2012 that consideration would be given to the sale of some assets of Coillte (excluding the sale of land).  The exclusion of the sale of land from that process was to address the industry and public concerns expressed to me and my colleagues and concurred with the views of Government.</p><p>  A more recent cabinet meeting resulted in the decision by the Government last summer that a concession for the harvesting rights to Coillte&rsquo;s forests be considered for sale.  Further to this decision, officials of my Department, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and NewERA, in conjunction with Coillte, are examining the financial and other implications of developing the potential of Coillte&rsquo;s forest assets. This work encompasses the identification of the forestry assets involved, the determination of their value and the consideration of a number of issues associated with the proposed sale of the harvesting rights. All of this work is being undertaken to inform the consideration of the Government on the sale of harvesting rights.

Substantial work has been undertaken to date on the identification of the forestry assets involved, the determination of their value and the consideration of a number of issues associated with the proposed sale of the harvesting rights. This whole process is a very complex one and it is not possible at this stage to pre-empt the outcome of the analysis or to give an estimate of the possible net proceeds.  As I have said previously, the Government will proceed with caution in relation to this matter and no final decision has been taken, as yet.</p><p>  As part of the process, a number of detailed financial, technical and other specialist reports were prepared for Coillte, by external specialist consultancy bodies, in full consultation with the Board of Coillte and its executive management.  As Coillte is a commercial company trading in a competitive environment, matters relating to the performance of its various businesses and its portfolio are commercially sensitive, and it is therefore not appropriate, at this point in time, to make public the analysis conducted to date.</p><p>  NewERA, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and my Department are considering the report by Peter Bacon and Associates, commissioned by IMPACT, containing an &#8220;<i>Assessment of the Consequences of the proposed Sale of Coillte&#8217;s Timber Harvesting Rights &#8211; 10 January 2013</i>&#8221; and the report by EPS Consulting commissioned by the Irish Timber Council on &#8220;<i>The impacts on the sawmill sector arising from the proposed sale of Coillte&#8217;s harvesting rights</i>  &#8221;.   Both of these reports provide useful background and insight to the concerns of the Coillte Unions and the Irish Timber Council, as expressed at the meetings with the respective groups, and contribute to the consideration process.</p><p>  The analysis is ongoing as it is essential that any decision is based on the most accurate, comprehensive analysis possible.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-03-26a.160.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013032600062#WRE01500"><p>Consumer confidence and trust is critical to preserving and securing employment throughout the Irish beef supply chain, including the processing stage. My chief concern since the beginning of this controversy has been to fully restore consumer confidence in Irish beef products and thereby limit the potential impact of food fraud on employment levels in the processing industry. </p><p>  The fact that the official control system in Ireland uncovered the fraudulent mislabelling of certain beef products and the manner in which we have addressed the issue demonstrates that Ireland is at the forefront of control regimes. In time and when the issue is fully addressed at EU level, I am confident that our handling of the matter will ultimately enhance the quality reputation of Irish food products.</p><p>  We have provided decisive leadership on the issue at European level and taken effective action at national level with a view to reassuring consumers and safeguarding employment in the beef supply chain. These additional measures include: </p><p>- A positive release programme for horsemeat destined for the food chain to run for an initial period of one month with a subsequent assessment to inform future policy direction;</p><p>- A DNA testing protocol agreed with the industry to check beef authenticity, over and above the EU DNA testing programme. I will pursue this issue in Brussels to ensure that a level playing field exists as regards controls applying to EU food production; </p><p>- I also intend to pursue at EU level the introduction of a number of changes in relation to labelling regulations, such as provisions covering intermediate labels and reporting of mislabelling incidences, as well as practical steps on the use of security features and more detail on commercial documentation accompanying consignments of beef.</p><p>  On overseas markets, I requested Bord Bia to work with the industry in explaining the facts of the situation in our beef markets worldwide. Bord Bia commissioned research in the domestic and important export markets to gauge consumer reaction to beef mislabelling and the likely impact on purchasing behaviour regarding processed beef product. The findings showed a high level of awareness of the issue but, despite a significant decline in UK retail sales of frozen burgers in the latest 4-week period up to 17 February, sales of products in this category are expected to recover because of their affordability, convenience and ease of preparation. The surveys also found that international opinion of Irish beef remains positive with little association between adulteration and Irish beef products in particular. Instead, adulteration was seen as affecting European processed beef generally and consequently no decline in volume sales of Irish product in the fresh beef category is anticipated.</p><p>  To date, apart from some temporary suspensions of operations, one beef processing plant has ceased operating as a result of the recent horsemeat incident. The Department of Enterprise, Jobs and Innovation, which maintains an early warning system for redundancies, has not received any information to indicate that the meat processing sector is making staff redundant on a temporary or permanent basis. </p></reply>

This proposal allows Member States, as an add-on and not an alternative, to flat rate or partial convergence, to use up to 30% of the national ceiling for top-up payments to farmers on hectares up to the national average farm size (32 hectares in Ireland) or up to 30 hectares.</p><p>  I am open to considering whether it would be of benefit to Ireland to avail of this option.  However, I do not believe we should rush a decision on this option.  The agreement last week established a Council position for opening negotiations with the European Parliament on this and all other elements of CAP reform.  Many elements of that agreement may be changed in the course of these negotiations and we need to see the final outcome on all aspects of the direct payments regime before we can take informed decisions on what is the best course for Ireland. I will of course consult widely before taking any decisions on this matter.  </p></reply>

The EU Commission&rsquo;s proposal was to abandon quotas from September 2015.  In discussions at the Council of Agriculture Ministers, it emerged that Member States were deeply divided on the issue between a group of Member States, including Ireland, who favoured early abolition and another group who wished to extend quotas to 2020 and beyond.  As President of the Council, I made a compromise proposal, that garnered the support of a large majority of Member States, to extend the quota regime for a further two years until 30 September 2017.  </p><p>  The European Parliament is in favour of extending quotas to 2020.  The Council is now well placed to enter into trilogue discussions between the EU Commission and the Parliament on the future of sugar quotas in the EU.</p></reply>

I have repeatedly called on the Bahraini Government to demonstrate its commitment to upholding human rights and to implement in full the recommendations of the Bahraini International Commission of Inquiry. The Commission has made specific recommendations which set out the way forward for Bahrain in terms of commitments in the areas of political dialogue, rule of law, human rights, and refraining from excessive violence. I am particularly concerned that the Bahraini authorities ensure that fundamental rights in relation to freedom of expression, and peaceful assembly and association, are fully respected.    I have made clear in this House on a number of occasions my view that all charges against the medical professionals should have been dropped. Given the great concerns and doubts which have surrounded the case of the medics from the start, and particularly in light of the well-documented reports of ill-treatment to which many of those originally detained were subject, it is my view that the Bahraini Government should consider exercising clemency and releasing the imprisoned medical professionals. This would also be very much in the wider interests of promoting urgently needed reconciliation within Bahrain.</p><p>  At the same time, I welcome the fact that there has been some progress in relation to political dialogue with the main opposition parties agreeing to meet with the Bahraini government within a process of national dialogue, which re-commenced last month. It is important that all sides engage constructively in this dialogue, with a view to furthering reconciliation and reform within Bahrain.    </p><p>  I have conveyed our concerns on human rights issues at every suitable opportunity with the Bahraini authorities and will continue to do so. Officials in my Department also regularly convey these serious concerns to the Bahraini Ambassador in London; and Ireland&rsquo;s Ambassador in Riyadh, who is accredited to Bahrain, has raised these issues directly with the authorities there on every appropriate occasion, including most recently with the Foreign Minister while the Ambassador was in Bahrain over the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day period. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-03-26a.190.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013032600062#WRE03600"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 171 and 172 together.</p><p>  Finance Bill 2013 includes a section on the Living City Initiative which proposes to introduce a scheme of tax incentives focusing on the regeneration of the historic centres of some of our main cities. The scheme which will be introduced by Ministerial order, will apply in the first instance on a pilot basis to specified regeneration areas in Waterford and Limerick.</p><p>  My Department has prepared an information note on this incentive which was published on the Department's website on 13 February last. The historic centres of some of our cities have suffered for a long time from gradual depopulation and the relocation of family homes and businesses to the suburbs, particularly during the period of the Celtic Tiger. These centres have also suffered greatly from the general economic downturn of the past few years. While I am not suggesting that this scheme is capable on its own of reversing that trend, I am convinced that it has a part to play. </p><p>  The particular focus of the scheme is as follows: to encourage people back to the centres of Irish cities to live in historical buildings, in particular Georgian houses; and to encourage the regeneration of the retail heartland of central city business districts.</p><p>  I indicated in my budget speech in December last year that I would examine proposals for a targeted incentive for already identified regeneration areas. The tax relief that will apply under this scheme will operate for five years from the date of commencement. However, it is my intention that before it begins, the scheme will be subject to an <i>ex ante </i>  cost benefit analysis and, subject to a positive outcome from the analysis, I will seek EU approval under State Aid rules for this initiative to be commenced for Limerick and Waterford cities. </p><p>  There are two strands to the scheme. The first involves a tax relief for the refurbishment or conversion of Georgian houses for residential purposes. The relief will only apply to owner occupiers and not for rented residential accommodation. It is not a section 23 provision, which was relief for investors. </p><p>  The second strand is a scheme of accelerated industrial buildings allowances for the conversion and refurbishment of retail premises although other business services will also be allowed where the premises is a Georgian building. In such cases the commercial element will be confined to the ground floor or basement with a residential element upstairs. The allowance is at a rate of 15% per annum for six years and 10% in year seven and is subject to the normal balancing charges of allowances if disposed of within that time period. I have not yet decided on the exact boundaries of the regeneration areas in these cities but I will be consulting with my Government colleagues and the relevant local authorities beforehand before I make any final decision.</p><p>  I hope these reliefs will help to restore some of these inner city areas to their former glory. The prevalence of Georgian houses is a particular characteristic of the built environment of many Irish cities. While some of these Georgian buildings have fallen into a state of disrepair and dereliction, my colleague, the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, and I have been exploring ways in which to promote and support the regeneration of these city centres. This pilot scheme is a targeted initiative which is aimed specifically at Georgian areas and I do not intend to go beyond this at this stage. </p><p>  The reliefs I am introducing are an attempt to encourage people back into the cities to raise their families and if possible to operate their businesses from there. It will not be possible to revitalise these inner city areas without this happening. Pobal, the State agency that supports local communities, has developed a sophisticated index which measures deprivation in different local areas across Ireland. Taking into account the deprivation statistics from the 2011 census, both Limerick and Waterford scored as the most disadvantaged of our major cities. Furthermore unemployment rates in these cities are also the highest, significantly worse than the national average. Both have their own unique problems regarding unemployment and social problems and for these reasons I have selected them alone for the pilot phase of this initiative.</p></reply>

The use of an external service provider has arisen in the context of additional work associated with the roll out of a new tax.  The outsourcing of peak call handling in respect of the LPT will ensure that skilled Revenue staff can continue to provide the necessary customer service to meet their long term, on-going demands and commitments in relation to the strategic priority of maintaining and improving levels of tax and duty compliance.</p><p>  The &euro;4.9 million figure quoted by the Deputy does not represent the estimate of the cost of the outsourced call centre service.  This figure was Revenue's initial estimate of the total cost of providing a telephone call service using both internal and external resources.  The nature of the contract is that the external cost will depend on the volume of calls handled, but I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that it is expected to be very much lower than the figure quoted by the Deputy.</p><p>  The proposal to address the simpler LPT queries through the outsourcing of limited call services offers a flexible, scalable response to an unpredictable demand.  It will also provide assurance that the introduction of LPT will not damage Revenue's overall capacity to deliver for the Exchequer and for the Irish people, an important consideration at any time and vital in the current economic circumstances.</p></reply>

This legislation provides for tax relief for health expenses incurred in the provision of health care.  Health care is defined for the purposes of that legislation as the prevention, diagnosis, alleviation or treatment of an ailment, injury, infirmity, defect or disability and includes care received by a woman in respect of pregnancy.  Health care does not include routine ophthalmic or dental treatment.  The section provides that tax relief must be either for the costs of the services of a practitioner, defined as a person registered on the register established under the Medical Practitioners Act 2007, or diagnostic procedures carried out on the advice of a practitioner, which includes &ldquo;physiotherapy or similar treatment prescribed by a practitioner&rdquo;.  Eligibility for tax relief is limited to expenses relating to treatment considered necessary and appropriate by a qualified practitioner.</p><p>  Section 469 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 consolidated all previous legislation pertaining to relief for health expenses, in particular section 12 of Finance Act 1967 which introduced the relief in the first instance.  This section also required that physiotherapy or similar treatment be prescribed by a practitioner before qualifying for relief.  This requirement has, therefore, been part of the qualifying criteria since the introduction of relief for health expenses and I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that guidance and instructions to staff have remained unchanged in this regard.</p><p>  For 2010 the cost of tax relief for health expenses was &euro;127 million and was availed of by 36,000 individuals who had sufficient income to benefit from a claim.  There is no specific breakdown in these figures of the costs related to physiotherapy.</p><p>  If self-referral for physiotherapy were allowed, an estimate of the additional cost would be unquantifiable, but, undoubtedly, it would increase the overall cost of health expenses relief to the Exchequer.  While the Government supports measures to lower the cost of medical treatment which should in turn lower the costs of health care provision by the State, an extension of the relief along the lines proposed would inevitably lead to calls for other treatments to similarly qualify for relief, which would greatly increase the overall cost of the scheme.</p><p>  I would point out that this issue was raised during the debates in the Seanad on Finance Bill 2013 during which I agreed to re-examine the matter during the course of this year.</p></reply>

This includes retail sales of motor vehicles.  The available information is derived from corporation tax returns for the year 2010, the latest year for which the necessary detailed information is available.  The gross trading profits returned by companies with these NACE codes was &euro;2.4 billion for 2010.</p><p>  The sector identifier used on the tax records is based on the 4 digit &ldquo;NACE code (Rev. 2)&rdquo; which is an internationally recognised economic activity code system.  The NACE codes are not essential for the assessment and collection of taxes and duties and the correct allocation and maintenance of these codes is subject to the limit of available resources. NACE code classifications on tax records are compiled by reference to the primary area of economic activity reported by individual and corporate taxpayers on their own behalf and the taxes collected are allocated to those codes without reference to the precise economic activity which generated them.  While the accuracy of the NACE codes on tax records is sufficient to underpin broad sector-based analyses there will undoubtedly be some inaccuracies at individual level.  This should be borne in mind when considering the information provided.  The sector identified for this reply represents the closest equivalents in the NACE code system to the sector mentioned in the question.</p><p>  I am also informed by the Revenue Commissioners that it is not currently possible to separately identify from their records the amount of these profits that relate to foreign owned companies nor to identify the amount of these profits that are repatriated abroad.</p><p>  The CSO has recently broken down economic activity by foreign-owned multinational sectors and indigenous - .  The threshold for inclusion in the foreign-owned category is if 85 per cent or more of the turnover for the sector is accounted for by foreign-owned multinationals.  For Ireland this includes software, chemicals and some other sectors, but not retail.</p><p>  On the issue of profits, it is assumed that foreign-owned retailers generally repatriate profits abroad. However in net terms some profits will remain in Ireland, to the extent that shareholders of these firms are Irish residents.</p></reply>

This 12-month moratorium is intended to provide co-operating borrowers with the necessary time to agree an alternative repayment arrangement with their lender.  It commences 31 days after arrears have first arisen on a mortgage account and excludes any time period during which:</p><p>the borrower is complying with the terms of any alternative repayment arrangement; </p><p>the borrower can consider whether he/she wishes to appeal a decision of the Arrears Support Unit; </p><p>an appeal by the borrower is being processed by the lender&#8217;s Appeals Board; </p><p>and a complaint from the borrower is being processed by the Financial Services Ombudsman.</p><p>  Under the CCMA, there are two scenarios that affect the application of the 12-month moratorium:</p><p>1.  Where a lender has complied with the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) and offered an alternative repayment arrangement to the borrower, the 12-month moratorium does not continue to apply if the borrower declines the arrangement offered.  A lender must, however, allow for the borrower&#8217;s right of appeal to the lender&#8217;s internal Appeals Board and to refer the appeal to the Financial Services Ombudsman.</p><p>2. Where a lender has deemed a borrower&#8217;s mortgage to be unsustainable and declined to offer an arrangement, that lender must wait for whatever period of time remains on the moratorium before commencing legal action.  This allows such borrowers some time to consider their situation and to make alternative arrangements.</p><p>  In relation to 1 above, and in the context of the new Personal Insolvency Act, the Central Bank is now proposing that a lender should be required to give a 30-day notice period, before commencing legal action, to a borrower who has declined an arrangement.  This would allow the borrower a period of time to consider his or her options, particularly whether to consult a Personal Insolvency Practitioner.</p><p>  In relation to 2 above, the Central Bank is seeking views on whether the 12-month moratorium should continue to apply where a lender has deemed a mortgage to be unsustainable (bearing in mind that the time remaining will vary, depending on the length of time a lender has taken to assess a borrower&#8217;s case).  Or whether the 30 day notice period outlined above, is a sufficient alternative period of time for a borrower to consider his or her options in this circumstance.</p><p>  The Central Bank has commenced a consultation process on the &#8220;Review of the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears&#8221; (CP63).  Submissions should be emailed to the Bank on or before 10 April 2013.  Full details are available on <i><font color="#0000FF">www.centralbank.ie</font></i>.</p></reply>

This is essential if they are to return to profitability, be in a position to support the economy and repay the State&rsquo;s investment through a return to private ownership.</p><p>  On behalf of the Government, I have now directed the banks to come up with plans as to how they intend to address this issue in a manner that can help meet the State&rsquo;s objectives.  I expect the value of those plans to mean a saving of 6% - 10% of total remuneration costs, through reductions in payroll and pension benefits, new working arrangements and structures that deliver efficiency gains. </p><p>  This point is reinforced in the correspondence supplied by the Deputies where it is asserted that even a target reduction of 6% to 10% in remuneration will not by itself impact significantly on losses now occurring at the covered institutions.  If appropriate action is not taken on this front in a timely manner then bank workers will be facing much more unpalatable measures than now proposed.  Tackling the cost base is of course only one of many goals that need to be achieved but combined with other measures will deliver the required results. </p><p>  I would point out in this context that redundancies at the covered institutions have been achieved to date on a voluntary basis on negotiated terms.  The effect on employee entitlements arising out of the liquidation of IBRC will serve as a sharp reminder to all sides of the fraught environment in which the banks and the country are operating.</p><p>  I, and the Government, acknowledge that the sacrifices and changes made by bank employees to date at all levels and recognise that this has been achieved without major industrial unrest in what is a critically important sector.  However, it can never be forgotten by management and employees of these banks &ndash; both past and present &ndash; that without enormous cost to Irish taxpayers these institutions would not have survived and that this needs to be borne in mind during future discussions.

At that time, my Department did not give any comment on the specific measures the Cypriot Government had agreed with the Troika.</p><p>  The structure of the levy of deposits was proposed by the Cypriot authorities.  The Eurogroup made its views clear to the Cypriot authorities that small depositors should be treated differently from large depositors.  To reinforce this point; the Eurogroup reaffirmed that EU law guarantees deposits up to &#8364;100,000 per customer, per bank in the event of a bank failure.  On 16th March, the Cypriot Government proposed a once-off levy on all bank accounts in Cyprus.  The Eurogroup advised against this proposal, but it recognised that fiscal measures such as taxes and levies are matters for individual member states, whether in a programme of assistance of not.</p><p>  As the Deputies are aware the terms of the bailout agreed for Cypriot banks have now changed in the sense that a levy will now no longer be applied to depositors with deposits of &#8364;100,000 or less.  Deposits equal to or less than &#8364;100,000 will be <i>fully</i>  protected and there will not be a system-wide levy. In addition, the Cypriot authorities have agreed that senior bondholders will share fully in the costs of bank resolution.</p><p>  I can confirm that this Government fully adheres to the EU policy of guaranteeing deposits of up to &#8364;100,000 per customer, per bank and would be against imposing a levy on guaranteed savings of under &#8364;100,000 as this would in itself undermine the nature of the guarantee.  I can also confirm that discussions on a levy never arose with the Troika.</p><p>  While there is a Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) on deposits, this applies only to interest earned and does not impact on the guaranteed deposit under &#8364;100,000.  DIRT is a common form of tax, which ensures that the income earned on deposits, like other income, is subject to tax.</p></reply>

I understand that a survey in respect of 2011 carried out for the Revenue Commissioners and the Health Services Executive found that some 770 million illicit cigarettes were consumed in the State.  This would indicate a loss of the order of &euro;258 million, in excise duty and VAT, in that year.  A similar survey was undertaken in 2012 and the final results are being compiled at present.</p><p>  The Revenue Commissioners are conscious that, in addition to the loss of tax revenues, the illicit tobacco trade poses a threat to legitimate businesses and to the Government&rsquo;s policy of discouraging smoking.  Taking action against this illegal activity is, therefore, a high priority for them.  Their programme of action resulted in the seizure of over 95 million cigarettes and 5,276 kilograms of tobacco in 2012, and 132 convictions were secured during the year in respect of the smuggling or sale of illicit cigarettes or tobacco.</p><p>  The penalty in the case of a summary conviction for either the smuggling of tobacco products or the illegal sale of unstamped tobacco products is a fine of &euro;5,000 or a term of imprisonment not exceeding 12 months, or both a fine and a term of imprisonment. </p><p>  The fines that may be imposed where a person is convicted on indictment of a tobacco-related offence were increased substantially by the Finance Act 2010. In the case of a conviction on indictment for smuggling, a fine not exceeding &euro;126,970 or, where the value of the goods concerned is greater than &euro;250,000, an amount not exceeding three times their value, may be imposed.  A term of imprisonment not exceeding 5 years may be imposed instead of, or in addition to, a fine.  Where a conviction on indictment occurs in respect of the illegal sale of unstamped products, the Court may impose a fine not exceeding &euro;126,970, or a term of imprisonment of up to 5 years, or a fine and imprisonment.</p><p>  The specific penalty to be imposed in a particular case is a matter for the Courts. Section 130(3) of the Finance Act 2001 permits a trial judge, in his or her discretion, to mitigate a fine incurred for an offence under excise law, provided that the amount so mitigated is not greater than 50% of the amount of the fine.</p><p>  I consider that the maximum fines available are sufficiently high at present, having been raised to the current levels in 2010.  The penalty imposed by the Court in any particular case is a matter entirely for the Court. In general, the level of penalty applied appears to be well below the maximum provided for in law.</p></reply>

In accordance with the law in most common law jurisdictions, a complete exemption from CAT is available in relation to gifts and inheritances transferring between spouses.  Section 70 CATCA 2003 provides that a gift taken by a donee who is at the date of the gift the spouse or civil partner of the disponer is exempt from tax and is not taken into account in computing tax.  Section 71 CATCA 2003 similarly provides that an inheritance taken by a donee who is at the date of the inheritance the spouse or civil partner of the disponer is exempt from tax and is not taken into account in computing tax.  Under CATA 1976 as originally enacted, no exemption was provided for spouses or surviving spouses.  In many cases, a surviving spouse inheriting a relatively small estate comprising of the family home, a widow&rsquo;s pension and other rights derived from a deceased husband was subject to CAT.  Accordingly, with effect from 30 January 1985, all inheritances taken by a spouse from another spouse are exempt from tax. Gifts between spouses are exempt from tax since 31 January 1990.</p><p>  These inheritance and gift tax exemptions were extended to civil partners as respects a gift or inheritance between civil partners taken on or after 1 January 2011.</p><p>  The result is that CAT is not now charged on any transfers between spouses or civil partners either by way of gift or inheritance. CAT is effectively postponed until assets are passed on to the next generation.</p><p>  The principle issue raised in the Deputy&rsquo;s question is a possible avoidance of debt as opposed to an avoidance of tax.  I do not believe that amendments to the sections referred to by the Deputy would deal with the issue raised.</p><p>More generally in the context of insolvency, both the Bankruptcy Act and the new Personal Insolvency Act contain provisions and offences regarding actions by a debtor who seeks to fraudulently or illegally deprive or defeat the legitimate rights of creditors.</p></reply>

I would like to clarify that qualifying for this relief does not confer on the property an exemption from the charge to Local Property Tax.  Section 15A of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) provides for a reduction in the market value of a residential property that has been adapted for occupation by a disabled person where the adaptation has been grant-aided by a local authority.  The person with the disability must occupy the property as his or her sole or main residence after the adaptation is completed.  The reduction in value is limited to the lesser of the chargeable value attributable to the adaptation work carried out on the property and the maximum grant payable under the relevant local authority scheme.  The relief ends on the sale or transfer of a property that has been adapted, unless the person with the disability continues to reside in the property.</p><p>  I would like to clarify that a person who adapted a home before 2001 is not excluded from this relief.  The relief is dependent on local authority grant aid being paid under S.I. 607 of 2001.  However, this particular set of regulations covers adaptation work carried out on or after 1 March 1993 and on foot of applications received by a local authority up to 1 November 2007 at which stage S.I. 670 of 2007 came into effect.  Thus, all houses which were grant aided in respect of adaptations in the last 20 years or so could potentially qualify for a measure of relief under section 15A.</p></reply>

Limiting the exemptions available allows the rate to be kept low for those liable persons who do not qualify for an exemption. There is no specific exemption from the requirement to pay LPT for pensioners under the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended), though such persons may be entitled to an exemption on other grounds or may qualify for a deferral subject to meeting the qualifying conditions.    The Thornhill Group considered the provision of waivers or deferrals for households unable to pay the tax or where a payment requirement would cause hardship. As a general principle, eligibility for deferral should be based on gross income. The system of deferrals in place is targeted at cases of need, where there is an inability to pay the local property tax under specific conditions.  </p><p>  The property must be the sole or main residence of the liable person and his or her gross income must be below certain thresholds.  The thresholds are &euro;15,000 for a single person and &euro;25,000 for a married couple, civil partners or cohabiting couple.  Deferral in respect of half of the local property tax payable is possible, where the gross income is above the threshold but less than &euro;25,000 in the case of a single person and &euro;35,000 in the case of a couple. (These partial deferral limits are each &euro;5,000 higher than those recommended by the Thornhill Group).  Owner/occupiers whose sole source of income is a state pension should qualify for a deferral. Deferred Local Property Tax and interest will have to be discharged on the sale/transfer of the property. </p></reply>

It is not appropriate for me, as Minister for Finance, to comment on or become involved in the detailed mortgage position of mortgage holders.   However, I have been advised by the Central Bank that they have engaged with mortgage lenders in relation to negative equity mortgages to develop a mortgage product that would allow home owners to sell their existing home and transfer the negative equity portion of the original loan to the new loan. In order to ensure that proposals in relation to such mortgages are consistent with the Central Bank&rsquo;s consumer protection and prudential policy objectives, the proposed criteria for any such facility need to be agreed in advance between mortgage lenders and the Central Bank.</p><p>  While the provision of negative equity mortgages will facilitate people moving homes and generate transactions in the housing market, it is not expected that there will be a large take up of this product, as all sales must comply with the affordability and suitability provisions set out in the Consumer Protection Code.</p><p>  Some lenders are offering this product, while others are considering making such a product available.</p></reply>

These targets are set in relation to both Principal Dwelling Homes (PDH) and Buy to Let (BTL) mortgages and have been set for banks regarding sustainable resolution for arrears cases which are 90 days or more overdue. This new approach is aimed at ensuring that banks offer and conclude sustainable solutions for their customers in arrears by setting specific performance targets and proposing revisions to provisioning standards.   The Central Bank's targets stipulate that:</p><p>-  By end June 2013, the banks should have proposed sustainable mortgage solutions for 20% of mortgage loans that are over 90 days in arrears, and</p><p>-By end September 2013, 30%, and</p><p>-By the end of 2013, 50%.</p><p>The targets will become progressively more demanding so that the vast majority of distressed borrowers will have been proposed solutions by end 2014.  </p><p>  The latest Central Bank mortgage arrears statistics for the end of December 2012 indicates that 94,488 (11.9%) accounts of PDH mortgages and 28,421 (18.9%) of BTL mortgage accounts were in arrears of more than 90 days.</p><p>  The Central Bank's Mortgage Resolution Strategy Targets, which can be accessed on the Bank&#8217;s website at <i><font color="#0000FF"></font></i>  , defines a sustainable solution as one of the following:</p><p>a)An arrangement concluded under a bank&#8217;s Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP), in accordance with the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, where the borrower is cooperating under the MARP and the bank has satisfied itself that the arrangement provides a sustainable solution which is likely to enable the customer to meet the original or, as appropriate, the amended terms of the mortgage over the full remaining life of the mortgage, including repayment of the original or an agreed revised principal sum where offered. This may include an interest only or other temporary solution for a period if it is likely that full repayment of the original or revised principal will be achieved over time, or where there is a payment plan to return the account to sustainability through the clearance of arrears; </p><p>b)A personal insolvency arrangement effected under the Personal Insolvency Act 2012; or </p><p>c)If an arrangement could not be reached or is not appropriate, that the PDH or BTL property securing the loan has been voluntarily sold or, failing that, any situation where a Specified Credit Institution takes possession of the property including by way of voluntary agreement with the borrower or by Court Order or otherwise. </p><p>  In determining whether a proposal constitutes a sustainable solution, the Central Bank has informed me that the lender will need to evaluate both actual and prospective affordability for the distressed borrower and the capital implications for the credit institutions in terms of their prudential responsibility to minimise losses.</p><p>  While the Central Bank is not mandating any particular model of restructuring and while sustainable solutions will be arrived at on a case-by-case basis, there are some fundamental principles that must be respected.  These include:</p><p>-  An affordability assessment of the borrower based on both their current and prospective future servicing capacity for all borrowings; </p><p>-  A realistic valuation of the borrower&#8217;s assets, in particular their property, and</p><p>-  The use of an appropriate interest rate when discounting future income flows, which should take account of the lender&#8217;s cost of funds. </p><p>  The Central Bank has advised that it will assess compliance with these principles in its supervisory audit of compliance with the targets, including through analysis of a sample of modifications.</p><p>  Section 37 of the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears provides that where an alternative repayment arrangement is offered by a lender, the lender must provide the borrower with a clear explanation, in writing, of the alternative repayment arrangement.</p></reply>

The Financial Services (Deposit Guarantee Scheme) Act 2009 provides for the operation of the Deposit Protection Account (DPA). Credit Institutions are required to maintain a balance in the DPA equivalent to 0.2% of their total deposits (subject to a minimum of &euro;50,000 for each bank or building society). The total balance in the DPA was &euro;388m at end December 2012 and has reduced to &euro;379m following compensation payments to IBRC depositors.</p><p>  In the event of a credit institution being unable to repay deposits, the Central Bank is authorised to make compensation payments to eligible depositors to a maximum of &euro;100,000 per person per institution.

In the event that the cost of compensation exceeds the balances in the DPA, the 2009 Act provides for the Central Bank to be reimbursed from the Central Fund within 3 months, subject to my approval.</p><p>  Subsequently, credit institutions would be required to replenish the DPA and to repay the government for amounts advanced to cover the immediate cost of compensation. I am authorised to specify the period for repayments and the interest rate chargeable.</p></reply>

No pay increases have been provided to the generality of the employees since that time and the Review states that bonuses are no longer payable at the covered institutions.    It is not correct to say that the Review indicates that bankers salaries are among the highest in Europe.  In fact, the Review opines that at senior executive level and above salaries are generally behind the market as compared to quoted Irish companies and the Mercer European Financial Services survey and significantly behind when incentives are taken into account.</p><p>  The Government has taken the decision that with the remaining Covered Institutions still incurring losses it was an inescapable conclusion that the cost base of the institutions needs to be reduced further. This is essential if they are to return to profitability, be in a position to support the economy and repay the State&rsquo;s investment through a return to private ownership.  </p><p>  In terms of next steps, I, on behalf of the Government, have directed the banks to come up with plans as to how they intend to address this issue in a manner that can help meet the State's objectives.  I expect the value of those plans to mean a saving of 6% - 10% of total remuneration costs, through reductions in payroll and pension benefits, new working arrangements and structures that deliver efficiency gains.</p></reply>

I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, in common with the procedures for other taxes, they will accept the self-assessment made by the liable person provided it is made honestly and reasonably.  In cases, therefore, where the liable person has made their best efforts at self-assessing the valuation band for their property and has submitted their Return and paid, or made arrangements to pay, the tax, the likelihood of disputes arising would be expected to be very low.</p><p>  The Deputy refers in his Questions to persons disputing the amount of money being sought from them in property tax.  This may be a reference to the Notice of Revenue Estimate that is being sent by Revenue to all liable persons as part of the general issue of LPT Returns that recently commenced.  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the question of appealing the Estimate does not arise.  The Revenue Estimate is not based on a valuation of individual properties, nor should it be regarded as an accurate calculation of the amount of LPT that a liable person should pay. The Revenue Estimate is an amount of LPT that will be pursued if a liable person does not submit his or her LPT Return with his or her self-assessment of their property's valuation band.  Accordingly, a person does not appeal the estimate &#8211; he/she displaces it by completing the return, self-assessing the value and filing the return. It is very simple, there is nothing to appeal - just file the return with the person&#8217;s own assessment of the LPT due and arrange to pay it.</p><p>  Because LPT is a self-assessed tax, the likelihood of formal appeals arising should not be high. A common feature of a self-assessment system is that return is filed which is generally accepted by Revenue. A number of returns are reviewed at a later date by Revenue and supporting documentation may be requested. At the end of a review, if there isn't agreement, Revenue may raise an assessment which the taxpayer may then appeal.</p><p>  In the context of LPT, Revenue has stated that their concern this year is to establish the register and to get the tax up and running. At a later date, they will analyse the returns received and will review a proportion of those returns. Their likely approach will be to ask a property owner to validate his/her self-assessment. Depending on the outcome of the review and in a minority of cases where agreement is not reached, Revenue will raise an assessment of additional LPT due. This may be appealed to the Appeal Commissioners. As with other self-assessed taxes, one of the conditions to appeal Revenue's assessment is that the person must submit a Return and pay his or her <i>own</i> assessment of the tax due - not Revenue&#8217;s assessed amount - within 30 days of the date of the Notice of Assessment.</p><p>  Finally, the determination of all tax appeals is the responsibility of the Office of the Appeal Commissioners - an Office under the aegis of my Department, entirely separate from the Office of the Revenue Commissioners. There are currently two Appeal Commissioners who are completely independent in carrying out their statutory role.  The extent to which the introduction of the LPT will impact on the work of the Appeal Commissioners cannot be accurately predicted at this stage.

Most correspondents would suggest measures which could be taken and all suggestions are reviewed by officials. Additional measures to curtail the shadow economy are included annually in the Finance Bill, this is an area of great concern to my Department.</p><p>  Also, I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that it is not possible to estimate the cost to the Irish economy of tax evasion. The measurement of the scale of tax evasion, often referred to as the shadow economy, is inherently difficult given the nature of the problem. There is no one internationally recognised and agreed measure. There is no doubt that shadow economy activity creates distortions in the economy and competitive disadvantages for compliant businesses. For these reasons, Revenue focuses on deterring shadow economy activity and non-compliance through its audit and investigation programmes based on risk analysis, use of Revenue powers and their intelligence and information systems.</p><p>  Revenue&rsquo;s tax and duty compliance programmes are under constant review to ensure that they are focussed on the areas of greatest risk, including risks from the shadow economy. A variety of methodologies are used by Revenue to identify those who are operating in the shadow economy including covert surveillance, cold calls to businesses and venues as well as pre-arranged aspect queries on specific items. In addition, joint operations are conducted with the Department of Social Protection using Joint Investigation Units and there is a strong focus on cash businesses, given its potential high-risk nature.</p><p>  In 2012, Revenue carried out more than 537,000 compliance interventions, yielding more than &euro;492 million. There were fifty convictions for serious evasion during 2012, and the end of 2012, there were eighty-nine ongoing investigations with a view to prosecution. </p><p>  Revenue investigations have detected the use of computer programmes or electronic devices to alter or conceal sales records. To counteract these risks, legislation was enacted in 2011 providing penalties for the possession, use or supply of automated sales suppression devices known as &quot;zappers&quot; for the purpose of evading tax. </p><p>  Streetscape programmes, in which every cash business in an area is visited, without prior announcement, have been carried out. The main focus of real time activity is on businesses that have the potential to operate with cash. This includes professionals such as doctors, veterinary surgeons, etc. </p><p>  Considerable success has been achieved in combating the illegal trade in tobacco products. In 2012, Revenue&rsquo;s Customs Service seized a total of 95.6 million cigarettes from 8,108 seizures. A further 5,276 kilograms of other tobacco products were taken in 2012 from 1,395 seizures. There were 22 convictions on indictment, and 110 summary convictions, during the year for offences related to the smuggling or sale of illicit cigarettes and tobacco. In addition there were over 2,400 convictions in relation to laundered oil (2), Marked Mineral Oil (207), VRT (21), Excise Licences (152), Ant-Fraud measures (143), Return Non-Filing (1,880).</p><p>  In addition to the on-going enforcement action against the illegal fuel trade, steps are being taken to ensure enhanced control and supervision at all stages of the fuel supply chain. Key actions include a strengthening of the licensing arrangements for businesses selling auto-fuel, and of the enforcement of licensing requirements. In addition, new licensing requirements have been applied to persons dealing in marked fuels, with effect from 1 October 2012. As well as these important licensing changes, a requirement operates from 1 January 2013 for all fuel traders to make electronic monthly returns to Revenue on their fuel transactions. This will facilitate Revenue in detecting unusual or anomalous patterns of activity.</p><p>  Given the links of organised criminality with the illegal fuel trade, Revenue works closely with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in combating it. Searches undertaken as part of intelligence-led operations have resulted in a considerable number of seizures of diesel and the closure of laundering plants, particularly in border counties. In 2012, 11 oil laundries were detected and shut down and 199,000 litres of oil were seized along with 27 vehicles, 2 forklifts and 5 trailers. There were 10 arrests in the course of these operations. 57 premises were closed in 2012. In addition to the fuel seized at laundries, a further 902,087 litre of fuel were seized during the year, the greater part from retail outlets or in the course of delivery to them.</p><p>  Much of the focus of the Joint Investigation Units (JIUs) is on shadow economy activity and their operations include targeting illegal traders at markets and at seasonal events (Christmas fairs, outdoor concerts etc.). During 2012, over 3,000 outdoor checks/visits/inspections were carried out by the JIU teams including 168 multi-agency operations.</p><p>  Our approach to the shadow economy is underpinned by close consultation and cooperation with other regulatory authorities such as the Department of Social Protection (DSP) and the National Employment Regulatory Authority (NERA). The primary objective of these activities is to uncover either non-declaration or under declaration of income, fraudulent DSP claims and/or non-compliance with employment regulations.</p><p>  Automatic access to third party information is of enormous value to Revenue enabling us to target compliance interventions, to profile sectors and to identify gaps in tax returns. Government Departments, bodies established under statute and any other body involved in the disbursement of public funds are now required to submit returns of payment information to Revenue on an annual basis. </p><p>  I am further advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they hold regular meetings with trade and representative bodies through The Hidden Economy Monitoring Group where the risks posed by shadow economy activities are discussed. Furthermore, Revenue encourages anyone who has specific information regarding any business that is engaged in tax evasion, to submit the details to their local Revenue office. The Hidden Economy Monitoring Group provides a forum for the exchange of views on the effectiveness of measures introduced in combating the hidden economy. This group, which is chaired by Revenue, includes representatives from employer and business organisations, trade unions and other Government Departments and agencies. Regional hidden economy liaison groups have been established to facilitate greater local interaction and more immediate responses to insights and issues that may be highlighted. The most recent meeting of the Hidden Economy Monitoring Group took place on January 30th.</p><p>  Changes are frequently made in tax legislation aimed at counteracting shadow economy activity. Two examples from 2012 include the introduction of the electronic Relevant Contracts Tax regime and an enhanced penalty regime for employers who fail to operate PAYE regulations fully. </p><p>  I am satisfied that the Revenue Commissioners are pursuing a programme that is dealing in a very determined way with tax evasion in all its forms through a range of compliance and audit interventions including targeted special projects.</p></reply>

That said, I am conscious of the need to support the small business sector of the economy given its key role in supporting economic growth and jobs.  For that reason, I introduced a ten-point tax reform to support all small businesses in Budget 2013.

In 2009 and 2010 the assets of the pension schemes of Universities and non-commercial semi-state bodies were transferred to the fund, boosting the effect of the NPRF on the GGB by &euro;1 billion in each year.</p><p>3. No contribution was paid from the Exchequer to the NPRF in 2010 and 2011 because the value of the additional contribution paid to the NPRF in 2009 and the value of the pension scheme assets transferred to the NPRF in 2010 and 2011 were offset against the requirement that the Exchequer make an annual contribution of 1% of GNP to the NPRF.</p><p>4.

Deposits have increased by &euro;7.7bn year on year to the end of February 2013.   It is also important to note that the covered banks have raised significant funding on international capital markets, both through public covered bond issues and private funding transactions, of over &euro;3.5 billion.  In addition, new investors have purchased the &euro;1 billion Bank of Ireland contingent capital bond from the State and that bank has also raised an additional &euro;250 million in lower tier 2 debt.</p><p>  These capital and deposit inflows are significant.</p><p>  In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s specific question, the Minister of Finance and the Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland have a range of powers to prevent capital outflows before consideration of capital controls.  In relation to capital controls, such measures would have an adverse impact on the Irish economy, which is a small, open, economy dependent on its vibrant export orientated sectors.  Our export industries need secure and efficient payment mechanisms which ensure the free movement of capital.  Our strategy of pursuing strong and sustainable export led growth has been fully endorsed by each of the members of the Troika.</p></reply>

Clearly, any final decision to go ahead with such a policy, and the parameters that would attach to it, will be informed by the consultation process itself.</p><p>  Tackling tax avoidance is an inherently difficult problem because, in reality, it is a symptom of the tax system that we have. So long as there are boundaries in the system, tax advisors and taxpayers will seek to exploit those boundaries. Difficult and all as the challenge is, however, it is a challenge that has to be met because aggressive tax avoidance distorts markets, is economically unproductive and breaks the fundamental link between economic productivity and reward. It also, of course, threatens Exchequer tax yields and the perceived fairness of the tax system. In the current economic climate when many individuals are losing their jobs, facing significant cutbacks in pay and welfare provisions and increases in taxes, it is particularly invidious. </p><p>  I have noted with interest the Chancellor&rsquo;s plans in this area.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they closely monitor international trends in relation to tax avoidance and aggressive tax planning, particularly in relation to the UK. They also study steps taken by Her Majesty&rsquo;s Revenue and Customs to counter tax avoidance.</p><p>  Over the last number of years acting on proposals from Revenue, myself and my predecessors have introduced specific anti-avoidance provisions in addition to developing our general anti-avoidance legislation including provisions in relation to mandatory disclosure. It should be noted that Ireland was one of the first OECD countries to introduce a General Anti-Avoidance law and the UK authorities are now about to implement such a provision. In addition, Ireland has had for many years legislation providing for the publication of the names of tax defaulters &ndash; something which the UK has recently introduced. </p><p>  Revenue will closely monitor the UK consultation process and the outcome of that process with a view to assessing if a naming and shaming policy might enhance our fight against the promoters of aggressive tax avoidance schemes.  It should be borne in mind that this is a complex area involving issues such as legal professional privilege that requires careful consideration.</p><p>  In summary, while I have no plans to introduce a naming and shaming practice at this time, I retain an open mind on the issue and if, in due course, Revenue were to recommend such a course of action I will give it due consideration at that time.</p></reply>

Businesses and self-assessed individuals within certain categories must meet their tax filing and paying obligations using the Revenue On-Line Service, ROS.  However, the legislation does allow Revenue to exclude a taxpayer from their obligation to pay and file electronically, if Revenue is satisfied that the taxpayer does not have the capacity to do so.

It requires that, in order to be eligible to receive the qualified rate of pay and allowances, a person on their first appointment to teaching must be registered with the Teaching Council and appropriately qualified for that position or sector.  This was introduced for the purpose of ensuring quality and promoting professional standards in teaching and this goal has been strongly supported by the teacher unions.</p><p>  The second measure was taken as part of Budget 2011.  The last Government applied a reduction in the pay of new entrants to the public service.  In the case of new teachers, a reduction of 10% was applied to pay and certain allowances and all new teachers were required to start on the first point of the scale rather than the third point as had previously been the case for most teachers.  The new pay rates applied to all teachers who were new appointees appointed on or after 1 January 2011.  Where a person gave any service - qualified or unqualified - in an analogous teaching position before 1 January 2011, he or she was not regarded as a new appointee to teaching and so was not affected by this measure.</p><p>  The third measure formed part of Budget 2012 and related to qualification allowances.  The Government announced that additional qualification allowances would not be payable to existing teachers and new teachers would be paid qualification allowances up to a maximum of the allowance applicable to an honours primary degree level.</p><p>  Furthermore, in 2012 a public service-wide review of allowances was also carried out by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and, pending its outcome, the payment of qualification allowances was suspended with effect from 1 February 2012.  As a result of the review, the Government abolished qualification allowances with effect from that date and a new salary scale was created with a starting point equivalent to the fourth point of the previous scale.  This reduced the impact of the ending of the qualification allowances and ensured a broad consistency across the public service.</p><p>  The introduction of this new salary scale has been a complex task which has required a detailed implementation process.  My Department, in consultation with VECs, is working through the operational aspects of these changes as they affect existing teachers and their pay.  It is also worth noting that the recent proposals put forward by the Labour Relations Commission on an extension to the Croke Park Agreement include a proposal that would address the imbalance between those who entered the teaching profession since 2011 and those who entered before that date.  These proposals are currently being considered by the membership of the public service trade unions at this time.</p></reply>

Explicitly, it is communicated via legislation, regulations, rulings, orders, plans, strategies, policy statements, and other forms &ndash; or  through a combination of these. Therefore the Deputy will appreciate that  specific policies and objectives are not always articulated in just one  document.</p><p>  However my Department is mindful that greater clarity would be useful for  schools and parents and accordingly my Department is currently in the process of preparing a comprehensive statement of existing policy within the boundaries  of one document. Naturally the new policy statement will not be exclusive.  Policies are subject of necessity to change from time to time. Also, the new  statement will neither alter nor add to existing policy. It will reflect the  current policy in a coherent and articulate manner for the benefit of schools  and parents.</p><p>  My Department strives to ensure that a continuum of special education provision  is available as required for children with special educational needs. In line  with this approach the policy is to promote a child-centred approach to  education of all children with special educational needs including those with  autism. As each child with autism is unique they should have access to a range  of different approaches to meet their individual needs.</p><p>  Children with autism present with a wide range of needs. Some children are  capable of being fully integrated into mainstream schools without additional  teaching or care supports. Others are able to attend mainstream schools but  need additional teaching and/or care assistance. Many are best enrolled in  autism-specific classes where more intensive and supportive interventions are  required. Some may move from one setting to another as they get older and  differing needs/strengths/abilities emerge.</p><p>  The preferred policy of my Department is that children with autism are educated  in school settings where children may have access to individualised education  programmes (IEPs), fully-qualified professional teachers, special needs  assistants, the appropriate school curriculum with the option, where possible  and appropriate, of full or partial integration and interaction with other  pupils.</p><p>  Autism classes are established with a staffing ratio of 1 teacher and a minimum  of 2 Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) for every 6 children. Other SNAs may be  allocated if required to meet the care needs of the children. Start-up grants  are provided to the schools to enable special equipment to be purchased.  Enhanced capitation is paid in respect of each child and assistive technology  is funded where this is recommended.</p><p>  This approach promotes the maximum level of inclusion which accords with the  intent of the EPSEN Act. While some children may be able to attend a mainstream  class, for others the most appropriate provision may be in a special class or  unit in the school or in a special school.</p><p>  My Department supports provision in mainstream schools, some 540 special  classes for autism attached to mainstream and special schools and 18 special  schools for children with autism throughout the State which cater for the  educational needs of some 5,000 children with autism, all of which operate  within the policy parameters.</p><p>  This policy is based on advice received from international experts on autism,  NEPS, the Inspectorate and the report of the Irish Task Force on Autism. My  Department has satisfied itself that research does not support the exclusive  usage of any one approach as a basis for national educational provision for  children with autism. It is for this reason that my Department's preferred  policy is for a child centred approach where the approach to be taken is based  on the individual child's needs.</p><p>  My Department continues to develop policy and programmes for children with  special educational needs, including those with autism, and will continue to  take relevant professional advice into account in this regard.</p></reply>

My colleague Minister Howlin has highlighted the importance of ensuring that the public sector is achieving maximum value for money and operational efficiency in its approach to public procurement. Centralising the procurement of commonly used goods and services can deliver significant benefits which include: cash savings; administrative savings from reduced duplication of tendering; greater purchasing expertise; improved consistency and enhanced service levels.</p><p>  In addition, given the financial constraints within which we must all now work, cost reductions and savings can go some way to helping Exchequer funded bodies, such as schools, manage within reducing financial budgets.</p><p>  Given the potential benefits that can be realised across the public sector, public procurement is one of the major projects of key strategic importance under the Government's Public Service Reform Plan. The Public Service Reform Plan, published in November 2011, provides for the development of a new policy framework for procurement.  This work is now being led by the newly appointed Chief Procurement Officer, Paul Quinn.  Under his leadership a new national procurement office for the public sector is being established. Paul is currently working with officials across the public sector to put in place new sectoral and centralised procurement arrangements.</p><p>  I do appreciate the concerns being raised by school supply companies and I have asked relevant officials here in the Department, who are coordinating procurement reform in the Education and Training sector, to take these concerns into consideration in the context of the work being undertaken on procurement reform.</p></reply>

Decisions on these matters are made following consideration of a number of criteria, such as the overall annual funding available, the urgency and prioritising of competing projects to meet demographic requirements, multi-annual contractual commitments created by individual projects and the technical readiness of projects to proceed to tender and construction.</p><p>  However there were also a number of school building projects which simply could not be included in the five year plan I announced in March last year. However, as the Deputy is aware, my Department has continued to progress projects outside the five year plan to the final planning stages in anticipation of further funding becoming available to my Department in future years. To date no extra funding has been made available.  As 2013 progresses, projects scheduled to proceed to construction in the later years of the plan will be assessed in the context of the criteria that I have outlined above and can only be considered for advancement if there is the financial scope to do so.</p></reply>

The provision made by Kilkenny College caters for the needs of children from the Protestant community spread across several counties.  Accordingly when the authorities of Kilkenny College indicated that they were considering that the long term future of that school might be better secured by entering the Free Scheme I was happy to have officials of my Department work with the college authorities to work through a basis on which such a transfer would be feasible if that was their ultimate judgement.  The Deputy will appreciate that over the course of those detailed discussions the College authorities shared information in confidence with the Department. While that is the case I do want to advise the Deputy of the agreement reached with the College.  Kilkenny College will cease to charge fees with effect from the start of school year in September next and as a result my Department will in future pay the salaries of a teacher for every 19 students attending the College.  This compares with one teacher for every 21 students in fee charging schools at present and which will rise to one teacher for every 23 students in September 2013.  My Department will also provide capitation and related funding to the College on the same basis as every other voluntary secondary school within the Free Education Scheme.  I also approved certain transition arrangements in relation to teaching staff employed by the College and reviewed the level of exchequer funding approved by the Department for building projects carried out by the College.  The precise cost of additional exchequer expenditure in Kilkenny College will be a function later this year of the actual enrolment in the College as a school within the Free Scheme.  The report I published recently &quot;Fee Charging Schools - Analysis of Fee income&quot; included an amount of &euro; 23.55 million exchequer funding foregone by the schools.  This equates with the amount of exchequer funding that would be paid out if every single fee charging school sought to transfer to the Free Scheme.  I do not envisage that all of the schools will seek to do so.  However, any approach to my Department will be considered on an individual basis that will take account of the significance of the provision concerned in terms of diversity and overall demand for school places in the locality served by the school.</p></reply>

It differs significantly from coastal flooding, as assets are permanently lost. Dealing with  problems of coastal erosion also requires a somewhat different approach to problems of flooding and must be addressed in a sensitive manner.</p><p>  The management of problems of coastal erosion in any particular area is first and foremost a matter for the relevant local authority. The local authority must assess the problem in the first instance and, if it considers that specific measures and works are required, it can submit an application to the OPW for funding to implement those measures under the OPW's Minor Coastal Works Scheme. This Scheme is one of the principal means through which the OPW, in conjunction with the local authorities, is tackling the problems of coastal erosion.</p><p>  Applications for funding under the Minor Works Scheme are assessed by the OPW to ensure that the works proposed are viable and are based on a robust technical analysis and assessment of the problems. To be eligible for funding the proposals must also be shown to be cost beneficial and have a sound economic justification. OPW requires that proposals and funding applications for structural measures to prevent or mitigate erosion should be done in conjunction with an appropriate coastal erosion risk management study, which fully investigates, substantiates and demonstrates the merits of the measures being proposed. </p><p>  Significant work has been carried out under the Irish Coastal Protection Strategy Study (ICPSS) which is a major examination being undertaken by the consultancy group RPS to assess and identify the most significant areas of erosion risk for the entire national coastline. This major study is virtually complete and it will provide invaluable and essential information required to inform policy in this area.</p><p>  The ICPSS is mapping the entire national coastline and the erosion hazard maps produced and published under the study will be available to local planners to inform and guide decisions on local coastal planning issues. This is very important element in the overall management framework to deal with problems of coastal erosion as it is vitally important that the correct decisions are made to avoid future risk associated with inappropriate developments in coastal areas.</p><p>In order to encourage greater SME participation the NPS over the past 3 years has conducted a targeted programme of education for suppliers who wish to learn more about doing business with the Irish Public Service.  This programme consists of seminars, workshops and large scale 'meet the buyer' events hosted nationwide.  Attendees could avail of educational seminars on a variety of topics ranging from the technicalities of public service procurement to procedures around consortia-building for SMEs.  To date the NPS has facilitated workshops and presented at seminars to over 3,000 SMEs nationwide.  Parallel with these events the NPS also works closely with business representative bodies such as ISME and IBEC to provide briefings for their members.</p></reply>

Notices were placed by the Labour Court in the national newspapers seeking submissions from interested parties on the issue.</p><p>  The deadline for submissions was 1st March 2013.  The Labour Court is obliged under the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2012 to conclude its review by 12 April 2013.  The new Section 41A of Industrial Relations Act 1946 sets down the specific criteria to which the Labour Court is required to have regard when carrying out the independent review.  The outcome of the review will inform the Labour Court as to whether any JLC should be abolished, maintained in its current form, amalgamated with another JLC or its establishment order amended.  The Labour Court will then make recommendations to me and if I am satisfied that the correct procedures have been followed, and I consider it appropriate to do so, I will make an order in the terms of the recommendation.  If I decide not to make such an order, I will advise the Labour Court in writing of the reasons why.</p><p>  Ms Hughes sought specific clarification from my Department regarding previous statements made by me regarding the potential rationalisation of the number of JLCs arising from the recommendations in the 2011 Duffy Walsh report.  Ms Hughes was advised that the Duffy Walsh Report was published almost two years ago.  In line with section 11 of the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2012, the Labour Court has since initiated a comprehensive review of each JLC.  Ms Hughes was also advised that this review will supersede the recommendations of the Duffy Walsh Report in this regard and the Labour Court will make recommendations to me based on the review and on specific criteria set out in the 2012 Act that post-date the Duffy Walsh Report.  Ms Hughes also sought, and was given, general views on possible legislative implications in the event that any changes were proposed regarding a JLC.</p></reply>

Consequently, it is not necessary for me as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to set out a separate policy for public sector contracts.  My colleague Mr Richard Bruton, Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation has overall policy responsibility for employment rights.  The National Employment Rights Authority (NERA) is responsible for enforcing minimum statutory employment rights and entitlements in the State and, in undertaking that role, carries out a range of functions including the provision of employment rights information and the inspection of employment related records.  NERA operates a system of risk based inspections in sectors where there are identifiable risks.  Inspections are also carried out in response to complaints received and routine inspections are undertaken as a control measure.</p><p>  The Public Service Agreement 2010 &ndash; 2014 established a mechanism to monitor compliance with employment law, including REAs, in operations which are the subject of outsourcing.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform notified each department on 22 December 2011 of these arrangements.</p><p>  It is a condition of any contract entered into by a public authority with a private sector entity (other than for operations that may reasonably be considered as small scale) that the entity is required to provide access to certain information.  This information should allow the authority to assess compliance with employment legislation, including relevant REAs, consistent with the requirements of EU and national law.  Any sub-contractors employed are also required to adhere to these conditions.</p></reply>

Work-life balance arrangements in the public service will continue to be among the best available options provided by Irish employers, particularly when considered in tandem with annual leave and other provisions.  These arrangements underpin important social policy goals, in particular supporting the ongoing participation of parents and carers in the workplace.</p><p>  A range of flexible working arrangements will continue to be available across the public service where they currently exist, including, flexi-time, work-sharing arrangements, the shorter working year scheme, career breaks, as well as all of the statutory entitlements such as parental leave and carer&#8217;s leave.  The LRC is proposing that two of these arrangements, namely flexi-time and work-sharing, be amended as sustainable reform measures that will underpin the delivery of a more integrated, efficient and effective public service.</p><p><b>Flexi-time</b></p><p>  Public service organisations that currently have flexi-time in place will continue to have flexi-time.  It will be available for existing staff and new entrants up to the grade of Higher Executive Officer and equivalent.  Everyone on flexi-time will continue, within certain limits, to be able to vary their arrival times, departure times and lunch breaks.  A change is proposed in the amount of flexi-leave that can be taken in a flexi period.  (4 weeks) &#8211; this will now be one day.  This still allows somebody on flexi-time to avail of an additional 13 days flexi-leave per year in addition to their annual leave entitlement and any other flexible working arrangements that they may have.  Management grades at Assistant Principal and equivalent, who currently have access to flexi-time will continue to have access to these arrangements but will not have access to flexi-leave.</p><p><b>Work Sharing</b></p><p>  It is important to clarify that a worksharer is an employee who was recruited to a full time position and has opted to reduce their hours to an agreed work sharing pattern.  Work sharing will still be available within the public service.  The proposals include a provision that will require everyone, with notable exceptions, to work a pattern of at least 50% of the full time hours.  It is important to note that only in the region of 2% of those currently work sharing in the Civil Service have a pattern of less than 50%.</p><p>  In recognition of the valuable contribution made by carers to society, those in receipt of Carer&#8217;s Allowance will not be required to increase their hours above the 15 hour a week limit for payment of their allowance.  In support of our commitment to achieving the public service target of a 3% employment rate for people with disabilities, those with disabilities who have reached a reasonable accommodation with their employer to work less than 50% of full time hours will continue to be able to avail of these arrangements for as long as they are required.</p><p>  It is necessary to revise flexi-time and work-sharing arrangements to better reflect the current needs of public service organisations, in the context of falling numbers and changing demands for public services.  As you will appreciate, the operation of these arrangements must support the business of the organisation and the provision of services to the public.  The proposed changes are an attempt to balance the requirements of the business while enabling staff to balance work and personal life requirements.</p><p>  The Irish public service has a proud record of promoting these arrangements and the employee profile across the service reflects the strong efforts made over the last few decades to ensure that public servants&#8217; employment terms allow them to balance their work and home commitments.</p></reply>

The talks and draft Agreement did not encompass public service pensioners and their pension entitlements, and on this basis it is clear that the question of pensioner representation at the negotiations did not arise.</p><p>  As referred to in the Labour Relations Commission proposals document, separately to the planned pay and productivity measures for existing public servants, the Government has decided to legislate for certain changes in respect of public service pensions.  These changes are not part of the draft Public Service Agreement, and were not proposed by the Labour Relations Commission.</p><p>  The main pension change proposed is that all public service pensions greater than &euro;32,500 will be reduced with effect from 1 July 2013.  The Government has decided that this is a suitable means by which public service pensioners will make a fair and proportionate contribution to the ongoing fiscal consolidation.  The proposed new reduction in pensions over &euro;32,500 will range from 2% to 5%, with the largest reductions being borne by those on higher pension rates; it will apply to pensions already in payment and to those awarded up to the end of August 2014.  The reduction is likely to be implemented by way of increasing and extending the Public Service Pension Reduction (PSPR), which was introduced on 1 January 2011, and which currently applies to all public service pensions over &euro;12,000 awarded at any time before the end of February 2012.  Further details, including the actual rates of reduction, will be available on publication of the necessary legislation.</p><p>  It has also been decided that public servants who retire before the end of August 2014 will have their pension and lump sum awards calculated by reference to current pay rates, that is, the rates applying before the pay cuts above the &euro;65,000 level on 1 July 2013 provided for in the draft Public Service Agreement.  This is intended to facilitate public service management in planning for staff departures in an orderly fashion.  For clarity, all public servants who retire on pensions greater than &euro;32,500 during this period to end-August 2014 will be subject to the proposed new pension reduction.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-03-26a.539.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1097" speakername="Brendan Howlin" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013032600069#WRM03400"><p>The Public Service Reform Plan published by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in November 2011 identified procurement reform as a key instrument that can assist in maintaining the delivery of public services in an efficient manner.  The national arrangements put in place by the National Procurement Service (NPS) are designed to enable the State to do more with less by aggregating procurement to secure better value for money.  The majority of the aggregated arrangements are not new and have been available to the public service for a number of years.  In utilising the national contracts, public bodies are able to take advantage of the NPS&rsquo;s buying power and as a result can purchase supplies at competitive prices.  This facilitates ongoing service delivery within tighter operating budgets.</p><p>  In relation to the potential impact of aggregated procurement arrangements, it is worth noting that such arrangements can be implemented in a manner that achieves value for money and also facilitates SME access.  While certain categories of goods and services may be suited to single supplier arrangements (e.g. electricity and gas), it should not be taken that single supplier frameworks are to be accepted as the norm.  The greater use where appropriate of multi-supplier frameworks &ndash; for example the supply of managed print services - can address local supplier issues while also ensuring ongoing cost competitiveness of the framework itself.  In order to facilitate SMEs, the NPS has encouraged tenderers who did not have the capability in their own right of providing goods and services nationally to partner with other entities to satisfy this requirement.  Such multi-supplier frameworks can also offer SMEs the opportunity to participate in national level contracts.</p><p>  In order to encourage greater SME participation the NPS over the past 3 years has conducted a targeted programme of education for suppliers who wish to learn more about doing business with the Irish Public Service.  This programme consists of seminars, workshops and large scale 'meet the buyer' events hosted nationwide.  Attendees could avail of educational seminars on a variety of topics ranging from the technicalities of public service procurement to procedures around consortia-building for SMEs.  To date the NPS has facilitated workshops and presented at seminars to over 3,000 SMEs nationwide.  Parallel with these events the NPS also works closely with business representative bodies such as ISME and IBEC to provide briefings for their members.</p></reply>

Notices were placed by the Labour Court in the national newspapers seeking submissions from interested parties on the issue.</p><p>  The deadline for submissions was 1st March 2013.  The Labour Court is obliged under the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2012 to conclude its review by 12 April 2013.  The new Section 41A of Industrial Relations Act 1946 sets down the specific criteria to which the Labour Court is required to have regard when carrying out the independent review.  The outcome of the review will inform the Labour Court as to whether any JLC should be abolished, maintained in its current form, amalgamated with another JLC or its establishment order amended.  The Labour Court will then make recommendations to me and if I am satisfied that the correct procedures have been followed, and I consider it appropriate to do so, I will make an order in the terms of the recommendation.  If I decide not to make such an order, I will advise the Labour Court in writing of the reasons why.</p><p>  Ms Hughes sought specific clarification from my Department regarding previous statements made by me regarding the potential rationalisation of the number of JLCs arising from the recommendations in the 2011 Duffy Walsh report.  Ms Hughes was advised that the Duffy Walsh Report was published almost two years ago.  In line with section 11 of the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2012, the Labour Court has since initiated a comprehensive review of each JLC.  Ms Hughes was also advised that this review will supersede the recommendations of the Duffy Walsh Report in this regard and the Labour Court will make recommendations to me based on the review and on specific criteria set out in the 2012 Act that post-date the Duffy Walsh Report.  Ms Hughes also sought, and was given, general views on possible legislative implications in the event that any changes were proposed regarding a JLC.</p></reply>

Ordinary employees who have access to the full range of social insurance benefits pay Class A PRSI at the rate of 4%.  In addition, their employers make a PRSI contribution of 10.75% in respect of their employees, resulting in the payment of a combined 14.75% rate per employee under full-rate PRSI Class A.  (For employees earning less than &#8364;356 per week, the rate of employer&#8217;s PRSI is 4.25%).  </p><p>  In 2011 I established the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare to meet the commitment made in the Programme for Government.   The Advisory Group will, <i>inter alia</i>, examine and report on issues involved in providing social insurance cover for self-employed persons in order to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable.   </p><p>  The Advisory Group&#8217;s overall method of working is based on producing modular reports on the priority areas identified in the Terms of Reference.  Where possible, the aim is to provide recommendations that can be acted upon in time for the annual budget, estimates and legislative cycle and to allow the Government to best address its commitments under the EU-IMF Programme of Financial Support.  The Group has been considering the issue of social insurance cover for the self-employed and will submit its report once its examination of the various questions has been completed.  </p><p>  The third Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund, as at 31 December 2010, was completed by consultants KPMG in June 2012 and laid before each House of the Oireachtas on 24 August 2012.   The Review covers a 55 year period from 2011&#8211;2066 and builds on the findings of the 2000 and 2005 Actuarial Reviews of the Fund.</p><p>  One of the issues examined in the 2010 Review was the long-term cost implications to the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) and the break-even contribution rates required to provide invalidity pensions to the self-employed and to provide jobseeker&#8217;s benefit for self-employed workers.  The report found that the effective annual rate of contribution, or the required contribution as a percentage of salary, needed to provide the core full-rate State pension (contributory), which is the benefit currently available to self-employed contributors, is approximately 15%.  This compares favourably with the 4% rate currently paid by the self-employed.  An incremental increase in contribution rates from approximately 15% to 16% would be required if jobseeker&#8217;s benefit in addition to core State pension (contributory) is provided.  The average contribution rate required for the core State pension (contributory) plus jobseeker&#8217;s benefit and the invalidity pension is estimated to be in the region of 17.3%.</p><p>  Any proposals to revise the social insurance system for self-employed persons by extending social insurance entitlements will have to be considered in a budgetary context, taking account of the finding of the Actuarial Review that the self-employed achieve very good value for money compared with the employed &#8211; when the comparison includes both employer and employee contributions in respect of the employed person.  </p><p>  Self-employed workers may access social welfare supports by establishing eligibility to assistance-based payments such as jobseeker&#8217;s allowance and disability allowance.  In the case of jobseeker&#8217;s allowance they can apply for the means-tested jobseeker&#8217;s allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.  In general, their means will take account of the level of earnings in the last twelve months in determining their expected income for the following year and, in the current climate, account is taken of the downward trend in the economy.  As in the case of a non-self-employed claimant for jobseeker&#8217;s allowance or disability allowance, the means of husband/wife, civil partner or cohabitant will be taken into account in deciding on entitlement to a payment.</p></reply>

This funding will consist of EUR 3 billion from the European Social Fund and an additional EUR 3 billion from a new Youth Employment budget line.</p><p>  The European Commission has now published its legislative proposal for this initiative, which in the first instance will have to be considered by Council and then, in turn, negotiated with the European Parliament.  The eligibility criteria for funding support are based on 2012 regional youth unemployment figures, which are not yet available on a pan-European basis, but are expected to be published by Eurostat next month. The financial allocation will be determined based on the number of young unemployed persons between the ages of 15-24 in the NUTS 2 level regions that have youth unemployment rates of more than 25% in 2012.  The allocation corresponding to each eligible region is then calculated on the basis of the ratio between the number of young unemployed persons in the eligible region and the total number of young unemployed persons in all eligible regions. </p><p>  In the absence of the published regional level youth unemployment data and subject to the final agreement on the legislative texts at EU level, we cannot be more definitive at this stage.  However, it is expected both Irish regions, the Border, Midland and West and the Southern and Eastern Regions will qualify for funding. While I do not wish to pre-empt a final decision on funding, I can assure the Deputy that we will be seeking to maximise the possible benefits to Ireland.</p><p>   The Government is already implementing a number of programmes to assist young unemployed persons and keep young jobseekers close to the labour market. There are five main approaches being taken to tackle youth unemployment: education, training, job search assistance/guidance, work experience, and encouraging job creation.  These actions range across a number of Departments and Agencies and include:- </p><p>-   The Youthreach programme providing 6,000 integrated education, training and work experience for early school leavers without any qualifications or vocational training who are between 15 and 20 years of age;</p><p>-   The Vocational Training Opportunities Scheme scheme, which provides a range of courses to meet the education and training needs of unemployed people over 21 years of age, particularly focusing upon early school leavers;</p><p>-   The Back to Education Allowance scheme run by the Department of Social Protection provides income maintenance for unemployed people returning to further or higher education. Over 6,500 young people participated on</p><p>      this scheme in the last academic year;</p><p>-   Approximately 12,000 persons aged under 25 completed a training course with F&Aacute;S in 2012. This excludes apprenticeships and evening courses; </p><p>-   This year MOMENTUM, a scheme for education and training interventions, which is part of the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Jobs initiative, is currently being rolled out by the Department of Education.  MOMENTUM will </p><p>     support the provision of free education and training projects to allow 6,500 long term jobseekers  to gain skills and to access work opportunities in identified growing sectors; </p><p>-   The JobBridge National Internship Scheme is focused on providing work experience to young people with the total number of placements of young people on JobBridge during 2012 at 2,700; </p><p>  - Long-term unemployed youth will also benefit from the JobsPlus initiative which is designed to encourage employers to recruit long-term unemployed people. Under this scheme the State will pay circa &euro;1 of every &euro;4 it costs the</p><p>     employer to recruit a person from the Live Register; </p><p>-   In the December Budget, funding was secured for an additional 10,000 places this year across a range of programmes -- including JobBridge, T&Uacute;S and Community Employment. About a quarter of these places are expected to</p><p>     be taken up by unemployed young people. </p><p>  In terms of job creation, the Government&rsquo;s primary strategy to tackle youth unemployment is to create the environment for a strong economic recovery by promoting competitiveness and productivity. Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth. Past experience suggests that youth unemployment, which tends to rise relatively rapidly in a downturn, can be expected to fall relatively rapidly during the recovery.</p><p>  With regard to targets for job creation, the original Action Plan for Jobs sets out a target for 100,000 net new jobs to be created by 2016, many of which will be filled by young people. In addition, the Action Plan for Jobs 2013 includes the Pathways to Work initiative&rsquo;s targets for increasing the number of people who are long-term unemployed moving into employment and reducing the average length of time spent on the Live Register. </p><p>  Specifically, these targets are that:</p><p>  (i) at least 75,000 of those currently long-term unemployed will move into employment by 2015. </p><p>  (ii) Reducing the average time spent on the Live Register from 21 months today to less than 12 months by the end of 2015.</p><p>  As two out of five young unemployed are long-term unemployed, these targets are pertinent to young people. </p><p>  A new recruitment incentive &ndash; JobsPlus &ndash; has also been developed by my Department and was approved by the Government as part of the Action Plan for Jobs.  This incentive will cover the cost of c. &euro;1 in every &euro;4 of an employer&rsquo;s wage costs and will be launched for availability by July 2013.  Young people are likely to be major beneficiaries of this initiative as employers tend to hire young people when there is a recovery in employment.</p></reply>

The EPSCO Recommendation is that each Member State should ensure that young people receive a quality offer of employment or of continued education, an apprenticeship or traineeship within four months of becoming unemployed.  The Recommendation will now move to be considered for formal adoption by the Council at a later stage in Ireland's Presidency - most likely in May.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">The Recommendation encourages Member States to implement its provisions as soon as possible once it is formally adopted.  It is also recognised that implementation will need to be more gradual in countries with higher levels of youth unemployment and particularly severe budgetary problems. The Department intends to work with youth and other agencies to maximise the impact of a youth guarantee in Ireland. For example, numerous organisations (e.g. IBEC, Ballymun Job Centre, National Youth Council of Ireland) have agreed to participate in the proposed pilot Youth Guarantee project, for which we have sought funding from the European Commission.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">In anticipation of the formal adoption of the Recommendation, the government will review the current range of youth employment and training policies in Ireland to assess what measures will need to be taken to commence the gradual implementation of the guarantee. This will include the identification of what would be the appropriate timescale for implementation in Ireland's current employment and budgetary circumstances. We do not anticipate any significant administrative difficulties, given that this Department, together with the Department for Education &amp; Skills, the Department for Children &amp; Youth Affairs and the Department for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation already administer significant schemes to generate employment, education and training opportunities and to ensure that young people have access to such opportunities. The Youth Guarantee will support rather than impede or replace this work. I, as Minister for Social Protection will work with my colleagues in Cabinet with responsibility for these portfolios to further the implementation of the Youth Guarantee.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">The scale and nature of the measures required will depend on the trend in youth unemployment, and in particular the number of young people likely to experience periods of unemployment of more than four months under current policies.  In this context, it is a welcome development that the official labour market figures published by the CSO recently indicated that the number of young unemployed at the end of 2012, at 59,000, a reduction of almost 9,000 on the same time a year earlier.  It is to be hoped that this is the beginning of a sustained downward movement in youth unemployment as the economy recovers.  Even so, the implementation of a guarantee will, almost certainly require an expansion in the range of opportunities currently on offer to young people in the form of further education, training, internships, subsidised private-sector recruitment, and supports for self-employment.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">In this regard the State already provides a significant number of places which are available to young people and the Department of Social Protection took steps in Budget 2013 to increase funding and places for schemes such as JobBridge, Community Employment, T&Uacute;S and a new state employment scheme in the local Government sector.  In total an additional 10,000 places will be provided.  The Department of Education also made provision for the new MOMENTUM programme which is providing 6,500 new training places many of which will be taken up by young people.  A new recruitment incentive &#8211; JobsPlus &#8211; has also been developed by my Department and was approved by the Government as part of the Action Plan for Jobs.  This incentive will cover the cost of c. &#8364;1 in every &#8364;4 of an employer&#8217;s wage costs and will be launched for availability by July 2013.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">The size and the timescale for any additional provision, over and above that outlined above that is both desirable and feasible will be established over the coming months. </font></p></reply>

There are approximately 14,000 mortgage interest supplement recipients for which the Government has provided &euro;42 million for in 2013.  I have set out below a tabular statement showing the number of mortgage interest supplement recipients from 2007 to 2012 and at end February 2013.</p><p>Following the Department&rsquo;s review of the administrative, policy and legal aspects of the mortgage interest supplement scheme and the review of the Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt Review Group, changes were made to the scheme in 2012.</p><p>To ensure that those who are in mortgage difficulty engage with their lender under the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) and avail of its forbearance arrangements, from June 2012 the mortgage interest supplement is not payable until applicants have agreed with their lender and complied with an alternative payment arrangement for a cumulative period of not less than 12 months. This process acknowledges that it is in the interest of both the lender and the borrower to address financial difficulties as speedily and effectively as circumstances allow.</p><p>In December 2012, to facilitate people who wish to trade down or downsize, the condition which provided that entitlement to mortgage interest supplement should be discontinued where the property is offered for sale was removed.  The removal of this condition will allow persons to engage in selling their residence and remain eligible for mortgage interest supplement, subject to the other conditions of the scheme.</p><p>Any further changes to the scheme which would allow additional categories to qualify for the payment would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</p><p><bu>TABULAR STATEMENT</bu></p><p><b>Mortgage Interest Supplement &ndash; Recipient numbers</b></p><p><table><tr><th bgcolor="#E6E6E6"><div>Year</div></th><th bgcolor="#E6E6E6"><div>Recipients</div></th></tr><tr><td><div>2007</div></td><td><div>4,111</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2008</div></td><td><div>8,091</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2009</div></td><td><div>15,101</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2010</div></td><td><div>17,974</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2011</div></td><td><div>18,988</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2012</div></td><td><div>14,597</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2013</div></td><td><div>13,755 (1) </div></td></tr></table></p><p><div style="padding-left: 40px; margin-bottom: 10px">(1)End February 2013</div></p></reply>

For the most part they are linked to having an underlying entitlement to a social welfare payment while temporarily detached from the labour force or having entitlement to statutory leave e.g. parental or maternity leave.  The primary purpose of PRSI credits is to secure social welfare benefits and pensions of employees by covering gaps in insurance where they are not in a position to pay PRSI such as during periods of unemployment, illness, etc.   </p><p>  The class at which a contributor paid his or her last PRSI contribution determines entitlement to credited contributions.  Credits are usually awarded at the same rate as your last paid PRSI contribution.  For example, Class A PRSI contributions may entitle a person to all insured DSP benefits, provided they satisfy the qualifying conditions.  </p><p>  Class B PRSI contributions may entitle a person to widow/er&rsquo;s or surviving civil partner pension (contributory), Guardian payment (contributory), bereavement grant, carers benefit and limited occupational injuries benefits.</p><p>  People who cease to be covered by compulsory social insurance, may opt to protect their existing long-term social insurance pension entitlements by becoming insured on a voluntary basis and paying voluntary contributions.   Payment of voluntary contributions does not provide social insurance cover for short term benefits such as jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit.  A person who wishes to become a voluntary contributor must satisfy certain contribution conditions and must apply to become a voluntary contributor within 12 months after the end of the contribution year in which he/she was last compulsorily insured. </p><p>  A person cannot be a voluntary contributor while also an employed contributor or in receipt of credited employment contributions.</p></reply>

Amongst the supports available are the back to education allowance scheme (BTEA) and the part time education option (PTEO) for persons who will to avail of a course of education. These supports may be available to persons on qualifying social welfare payments.</p><p>  Eligibility conditions attached to BTEA include that a person must be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment, if under the age of 21 years must be out of formal education for at least two years and pursuing a full time course of education leading to a recognised qualification.  BTEA is essentially a social welfare replacement income which is paid in lieu of the relevant social welfare payment that qualifies the applicant for participation in the scheme.  </p><p>  However, if a person wishes to pursue a part time education course they may be able to do so while retaining their jobseekers payment under PTEO of the back to education programme.

Indeed, for many unemployed people, unemployment is a short-term experience and the jobseeker&rsquo;s schemes have an important role to play in supporting people through periods of involuntary unemployment.</p><p>  The replacement rate for given income levels measures the proportion of out-of-work benefits received when unemployed against take home pay if in work.  While there is no pre-determined level of replacement rate, which would influence every individual&rsquo;s decision to work, clearly the higher the replacement rate, the lower the incentive to work.  A replacement rate in excess of 70% may be considered to be excessive as the higher the replacement rate the greater the disincentive to take up offers of employment. </p><p>  The comparison of an individual&rsquo;s total income on a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment with total income equivalent to two thirds the average industrial earnings shows that;</p><p>  - 82% of Live Register claimants have a replacement rate of less than 60%;</p><p>  - 12% of Live Register  claimants have an RR above 60% but less than 70%; and</p><p>  - 6% of Live Register claimants have an RR above 70% but less than 80%</p><p>  This demonstrates that for the overwhelming majority of social welfare recipients, replacement rates are relatively low and therefore availing of an employment opportunity is financially worthwhile. This finding is supported by analysis conducted by the ESRI. </p><p>  I recognise that a changing labour market has resulted in a move away from the more traditional work patterns, with a consequent increase in the number of casual workers. In fact, the number of casual workers in receipt of a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment has increased more than four-fold over the last seven years. In acknowledgement of this trend, my Department is considering the future structure of the jobseeker schemes. A key feature of this work will be ensuring that social welfare recipients, including those who work part-time, continue to have a significant financial incentive to avail of an employment opportunity. </p></reply>

Ordinary employees who have access to the full range of social insurance benefits pay Class A PRSI at the rate of 4%.  In addition, their employers make a PRSI contribution of 10.75% in respect of their employees, resulting in the payment of a combined 14.75% rate per employee under full-rate PRSI Class A.

The Group has been considering the issue of social insurance cover for the self-employed and will submit its report once its examination of the various questions has been completed.  </p><p>  The third Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund, as at 31 December 2010, was completed by consultants KPMG in June 2012 and laid before each House of the Oireachtas on 24 August 2012.   The Review covers a 55 year period from 2011&#8211;2066 and builds on the findings of the 2000 and 2005 Actuarial Reviews of the Fund.</p><p>  One of the issues examined in the 2010 Review was the long-term cost implications to the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) and the break-even contribution rates required to provide invalidity pensions to the self-employed and to provide jobseeker&#8217;s benefit for self-employed workers.  The report found that the effective annual rate of contribution, or the required contribution as a percentage of salary, needed to provide the core full-rate State pension (contributory), which is the benefit currently available to self-employed contributors, is approximately 15%.  This compares favourably with the 4% rate currently paid by the self-employed.  An incremental increase in contribution rates from approximately 15% to 16% would be required if jobseeker&#8217;s benefit in addition to core State pension (contributory) is provided.  The average contribution rate required for the core State pension (contributory) plus jobseeker&#8217;s benefit and the invalidity pension is estimated to be in the region of 17.3%.</p><p>  Any proposals to revise the social insurance system for self-employed persons by extending social insurance entitlements will have to be considered in a budgetary context, taking account of the finding of the Actuarial Review that the self-employed achieve very good value for money compared with the employed &#8211; when the comparison includes both employer and employee contributions in respect of the employed person.  </p><p>  Self-employed workers may access social welfare supports by establishing eligibility to assistance-based payments such as jobseeker&#8217;s allowance and disability allowance.  In the case of jobseeker&#8217;s allowance they can apply for the means-tested jobseeker&#8217;s allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.  In general, their means will take account of the level of earnings in the last twelve months in determining their expected income for the following year and, in the current climate, account is taken of the downward trend in the economy.  As in the case of a non-self-employed claimant for jobseeker&#8217;s allowance or disability allowance, the means of husband/wife, civil partner or cohabitant will be taken into account in deciding on entitlement to a payment.</p></reply>

The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer. There are currently approximately 87,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided &euro;403 million for 2013.   As the Department funds a significant proportion of private sector rented accommodation it is essential that State supports for rents are kept under review. The purpose of the rent limit review was to ensure availability of accommodation for rent supplement tenancies and not to provide rent supplement tenants with access to all housing in all areas.</p><p>  The maximum rent limits came into force on 1 January 2012 and are in place until June 2013. These limits were set after an analysis of the most up to date market data available. For all counties, major urban population centres were tested as part of the rents review to ensure that rent supplement applicants can access temporary housing arrangements whilst seeking employment opportunities. The emphasis of the rent limit review was to ensure that maximum value for money for tenants and the taxpayer was achieved whilst at the same time ensuring that people on rent supplement are not priced out of the market. Approximately 56,600 rent supplement claims have been awarded since January 2012, showing that accommodation can be secured within the revised limits.  </p><p>  Analysis of a leading property website shows that for Dublin there are properties available within the maximum rent limits for rent supplement recipients. Over 32,500 persons in receipt of rent supplement reside in Dublin. Based on current analysis, there is accommodation available within the Fingal rent limits for both two and three bedroom properties. The number of rental properties available in Dublin 15 is somewhat lower than the numbers available in the rest of Fingal and therefore impacts on the number of accommodation units available for rent supplement.</p><p>  Officials in the Department continue to examine the impact of the rent limits on those who claim rent supplement and continue to ensure that accommodation needs for recipients can be met.  The next review of rent limits is being undertaken before June 2013 and any changes to the existing limits will be considered as part of this process. </p></reply>

There are approximately 14,000 mortgage interest supplement recipients for which the Government has provided &euro;42 million for in 2013.   Mortgage interest supplement is normally calculated to ensure that a person, after the payment of his or her mortgage interest, has an income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) appropriate to their family circumstances, less a minimum contribution which recipients are required to pay from their own resources. The weekly minimum contribution is &euro;30 for single adult households and &euro;35 for coupled households.  Many recipients pay more than this amount because recipients are also required, subject to income disregards, to contribute any additional assessable means that they have over and above the appropriate basic SWA rate towards their accommodation costs. </p><p>  The mortgage interest assessment provides for a gradual withdrawal of payment as hours of employment or earnings increase. Those availing of part-time employment and/or training opportunities can continue to receive mortgage interest supplement subject to their satisfying the standard means assessment rules. Where a person has additional income in excess of the standard weekly rate of SWA, the first &euro;75 of such additional income together with 25% of any additional income above &euro;75 is disregarded for means assessment purposes. </p><p>  Mortgage interest supplement claimants participating on a T&Uacute;S work placement scheme are treated in the same way as any other person engaged in part-time employment and any additional income arising from participation on the work placement is subject to the additional income disregard. </p><p>  The means test ensures that those returning to part-time work or participating in training schemes are better off as a result of taking up such opportunities.</p></reply>

It should also be noted that the Momentum initiative only represents a small percentage of the over 450,000 state-funded places provided in 2012 in further education, higher education and training, namely: 75,000 F&Aacute;S training places in 2012; 180,000 Further Education places 162,000 full-time Higher Education places, through Universities and Institutes of Technology across the country; Over 40,000 training places through Skillnets, including 8,000 for the unemployed, in partnership with private employers; Over 6,000 Springboard, free part-time higher education, places in 2012, with additional places to be announced for this year.</p><p>  Eligibility for accessing many of these interventions is not contingent on receipt of a social welfare payment or signing for credited contributions. Extension of the initiative to those not associated with the Live Register is not being considered given the current size and construct of the Live Register, in particular the numbers of people who are now long-term unemployed.</p></reply>

The 1987 Act sets out the statutory provisions in relation to the general use of metal detectors to search for archaeological objects on any lands and the particular requirements applying to their use on protected monuments and archaeological sites. Detectors may be used only under the terms of Consents issued by the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht to named individuals for a specific site or sites only.  In practice, such Consents are issued for professional archaeological purposes only.

The biogas that is produced can be used to generate electricity, provide heat or can be used as a biofuel in the transport sector.  Biogas can also be upgraded by removing impurities to create biomethane, a direct substitute for Natural Gas, which can be injected directly into the natural gas network.</p><p>  The REFIT scheme for biomass (REFIT3), which was opened in February 2012, is designed to incentivise the addition of 310 Megawatts (MW) of renewable electricity capacity from bioenergy to the Irish electricity grid.  A number of technologies are being supported by REFIT3 including anaerobic digestion with 50 MW allocated for AD technologies.  These technologies include Combined Heat and Power (CHP) where the heat created in the generation process is also used.</p><p>  The REFIT schemes operate by guaranteeing a minimum price for renewable electricity generated and exported to the grid over a 15 year period.  The current minimum prices payable for AD technologies are as follows:</p><p>  AD CHP (units up to 500 kW) 		&euro;156.516 per Megawatt Hour</p><p>  AD CHP (units greater than 500 kW) 	&euro;135.647 per MWh</p><p>  AD (non CHP) (up to 500 kW) 		&euro;114.779 per MWh</p><p>  AD (non CHP) (greater than 500 kW) 	&euro;104.344 per MWh.</p><p>  The Biofuel Obligation Scheme, which has been in operation since 2010, works by obligating large road transport fuel suppliers to bring a certain amount of sustainable biofuels to the market.  If placed on the market as a transport fuel, gaseous biofuels such as biogas or biomethane could be counted towards a fuel supplier&rsquo;s biofuel obligation.  As the biofuel market increases in line with the biofuel obligation, opportunities for indigenous biofuel production will increase also.  This, in turn, may provide further opportunities for anaerobic digestion.</p><p>  Further analysis is required on a cross-Departmental basis on the economic, technical and regulatory aspects of injecting biomethane into the gas grid.</p></reply>

Prior to the commencement of the NBS, a detailed mapping exercise was carried out to determine those areas that would be included in the Scheme and those which, by virtue of being already substantially served by existing broadband suppliers, could not be included.

There is no general exemption for estates that have not been taken in charge.</p><p>  Section 180 of the Planning and Development Act, 2000 applies to estates which have been granted planning permission and includes the construction of two or more houses (which as defined in the Act includes apartments) and the provision of new roads, open spaces, car parks, sewers, watermains or drains.</p><p>  In relation to estates which have been completed to the satisfaction of the planning authority in accordance with the permission, section 180 provides that the planning authority must if requested to do so by the developer or by the majority of the qualified electors who are owners of the houses involved, initiate the procedures in section 11 of the Roads Act 1993 for declaring the road(s) to be public roads, for whose maintenance the local authority will then be responsible.</p><p>  Section 11 of the Roads Act empowers a local authority to, by order, declare any road over which a public right of way exists to be a public road. Before making an order the local authority must be satisfied the road is of general public utility, consider the financial implications of taking the road in charge and consult with the public/consider any objections received. The consideration of the objections and the making of the order declaring the road to be a public road is a reserved function, so that the decision whether to take the road in charge is ultimately one for the discretion of the elected members.</p><p>  In relation to estates which have not been completed to the satisfaction of the planning authority and enforcement proceedings have not been commenced within the relevant period section 180 also provides that the planning authority must, if requested to do so by the majority of the owners, initiate the procedures in section 11 of the Roads Act. However, in this case the section provides that the provision in section 11 of the Roads Act requiring the authority to consider the financial implications of taking the road in charge is to be disregarded.</p><p>  Section 180 also provides that where a planning authority, in complying with section 180, makes an order under section 11 of the Roads Act, it must also take in charge any open spaces, car parks, sewers, watermains, or drains within the attendant grounds of the development.</p><p>  Section 180 was amended in the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2010 to provide that a planning authority may take in charge an unfinished estate, at the request of the owners of the housing units, at any time after the expiration of the planning permission, in situations where enforcement actions have commenced or where the planning authority consider that enforcement action will not result in the satisfactory completion of the estate by the developer. Planning authorities have also been empowered to take in charge part of an estate or some, but not all, of the facilities in an estate.</p></reply>

My Department and individual local authorities have a responsibility to ensure that mortgage lending is prudentially based and that the capacity of a borrower fully to service a loan over the full term is realistically assessed and stress-tested. Provisions governing mortgage lending by local authorities are set out under the Housing (Local Authority Loans) Regulations 2012 and associated credit policy.</p><p>  Local authorities are advised to examine each loan application on its own merits in determining whether an applicant is eligible for a house purchase loan. It is the case that the rate of refusal of applications has increased since the credit policy was introduced. However, it is also clear that the loans issued under that credit policy are more likely to be fully performing. The final decision on whether to grant/refuse an applicant lies solely with the relevant local authority, and all local authorities must satisfy themselves on the financial risk they are undertaking.</p><p>  I consider that the current arrangements for mortgage lending are fair and adequately meet the needs of prospective home owners in a prudent manner.</p></reply>

In its membership, drawn primarily from the local government and local development sectors, I believe that the Implementation Group has the correct focus; while it is not intended to extend the membership, it is open to the Group to consult as required with their nominating bodies so as to fairly and accurately represent key stakeholders and, also, to invite other stakeholder representatives affected by the alignment process to participate where required.</p></reply>

The charge is set at &euro;200 and liability for it falls, in the main, on owners of rental, holiday and vacant properties. It is a matter for an owner, whether resident in Ireland or elsewhere, to determine if he or she has a liability and, if so, to declare that liability and pay the charge.</p><p>  The provision of information to potentially liable owners was regarded as an important element in the introduction of the Non-Principal Private Residence Charge in 2009 and in subsequent years. The associated communication campaign, including media advertisements funded by my Department, information made available by local authorities, and website hosted information, in circumstances in which the legal onus is on the liable owner to declare liability and make payment, has achieved its general goals of raising awareness and encouraging compliance. Much of this information, such as information available online and press advertisements aimed at Irish communities living abroad, was available to liable persons resident outside of the country.</p><p>  Under the Act, it is a function of a local authority to collect the Non-Principal Private Residence Charge and late payment fees due to it, and all charges and late payment fees imposed and payable to a local authority are under the care and management of the local authority concerned. In this regard, application of the legislation in particular circumstances is a matter for the relevant local authority. Guidelines have also been issued to local authorities in relation to the operation of the &ldquo;care and management&rdquo; provisions of the Local Government (Charges) Act 2009 and local authorities are expected to implement these guidelines appropriately.</p></reply>

They specify requirements in relation to a range of matters such as structural repair, sanitary facilities, heating, ventilation, natural light and safety of gas and electrical supply. All landlords have a legal obligation to ensure that their rented properties comply with these regulations and responsibility for the enforcement of the regulations rests with the relevant local authority supported by a dedicated stream of funding provided from part of the proceeds of tenancy registration fees collected by the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB).</p><p>  On 1 February 2013, Articles 6, 7 and 8 of the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2008 came into effect for all existing residential rented accommodation. This means, <i>inter alia</i>, that all rental accommodation must now have its own separate sanitary facilities.  The requirements in relation to heating and facilities for cooking, food storage and laundry have also been updated.</p><p>  The Regulations took effect in their entirety for all rented properties being let for the first time from 1 February 2009. However, in some cases Articles 6, 7 and 8 of the regulations may have required significant refurbishment works for existing tenancies and as such a four year phasing-in period was afforded to these properties to facilitate any improvement works that needed to be carried out. This phasing-in period was introduced to take account of views expressed in wide-ranging consultations during the development of the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2008 that it would be necessary to allow time for the carrying out of any significant remedial work that could be involved in achieving compliance. My Department keeps the appropriateness of the current standards under review and it engages on a regular basis with local authorities on the implementation and enforcement of the significantly strengthened current standards.</p></reply>

The Action Programme proposes rates harmonisation to cater for differences between Annual Rates on Valuation (ARVs) of towns and counties. My approach to rates harmonisation will seek to ensure, on the one hand, that harmonisation does not lead to significant net loss of revenue in individual counties with consequential implications for services, and on the other hand, that increases in rates do not impact negatively on businesses and employment.  Definitive details, arrangements and procedures in relation to the funding of district level functions, and financial relations between district and county levels, will be developed in the context of the new local government funding arrangements generally, implementation of the new sub-county system and preparation of the legislation in relation to the reform programme.</p></reply>

Prior to this the LEADER elements were co-funded at a rate of 55% by the EU, with the remaining 45% coming from national exchequer sources. The 2011 agreement reduced the national exchequer input to 15% on a net basis for 2012 and 2013 without a concomitant increase in the amount of funding to be provided by the EU. This resulted in a reduction in the overall Programme complement from &euro;427m to approximately &euro;314m on the basis of the Programme achieving full spend by the end of 2013.</p><p>  However, given the levels of spending by the Local Development Companies (LDCs) from 2009 to date, it is very unlikely that full spend will be achieved by the end of 2013, at which time the co-funding rate will revert to 55% for all expenditure beyond that date. As a consequence of this the overall Programme requirement will change. In the context of these changes to the co-funding rate the original project allocations given to each LDC contracted to deliver the LEADER elements of the RDP require readjustment.  An exercise is currently being carried out to determine the level of project commitments across all LDCs and all RDP measures in order to rebalance the programme in as equitable a way as possible.  It will not be possible to be definitive regarding the remaining funding available for project commitments until such time as this rebalancing exercise has been satisfactorily completed. I expect this exercise to be completed shortly.</p></reply>

The guidelines are also intended to ensure a consistency of approach throughout the country in the identification of suitable locations for wind energy development and the treatment of planning applications for such developments. In order to ensure that Ireland continues to meet its renewable energy targets and, at the same time, that wind energy does not have negative impacts on local communities my Department, in conjunction with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and other stakeholders, is undertaking a targeted review of certain aspects of the Wind Energy Guidelines 2006.  This focused review will examine the manner in which the Guidelines address key issues of community concern such as noise, proximity and visual amenity and any other potential impacts, as considered appropriate, as well as ways of building community support for wind energy development.</p><p>  All statutory planning guidelines issue first in draft form for a public consultation over a period of a couple of months. Once the consultation period is closed the submissions received on the draft guidelines are considered and taken into account in the final form of the guidelines. The draft guidelines will &ndash; like all other new or revised guidelines &ndash; go out for extensive public consultation for a period of 6 weeks to 2 months. The indicative timetable for the publication of the draft guidelines is Quarter 3 or Quarter 4 2013.  I do not think it either appropriate or necessary to impose a moratorium on planning applications for wind energy development at this time.</p></reply>

In allocating the available funding across all 34 city and county councils I did so in as transparent and as fair a way as possible. In framing the 2013 allocations, my Department wrote to each local authority requesting details of the numbers and value of grants where work had been approved to commence.  Between them, local authorities reported contractual commitments in respect of approved grants totally &euro;18 million.  This year I allocated local authorities the full amount of their contractual commitments which, in the case of Dublin City Council, amounted to &euro;2,906,500.  The balance of the available funding was allocated on the basis of each authority&rsquo;s share of the new applications on hand in January 2013. This brought Dublin City Council&rsquo;s overall allocation to &euro;4,932,319.56.  In order to deal with any acute or particular difficulty which might arise in the operation of the schemes over the course of the year I have set aside a small capital reserve.  My Department will consider applications from local authorities for a supplementary allocation in such cases.</p></reply>

A key role of the Authority is to set and enforce standards in the provision of property services by auctioneers, letting agents and property management agents and to provide redress mechanisms for consumers of those services.  The Authority administers a system of investigation and adjudication of complaints and investigates all complaints where it is alleged that a Property Services Provider has engaged in improper conduct.  All such complaints must be made in writing and a complaint form is available on the Authority's website www.psr.ie.</p><p>  Where, on completion of an investigation, the Authority is satisfied that the property services provider has engaged in improper conduct, it may impose any of the following sanctions:<blockquote>- issue a reprimand, warning, caution or advice to the property service provider;<br /><br />- revoke the property service provider's licence;<br /><br />- suspend the property service provider's licence for a specified period;<br /><br />- direct the property service provider to pay: - up to &#8364;50,000 to the Property Services Compensation Fund;<br /><br />- up to &#8364;50,000 to the Authority towards the cost of the investigation;<br /><br />- up to &#8364;250,000 to the Authority by way of a financial penalty, or<br /><br />- any combination of the foregoing.</blockquote></p></reply>

It is the responsibility of all non EEA nationals who are resident in the State to ensure that they have an appropriate permission from the Minister for Justice and Equality.  Most migrants do in fact comply with this condition and obey the State's immigration laws.  Clearly, all illegal immigrant cases are not the same and must be dealt with on a case by case basis taking account of their individual circumstances.  At one end of the scale are those where the person's illegal status is through no fault of their own and indeed the Department continue to deal with cases of this nature on an ongoing basis.  However there are also much more egregious instances of immigration abuse, often at considerable expense to the State and it does not follow that such persons should profit from their conduct.</p><p>  At EU Level, the Member States, in agreeing the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum at the European Council in October 2008 made specific commitments "to use only case-by-case regularisation, rather than generalised regularisation, under national law, for humanitarian or economic reasons".  While the Pact is not legally binding, the political commitment among Member States, then and now, is clearly against any form of process that would in any way legitimise the status of those unlawfully present without first examining the merits of their individual cases.  In our case there are also considerations based on maintaining the integrity of the Common Travel Area with the UK which must be taken into account.</p><p>  In looking at cases as they arise, among the issues that would be relevant to the outcome would be the circumstances in which the person became undocumented, the length of time they have been in that situation, their prospects of being able to gain lawful employment without being a drain on the financial resources of the State such as the welfare, health, housing and education areas, along with the more general considerations applicable to immigration decisions, including any family related rights they may have in the context of the European Convention on Human Rights.  Sometimes case by case consideration will result in a positive outcome for the applicant.  However, in other cases this may result in a decision by the Irish authorities, subject to the oversight of our Courts, that the person has to go home.  That decision should be respected.</p><p>  The Deputy may be aware that employment legislation in respect of immigrants is a matter for the Minister of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  I understand his Department is currently developing new legislative proposals in the area of work permits to ensure inter alia that an employer may not benefit from the illegality of the contract of employment where they are found culpable in not ensuring a valid employment permit was in place for the employee concerned.</p></reply>

The Land Registration (Fees) Order 2012 (S.I. No. 380 of 2012), which came into effect on 1 December 2012, introduced new fees for Land Registry services.  Section 21(2) of the Registration of Deeds and Title Act 2006 provides that registration fees shall not be fixed at a level calculated to produce an annual amount which is less than that sufficient to discharge the operational cost and expenses under the Act, i.e. fees are to be set at a level sufficient to meet the full cost associated with Property Registration Authority services.</p><p>  It should be noted that the land registry fees had not been adjusted since 2000, which was a key reason for the need for a significant increase in the level of charges to ensure that the fees cover the cost of Property Registration Authority services.  Notwithstanding the fact that Land Registry fees are paid into and disposed of for the benefit of the Exchequer, they constitute payment for the registration and other services provided by the Authority and the State-guaranteed title that results from registration and are not, therefore, a tax.</p></reply>

There is also provision contained in Section 3 (2) in relation to begging at certain locations, including at or near automated teller machines or vending machines, and members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may direct a person begging at such a location to leave the vicinity in a peaceable and orderly manner.  Section 4 of the Act also gives Garda&iacute; powers of arrest without warrant where there is reasonable grounds to believe that offences under this legislation have been committed.</p><p>  In addition to these provisions, Section 247 of the Children Act, 2001 provides for an offence of causing, procuring or allowing children to beg, and Garda&iacute; have powers of arrest under section 254 of the 2001 Act where there is reasonable grounds to suspect that such an offence has been committed or attempted.</p><p>  I am informed that Garda&iacute; in Dublin City Centre have been targeting begging at or near cash machines and vending machines such as Luas ticketing machines.  High visibility foot patrols are conducted in areas of high footfall in conjunction with plain clothes operations which specifically target begging.</p><p>  The Deputy will appreciate that the issue of begging is a wider societal problem which needs to be tackled through an inter-agency approach rather than depending solely on law enforcement.  In this regard, a proactive strategy led by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na involving an inter-agency partnership approach has been developed.  The objective of this initiative is to develop a long-term strategy that will address the issue holistically and not only through the Criminal Justice System.</p></reply>

As regards existing ground rents, Part III of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No.2) Act 1978 contains a statutory scheme whereby a person may, at reasonable cost, acquire the fee simple in their dwelling.  To date, over 80,000 applicants have acquired freehold title to their property under this scheme.  In the case of property other than dwellings, the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act 1967 contains provisions which facilitate acquisition of the fee simple subject to agreed terms or on terms set out in an arbitration carried out by the County Registrar. </p><p>  The position regarding ground rents was considered by the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution in their 2004 Report 'Private Property'.  The Committee took the view that a ground landlord's ground rent is a form of property right which is constitutionally protected and that abolition of such rents would be unconstitutional in the absence of adequate monetary compensation.  The Committee also noted that where leases were approaching expiry, any legislation providing for the abolition of ground rents would have to provide for the payment of enhanced compensation by the ground tenant.  In light of the foregoing, I have no immediate plans to introduce further legislation in this area.  Operation of the existing law will, however, be kept under review by my Department.  <b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p></reply>

However, the Garda authorities have concluded that the current arrangement whereby Garda vehicles are purchased through an open tender procedure represents the most efficient use of available resources as, in particular, it secures bulk discounts for Force.</p><p>  I am advised by the Garda authorities that the deployment of Garda transport is determined on the basis of ongoing analysis and review of the policing needs of each Garda Division to ensure that the available resources are utilised to best advantage to meet the operational requirements of the Force.  Garda patrol vehicles are taken out of service for a variety of reasons, including as a result of accidents or when the odometer reading reaches the safety limit set by the relevant manufacturer.  </p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, I made an additional &#8364;3 million available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na towards the end of last year, enabling the Force to procure a total of 213 vehicles in 2012.  This is approximately the same as the total number of vehicles purchased in 2009, 2010 and 2011 combined under budgets brought in by the previous Government.</p><p>  In addition, a further allocation of &#8364;5 million has been provided for the purchase and fit-out of Garda transport in 2013.  This represents a very considerable financial investment in Garda transport, particularly at a time when the level of funding available across the public sector is severely limited.  It is a clear indication of my commitment to ensure that, to the greatest extent possible, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are provided with sufficient resources to enable them to provide an effective and efficient policing service.  <b><font color="#000080">   </font></b></p></reply>

The facility was to be built on a site owned by Dublin City Council in Marino, Dublin 3.  A contract was awarded and the project commenced but the building contractor went into receivership in late 2010 leaving the build at a very early stage of completion.  Following the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure there was insufficient funding available under the current capital envelope to finance the original project; nor was there any possibility of State funding being made available in the foreseeable future.  As a result, other options to recommence and fund the project were examined including the completion of the build under a Public Private Partnership (PPP) arrangement.</p><p>  Consequentially, the project was initially included in the PPP as a mechanism to access capital funding to complete the build.  Following the examination of the project in detail under the PPP process, it became clear that the PPP was not the most appropriate mechanism for accessing finance to complete the build given its relatively small scale and the specialised and complex nature of the build.  As a consequence the project has been withdrawn from the PPP process.</p><p>  Given the identified deficiencies in the current facilities and accommodation available to the Office of the State Pathologist and the Dublin Coroner it is considered essential that action must be taken to provide more suitable facilities in the short to medium term.  An alternative proposal is therefore being considered which is to utilise the former Whitehall Garda Station as a site to provide different and more scaled down facilities.  Compared to a new build this option would obviously provide a more limited and less technically sophisticated range of services but it would address some of the key concerns while retaining some of the benefits of the shared approach.  This proposal is subject to assessment as regards suitability and a full analysis of the costs involved.  However, it is believed that this option now presents the best mechanism to address the current problems in the shortest time period and at the least cost to the State.  A Project Team has been established to develop the proposal and make recommendations in this regard.</p></reply>

An examination of this case indicated that this person arrived in Ireland on 17 August 2006 and was registered in the State as a Student until 30 November 2012.  There are no undue delays in processing cases in this category involving 'timed-out' students; in many jurisdictions cases involving persons who entered as students and who seek to remain as permanent migrants are rejected automatically whereas in others, decisions can take many years to be finalised.  I am advised that this case is being assessed on its merits and will be decided upon in the coming weeks.</p><p>  All non-EEA students resident in the State are subject to the student immigration rules set out under the "new immigration regime for full time non-EEA students" which was published in September 2010 and has been in effect since 1 January 2011.  These rules stipulate that non-EEA nationals may reside in Ireland as students, subject to the provisions of the new regime, for a maximum period of seven years.  As this person arrived in the State in 2006 he is now classified as a timed out Student.</p><p>  On the matter raised by the Deputy on the numbers seeking leave to remain in the State, for the sake of clarity, I should state that there are a number of categories of immigrants who could be so classified.  The categories in this respect include cases such as those comprehended by the person in the Question - i.e. students and timed-out students.  The number in this category is approximately 2,000 and essentially represents the ongoing "work in progress" workload.</p><p>  Other categories include failed asylum seekers, applicants for subsidiary protection and humanitarian leave to remain.  Other immigrants such as those who come here on short-term visas and wish to remain for longer periods, persons who have been here unlawfully for lengthy periods and who have been detected by the Garda&iacute; as well as those who no longer have lawful immigration status make up the remaining caseload.  By definition, this caseload varies over time and without engaging in a major detailed exercise, it is not possible to state the numbers in these categories.</p><p>  However, I can say that the entire caseload for the first two months of this year on all aspects of immigration, including naturalisation, registrations, EU Treaty Rights, visas, family reunification, long-term residency, investor programmes, asylum and related applications, as well as general applications for leave to remain and so forth, amounted to in excess of 40,000.</p></reply>

The purpose of the discussion document is to facilitate a public consultation process.

Publication of the discussion document follows the Minister&#8217;s announcement that he would be arranging a public consultation process as part of the current review of prostitution legislation. Announcing publication of the discussion document, Minister Shatter said:<br /><br /><b>&quot;The criminal law in this area is being reviewed primarily because of the changed nature of prostitution in Ireland. Prostitution was once mainly a street-based phenomenon. That is no longer the case. The organisation of prostitution is now much more sophisticated, highly mobile and is easily facilitated by the use of mobile phones and the internet.</b><br /><br /><b>There is, of course, already a clear consensus on the great evils of child prostitution and trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation. However, I am aware that there are differing and genuinely held views on the approach the criminal law should take to other aspects of prostitution. While there is a significant amount of criminal legislation in this area already, there is always scope for change and improvement. It is important to review the law periodically to ensure it is up to date and comprehensively responds to altered circumstances.&quot;</b><br /><br />The Minister added that:   <b>&quot;Prostitution is an issue which affects individuals, communities and society as a whole. It is important that I facilitate the expression of all views on this subject and that those views are examined in due course. Public debate should therefore, be open to the widest possible audience and I want to ensure that everyone who wishes to make a contribution to this important debate is given the opportunity to do so. It is for that reason I have decided on a consultation process before charting the way forward.</b><br /><br /><b>My Department will hold a conference in the autumn to discuss the document. The widest possible participation will be encouraged in order that we have an open and transparent discussion on all aspects of this very important issue.</b><br /><br /><b>This discussion document will now be referred to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence. Interested groups and members of the public, I expect, will be invited to make submissions to the Committee which will hold such hearings as it deems appropriate. I am asking Mr. David Stanton T.D., Chairman of the Joint Committee, that it publish its report and recommendations by the 30th November 2012 and that the report be furnished to me together with any submissions received. I expect it is likely that the Committee&#8217;s report will also be lodged in the Oireachtas Library and that a debate on it will subsequently take place in both the D&aacute;il and the Seanad. The report received by me from the Joint Oireachtas Committee will be fully considered in the framing of any necessary new legislative proposals to be submitted to Government in due course.</b><br /><br /><b>I look forward to the results of the consultation process.&quot;</b><br /><br />The discussion document is attached below and will be made available on the Department&#8217;s website, <br /><br />This discussion document does not favour any particular approach but simply tries to assist reflection. The arguments contained in the document are not exhaustive and the questions posed are not intended to limit in any way the range of questions readers might want to consider.<br /><br />22 June, 2012</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></p></reply>

I met with Irish troops serving with UNDOF, the UN monitoring force on the Golan Heights, and was briefed on security issues in that area, especially the growing risks flowing from instability in Syria. I also engaged in trade promotion activities, attended a business breakfast organised by the IDA and the Embassy, and attended the Israel launch of the Ireland-Israel Business Network. I attended Saint Patrick&rsquo;s Day events held in East Jerusalem and in Tel Aviv.</p><p>  In relation to the general Israeli-Palestinian conflict, I received briefings and had a number of discussions on the overall political situation. In Israel I met with politicians including the outgoing and incoming Ministers for Justice, with Itzhak Herzog the Deputy Leader of the opposition Labour Party, and others. In the West Bank I met with senior PLO leader Nabil Shaath, with the Palestinian Minister for Justice. I was also briefed on the EU&rsquo;s police training mission with the Palestinian police, which Ireland has strongly supported. I also had a breakfast meeting in Jerusalem with various NGOs and UN agencies.</p><p>  My discussions were intended, both as a member of the Government and as a member of the Oireachtas with a long standing interest in the conflict, to explore informally the difficulties facing the parties and the peace process, and the prospects for renewed movement towards a comprehensive peace. I of course reiterated at all points the Irish Government&rsquo;s strong and consistent support for a two state solution resulting in a sovereign State of Palestine existing peacefully alongside a secure Israel. I also stated the Government&rsquo;s support for the resumption of talks between both sides.</p><p>  The incoming Minister for Justice, Tzipi Livni, was the Foreign Minister during a previous serious effort at negotiations with the Palestinians, and is well known for her strong commitment to the peace process. She has been designated to lead the negotiations with the Palestinian side for the new Israeli Government. My discussions with her therefore focussed very much on this perspective, and were informative and encouraging. I did not raise with her aspects of specific policies in the military administration of the West Bank. I am aware that these issues have however been raised with the Israeli authorities by my colleague the T&aacute;naiste and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, both bilaterally and through EU engagement.</p></reply>

The following table illustrates the number of drivers who provided a preliminary breath sample at the scene of a fatal or serious injury collision during that period.</p><p><table><tr><th><div>-</div></th><th><div>Fatal Collision</div></th><th><div>Serious Injury Collision</div></th></tr><tr><td>Total no. drivers</td><td><div>208</div></td><td><div>403</div></td></tr><tr><td>Total no. drivers provided a preliminary breath sample at collision scene</td><td><div> 80</div></td><td><div>144</div></td></tr></table></p><p>  I am further informed that analysis of incidents recorded show that 128 drivers involved in a fatal collision and 259 drivers involved in a serious injury collision were not tested at the roadside for a number of reasons.  The following table sets out the reasons a preliminary breath sample was not taken at the roadside at the scene of a fatal or serious injury during the period 1 January, 2012 and 31 December, 2012.</p><p><table><tr><th>Reason preliminary breath sample not taken at roadside</th><th><div>Fatal Collision </div></th><th><div>Serious Injury Collision</div></th></tr><tr><td>Driver deceased</td><td><div>74</div></td><td><div>-</div></td></tr><tr><td>Driver taken to hospital</td><td><div>35</div></td><td><div>136</div></td></tr><tr><td>Garda opinion - testing not required</td><td><div>9</div></td><td><div>52</div></td></tr><tr><td>Medical grounds</td><td><div>4</div></td><td><div>36</div></td></tr><tr><td>Insufficient time / Collision reported at Garda station</td><td><div>2</div></td><td><div>5</div></td></tr><tr><td>Serious injury of driver</td><td><div>1</div></td><td><div>12</div></td></tr><tr><td>Hit and run collision</td><td><div>1</div></td><td><div>6</div></td></tr><tr><td>Garda&iacute; unable to ascertain driver identity</td><td><div>1</div></td><td><div>0</div></td></tr><tr><td>Sample to be taken at hospital</td><td><div>1</div></td><td><div>4</div></td></tr><tr><td>Sample to be taken at Garda station</td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>3</div></td></tr><tr><td>No screening device available within allowed time (1 hour)</td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>3</div></td></tr><tr><td>Scene of collision not a public place</td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td>Collision not investigated at scene</td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td>Total no. drivers who  did not provide a preliminary breath sample at collision scene</td><td><div>128</div></td><td><div>259</div></td></tr></table></p><p>   I am advised that in respect of those drivers recorded as being involved in a fatal collision who were not tested at the scene of the collision, 14 drivers subsequently provided a blood/urine sample at the hospital and 3 drivers subsequently provided a sample at a Garda station.  In total, 93 drivers are recorded as being tested either at the roadside, hospital, or Garda station.  I am also advised that in respect of those drivers recorded as being involved in a serious injury collision that were not tested at the scene of the collision, 48 drivers subsequently provided a blood/urine sample at the hospital and 10 drivers subsequently provided a sample at a Garda station.  In total, 200 drivers were recorded as being tested either at the roadside, hospital or Garda station.I am further advised by the Garda authorities that each collision can have a very contrasting set of circumstances and the preservation of life is paramount. In that regard, instructions have been issued to members of an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na emphasising the mandatory requirement to breath test drivers at the scene of both fatal and serious injury collisions taking into account the particular circumstances arising in incidents of serious injury.  I can also inform the Deputy that my colleague the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and I have since received assurances from the Garda authorities that every effort is being made to ensure the relevant legislative provisions are fully complied with.  These measures include communication with all Garda members through a series of instructions and Directives from Garda Headquarters as well as Monthly Tactical Assessments by Garda management on the level of compliance.</p></reply>

The fee increases introduced at that time merely brought the amounts in line with inflation since the previous increase in 1993.<font color="#FF0000"> </font>The standard certification fee is &#8364;950 while a reduced fee of &#8364;200 applies in the case of an application made on behalf of a minor or in certain circumstances when the application is made by a widow, widower or surviving civil partner of an Irish citizen. In the case of refugees and stateless persons no certification fee is charged.  I consider it appropriate that the fee is reduced or eliminated for these categories of applicants.</p><p>  In November 2011, I signed into law Statutory Instrument 569/11, which introduced an application fee of &#8364;175 for new applications for a certificate of naturalisation.  Managing and dealing with incomplete applications consumes scarce processing resources and the application fee is designed to recoup some of the costs associated with the application process.  The application fee is also intended to help cover costs associated with the processing of unsuccessful applications that often consume more processing time and resources than successful applications, but which previously attracted no fee.</p><p>  The costs incurred in facilitating each naturalisation request are very complex as multiple external agencies, such as the Garda&iacute;, and divisions within my Department provide services at various times to the Citizenship Division. The fees are therefore designed to reflect the effort and cost involved in processing applications for a certificate of naturalisation. These costs cannot be readily identified without engaging in a major and time consuming exercise which I do not believe would be warranted at a time of shrinking resources.</p><p>  Efforts to eliminate the backlog of applications, including allocation of additional resources to this work both within the Department and in external agencies, have been very successful and has resulted in an increase in fee revenue, with some &#8364;17 million being lodged to the Exchequer in 2012.</p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware I have introduced formal citizenship ceremonies at no extra cost to applicants. These have been universally well received by participants as the ceremonies provide a sense of occasion that serves to underscore the importance to both the State and the applicant of the granting of Irish citizenship.  I have no plans to alter either the application or certification fee at this time.</p></reply>

The Unit processed approximately 328,000 vetting applications on behalf of these organisations in 2012.</p><p>  The current average processing time for applications is approximately 12 weeks from date of receipt. However, seasonal fluctuations and the necessity to seek additional information on particular applications can result in this processing time being exceeded on occasion.</p><p>  In order to observe equity and fairness in respect of all applicants for Garda Vetting, standard processing procedures are such that applications are processed in chronological order, from the date of receipt at the Central Vetting Unit.  All organisations registered for Garda Vetting are aware of the processing time-frames for the receipt of Garda vetting and have been advised to factor this into their recruitment and selection process.</p><p>  I should emphasise that the certificate is a disclosure to the requesting, registered organisation of the position at the time when it is issued. Each time a new vetting application is received, new and full vetting checks are conducted. This is to ensure that the most recent data available is taken into account. The non-transferability and contemporaneous nature of the certificate protects against the risk of fraud or forgery and is a guarantee of the integrity of the vetting system. The primary purpose of the vetting process is the protection of children and vulnerable adults.  This must remain so.</p><p>  It is my objective that processing times should be kept to a minimum, while maintaining the overall integrity of the vetting system. In that regard, following recent discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, sanction was recently granted for an additional 25 staff to be re-deployed from the Department of Agriculture to the Garda Central Vetting Unit in the near future.</p><p>  The Deputy may wish to note that Garda Central Vetting Unit will become the National Vetting Bureau under the provisions of the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 and will have a substantially expanded role under that legislation.

Such transfers may be facilitated where the other country has ratified the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons.</p><p>Transfer requests under the Convention are normally made by a prisoner through the governor of the prison in which he or she is detained.  I decide on all such requests following the collation of a number of reports from various agencies setting out the consequences of such a transfer.  The consent of all three parties in the process is required prior to any transfer, i.e. the sentencing state, the receiving state and the sentenced person.</p><p>Prisoners avail of the remission rate applicable in the country into which they are transferring. For prisoners transferring from Britain to the Republic of Ireland the Irish remission rate will be applied to the portion of their sentence which is outstanding.</p><p>I can confirm to the Deputy that there has been no change since I took office in the policy regarding remission for prisoner repatriated to Irish jails from prisons in Britain or other countries. It is possible that prisoners transferring to Ireland would serve longer sentences as the Irish remission rate is 25% and in Britain it is 50%.</p><p>  The figures on the number of prisoners who have repatriated to Ireland from abroad is set out in the following table.</p><p><table><tr><th>-</th><th><div>2000</div></th><th><div>2001</div></th><th><div>2002</div></th><th><div>2003</div></th><th><div>2004</div></th><th><div>2005</div></th><th><div>2006</div></th><th><div>2007</div></th><th><div>2008</div></th><th><div>2009</div></th><th><div>2010</div></th><th><div>2011</div></th><th><div>2012</div></th><th><div>Total</div></th></tr><tr><td>UK</td><td><div>11</div></td><td><div>4</div></td><td><div>8</div></td><td><div>8</div></td><td><div>5</div></td><td><div>5</div></td><td><div>13</div></td><td><div>6</div></td><td><div>4</div></td><td><div>1</div></td><td><div>-</div></td><td><div>-</div></td><td><div>3</div></td><td><div>68</div></td></tr><tr><td>USA</td><td><div>-</div></td><td><div>-</div></td><td><div>-</div></td><td><div>-</div></td><td><div>1</div></td><td><div>-</div></td><td><div>-</div></td><td><div>-</div></td><td><div>-</div></td><td><div>-</div></td><td><div>-</div></td><td><div>-</div></td><td><div>-</div></td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td>Panama</td><td><div>-</div></td><td><div>-</div></td><td><div>-</div></td><td><div>-</div></td><td><div>1</div></td><td><div>-</div></td><td><div>-</div></td><td><div>-</div></td><td><div>-</div></td><td><div>-</div></td><td><div>-</div></td><td><div>-</div></td><td><div>-</div></td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td>Spain</td><td><div>-</div></td><td><div>-</div></td><td><div>-</div></td><td><div>-</div></td><td><div>-</div></td><td><div>-</div></td><td><div>1</div></td><td><div>1</div></td><td><div>-</div></td><td><div>1</div></td><td><div>-</div></td><td><div>-</div></td><td><div>-</div></td><td><div>3</div></td></tr><tr><td>Japan</td><td><div>-</div></td><td><div>-</div></td><td><div>-</div></td><td><div>-</div></td><td><div>-</div></td><td><div>-</div></td><td><div>-</div></td><td><div>1</div></td><td><div>-</div></td><td><div>-</div></td><td><div>-</div></td><td><div>-</div></td><td><div>-</div></td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td>Northern Ireland</td><td><div>-</div></td><td><div>-</div></td><td><div>-</div></td><td><div>-</div></td><td><div>-</div></td><td><div>-</div></td><td><div>-</div></td><td><div>-</div></td><td><div>1</div></td><td><div>-</div></td><td><div>-</div></td><td><div>-</div></td><td><div>-</div></td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td>Italy</td><td><div>-</div></td><td><div>-</div></td><td><div>-</div></td><td><div>-</div></td><td><div>-</div></td><td><div>-</div></td><td><div>-</div></td><td><div>-</div></td><td><div>-</div></td><td><div>-</div></td><td><div>-</div></td><td><div>1</div></td><td><div>-</div></td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td><div>11</div></td><td><div>4</div></td><td><div>8</div></td><td><div>8</div></td><td><div>7</div></td><td><div>5</div></td><td><div>14</div></td><td><div>8</div></td><td><div>5</div></td><td><div>2</div></td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>1</div></td><td><div>3</div></td><td><div>76</div></td></tr></table></p><p></p></reply>

The matters raised in the correspondence were addressed in a reply issued to the company on 22nd March 2013.</p><p>  In relation to vetting matters in general the Deputy will be aware that the Garda Central Vetting Unit provides employment vetting for approximately 20,000 organisations in Ireland, registered with the Unit for this purpose, which employ personnel to work in a full-time, part time, voluntary or student capacity with children and / or vulnerable adults. T  he Unit processed approximately 328,000 vetting applications on behalf of these organisations in 2012.</p><p>  In order to observe equity and fairness in respect of all applicants for Garda Vetting, standard processing procedures are such that applications are processed in chronological order, from the date of receipt at the Central Vetting Unit.  All organisations registered for Garda Vetting are aware of the processing time-frames for the receipt of Garda vetting and have been advised to factor this into their recruitment and selection process.</p><p>  It is my objective that processing times should be kept to a minimum, while maintaining the overall integrity of the vetting system. In that regard, following discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, sanction was recently granted for an additional 25 staff to be re-deployed from the Department of Agriculture to the Garda Central Vetting Unit in the near future, which should have a positive impact on processing times.</p><p>  The Deputy may also wish to note that the Garda Central Vetting Unit will become the National Vetting Bureau under the provisions of the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 and will have a substantially expanded role under that legislation. I am currently engaged with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in addressing the staffing issues relevant to the coming into force of the 2012 Act.</p></reply>

My visit to Lebanon afforded me an opportunity to see, at first hand, the dedication and professionalism of military personnel and the tremendous work done overseas by the Irish Defence Forces personnel serving as part of a joint Irish/Finnish battalion with the United Nations Interim force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) in south Lebanon. I conveyed to the troops our deep appreciation for the outstanding manner in which they continue to perform their duties on overseas service. The visit to the troops was part of a comprehensive St Patrick&rsquo;s Day programme in the Middle East.     During my visit to the Irish/Finnish battalion&rsquo;s area of operations, I received briefings on the current situation in the region and met with the UNIFIL Force Commander, General Paolo Serra of Italy. I also laid a wreath at the Memorial in Tibnin to the forty-seven members of the Defence Forces who died in Lebanon in the cause of peace.  I also met with the Lebanese Minister for Defence, Mr. Fayez Ghosn and we discussed the current security and political situation and the challenges being faced by Lebanon and how their efforts can be supported by Ireland and the international community.  I also discussed with him the current conflict in Syria and the refugee crisis, and in particular the number of Syrian refugees in the Lebanon and the supports required by Lebanon from the EU.</p><p>  In Israel, I visited the Golan Heights and I met with Irish Defence Forces personnel who are serving with the UN Truce Supervision Organisation as unarmed Military Observers in support of UNDOF, the UN monitoring force on the Golan Heights, and the Head of Mission and Force Commander of UNDOF, Major General Iqbal Singh Singha of India.  I was briefed on security issues in that area, especially the growing risks flowing from instability in Syria and the impact of the refugee crisis in the region. While in Israel, I also engaged in trade promotion activities, attended a business breakfast organised by the IDA and the Embassy, and attended the Israel launch of the Ireland-Israel Business Network. I attended the 45th anniversary celebration of the Ireland Israel Friendship League where I met with many of the Irish diaspora in Israel and also the Saint Patrick&rsquo;s Day events held in Jerusalem and in Tel Aviv.  In the course of my visit I also attended an Ireland/Israel seminar on road safety where the experiences of the relevant authorities in both States were shared and options for continued engagement in improving road safety were explored.  I also received a briefing on ongoing developments in the use of unmanned aerial systems for security surveillance purposes.  The Defence Forces already use such systems in peacekeeping operations.  </p><p>  In relation to the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, I received briefings and had a number of discussions on the overall political situation, with a number of politicians including both the outgoing and incoming Ministers for Justice in Israel, Yaakov Neeman and Tzipi Livni respectively.  While visiting Ramallah in the West Bank, I met with Nabil Shaath, a senior Palestinian official and negotiator, with the Minister for Justice of the Palestinian Authority, Mr Ali Muhanna and with NGOs and UN agencies operating on the ground.  I was also briefed by Mr Kenneth Deane Head of mission of EUPOL COPPS, the EU&rsquo;s police training mission with the Palestinian police, which Ireland has strongly supported.  </p><p>  In the course of my visit, I was very much in listening mode, while also indicating that Ireland would do whatever it could to help and support the peace process.  My discussions were intended, both as a member of the Government and with a long standing interest in the region, to hear about the difficulties facing the parties and the peace process, and the prospects for renewed movement towards a comprehensive peace.  I of course reiterated at all points the Irish Government&rsquo;s strong and consistent support for a two State solution resulting in a sovereign State of Palestine existing peacefully alongside a secure Israel and Ireland&rsquo;s support for the recommencement of discussions in respect of the peace process.  </p><p>  Throughout my visit to the Middle East, I also promoted economic cooperation, high-tech research and innovation, bilateral trade links and tourism. </p><p>  No discussions were conducted with the Israeli Government relating to the purchase of defensive equipment by the Department of Defence.</p></reply>

Maximum benefits accrue after 31 years.  The 21-year pension consists of the following elements: (a) a basic flat-rate pension that varies according to rank (Sergeant in the case of the person referred to); <i>plus</i> (b) an addition in respect of military service allowance (MSA) equal to 40% of the MSA rate where discharged since August 1990; and ( c) if applicable, fixed % additions in respect of certain other qualifying payments (e.g. 3% extra for Technician Pay in this case). </p><p>  All of the above elements are payable for the person&#8217;s lifetime.  However, an &#8216;additional increment&#8217; is also payable at a flat rate for each year of service in excess of 21 years up to a maximum of 31 years. This increment is increased, where appropriate, by the top-up at (c). Where maximum pensionable service is 31 or more years, as applied in this instance, the MSA top-up is 50% of the rate of MSA (rather than 40%). However, the additional increment ceases to be payable when the pensioner reaches the qualifying age of 66 under the Social Welfare code for a State Pension Contributory, or if they become entitled to a Retirement Pension Contributory at the earlier age of 65. At the same time, the 50% MSA top-up reverts to the 40% rate. When the person referred to retired from the Defence Forces on 7 October 2002 (at the prescribed age of 60), he had accrued the maximum pensionable service of 31 years.  On that basis, his military pension included the additional increment for 31 years&#8217; service and the corresponding MSA top-up. He reached the age of 66 years on 7 October 2008, the qualifying age for the State Pension Contributory. In accordance with the arrangements mentioned, these additional elements of his Defence Forces pension ceased to be payable from that date. </p><p>  I am advised that these arrangements are in accordance with the long established principle of integrating occupational pensions with Social Insurance benefits of employees who are in full PRSI class.  This includes NCOs and Privates, who are fully insured for the range of benefits under the Social Welfare Acts such as the State Pension. &#8216;<i>Integration</i>&#8217; means that a person&#8217;s entitlement to Social Insurance benefits such as the State Pension is taken into account when calculating the rate of occupational pension payable. The State Pension etc. is regarded as part of the overall pension package payable to the individual. The integration principle applies right across the public service and, indeed, in many areas of the private sector as well as in other countries. </p><p>  However, the method of integration for military pensioners such as the person referred to is considerably less severe than in other areas of the public service. The maximum personal rate of State Pension is currently &#8364;230.30 a week (if under age 80). This is considerably greater than any reduction that could arise under the pre-April 2004 Defence Forces&#8217; pension arrangements on qualification for the State Pension.</p><p>  The general issue of integration of occupational pensions in the public service was examined by the <i>Commission on Public Service Pensions. </i>  Its final report, published in November 2000, was considered and broadly accepted by Government. The Commission accepted that integration is a fundamental component in the public service pension framework and was strongly of the view that it should be continued. It did not make any recommendations that would affect the current integration arrangements applicable to retired NCOs and Privates covered by the pre-April 2004 pensions schemes.</p></reply>

In this context, the Foreign Affairs Council of the European Union established a military mission, EUTM Mali, which will provide military training and advice to the Malian Armed Forces.  On 26 February 2013 the Government decided to deploy approximately eight members of the Permanent Defence Force for service with the EU Training Mission in Mali (EUTM Mali), as part of a joint infantry training team with the United Kingdom Armed Forces, to provide military training and advice to the Malian Armed Forces. The objective of the mission will be to improve the capacity of the Malian Armed Forces to maintain security in Mali and restore the authority of the Malian Government and the territorial integrity of the Malian State.  Alongside standard infantry training, training will also be provided in international humanitarian law, the protection of civilians and human rights.</p><p>  All EU Member States, irrespective of participation, are obliged to contribute to the common costs of the mission, unless they specifically opt out of doing so at Council.  All troop contributors to the new mission will be responsible for their own costs. The estimated cost to the Defence Vote of deploying and sustaining eight personnel with EUTM Mali will amount to approximately &euro;632,000 for the duration of the mission&rsquo;s mandate of 15 months. This figure includes Ireland&rsquo;s contribution of &euro;120,000 to the common costs of the mission.</p><p>  The EU Training Mission is being deployed under UN Security Council Resolution 2071, in a country which is deeply divided along ethnic lines, to assist in building an army which is able and ready and to defend all the people of Mali, regardless of origin and identity.

As a first step, the European Parliament&rsquo;s Agriculture and Rural Development Committee adopted an initial position on the CAP reform package at the end of January. Further momentum was generated in early February when the clarity that had been awaited from the negotiations on the EU budget was delivered by the agreement on the Multi-annual Financial Framework at the European Council. Two weeks ago, the European Parliament finalised its position on the CAP reform package. And last week the Council of Agriculture Ministers successfully adopted - by a strong qualified majority - its General Approach on CAP Reform. The latter in particular marked a considerable achievement, taking place as it did against a background of lengthy, intensive negotiations with my Member State colleagues across a range of complex and sensitive issues. </p><p>  The achievement of the Council General Approach is a vitally important development. It means that all three institutions are now ready to move on to the final, so-called &lsquo;trilogue&rsquo;, stage of the negotiation process, where the Irish Presidency will represent the Council in discussions with the European Parliament and with the Commission. It also means that the overall target of an inter-institutional political agreement by the end of June remains very much on schedule.  </p><p>  I am very hopeful that all participants across all three institutions will maintain their focus and redouble their efforts so that, together, we can bring the reform negotiations to a conclusion by the end of June.</p></reply>

However, I believe we should do so in a way that does not result in unacceptably large transfers from our most productive farmers. The Commission&rsquo;s proposal would have the latter effect. The Deputy is no doubt aware of the analysis carried out by my Department based on our 2010 payments database, which shows that, under the Commission&rsquo;s proposal, &euro;280 million would be transferred between Irish farmers, with 70,000 gaining by an average of 75% and 54,000 losing by an average of 32%. I believe this is unsustainable, and would jeopardise the development of the agri-food sector as foreseen under the Food Harvest 2020 strategy.</p><p>  This is why I have consistently argued for an alternative, more measured, approach that acknowledges the need to move from historic references while not going as far or as fast as envisaged by the Commission. Last year I proposed a partial convergence model which would result in the transfer of &euro;74 million between Irish farmers, with 60,000 gaining by an average of 25% and 53,000 losing by an average of 8%. This is the minimum transfer generated by the partial convergence model &ndash; Member States would have the flexibility to go further if they wished. I worked very hard to persuade my Member State colleagues that this alternative model should be incorporated into the Commission&rsquo;s proposals on direct payments, and was successful in building a strong alliance to this effect. </p><p>  Although this is a highly sensitive issue for all Member States, I am very pleased that last week&rsquo;s Council of Agriculture Ministers endorsed this approach and agreed to include the Irish model in the options available for the distribution of direct payments. This enhances the prospect of a more reasonable level of transfers of payments between farmers than would be the case under the Commission&rsquo;s flat-rate proposal. </p><p>  Of course, this issue still has to be negotiated further, and the reality is that the final outcome will be somewhere between the Commission proposal and the Irish proposal. However, the important point is that the Irish model is at the centre of the negotiations, and I will be working to ensure that the final outcome is as close as possible to this model.</p></reply>

The Council general approach allows for  some practical measures that will support the effective implementation of the discards ban.  In relation to de-minimis, it provides that the de-minimis exemption shall apply in  specific situations such as: i) where scientific evidence indicates that increases in selectivity are very difficult to achieve; or ii) to avoid disproportionate costs of handling unwanted catches, for those fishing gears where unwanted catches per fishing gear do not represent more than a certain percentage, to be established in the plan, of total annual catch of that gear.</p><p>  This exemption<b><i></i></b>shall not exceed a total of 7% of the total annual catches of the species concerned. But for a transitional period of four years the percentage of the total annual catches referred to under de-minimis shall increase: (i) by two per cent (to 9%) in the first two years of application of the landing obligation; and (ii) by one per cent(to 8%) in the subsequent two years.  The European Parliaments position which is set down in its First Reading  (6 February 2013) does not provide for a de-minimis option.  A first round of trilogues with Parliament  and the European Commission  took place on the Basic Regulation on the 19<sup>th</sup> of March. As Presidency, we  have in place a schedule of further trilogues planned over the coming weeks with the aim of having political agreement by the end of June.</p></reply>

The PECHE Committee of the EU Parliament is currently examining the Commission proposal and expects to adopt its position by the end of May.

However funding for the STAP is capped at &euro;3 million for 2013.  The Programme was conceived to cater for approximately 3,000 participants with a maximum annual payment of &euro;1,000 per participant. As approximately 4,900 applications have been received for 2013 under the STAP, based on the qualifying criteria applicable for established producers, the Programme is currently oversubscribed. Therefore it is not possible this year to make provision for the inclusion of sheep farmers from offshore Islands who have less than the requisite breeding stock.</p></reply>

It is now recognised that the first year of the new regime will be 2015. Farmers will apply in that year for an allocation of new payment entitlements.</p><p>  The Commission proposals have been the subject of negotiations at official and political level in the Council of Ministers over the past 18 months culminating in an agreed Council position which was reached at the Council on 18/19 March.  Under the proposals agreed by the Council of Minister, the number of entitlements to be allocated in the first year of the new regime can either be based on the total number of eligible hectares declared in that year or, alternatively, a Member State may decide that the number of entitlements will be confined to the number of eligible hectares declared in either 2012 or 2013.  While this is an option for Member States it is too early yet to say which option will be exercised by Ireland.</p><p>  Member States are also allowed to confine the allocation of payment entitlements to those farmers who received a payment under the existing Single Payment Scheme in either 2010 or 2011.  Where a Member States exercises this option, the European Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts to determine how entitlements are to be allocated to farmers who apply in the first year of the new regime but who did not receive payment in either 2010 or 2011.  Again, it is too early to say whether Ireland will exercise this particular option.</p><p>  I should also point out that the next step in the negotiations involves reaching agreement between the three European Institutions i.e. the Council of Ministers, the European Parliament and the Commission.  It is therefore too early to speculate on how the final outcome will affect individual farmers.</p></reply>

Most support to the seafood sector is co-funded by the European Fisheries Fund and is covered by the Seafood Development Programme 2007-2013.</p><p>  Financial supports for the construction, installation and modernisation of aquaculture enterprises are provided by BIM and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta through the Commercial Aquaculture Development Scheme.  This Scheme was originally part of the Irish Seafood National Programme, but was moved into the co-funded Seafood Development Programme in 2012, as part of a revision of that Programme following its 2011 interim evaluation.</p><p>  As part of the original development of both programmes, a strategic environmental assessment was conducted.  During the course of the public consultation on that SEA, the Central and Regional Fisheries Boards (now Inland Fisheries Ireland) raised concerns about the possibility of sea-lice emanating from salmon farms negatively affecting migrating wild salmon.  The Minister for Communication, Energy and Natural Resources supported these concerns.  Rather than delay the finalisation of the programmes, it was agreed to exclude salmon farms from financial support under the Irish Seafood National Programme until such time as the sea-lice issue has been satisfactorily resolved.  This temporary restriction on development grants was included in the text of the Irish Seafood National Programme (page 99).  However, there is no restriction on the development of the salmon farming sector itself.</p><p>  With the transfer of the Commercial Aquaculture Development Scheme into the co-funded Seafood Development Programme in 2012, the text of that Programme was amended to provide for the continuation of the temporary restriction on financial support to the salmon farming sector.  The temporary restriction was also included in the eligibility criteria approved earlier this month for the next call for applications under the Commercial Aquaculture Development Scheme.</p><p>  My Department&rsquo;s policy on sea lice controls is strictly evidence based. The control protocols are operated by the Marine Institute on behalf of the State and are more advanced that those operated in other jurisdictions for the following reasons:</p><p>- the inspection regime is totally independent of the industry;</p><p>- data obtained as a result of inspections is published;</p><p>- treatment trigger levels are set at a low level.</p><p>  In 2008, the State introduced a new Pest Management Strategy, supplementing the control regime already in place.  This has resulted in a steady decline in average sea lice numbers on farmed salmon since its inception.</p><p>  The protocols have been the subject of detailed investigation and testing by the EU Commission in response to a complaint from a member of the public in respect of the effects of sea lice on wild salmon.  On 11 October 2012, the Commission closed its investigation of this complaint in the State&rsquo;s favour following its examination of all relevant matters.   The Commission has also indicated that it regards the sea lice protocols operated in Ireland as representing best practice internationally.</p></reply>

The Seafood Development Programme includes the overwhelming majority of initiatives for the development of the sector.  That Programme is co-funded by the European Union under the European Fisheries Fund.  It was considerably updated in 2012, following an interim evaluation of its progress.  The Programme identifies the development needs of the catching, processing and aquaculture sectors and the measures that will be implemented to address those needs.</p><p>  The complementary Irish Seafood National Programme is the framework programme for a small number of measures that are not eligible for EU co-funding and thus cannot be included in the main programme.</p><p>  A new EU Regulation is presently being negotiated to replace the European Fisheries Fund from 2014 to 2020.  My Department has commenced preparation of a new operational programme to cover investment needs for that programming period.  As part of that process, my Department will shortly be initiating a stakeholder consultation to identify the investment needs of the sector.  My Department is aiming to have that new Programme completed early in 2014.</p></reply>

It is clear that in the context of a quota free production environment, Ireland&rsquo;s natural advantages in terms of climate and grassland provide a tremendous opportunity for the dairy sector, particularly in light of expanding global population and demand for dairy products.</p><p>  It is against this background that the industry has set an ambitious but achievable 50% target for expansion in output in the Food Harvest 2020 Report. Meeting this target will require positive and pro-active action to improve efficiencies at farm level, to increase processing capacity, and to improve breed quality and animal health. </p><p>  My Department has provided a range of critical supports through measures such as the New Entrants to Dairying Scheme, which helps to revitalise the sector through the provision of milk quota to dynamic young educated farmers, through the Dairy Efficiency Programme, which encourages the adoption of best practice management and production methods on farm, through the provision of financial support for ICBF and Animal Health Ireland to improve breed quality and animal health. My Department has also made up to &euro;40m available through its Rural Development Programme for investment on farm, as well as &euro;80m in capital investment support for the processing sector through the Dairy Investment Fund  </p><p>  Teagasc and Bord Bia are also playing their part in ensuring a continued focus on commercially relevant R&amp;D and marketing activities, and these aspects are being advanced in collaboration with the sector, with critical financial support from my Department.</p><p>  Against this background, I believe that the opportunities for the dairy sector will expand significantly over the coming years and I can assure the Deputy that my Department and its agencies will continue to play their part in providing an appropriate framework to support the development of this critically important industry.  </p></reply>

Indigenous production of cereals is of course, an important part of primary agriculture production.  In addition to generating an income for our tillage farmers, the cereals sector is a key source of grain for the milling and malting industry and feeding stuffs for the livestock sector.<b></b>Annual cereals production in Ireland has fluctuated around 2 million tonnes in recent years and it is desirable to try and sustain this level of production in order to avoid over dependence on imported cereals. According to the CSO Cereals Supply Balance sheet Ireland had 74% self-sufficiency in cereals in 2010/2011. </p><p>  Since Ireland is a deficit market for cereals, prices here are greatly affected by world prices and supplies. In 2010, increased demands for grain from the biofuels sector and the growing needs of new emerging markets like China and India drove up world grain market prices. In line with this rise in world prices, grain prices in Ireland increased and growers here reacted by increasing the acreage sown. The cereals harvest for 2012 is estimated at 2.05 million tonnes which is lower than the record harvest of 2011 due to the persistent adverse weather during the growing season.   Prices however continue to remain high due to production shortfalls in the USA and Russia.</p><p>  My Department operates a range of services aimed at improving the efficiency of, quality and viability of cereal production. </p><p>  These services include seed certification, seed testing and recommended list of varieties, research funding through the &#8216;Stimulus&#8217; programme, funding for grain drying/storage and funding for the quality assurance scheme In addition, Teagasc provides research, training and advisory services for cereal producers. The value of all these support services is reflected in the fact that Irish cereals producers have consistently achieved some of the highest yields in the world. </p><p>  Food Harvest 2020 outlined a number of challenges facing the cereal sector in the coming years including price volatility, climatic and disease issues, high input prices, small and fragmented holdings and the cost of rented land. However, the report also pointed to positive projections for cereal prices as markets are relatively well-balanced and world cereal prices are projected to be higher than in the last decade. It is known that global grain production is struggling to meet the increasing demand for food, feed and industrial uses. In addition to a rising global population creating a bigger demand for cereals, an increasing demand for meat is disproportionately increasing grain demand even further. It is predicted that global demand for cereals will reach 3 billion tonnes by 2025 compared with 2.3 billion tonnes currently. </p><p>  Global grain stocks are known to be reducing over time and this should also lead to improved market prospects for Irish cereals. With the world population projected to grow to 9 billion by 2050, it is vital that the agriculture sector, including the Irish cereal sector, can meet the increased demand for food, not just in the next ten years, but through to 2050. Signalling an intention to migrate away from the use of food in the production of biofuels, in October last, the European Commission published a proposal that seeks to introduce a 5% ceiling on the use of biofuels derived from sugar, cereals and rapeseed as part of the count towards the EU&#8217;s 10% target for renewable energy in the transport sector by 2020. The proposal seeks to encourage future investment in advanced biofuels such as municipal waste and agricultural residues that do not compete directly with food and feed crops.</p><p>  Food Harvest 2020 highlighted the importance of optimising yields, tackling high costs and targeting higher priced domestic markets in order to reverse declining production trends and made a number of recommendations on competitiveness, branding and marketing. Some progress has been made on these recommendations and in recent months the Tillage Stakeholder Group presented their development plan to the Food Harvest High Level Implementation Committee (HLIC).  This plan identified opportunities and was devised to stimulate concerted action by the sector so as to exploit to the maximum the potential identified by the stakeholders.  The HLIC welcomed this report and noted that many of the issues required a strong cross-industry approach if they are to be progressed. They advised that industry should start this process and the group should revert back to the HLIC at a later date on the progress achieved.</p><p>  The primary growth in requirement for Irish cereals in the years ahead is likely to be for animal feed given the targets for increased livestock output proposed in Food Harvest 2020. However, considerable potential also exists in grains for the drink industry such as malting barley and recent significant investments by the large brewing and distilling companies here in Ireland are proof of such potential. Further, it is envisaged that there will be increased demand for Irish oats milled for human food for the home and export markets and in this context, the success of the Agribusiness sector in securing, long-term contracts with US-based Foods companies to supply milled Irish oats to a premium Irish oatmeal brand in the US market, is particularly welcome. Production of oats is also declining globally and therefore it is envisaged new export markets will continue to come on stream for Irish oats. </p><p>  In conclusion, I am confident that demand will be sustained for a strategic supply of native cereals as raw material for our brewing, distilling, flour and oat milling industry and for the expanded livestock and dairy production foreseen in the Food Harvest 2020 report. </p></reply>

Significant supports, in the form of Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Schemes (TAMS), for egg producers and pig farmers were put in place and a total of &euro;32 million to these sectors was made available under the Rural Development Programme. </p><p>  In the case of egg producers the conversion of production systems to &lsquo;enriched cages&rsquo; came into operation on 1 January 2012. From this date eggs from &lsquo;unenriched&rsquo; caged production systems were not allowed to be placed on the market. Following the operation of an aid package amounting to &euro;16 million to assist producers to convert, the size of the caged egg flock remained stable, at approximately 1.25 million birds due to new entrants and consolidation amongst existing producers. </p><p>  The Loose Sow Housing Directive came into operation in January of this year. These new standards in relation to the housing of sows have presented a challenge to pig farmers and officials from my Department continue to liaise with producers as a small number continue to work towards compliance. </p><p>  The Sow Housing Welfare Scheme was introduced in 2010 to facilitate pig producer compliance with the new requirements. The scheme has been enhanced and extended on a number of occasions. While the majority of producers have worked extremely hard to achieve compliance, my Department became aware that a small number of producers had experienced difficulties with planning permission and, with this in mind I recently announced a further extension in the deadline for grant applications until 2 April 2013. </p><p>  I have provided a total of &euro;16 million for this scheme. I should add that this funding is in addition to earlier Sow Welfare Schemes which delivered over &euro;6 million to successful applicants. </p><p>  Officials from my Department will continue to engage with pig producers to ensure compliance with this and all animal welfare requirements.</p></reply>

However my Department plays an important role in the labelling of food together with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI).</p><p>  In my capacity as Chairman of the EU Agricultural Council I have, together with my ministerial colleagues and the EU Commission, given a high priority to food labelling issues. Consumers should rightly expect not to be misled by inaccurate labelling and must have confidence in knowing what they are eating. Ireland will continue to give leadership in this area and will work with our EU partners to strengthen consumer assurance measures, including more accurate labelling requirements as set out in the Food Information for the Consumer (FIC) Regulation (1169/2011/EC).</p><p>  This legislation extended explicit compulsory origin labelling requirements to meats other than beef, with the detailed rules to be adopted in implementing acts by 13 December 2013, following an impact assessment by the Commission.</p><p><i>General Food Labelling Rules</i></p><p>  Food labelling used to inform consumers of the properties of pre-packaged food is governed by EU rules. The most important labelling rule is that the consumer should not be misled.</p><p>  The FIC regulation also adopts rules on compulsory labelling where the origin or place of provenance of a food is given and where it is not the same as its primary ingredient.  Insofar as meat as an ingredient is concerned, these rules are subject to the adoption of implementing acts, which must take account of an impact assessment to be carried out by the Commission. As a result of the recent incidents of horsemeat being discovered in beef burgers and other beef products the Commission have now agreed to bring forward their work on this aspect of the regulation to September this year. </p><p><i>Beef Labelling Rules</i></p><p>  In general, all fresh, frozen or minced beef marketed in the EU (with the exception of offal) is subject to a mandatory system of origin traceability and origin labelling. The purpose of these rules is to ensure that beef on sale can be traced back to the animal or group of animals from which it came. </p><p>  There are two elements to the  beef labelling regime which apply to all parts of the supply chain; the compulsory system, which requires food business operators to label their beef products (unless cooked or processed) with certain prescribed information up to and including the point of sale to the consumer; and the voluntary system, which covers any other labelling claim that processors or retailers wish to make concerning the origin, characteristics or production methods of the beef they are supplying. The claims made on product labels, marketing material or point of sale notices must be clear and cannot be misleading.</p><p><i>Formed meat</i></p><p>  Also in the FIC regulation (Annex VI) in the case of meat products, meat preparations which may give the impression that they are made of a whole piece of meat, but actually consist of different pieces combined together by other ingredients, including food additives and food enzymes or by other means, shall bear the words &#8220; formed meat&#8221; on the label. </p><p><i>Traceability</i></p><p>  The identification and registration of cattle, sheep, pigs, poultry and equines are also governed by EU Regulations and these Regulations have been transposed into national law. </p><p>  The Department&#8217;s Animal Identification and Movement (AIM) database is a generic system that records identification and movement data on cattle, sheep, goats and pigs. The AIM system was developed using Internet-based technology and the majority of interactions with the system are electronic transactions. Work is already advanced on the development of a central database for equines on the AIM system. The AIM system is integrated with the Department&#8217;s corporate systems to record customer data (CCS) and animal health data (AHCS).  The AHCS database holds a record of persons registered as keepers of the different animal species, including equine animals.  </p><p>  The Department is introducing a range of measures to improve traceability systems in the equine sector and is liaising with passport issuing agencies in Ireland in this regard. Protocols to allow abattoir operators to cross check the details of passports with these agencies have been developed, aimed at ensuring that only those horses eligible for slaughter are slaughtered. The Department is also developing a central database of horses which will involve migration of selected data from passport issuing agencies. The database will be populated with information provided from the databases maintained by the agencies, by the Department from records obtained at slaughter plants and knackeries and by local authorities in respect of records maintained at appropriate slaughter plants. The intention is that this database will be used at abattoirs to assist in verifying the authenticity of the passport for the equine presented and to record its date of slaughter.</p><p><i>Pigmeat </i></p><p>  Under the National Pig Identification and Tracing System (NPITS) all pig herds are centrally registered,  all pigs being moved are identified (by means of tag or slap mark) and accompanied by movement documents, and all movements are recorded on a centrally managed database.  Thus the movement of all pigs from farm to factory and to any destination in between is fully traceable.</p><p><i>Poultry</i></p><p>  All poultry keepers are required to register with my Department. Poultry operators are subject to a wide range of EU and domestic legislation and are monitored by inspectors from my Department. Given the vertical nature of the poultry meat sector, most birds are reared under contract to processors. The processors supply the day-old birds in the first instance. The subsequent movement of broilers back to the processing facility is strictly controlled. Furthermore, there is an ongoing Department veterinary presence in poultry plants and this, together with inspections at farm level, underpins a strong domestic regime.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-03-26a.1095.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013032600078#WRY01900"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 488 and 490 together. </p><p>  I remain fully committed to the growth targets set out in Food Harvest 2020 and I am very confident that these targets will be achieved.  The progress achieved to date on the Food Harvest targets justifies my confidence.  At end 2012, the value of both primary output and exports are estimated to have increased by 23% and 12% respectively while the value- added element of the sector has increased by 5.6% at end 2010, the latest data available from the CSO. In that context, I anticipate that the Food Harvest growth targets of attaining a 33% increase in the value of  primary agriculture and fisheries and over a 40% value increase in exports and value added product by 2020 will be met and even exceeded if global economic conditions remain favourable.  </p><p>  Furthermore, I strongly believe that the significant progress achieved at recent EU negotiations has provided the necessary robust framework to facilitate optimal development and growth in the agri-food sector over the next ten years. The recent outcomes achieved under the Irish Presidency have delivered a Common Agricultural Policy that will strengthen productive farming and will support the goals of competitiveness, sustainability and growth outlined in the Food Harvest 2020 strategy. </p><p>  The initial steps were taken in February when agreement was achieved on the EU multiannual financial framework (MFF). Subject to the consent of the European Parliament, the seven year EU budget agreed at the EU summit provided clarity on overall EU agriculture funding.  It guaranteed funding of over &euro;1.5 billion per year for Ireland from the Common Agriculture Policy (CAP) including a direct payment ceiling of over &euro;1.2 billion per year.  In addition, approximately &euro;313 million per year in current terms will be available from EU funding for rural development. When taken together, the EU funding to Ireland from direct payments, rural development and market supports will amount to over &euro;11 billion over the seven year period 2014-2020.</p><p>  This week, negotiations on the reform of the CAP moved to a new level when the package of proposals, tabled by the Irish Presidency, was agreed by the European Agriculture Ministers and so achieved an agreed position to a General Approach on CAP reform. Particular points of interest to Irish farmers were the flexibility achieved in the way in which direct payments can be distributed within Member States (internal convergence), the concession that the greening of direct payments may be a percentage of each farmer&rsquo;s individual payment rather than a flat rate, and an earlier abolition of the sugar quota regime. </p><p>  The negotiation process will now move to the final stage of the negotiations, where the Irish Presidency will represent the European Council in discussions with the European Parliament and with the Commission to achieve a final outcome on the reform of the CAP.  While the progress achieved to date augers well for achieving the Presidency&rsquo;s target of an inter- institutional political agreement by end June, there remains a significant task ahead and a very clear and strong focus is required to achieve our final objective of a reform package which underpins the Food Harvest strategy of Smart, Green, Growth.</p></reply>

The Food Safety Authority of Ireland has advised my Department that the number of inspections where non-compliance with labelling legislation was found was 11,231 in 2009, or 16.33% of the total number of inspections carried out in that year; 9,919 in 2010, or 14.04% of the total number of inspections carried out in that year; and 9,499 in 2011, or 15.98% of the total number of inspections carried out in that year.

I am pleased that the Council endorsed the principle of flexibility that I have been seeking and agreed to the inclusion of the Irish model of partial convergence to a flat rate system in the options available for distribution of direct payments within Member States.  As I have said many times, my key aim in these negotiations is to ensure a reasonable level of transfers of payments between farmers, compared to the large transfer that would occur under the Commission's flat rate proposal.  My proposal reduces this transfer to around &euro;74 million at a minimum with discretion to transfer higher levels if we wished; whereas the Commission proposal would result in the transfer of around &euro;280 million, based on our 2010 payments database.  In addition, the Council has agreed that the greening payment may be a percentage of each farmer's individual payment rather than a flat rate payment.  I am pleased with the Council&rsquo;s agreement to my proposals to bring the necessary flexibility to the Commission&rsquo;s original proposals on greening, so that farmers can practise sustainable agriculture without overly bureaucratic impediments.  </p><p>  The successful completion of the Council&rsquo;s deliberations in the form of a General Approach means that my target of an inter-institutional political agreement by the end of June remains on schedule.  This General Approach will form the basis for the next step in the negotiation process, the so-called &quot;trilogue&quot; stage.  As Chair of the Council of Agriculture Ministers, I will represent the Council in discussions with the European Parliament and the Commission to agree the final CAP Reform Package.  I am hopeful that all participants across all three institutions will maintain their focus and redouble their efforts so that, together, we can bring the reform negotiations to a conclusion by the end of June.</p></reply>

The Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority and the Marine Institute act as Official Agencies under service contract with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland and enforce the relevant seafood Regulations.  A framework for the prevention and control of aquatic diseases in aquaculture facilities is set out in Council Directive 2006/88/EC.  This Directive has been transposed into Irish law by SI No. 261 of 2008, as amended.  Under this legislation, every Aquaculture Production Business in the country must be authorised by the Marine Institute.  To become authorised, the operator must retain mortality records and records of movements of live and dead fish to and from the farm.  He must also implement adequate bio-security practices. </p><p>  Record keeping, bio-security measures and the clinical health of the animals on the site are assessed as part of the inspection regime which is implemented on aquaculture sites by Marine Institute or Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine Veterinary Inspectors.  Sites are inspected annually or biennially, depending on the risk of disease spread.  In addition, all movements of live animals to and from aquaculture sites in Ireland must be pre-approved by the Marine Institute, to ensure traceability and for disease control purposes.  Further to the statutory provisions outlined above, all Aquaculture Production Businesses which farm salmonids have signed up to a Code of Practice and are implementing the provisions of the Farmed Salmonid Health Handbook, which outline best practice in relation to the farming of salmon and trout in Ireland.  A combination of the statutory requirements under the legislation and the adherence to the Code of Practice and the handbook ensures the animal health and welfare standards adhered to by the Irish Aquaculture industry are among the highest in Europe.</p><p>  The Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority carries out its official controls in accordance with the relevant EU and National legislation on an ongoing basis from boat up to but excluding retail level; for example, on fishing vessels, in shellfish production areas and in establishments handling preparing and processing seafood.  The Health Service Executive has responsibility for official controls in the retail sector while the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine carries out routine inspections of aquaculture farms.  There is ongoing official control monitoring of primary producers - fishing vessels and aquaculture production areas.  All seafood establishments are registered by the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority.  In addition, those handling fishery products are approved by the authority.  Both registered and approved sea food establishments are inspected at a determined frequency based on a risk assessment.  Official control checks carried out by the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority include quality checks of the produce, food safety management system checks, hygiene and structural checks of establishments preparing or processing seafood, labelling and traceability.  Official control samples of produce are also taken if necessary to verify the effectiveness of food business operators' food safety management systems.</p></reply>

These schemes include the Youth Service Grant Scheme, the Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young People&rsquo;s Facilities and Services Fund Rounds 1 and 2, Local Drug Task Force Projects and certain other provisions including the Local Youth Club Grant Scheme, Youth Information Centres, the European Youth in Action Programme (administered by L&eacute;argas &ndash; the Exchange Bureau) and Gaisce &ndash; the President&rsquo;s Award.</p><p>  Funding of &euro;53.173m has been provided to my Department for the provision of youth services in 2013. Of this total funding, &euro;1.75 has been provided in a new capital funding programme for 2013.  </p><p>  The Comprehensive Review of Expenditure (CRE) published in December 2011 sets out clearly the savings required from the Department in 2012, 2013, 2014.  The CRE contains a detailed seven page chapter outlining savings required from youth work funding.  The CRE requires a 10% saving in 2013, with a lessor saving in 2014.  Having regard to the savings requirements identified in the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure my Department has tried to ensure that, in the determination process for the allocations, the front line youth services, particularly those for the most vulnerable young people are protected as far as is possible from the impact of any  necessary reductions in funding.  </p><p>  With respect to future funding provision, my Department has commenced a comprehensive Value for Money and Policy Review of youth funding and this report is expected later this year.</p><p>  In addition, I am committed to the development of a new youth policy framework which my Department is currently progressing. Through this work a clear policy framework will emerge that will aim to enhance the development, participation and support of young people. I intend that the policy framework will also facilitate and promote co-ordination and cohesion across departments and front line youth services including youth services in Dublin.  This will ensure that the funding available in future years will be used as effectively as possible.</p></reply>

RIA is charged with providing accommodation and ancillary services to asylum seekers i.e. adults and their children, under the Direct Provision system while their applications for asylum are processed.  Direct Provision centres are monitored three times a year, twice by Department of Justice staff and once by an external company.  </p><p>  The revised Children First: National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children was published in July, 2011. The Guidance deals with the recognition, reporting and management of child safety concerns.  It sets out a number of key messages relating to the duty to protect children.  Among these are that the safety and welfare of children is everyone&rsquo;s responsibility, that children will have safer lives where everyone is attentive to their wellbeing and that people who work with children across a range of areas understand their responsibility for safe practice and the reporting of concerns.  The Guidance sets out specific protocols for HSE social workers, Garda&iacute; and other front line staff in dealing with suspected abuse.  The scope of Children First extends beyond the reporting of suspected abuse.  It emphasises the importance of multi disciplinary, inter-agency working in the management of such concerns.  Key to this is the sharing of information between agencies and disciplines in the best interests of children and the need for full co-operation to ensure better outcomes. The guidance does not deal specifically with the rights and entitlements of children. These issues are dealt with in a range of other documents including the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.</p><p>  The HSE has advised me that concerns about the welfare, safety or wellbeing of a children in Direct Provision are reported to the HSE Children and Family Services, in line with Children First.  Referrals include welfare concerns such as a parent being hospitalised, parental illness, a child being left unsupervised by an adult or mental health concerns regarding the parent, while a smaller number would relate to child protection concerns.  </p><p>  There is a specific unit within RIA -the Child and Family Services Unit - whose role is to manage, deliver, co-ordinate, monitor and plan all matters relating to child and family services for all asylum seekers residing in the direct provision system. This unit also links, where necessary, directly with an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>  Following a recent Seanad debate on this issue, I have been engaging with the HSE to ensure that those children currently residing in Direct Provision are afforded the same levels of welfare and protection that their counterparts in the wider community are afforded.</p></reply>

Following cross departmental consultation and an examination of the issues involved by the Project Team, ComReg, which has responsibility for the allocation of the Missing Children Hotline number in Ireland, allocated the number to the ISPCC. The ISPCC has been successful in securing EU Daphne funding to support the establishment of the line. The ISPCC also submitted an application for funding to the Department of Children and Youth Affairs to cover the establishment and running of the Hotline. This application has been approved for 2012 and 2013. Future applications for running costs will be considered in the context of the annual budget estimates process. </p><p>  Officials of my Department are liaising with the ISPCC in relation to the implementation of the 116000 Missing Children Hotline.  A phased implementation of the 116000 line commenced in December 2012. The service is operating on a pilot basis initially, on a reduced hours basis from 4pm-10am (16hrs), until the end of April, at which time it will move to a full service, on a 24/7 basis, as recommended by the EU. The service will be officially launched in June 2013.</p><p>  Memoranda of understanding between the ISPCC and the HSE, my Department and the Garda&iacute;, respectively were finalised in advance of the commencement of the pilot in December 2012.</p><p>  The 116000 Hotline will:</p><p>- Provide emotional support to children who are missing, their family and others responsible for the missing child</p><p>- Offer guidance and advice to the callers regarding a missing child; </p><p>- Report risk cases (where identifying information has been received) to the Gardai/HSE as per Children First Guidance;</p><p>- Support the Garda Investigation, where appropriate;</p><p>- Redirect calls outside the scope of the line.</p><p>  It is important to note that the 116000 number is not an emergency number. Emergency calls should always be directed to the 999/112 number in the first instance, where the relevant emergency responses, including the recently launched Garda Missing Children Amber Alert mechanism, may be activated. The establishment of the 116000 line will, however, be of valuable support and assistance to families of missing children and to missing children themselves.</p></reply>

A national register for foster carers is currently under development by the HSE.  The HSE plans to pilot a register towards the end of 2013 in a number of sites across the country and subject to the findings of the review of the pilots, it is expected that the national register will be finalised  in 2014 . There is no national register of foster parents who are not deemed suitable.  However, it is policy that any approved foster carer who is later found to be  unsuitable is removed from the panel of persons willing to act as foster carers. </p><p>  Prospective foster carers or applicants undergo an assessment and training process to establish their suitability and competence as future foster carers. The assessment procedure is carried out by a social worker from the local fostering team and includes Garda vetting, internal HSE checks to establish previous involvement with child protection services, a medical assessment, personal interviews in the applicant&rsquo;s home and if the applicant(s) have children, the social worker will also talk to them about being part of a foster family.  Garda vetting includes adult children and extended family members residing in the home.   The applicant(s) will also be asked to provide referees who will be interviewed by the social worker as part of the assessment process.   The social worker then prepares a report, which is shared with the applicant(s) and their views are represented. This report is then presented to the Foster Care committee for approval, including a recommendation as to the age of the child and type of foster care suitable to the applicant(s).  All approved foster carers are entered on a panel of approved foster carers.</p><p>  When a child is being placed in foster care, the suitability of a placement with relatives is explored in the first instance. Where the HSE is satisfied that an immediate placement with relatives is in the interests of the child,  such placement may occur before full approval of the committee is in place. Such emergency placements are provided for in the regulations. Prior to placement, the  relative is assessed by a principal social worker, including early garda vetting. This is followed by a full assessment and approval by the foster care committee as outlined above. </p><p>  Any  concerns about the welfare, safety or well-being of a child in foster care should be reported to the HSE Children and Family Services, in line with Children First: National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children, was published in July, 2011.</p></reply>

Following detailed consideration of issues involved with Cabinet colleagues, the Government decided on 26th February that it is no longer possible to allow the two schemes to continue as they presently operate and to devise an alternative solution for meeting people's needs. </p><p>  A special review group, which is independently chaired, has been established to seek an alternative method to provide for the priority transport needs of people with a disability in a manner that does not run counter to the Equal Status Acts.  Following the initial phase of the group's work, which will concentrate on issues around Mobility Allowance and the Motorised Transport Grant, a key concentration of the group will be to look at opportunities for the enhancement of the transport options provided to the relevant persons in need.  As part of the review, the Health Service Executive (HSE) will examine the circumstances of all those currently benefiting from the schemes to ensure the identified solutions will encompass their priority mobility needs.  In addition, the Minister for Health has instructed the HSE to contact each individual in receipt of the payments to notify them of this decision.</p><p>  In advance of the establishment of the Project Group,  Department of Health officials met with representatives of the National Federation of Voluntary Bodies, the Disability Federation of Ireland and the Irish Wheelchair Association at my request.  In addition, membership of the Project Group is drawn from both the statutory and non-statutory sectors.  The work of the Project Group is being supported by the National Disability Authority and includes representatives from the Irish Wheelchair Association, the Disability Federation of Ireland, the Centre for Independent Living, an independent service user and advocate for people with disabilities and a retired County Council Manager with relevant experience.  Both Minister Reilly and myself have instructed the Project Group to seek solutions across the whole of Government, so that alongside representatives from the Department of Health and the HSE, membership also includes representatives from Pobal and from the Departments of Transport, Tourism &amp; Sport, Environment, Community and Local Government, Social Protection and Finance.   </p><p>  The Project Group has already met three times and their next meeting is scheduled for 16th April.  The Government decision includes a requirement that the results of the review will be presented to the Government before any final decisions are made on future arrangements.  The funding involved in the two schemes (&euro;10.6 million) remains committed to meeting the priority transport needs of people with a disability.</p></reply>

Co-location, and ultimately tri-location with a maternity hospital, on the St James's campus will support the provision of excellence in clinical care that our children deserve.  The new children&rsquo;s hospital is a key commitment in the Programme for Government and the largest project within the current Capital Plan.  </p><p>  Following the announcement of the Government's decision, detailed consideration was given to the project management structures and governance arrangements required to enable delivery of the project as quickly as possible and to the highest quality.  It is my intention to restructure the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board (NPHDB) so that it focuses on the core function of planning, designing, building and equipping the new hospital.  The membership of the restructured Board will align with this core function and include the necessary capital development expertise.  As the terms of office of the majority of Board members expired on 5 December I have appointed senior representatives from my Department and the HSE as an interim measure pending the required legislation, with the aim of ensuring effective governance and decision-making for the project during this transitional phase. </p><p>  At this important initial stage it is crucial that the project continues without delay.  Work has been progressing in relation to the site and site preparation, representatives of  the HSE and St. James's Hospital  are meeting regularly to progress plans for the necessary enabling and decant work and that a joint team has been put in place to progress this critical early stage work with a robust timetable.  A review of urgent care centre(s) configuration is underway; the Dolphin report concluded that the existing plan for the Ambulatory and Urgent Care Centre in Tallaght would need to be revisited in light of any decision about the location of the new children's hospital.  This review is expected to be complete within the coming weeks; this will be a key decision, the outcome of which will  be a core factor in finalising the scale of the facilities required on the St James's campus and informing the design.  While much of the work that has been done for the project in its previous location on the Mater site is transferable to the new site, a new design for the new site is required and in this regard a priority now  for the NPHDB is the procurement of a new design team.</p><p>  In relation to costs, the totality of the costs for the project in its new location will be determined as part of the updated business case to be finalised by the NPHDB. Funding for the project is secure in the Capital Plan, while it is intended that a proportion of the funding will come from a number of sources, e.g. education and research bodies, research foundations, commercial enterprises, philanthropy and other sources.  In addition, up to &euro;200m can be made available from the sale of the National Lottery.</p><p>  The timelines for delivery of this extremely large and complex capital project will require to be established, examined and kept under continuous review by those charged with project delivery.  This Government regards the building of the hospital as a priority and no effort will be spared in expediting its completion.</p></reply>

Section 11 of the current contract states as follows:</p><p><i>&quot;The medical practitioner shall provide for eligible persons, on behalf of the relevant Health Board, all proper and necessary treatment of a kind usually undertaken by a general practitioner and not requiring special skill or experience of a degree or kind which general practitioners cannot reasonably be expected to possess.  This will include such preventive and developmental services as are currently provided or may be developed in the new style of practice which this agreement facilitates, some of which services may be included on the list of special items of service for which specific payments shall be made.</i> &quot;</p><p>  In circumstances where the taking of blood is necessary to either (a) assist in the process of diagnosing a patient or (b) monitor a diagnosed condition, General Practitioners (GPs) may not charge patients if they are eligible for free GMS services under the Health Act, 1970, as amended.  It is the contracted responsibility of GPs to provide proper and necessary treatment to eligible persons.  If part of that proper and necessary treatment includes routine phlebotomy, GPs must provide such services free of charge under the terms of their General Medical Services (GMS) contract.</p><p>  The HSE has written to GP contract holders and clarified the position in relation to phlebotomy services and has also communicated its position to the Irish Medical Organisation.  The HSE is also continuing to advise eligible patients who believe they have been inappropriately charged by a GP for routine phlebotomy services, to seek a refund from the GP in question.</p><p>  The monitoring and appropriate care of patients receiving anti-coagulation therapy with Warfarin comes within the scope of competence of general practice.  Warfarin testing is also available free of charge in hospitals.  Warfarin testing is carried out by some general practitioners as a matter of course in their practices and I welcome this.  This provides their patients with an option of receiving this service locally in a primary care setting rather than attending an acute hospital for this service.</p><p>  The Programme for Government provides for the introduction of a new GMS GP contract with an increased emphasis on the management of chronic conditions, such as diabetes and cardiovascular conditions.  It is envisaged that the new contract, when finalised, will focus on prevention and will include a requirement for GPs to provide care as part of integrated multidisciplinary Primary Care Teams. </p><p>  Officials in my Department are in consultation with the HSE with a view to drawing up a new contract.  I have recently had discussions with the IMO during which I outlined the Government's policy in relation to free GP care and I intend to engage in further discussions with the IMO once that legislation is published.  The appropriate arrangements in relation to phlebotomy services and anti-coagulation therapy will be considered as part of the new GMS contract. </p></reply>

I have asked for the delay amid concern over the effectiveness of a communication campaign to alert the general public to the issue.  I have asked that the delay give time for an expert group to consider the matter further.</p><p>  The newborn screening cards taken between 1984 and 2002 were retained without the informed consent of the parents or guardians of the children. There is no written consent from parents for the retention or use of these newborn screening cards taken between 1984 and 2002 for research, or other, purposes.</p><p>  The Data Protection Commissioner had ruled that the cards should be destroyed by the HSE to comply with a ruling from the Data Protection Commissioner that the indefinite retention of newborn screening cards breached the Data Protection Acts 1998 and 2003. </p><p>  The HSE has been running a campaign to allow parents of children born between 1984 and 2002 who wish to donate their child&rsquo;s newborn screening card for research to have the card returned to them. They can then donate them for research purposes.</p><p>  It was intended that the retrieval procedure will begin after the ending of the campaign but public awareness appears to be low. The length of time it could take for retrieval will depend on how many cards have to be returned, however no material will be destroyed before all requests have been processed.</p><p>  In the wake of mounting concern from a range respected bodies about the potential value into the future of the loss of the material, and in the context of low public awareness of the issue, I have requested that no destruction of the cards begins before an expert group has had an opportunity to consider the matter further.</p><p>  I have requested the group, which will involve representatives from the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office, consider if a method can be found to archive the material in a manner that satisfies the concerns of the Data Protection Commissioner.</p></reply>

The Scheme provides support to individuals, not to nursing homes. In order to be an approved nursing home for the purposes of the Scheme all private nursing homes, and voluntary nursing homes which previously received funding for long-term residential care under section 39 of the Health Act 2004, must negotiate and agree a price for the cost of long-term nursing home care with the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF).  This is necessary due to the commitment by the State to meet the full balance of the cost of care over and above individuals&rsquo; contributions.</p><p>  The NTPF is independent in the performance of this function and, in carrying it out, it must ensure value for money for both the individual and the State. The NTPF negotiates with each nursing home individually and may examine the records and accounts of nursing homes as part of the process.  </p><p>  Finally, the Scheme only applies to long-term nursing home care.

In recent years, a number of changes to the pricing and reimbursement system have been successfully introduced in Ireland. These have resulted in reductions in the prices of thousands of medicines.</p><p>  Following intensive negotiations involving the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA), the HSE and the Department of Health, a major new deal on the cost of drugs in the State was concluded in October last.  It will deliver a number of important benefits, including</p><p>-	significant reductions for patients in the cost of drugs,</p><p>-	a lowering of the drugs bill to the State,</p><p>-	timely access for patients to new cutting-edge drugs for certain conditions, and</p><p>-	reducing the cost base of the health system into the future.</p><p>  The gross savings arising from this deal will be in excess of &euro;400m over 3 years. &euro;210 million from the gross savings will make available new drugs to patients over 3 years. Thus, the deal will result in a net reduction in the HSE expenditure on drugs of about &euro;190m.</p><p>  The Department and the HSE have successfully finalised discussions with the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers in Ireland (APMI), which represents the generic industry, on a new agreement to deliver further savings in the cost of generic drugs. Under this Agreement, from 1 November 2012, the HSE will only reimburse generic products which have been priced at 50% or less of the initial price of an originator medicine. In the event that an originator medicine is priced at less than 50% of its initial price the HSE will require a generic price to be priced below the originator price. This represents a significant structural change in generic drug pricing and should lead to an increase in the generic prescribing rate.</p><p>  It is estimated that the combined gross savings from the IPHA and APMI deals will be in excess of &euro;120 million in 2013.</p><p>  The IPHA agreement provides that prices are referenced to the currency adjusted average price to wholesaler in the nominated EU member states in which the medicine is then available.  The prices of a range of medicines were reduced on 1 January 2013 in accordance with the agreement.</p><p>  The Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Bill 2012, which was passed at Committee Stage on the 19th of March, provides for the introduction of a system of generic substitution and reference pricing. The Bill provides that when the HSE is setting a reference price for, or reviewing a reference price set for, a relevant group of interchangeable medicinal products it shall take into account the following criteria:</p><p>-	the ability of suppliers to meet patient demand for the relevant item;</p><p>-	the value for money afforded by the relevant item;</p><p>-	the equivalent prices of the relevant item in all other Member States where the product is marketed;</p><p>-	the prices of therapeutically similar items; and</p><p>-	the resources available to the HSE.</p><p>It is important to balance achieving best value for money for the taxpayer with assuring continuity of supply for critical medical products, particularly in a small market like Ireland. Consequently, the Bill aims to achieve value for money while avoiding disruption in the availability of medicines on the Irish market. This legislation will promote price competition among suppliers and ensure that lower prices are paid for these medicines resulting in further savings for both taxpayers and patients.</p></reply>

The Irish Expert Body on Fluorides and Health, established in 2004, monitors new and emerging issues on fluoride and its effects.  It advises that the balance of scientific evidence worldwide confirms that water fluoridation, at the optimal level, does not cause any ill effects and is the safest and most cost effective method of protecting the oral health of the population.  The opinion of the Expert Body is supported by the World Health Organisation; the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, the Public Health Service and the Surgeon General of the United States; the World Dental Federation; the International Association for Dental Research; the Royal College of Physicians of England and by major international scientifically validated reviews in many countries.

My priority is to ensure that children/adolescents affected by narcolepsy, with symptom onset post pandemic vaccination are provided with a range of services and supports to meet their health needs.  </p><p>  The Health Service Executive has responsibility for health service delivery and at my request the HSE developed a range of appropriate services and supports to address the needs of this group.  Together, the HSE and the Department of Education and Skills provide a very comprehensive range of services and supports to those affected.  These supports and services include access to rapid diagnosis, clear treatment pathways, temporary medical cards and reimbursement of expenses incurred.  This includes expenses for counselling services for individuals and also for families of children affected by narcolepsy following pandemic vaccination,  in cases where such services are not already available through the HSE.  Multi-disciplinary assessments which allow for the appropriate individualised health and educational supports to be put in place are ongoing.  The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) is also engaging with the HSE and with the individual schools and parents of children concerned to identify and provide educational supports for the children and adolescents affected.</p><p>  The HSE's advocacy unit is in regular contact with the support group SOUND and last met representatives of the group on 28 February 2013.  Through regional co-ordinators, the HSE also has frequent contact with individual members of SOUND and recently held an information day to ensure those affected were fully aware of all of the the services available.  </p><p>  My Department is considering all possible supports which may need to be put in place for those affected by Narcolepsy following pandemic vaccination.  My Department is considering all other possible supports which may need to be put in place for those affected.  Any such supports require my approval and the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  My officials are engaged with relevant Departments to progress this issue.  I would like to assure the Deputy that this matter continues to be a priority for my Department.  A further meeting with representatives from the support group will be arranged when the matter has been concluded.</p></reply>

Since then 292 separate cosmetic products have been surveyed by the IMB in conjunction with the HSE, Environmental Health Services. There have been no incidences of breaches of the animal testing ban detected.</p><p>  Since the IMB assumed the role as competent authority for cosmetics on 1 October 2010, 354 cosmetic products have been brought to the attention of the IMB from EU surveillance reports and there have been no reported instances of breaches of the animal testing ban. The IMB, in conjunction with the EU Commission and other European Member States, takes a risk-based approach with respect to enforcement of cosmetics legislation, including surveillance programmes, to ensure a high level of public safety.  As a notification system operates and there is no pre-approval of cosmetic products in Europe, the regulation of these products primarily involves post-marketing surveillance programmes which are both pro-active and reactive in nature.  There is a requirement for a Responsible Person to be designated for each cosmetic product placed on the European market and the Responsible Person must maintain a Product Information File (PIF) relating to each product. This PIF contains all information relating to testing and can be requested for review by the IMB both proactively, as part of a pre-planned surveillance programme, and reactively if there are grounds to suspect a non-compliance. </p><p>  The PIF must also contain the cosmetic product safety report as specified in Annex I of Regulation (EC) 1223/2009 on cosmetic products, this includes information on the toxicological profile of the substance for all relevant toxicological endpoints and a clear identification of the source of the information. The IMB will be pro-actively reviewing PIFs over the next 12 months for compliance with the implementation of the full animal testing ban as part of a pre-planned surveillance programme. </p><p>  Prior to October 2010 the HSE, Environmental Health Services was responsible for enforcement activities in relation to cosmetics and my Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have the statistic compiled for the period March 2009 to October 2010 and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</p></reply>

This is an increase of 1.7% and 7.6% respectively on the 2012 figures.</p><p>  During 2013, the Department of Health will work with the HSE and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to develop Programme Based Budgeting in 2013 within the confines of the existing financial systems.  This will take place in advance of the Vote of the HSE being disestablished, with funding for the services being provided through the Vote of the Office of the Minister for Health with effect from January 2014.</p><p>  Successful transformation of our health services requires a corresponding transformation of our funding model.  The first stage in transforming our funding model is to clarify funding streams through the creation of directorates and corresponding programme based budgets.   As part of this process, a Primary Care Directorate is being established within the HSE.  This directorate will oversee the development and strengthening of primary care.  An announcement is expected very shortly on the appointment of the National Director of Primary Care, who will head up the Primary Care Directorate.</p></reply>

Desired outcomes range from a return to full independence in social and work situations to a person requiring long-term support and care but with a higher level of independence than in the absence of neuro-rehabilitation.  Current services available include acute hospital services; the National Rehabilitation Hospital; multi-disciplinary community services; long-term assisted living supports; and rehabilitative training services.  These services are provided directly by the Health Service Executive (HSE) and several non-statutory organisations.</p><p>  The Department of Health and the HSE have developed and published the &quot;National Policy and Strategy for the provision of Neuro-Rehabilitation Services in Ireland 2011 - 2015&quot;. In addition the HSE is developing its Rehabilitation Medicine Programme within the Clinical Strategy and Programmes Directorate.  The Report is the overarching policy on neuro-rehabilitation services and  includes proposals for a framework for the future of neuro-rehabilitation services in Ireland and proposals on implementing the report including key elements such as: guiding principles; implementation structure; methodology for implementation; and information and communication.</p><p>  The Report recognises that given the current economic climate, the focus in the short to medium term has to be on re-configuration of services, structures and resources and the enhancement of the skills and competencies required to meet the changing context. The Rehabilitation Medicine Programme has been working in collaboration with the National Disability Unit as part of an expert Working Group planning for the implementation of the Report. The key priority areas, as identified in the HSE's National Operational Plan for 2013 are to: Map and develop Integrated Service Area level rehabilitation networks; and implement the model of care for rehabilitation services within the networks with a focus on community rehabilitation.</p><p>  The Rehabilitation Medicine Programme has incorporated key elements of the Report into its own Model of Care and adopted the Strategy's recommendation of &quot;hub and spoke&quot; model for specialist rehabilitation services and is keen to progress with a comprehensive model for the continuation of such service into the community.  With regard to funding agencies, this Government currently provides over &euro;1.5 billion to the Disability Services Programme through the HSE's National Service Plan for 2013. We are committed to protecting frontline services for people with disabilities, including neuro-rehabilitation services, to the greatest possible extent.  The Minister for Health is working to ensure that protection is afforded to the disability sector and the Social Care area as a whole.  While the allocation for disability services in 2013 will be reduced by 1.2%, its share of the estimate reduction, the HSE is seeking to maximise the provision of services within available resources and to maintaining a consistent level to that provided in 2012.</p></reply>

Tourism and coach operators in particular will also benefit from  the recently introduced fuel rebate and small tourism businesses will also benefit from the higher VAT threshold of &euro;1.25 million. </p><p>  In 2013 the Government will spend almost &euro;140m through its agencies to support the industry, to market tourism at home and abroad and to support product development.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland also provides a range of business and training supports to tourism enterprises.</p><p>  These measures put in place to support tourism helped to contribute to growth of almost 8% in visitor numbers in 2011 and, although visitor numbers only experienced marginal growth in 2012, figures released last week by the CSO showed that spending by visitors to Ireland increased by 4.5% last year to &euro;3.68 billion.  In addition, according to F&aacute;ilte Ireland, the numbers employed in the tourism and hospitality sectors in Ireland is now 185,000, up 5,000 on their previous estimate.  Finally, as the Deputy is aware, 2013 is the year of the Gathering and this initiative will provide further support for the industry this year as well as a legacy effect for future years.</p></reply>

The Road Safety Authority (Commercial Vehicle Roadworthiness) Act 2012 provides for the RSA to become the central driver licensing authority in Ireland.  This came into effect on 12 January 2013.</p><p>  The new system involves three outsourced elements, a card production facility, a front office for engaging with the customer, and a back office to process applications.  All three are overseen by a &lsquo;centre of excellence&rsquo; based in the RSA itself.  The card licence is standardised across the European Union and therefore there must be consistency in the quality and standard of information used.  The photograph is digital and is not stuck on to the card in the way it was on the old paper licence.  The capture of the photograph is included in the fee for the licence.  As the system develops, the SAFE2 ID standard will be implemented, at which point the only option will be the digital photo taken at the Front Office Network.</p><p>  There was no specific tender for photo capture.  I understand that this matter comes under the contract for the front office, which was recently awarded to SGS by the RSA.  The operation of the tender processes for the outsourced elements was a matter for the RSA and all contractors have now been procured.</p></reply>

The purpose of these visits is threefold:</p><p>  Firstly, to promote Irish economic and cultural links overseas.  Secondly, to use the opportunity of St Patrick's Day to strengthen our bi-lateral relationship with other states.  Thirdly, to connect with our diaspora overseas as well as those individuals with a strong connection or affinity with Ireland.  With regard to bi-lateral relations, I met with Minister for Culture, Tourism and Sport and the Minister for Patriots and Veterans Affairs  in Korea.  While in Japan, I met with the Minister for Land, Infrastructure and Transport and the Minister for Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology. I also had the privilege in Japan of attending a meeting of the Japan Ireland Parliamentary Friendship League in their parliament. These meetings gave me an opportunity to discuss matters relating to matters of mutual interest between our two countries and also to promote key Irish interests in Korea and Japan.</p><p>  In relation to the promotion of Irish economic and cultural interests, I undertook a number of events with the Enterprise Ireland and the IDA offices in Korea and Japan, meeting with IDA client companies with investments in Ireland or those considering an investment. I also met with Enterprise Ireland clients exporting into these economies, as well as meeting with a variety of tourism trade interests in Japan.</p><p>  I was pleased to have the opportunity to do all three on my visit to Korea and Japan. With regard to Korea, I was pleased to be able to attend our National Day event in Seoul, as well as to meet separately with members of the Irish community in Korea and members of the Global Irish Network. In Japan, I attended the National Day events in Tokyo and Osaka, and participated in the St Patrick's Day Parades in Yokohama and Tokyo. These events gave me an opportunity to express my Government's support for our links with the diaspora, as well as to learn as to how we can better improve our relationship with Japan and Korea.</p></reply>

The RTP is managed by Pobal in conjunction with the NTA as part of the Programme transition. Thirty-five groups covering thirty-six geographical areas nationwide are currently being funded under the Programme. </p><p>  Since becoming Minister for Public and Commuter Transport, my aim has been to strengthen the RTP by ensuring a more efficient delivery structure by maximising integration with other state transport services and by making the Programme a sustainable part of the public transport system. This is in line with the Programme for Government commitment to maintain and extend the RTP with other local transport services. </p><p>  Given that resources are limited and that the Value for Money and Policy Review of the RTP, published last year, recommended organisational restructuring to achieve efficiencies and the better alignment of the 35 RTP groups with local authorities, it is necessary that the current delivery mechanisms and structures are examined and revised. </p><p>  In summary the current structures of the RTP are not sustainable if the required efficiencies and savings are to be achieved. If these are not achieved then with the limited resources available services will decline. I am not prepared to allow that to happen.</p><p>  Work is currently underway to determine the optimal structure for the delivery of rural transport from an efficiency and service perspective. One of the proposals being examined is that the RTPs be aligned with local authorities and that a number of Transport Co-ordination Units be established. The anticipated efficiencies to be achieved under the proposed structure include the efficiencies and savings identified in the Value for Money Report.  </p><p>  Central to any new structure will be an acknowledgement of the significant role that the Programme currently plays in combatting rural isolation and enhancing mobility, accessibility and community participation of local people, particularly those at risk of social exclusion. </p><p>  I would emphasis that no decision has been taken but I am hopeful that I will be in a position to recommend a new structure later this year which will allow for the maxmising of spend on services and the reduction of administration  costs.</p></reply>

Works on those roads are funded from local authorities own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.</p><p>  The Department has allocated a total of &euro;349.462 million to local authorities for works on regional and local roads in 2013, and increasingly this funding is being directed towards the maintenance and repair of regional and local roads and low cost safety works.  This will remain the position in the coming years.</p><p>  My Department recently wrote to local authorities offering additional flexibility this year by allowing Councils to transfer resources into their discretionary grant from their Restoration Improvement Grant to ensure funding is targeted at the areas which are most in need.  </p><p>  It is also important to reiterate that the role of Exchequer grants for regional and local roads is to supplement Councils in their own resources spending in this area and local authorities need to prioritise increased expenditure from their own resources on their own roads in view of the current difficult situation.</p></reply>
