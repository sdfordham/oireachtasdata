Implementation of these commitments is a matter for all concerned.  During the January round table meeting, we took time to review implementation of the commitments and we will return to this at a future meeting of the group.  One of the outcomes of the November round table discussions was a commitment by the relevant stakeholders to review the Quality Payments System or QPS. The QPS was devised in 2010 between the processing industry and farming organisations. Teagasc provided assistance with the technical aspects of the grid design.     </p>  <p>  My Department did not engage in the design of the QPS as it is a commercial matter between farmers and processors.  It would be inappropriate for me or my Department to take a lead role in a review of the pricing mechanism for beef. </p>  <p>  It is the responsibility of the beef processing industry and farming organisations to discuss the QPS and formulate the methodology of any review . It is their agreement and therefore it must be their review.   </p>  <p>  As chairperson of the Beef Roundtable discussions, I would encourage those parties to decide now how they wish to proceed. I have offered the assistance of Teagasc who can provide any technical input required, if requested to do so by the relevant parties. The QPS has formed an integral part of beef production in Ireland since its introduction. I strongly support its core principle of price differentiation based on quality, taking conformation scores and fat content into account.   </p>  <p>  Any change to the QPS must be carefully considered and take account of the national scope of its impact. The continued positioning of Irish beef as a high quality product on EU and international markets must be a key consideration. </p>  <p>  While Irish beef must supply a diversity of markets, the sale of high quality product from beef breeds will continue to be a central part of any market strategy designed to deliver maximum value to Irish farmers. The QPS was designed by agreement between farmers and processors to reflect that dynamic.   </p>  <p>  The establishment of the grid was a complex matter and not all stakeholders, including farm bodies, were ad idem on its objectives. It may be equally difficult to achieve consensus in any review.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-03-31a.12.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015033100052#WRA00900"><p>Under the provisions of the Basic Payment Scheme, farmers need to declare an eligible hectare for each payment entitlement held in order to benefit from payment. The hectares declared must be eligible and must have an agricultural activity carried out on them. The situation in Ireland has not changed since the Single Payment Scheme was replaced by the Basic Payment Scheme at the beginning of 2015. Eligible lands include those lands with herbaceous grasses and other grazable vegetation. In Ireland, the main type of vegetation other than grasses is heather. I am, therefore, satisfied that the definition of eligible areas under the Basic Payment Scheme has no implication for designated lands such as Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas in Ireland.  The main difficulty in relation to land eligibility arising from recent inspection experience is the lack of any farming activity on some land, particularly marginal land. It is a problem that can to some extent be solved by those farmers applying for payments on marginal lands. However, I am prepared to pursue options that may assist farmers, who have marginal lands, in particular those that have designated land, in meeting the requirements of the Direct Payment regulations. My Department officials are in direct contact with the EU Commission with a view to progressing the issue and looking at all possible options.   </p>  <p>  This year is an important year for farmers in that new payment entitlements will be allocated to applicants under the 2015 Basic Payment Scheme. In order to ensure that they will benefit from their full payment under this Scheme up to the end of this decade, farmers should ensure that the number of entitlements allocated corresponds to the number of eligible hectares on which there is and will continue to be an agricultural activity on their farms. The number of entitlements allocated under the BPS will be based on the eligible land declared in 2013 or 2015, whichever is the lower. There is, therefore, no incentive for farmers to increase the area they declare in 2015. </p></reply>

These factors include seasonality of production, consumer preferences, competition from other meats, conditions in international markets, retail promotions, exchange rates and the overall macroeconomic situation   and a combination of all of these will determine the price paid to a beef farmer .  I am pleased to note that prices at the end of last week have increased 15% since last September and are now 6% higher than in the same point in 2014. Current beef prices in Ireland stand at 103% of the EU15 average. As of the end of last week, the average price s paid (excluding VAT) for an R3 steer stood at &euro;4.03/kg and an R3 Heifer at &euro;   4.14, an increase on the previous week and almost 10% higher than the beginning of the year in both cases. </p>  <p>The weakening of the euro is a factor in strong demand for Irish beef, due to 90% of   beef produced in the State   being   destined for export, the majority of which goes to the UK. Although slaughter numbers are still high at present, supply is ultimately expected to contract this year by around 10%. This, combined with more markets being available for both Irish Beef and live exports, suggest continued positive market conditions as the year progresses.   </p>  <p>  In relation to farmers&rsquo; share of margins along the supply chain, I will, as agreed at the Beef Forum, be bringing forward proposals for the recognition of beef producer groups, which can provide a framework for collective action by farmers in a range of areas, including collective bargaining on price. </p>  <p>Of course, new market opportunities for both beef and live cattle exports also impact on the eventual returns to farmers. The recent opening of the US market to Irish beef is a major achievement in this regard. The announcement of China lifting its ban on Irish beef is yet an other major gain for producers and is a clear endorsement of Ireland&rsquo;s food safety standards .   </p>  <p>The Deputy will also be aware that I have made provision for a package of support measures for the Beef Sector in 2015 worth over &euro;70m. This includes &euro;52m for the Beef Data and Genomics Programme (BDGP) which forms part of Ireland&rsquo;s draft Rural Development Programme and will have a budget of &euro;300m over a period of 6 years. The proposed BDGP is intended to deliver an accelerated improvement in the environmental sustainability of the herd through the application of genomic technology. It will also position Ireland at the global forefront in the application of genomics technology and cement our place as one of the most important export focussed beef producing nations in the world.   </p></reply>

It is designed to specifically target environmental priorities, but there is also provision to accept applications from farmers with no such priorities, but who are committed to carrying out general environmental actions on their holdings. Access to the scheme is therefore by means of three Tiers, which will allow the most pressing environmental priorities to be addressed in order of importance, but also provides for a broad approach to delivering environmental benefits across all farming systems.  In Tier 1, all farmers with Priority Environmental Assets (PEAs) get first priority access to the Scheme in year one and subsequent years. If any of the following PEAs are applicable to the holding, they must be chosen and the relevant actions planned.</p><p>- Farmland Habitat (private Natura sites)</p><p>- Farmland Birds (Twite, Breeding Waders, Chough, Geese/swans, Corncrake, Grey Partridge, Hen Harrier)</p><p>- Commonages</p><p>- High Status Water Area</p><p>- Rare Breeds</p><p>In the absence of any of the listed PEAs, a farmer (whether beef, sheep or dairy) with a whole farm stocking-rate exceeding 140kg organic Nitrogen <font color="#FF0000"> </font>per hectare, or any farmer with more than 30 hectare of arable crops, will be considered under Tier 1 if he or she adopts at least one of four mandatory actions identified for them. Registered Organic farmers will qualify for priority access to the scheme under Tier 1, by selecting actions appropriate to the farm.</p><p>Under Tier 2, farmers who do not have Priority Environmental Assets but whose lands include a Vulnerable Water Area, may apply for access to the scheme. In the absence of a Vulnerable Water Area, an applicant may still qualify for Tier 2 access provided that they choose one of four mandatory actions identified. </p><p>Tier 3 sets out a list of actions which can be adopted in addition to actions laid down in Tiers 1 or 2, providing a means by which farmers can maximise their GLAS payment. Tier 3 also provides a mechanism by which farmers who do not fulfil any of the criteria for Tiers 1 or 2, can apply to join GLAS.</p><p>The structure of GLAS, therefore, while targeted closely at specific priority environmental objectives, also contains considerable flexibility and the scope to attract a wide range of farmers.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-03-31a.22.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015033100052#WRA01400"><p>There is specific provision within the online GLAS system to split parcels. In fact, the facility is there to split a n existing parcel into as many as three new parcels to deliver up to three separate area-based actions.  By way of example, a 12 hectare parcel could be split to deliver a combination of Traditional Hay Meadow, Low Input Permanent Pasture and Wild Bird Cover, generating an annual payment of just under &euro;5,000. The adviser can do this, online, on behalf of his or her client. Where a parcel is not split, one area based action may be selected together with certain linear actions and again it should be possible in most cases to choose a combination which delivers the best rate of payment to the farmer .   </p>  <p>It is a key requirement in the approval process of the Rural Development Plan that all proposed actions are verifiable and controllable and my Department&rsquo;s online system for GLAS has been designed with this very much in mind. This is the reason why only certain combinations of actions are allowed on each parcel , and these have been pre-populated into the online system which should significantly reduce error-rates later . The overall objective is to reduce the possibility of penalties for the farmer down the line.     </p></reply>

Two statutory committees of Bord na gCon, namely the Control Committee and the Control Appeals Committee are central to the regulatory process. These committees operate independently of Bord na gCon.The Control Committee and the Control Appeals Committee of Bord na gCon were established under the Greyhound Industry (Control Committee and Control Appeal Committee) Regulations 2007 (S.I. Number 301 of 2007). </p><p>Under that legislation, full details of any laboratory findings can only be published at the conclusion of proceedings by the Control Committee and the Control Appeals Committee. </p><p>The majority of samples obtained at licensed stadia are tested for prohibited substances in the National Greyhound Laboratory at Bord na gCon headquarters in Limerick and some samples are tested in an appropriate laboratory the UK. </p><p>The number of Control Committee monetary Sanctions for the years 2014 and 2015 where prohibited substances were detected were 71 and 10 respectively. The monetary sanctions ranged from &euro;100 to &euro;2,500 with 58 cases of sanctions in the range &euro;100 to &euro;200, 9 cases in the range &euro;250 to &euro;400, 5 cases of &euro;500 to &euro;750 and 9 cases in the range &euro;1,000 to &euro;2,500. </p><p>In the circumstances where the additional sanction of a Testing Order is applied by the Control Committee the greyhounds under the care of the Owner/Trainer are subjected to testing when presented for racing for a specified period of time. The testing order imposed in 2014 was for 3 months and the one for 2015 was for 6 months. There were two Testing Order Sanctions with 1 in each of the two years. </p><p>The Control Committee has not issued any Exclusion or Disqualification Orders in this time period.</p><p>The Control Committee, when determining the sanctions consider the following:</p><p>- Nature of substance detected</p><p>- Evidence presented at a Hearing</p><p>- Mitigating circumstances when relevant</p><p>- Co-operation with the proceedings</p><p>- Previous Offences</p><p>I have been assured by Bord na gCon of its commitment to ensuring that the regulatory system within the industry is aligned with international best practice founded on integrity, education and transparency to all our stakeholders.</p></reply>

As of now, this beef must be sold as raw product in the US and may not be ground (minced) in the US before being placed on the market. Beef currently being exported to the US is in the form of primal and subprimal cuts.  I am fully aware of the importance of securing this additional approval to export manufacturing beef given the high prices for such product in the US right now.  This is an issue I also pursued with my US counterpart, Tom Vilsack Secretary Agriculture when we met in Washington.  My officials are working intensively with their counterparts the Food Safety Inspection Service (FSIS) of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to agree and put in place procedures to allow Ireland to export beef intended for grinding to the USA.   We have agreed a roadmap for how such approval might be achieved but there are a number of processes to be completed first and we are currently working through these. </p>  <p>  The US beef market is potentially extremely lucrative, with consumption at 11 million metric tonnes annually, which makes this new market such an exciting one for Irish producers. While grass fed is a small volume category compared to conventional or grain fed beef, currently accounting for approximately 10% of total volume, it is estimated to be growing at approximately 20%+ per annum. Consumers in this segment of the market will be a key target in the marketing efforts to promote Irish beef. </p>  <p>I was delighted to be able to visit the US in February to launch the arrival of Irish beef for the first time there in 16 years and I can report very strong interest from US buyers and distributors in Irish beef. The return of Irish beef to the US market was the result of significant political, technical and diplomatic efforts by my Department, Bord Bia and Irish Embassy in Washington DC. It was a collaborative effort which has borne fruit, with Ireland being the first European country to regain access to the biggest beef market in the world. All of the major Irish beef exporters that accompanied me reported strong interest from US buyers and distributors, which are already lead ing to commercial deals being signed.   </p>  <p>I am also delighted to see that the first commercial shipments of Irish beef have landed in the US. Indeed the very first shipment was served at the annual Ireland-America Fund attended by the Taoiseach during his Saint Patrick&rsquo;s day visit. This was a huge marketing opportunity to serve our beef to a hugely influential Irish-American network and one which we exploited to the full.</p>  <p>  Currently just 2% of Irish beef exports go outside the EU each year and further diversifying the available markets has been a key element of my strategy for the beef sector for some time. This is a key element in ensuring more sustainable returns to beef farmers and ensuring that an over-reliance on particular markets does not harm the long term prospects of the sector.

This principle is already enshrined under the World Trade Organisation Agreement and I am pleased to report that it is also recognised by both sides in the EU/US negotiations as the basis for the TTIP agreement. Equally it is important that both the EU and United States retain the policy space to restrict certain practices and processes on social and ethical grounds and this is also recognised, in principle, by both sides.    We are at a relatively early stage in these negotiations and it is difficult to predict the final shape of an agreement at this point. Nevertheless, I have made it clear to the EU Commission, which negotiates on our behalf, that the principle of equivalence, and the right of reservation on policy grounds, must both be respected in the negotiations. This is particularly relevant in relation to the use of hormones in meat production. The EU Commission has made it clear that it will not allow the importation of hormone treated meat into the EU and this is well understood by the US side. In these circumstances, I do not anticipate that the TTIP agreement will have any impact on food standards within the state. </p></reply>

Without wishing to impugn or criticise the standards of animal welfare practised in the US, it will be crucial for ethical and economic reasons to ensure in the negotiations that the principle of equivalence is applied in respect of imports from the US and that the competitiveness of EU production is not undermined by imports of animals and meat from animals subject to less robust animal welfare rules.  For this reason, Ireland has encouraged the EU Commission to be ambitious in ensuring that the high standards of animal welfare applied across the EU are fully reflected in a trade agreement.     While it is a fact that animal welfare issues generally fall outside the WTO agreement on Sanitary and Phyto-sanitary matters, this will be a bilateral agreement and there is therefore more scope to address the issue. Furthermore, the US, like the EU has a well-developed agriculture sector and the argument cannot be made that seeking similar standards to the EU imposes unfair burdens on farmers. </p></reply>

In developing these schemes I am obliged to respect all EU Regulatory provisions, one of which is to ensure that similar actions are not paid twice under both schemes.During the negotiations with the European Commission, which were long and protracted, the issue of protecting against double funding across both these Schemes was emphasised at every stage of the process .However, it isnot correct to say that a farmer cannot receive a GLAS payment and an Organic payment on the same land parcel. This is allowed where the commitments under both schemes are mutually exclusive and there is clearly no risk of double payment involved. The Organic payment is allowed with the GLAS payment for the following actions:</p><p>- Additional New Hedgerow Establishment</p><p>- Arable Grass Margins</p><p>- Bat Nest Boxes</p><p>- Bird Nest Boxes</p><p>- Conservation of Solitary Bees (Boxes)</p><p>- Conservation of Solitary Bees (Sand)</p><p>- Conservation of Private NaturaSites</p><p>- Coppicing of Hedgerows</p><p>- Green Cover Establishment from a Sown Crop</p><p>- Laying of Hedgerows</p><p>- Low Emission Slurry Spreading</p><p>- Minimum Tillage</p><p>- Protection and Maintenance of Archaeological Monuments (Grassland)</p><p>- Protection of Watercourses from Bovines</p><p>- Rare Breeds</p><p>- Traditional Dry Stone Wall Maintenance</p><p>- Traditional Orchards</p><p>In addition, it is important to note that GLAS is not a whole farm scheme.

Live exports serve an important purpose as a means of both satisfying market demand for live animals and providing essential alternative market outlets for Irish cattle farmers.    Total live exports for 2014 stood at approximately 237,000 head, valued at &euro;172 million. It is notable that live shipments to non-EU markets grew by 17%, boosted by increased trade with North African countries such as Libya and Tunisia. This factor, along with the weakness of the Euro for trade to Northern Ireland and Great Britain, is indicative of a generally positive outlook for live trade and I believe there are good grounds for optimism here. For example, recent developments suggest a strong possibility that the Turkish market may open to live trade with the European Union before the year is out. </p>  <p>  Approximately 100,000 Friesian calves were exported from Ireland in 2014, up from 87,000 in 2013. Calf exports in recent weeks have been running at a high level, which is evidence of the strong market demand in continental Europe for these types of calves. The main markets for black and white animals continue to be the Netherlands, Belgium and Spain. A good system of transport links to facilitate these exports, an essential element in live trade, is in place, and some extra roll-on roll-off ferry capacity for livestock exports has been added in recent months. Three dedicated vessels and three roll-on roll-off ships are currently approved for export of live animals from Ireland. The process has begun to approve two more dedicated vessels for the purpose of exporting animals.   </p>  <p>  Trade between farmers, marts and processors is a commercial matter for them based on market conditions, both current and projected. As Minister, I am not in a position to interfere in the purchases and choices farmers make when they conduct their business. However, I am fully conscious of the concerns which have been expressed on this issue and will continue, at every opportunity, to pursue the opening of new markets for the live export trade.</p></reply>

Priority under the National Reserve is given to &lsquo;young farmers&rsquo; and to &lsquo;new entrants to farming&rsquo;. The Regulations governing the operation of the National Reserve also include an optional provision whereby Member States may use the National Reserve to allocate new entitlements or give a top-up on the value of existing entitlements for persons who suffer from a &lsquo;Specific Disadvantage&rsquo;.  Following my Department&rsquo;s consultation with the EU Commission, I recently announced that the group commonly known as &ldquo;Old Young Farmers&rdquo;, who established their holding between 1 January 2008 and 31 December 2009, and who, due to the timeframe of setting up their holding, did not benefit from either the Installation Aid or the Young farmer category of the National Reserve, can be considered as a &lsquo;group   suffering from specific disadvantage&rsquo;. The result is that this group will be eligible to apply to the National Reserve under Phase 2 which will open for applications in early April.   </p>  <p>  With regard to the group of farmers to which the Deputy refers who commenced farming prior to 2008, officials from my Department are meeting tomorrow with representatives of this group to discuss their particular circumstances.   </p>  <p>  In establishing the National Reserve I opted for the maximum available 3% of the Basic Payment Scheme financial ceiling, which is estimated at providing a fund of approx. &euro;24 million in 2015. I expect that there will be significant demand for the two priority categories of young farmer and new entrant under Phase 1 of the National Reserve. These two priority categories close for applications later today and the estimated cost of the applications will be assessed. My Department will then have an indication of the level of resource remaining in the National Reserve to cater for the categories under Phase 2 of the Reserve which will open for applications in early April.   </p>  <p>  Eligibility for the Young Farmers Scheme is clearly defined in the EU Regulation and is restricted to farmers who commenced their farming activity no more than five years prior to submitting the Basic Payment Scheme application. My Department has no discretion in the implementation of this aspect of the Regulation and in this regard farmers who commenced their agricultural activity prior to 1 January 2010 are not eligible for the Young Farmers Scheme. </p></reply>

The ICC has confirmed to my Department that it has systems in place to underpin the welfare of animals participating in coursing events. These include the issuing of guidelines to Coursing Clubs and the mandatory inspections of hares and coursing venues in advance of the commencement of an event. </p>  <p>  The ICC rules provide for the postponement/cancellation of meetings in the event of adverse weather conditions, e.g. snow, frost or waterlogged ground, which may impact negatively on the welfare of the hare and/or the greyhound. The ICC invoked this provision when it postponed the national meeting scheduled for Monday, February 2nd 2015, to Sunday, February 8th 2015, due to unfavourable conditions caused by frost. I am advised that officials from the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht did inspect the hares in the paddock while they were in the enclosure and found them to be in a very good condition with sufficient food and water supplied. Officials also attended the last day of the meeting on 8th   February and agreed with the Club officials on the number and locations of the hares to be released back into the wild. </p>  <p>  I am advised that the National Meeting commenced with 177 hares and following the completion of 209 competitive courses, all of the 177 hares were released back to the countryside in accordance with the conditions of the licences granted by the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht. I am also advised that ICC Guideline 7 enforcing the high standard of hare maintenance while the hares were held in captivity, was fully complied with.   </p>  <p>  The ICC has informed my Department that it ensures:</p>  <p>- Veterinary care is available to the hare at all times. Coursing Clubs employ a veterinary surgeon to attend at coursing meetings to administer care as deemed appropriate to any animal in need of attention.</p>  <p>- The health status of all hares is assessed by a veterinary surgeon (appointed by the ICC) and a member of the Hare &amp;amp; Field Committee and an ICC Control Steward prior to coursing.</p>  <p>- A member of the Executive Committee of the ICC oversees each coursing meeting. This person has powers to curtail or abandon a meeting if required.</p>  <p>- An ICC Control Steward is appointed to each meeting to ensure all rules are adhered to by the host club.</p>  <p>- On conclusion of the coursing meeting all hares are released back into the countryside under supervision of an ICC steward and a Wildlife Ranger, when available.</p>  <p>- Wildlife Rangers are officials of the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) and these officials attend a number of coursing meetings, including the National Meeting to monitor compliance with conditions of the licences issued by the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht. These licences facilitate the tagging and capturing of hares for the purpose of hare coursing.</p>  <p>- The conduct of each coursing meeting is monitored to capture relevant information as required by the NPWS and the ICC and this data is returned to the NPWS.</p>  <p>The ICC has assured my Department that the measures outlined above underpin the welfare of animals participating in coursing events, and were in place throughout the period during which the hares were in the care of the ICC for the national meeting. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-03-31a.67.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015033100052#WRA04400"><p>The rules governing the imposition of a super levy fine are set by regulations agreed at EU level. Under these regulations each Member State is allocated a volume quota of milk, above which a super levy fine (of 28.6 cents/litre) has to be paid to the EU Commission by producers who contribute to the over production. It is not possible for me on a unilateral basis to adjust these super levy rules.    The final amount of the superlevy fine will only be known after the end of the quota year. However, for Ireland, each percentage point of production over quota means a levy of approximately &euro;16 million. Based on an over quota position of 5.07% reported at the end of February, this would equate to a super levy of about &euro;80m. </p>  <p>I have, on numerous occasions, proposed action at EU level to mitigate the impact of super levy fines, primarily via utilisation of an adjustment to the butterfat coefficient, as this would not have required an amendment to existing regulations. Other options previously discussed included the front-loading of the remaining quota increases, a reduction in the super levy, or a type of EU flexi-milk arrangement which would have operated providing overall EU production was within quota.   However, given the opposition of a blocking minority of Member States, some of which have gone so far as to seek to link the issue to possible measures to regulate supply after quotas are gone, there is no realistic prospect of any movement on the super-levy. </p>  <p>  With respect to the impending super levy, there are a number of initiatives which I as Minister have taken to help ensure that the Irish dairy sector enters the post quota era as smoothly as possible. Flexibility has been secured from the European Commission for farmers to pay the superlevy fine on a phased basis over 3 years and my Department are working on the details of a scheme to give effect to this flexibility at national level. This announcement wills serve as a major boost to dairy farmers in helping to ease the cashflow burden of paying the superlevy bill.   </p>  <p>  On-going contact has been maintained with the Minister for Finance to ensure that existing and future taxation policy reflects the Government&rsquo;s commitment to agriculture. Of interest to dairy farmers here will be the announcement in last October&rsquo;s budget to provide for income averaging over five years when it comes to paying income tax bills. I have also ensured that Priority has been given to measures for the dairy sector in the Rural Development Plan. In addition, in regular meetings with the CEOs of the Irish banks I have impressed upon them the need to show flexibility in their dealings with farmers experiencing temporary cash flow difficulties in 2015.</p>  <p>  Furthermore Teagasc, in late January and early February, held a series of very well attended dairy seminars throughout the country to help dairy farmers to manage their dairy enterprises through 2015, while also planning the efficient development of their dairy business in a non-quota environment. This complemented the Cash Plan Programme, supported by my Department in 2014, which was aimed at encouraging recent entrants to dairying to engage in a programme to improve farm planning, cash flow management and to minimise the cost of producing a litre of milk by managing the factors that influence this cost.   </p>  <p>  The abolition of milk quota presents a massive opportunity for the Irish dairy sector and one which we should look forward to with confidence. However, it is important that dairy farmers plan prudently for this new era. I believe we have the right balance of measures in pace to ensure that Irish dairy farmers can enter the new era with full confidence. </p></reply>

The system also provides Advisors with the tools to prepare detailed and accurate farm-plans for their clients.    Issues always emerge when any new system is first launched into the live environment, particularly an environment with large numbers of clients and literally tens of thousands of potential variables across the farms being planned. My Department has been responding to these systematically, and has already delivered updated data to the system and new tools for the user. Overall, the response to the new system has been very positive, and all recognise the enormous step forward it represents. My Department maintains close contact with the advisors and their representatives, who were closely involved in user-testing the system before roll-out, and we will continue to listen and to improve and adapt the system. There will, of course, be a learning curve for users as well and as these become more familiar with the system, and with what is allowed under GLAS itself. Already we have seen a rapid acceleration in the preparation of applications online. As things stand, 9,119 new applications have already been created on the new system, which is a tremendous achievement by all concerned. </p></reply>

The hectares declared must be eligible and must have an agricultural activity carried out on them. The situation in Ireland has not changed since the Single Payment Scheme was replaced by the Basic Payment Scheme at the beginning of 2015. Eligible lands include those lands with herbaceous grasses and other grazable vegetation. In Ireland, the main type of vegetation other than grasses is heather. I am, therefore, satisfied that the definition of eligible areas under the Basic Payment Scheme has no implication for designated lands such as Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas in Ireland.  The main difficulty in relation to land eligibility arising from recent inspection experience is the lack of any farming activity on some land, particularly marginal land . It is   a problem that can to some extent be solved   by those farmers applying for payments on marginal lands. However, I am prepared to pursue options that may assist farmers, who have marginal lands, in particular those that have designated land , in meeting the requirements of the Direct Payment regulations. My Department officials are in direct contact with the EU Commission with a view to progressing the issue and looking at all possible options.   </p>  <p>  This year is an important year for farmers in that new payment entitlements will be allocated to applicants under the 2015 Basic Payment Scheme. In order to ensure that they will benefit from their full payment under this Scheme up to the end of this decade, farmers should ensure that the number of entitlements allocated corresponds to the number of eligible hectares on which there is and will continue to be an agricultural activity on their farms. The number of entitlements allocated under the BPS will be based on the eligible land declared in 2013 or 2015, whichever is the lower. There is, therefore, no incentive for farmers to increase the area they declare in 2015. </p></reply>

I have made this very clear on a number of occasions.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Charlie Flanagan T.D., and the Minister of State for European Affairs and Data Protection, Dara Murphy T.D., have also spoken clearly on this issue. </p>  <p>  The reasons why the UK's presence in the EU is so important to Ireland are well-documented.  British membership is central to the health of our economy and to the broader British-Irish relationship.  And the people of Northern Ireland benefit, on a variety of levels, from our joint membership of the Union.  </p>  <p>  It is also the Government's firm view that the EU is better and stronger as a whole with Britain as a full and committed EU member.</p>  <p>  That is why our focus remains on keeping the UK in the European Union, rather than planning for their departure.  A key part of this approach is working closely with the UK, and other Member States, on EU policy issues on which we have similar views.  The British Government and other British political parties have made it clear that the achievement of common aims in regard to EU policy &ndash; and economic policy in particular &ndash; will help buttress the case in Britain for its continued membership of the EU. </p>  <p>  We recognise that the UK has some legitimate concerns about how the EU functions and its future direction.  We will therefore be open and sympathetic to considering any British proposals, if and when they are presented, on how we can improve the functioning of the EU.  At the same time &ndash; as we have said before &ndash; we will not support anything that would weaken the Union or our position within it.</p>  <p>  While the Government is determined to do its utmost to keep the UK in the EU, we recognise that we must be prepared for any scenario.  We are therefore monitoring and assessing developments in the EU-UK relationship very carefully. </p>  <p>  My Department is working closely with other Departments, including the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, in this regard.  The Department of Finance is also playing an important role and has recently commissioned a report to improve our understanding of the macro-economic links between the UK and Ireland in the context of our EU membership. </p>  <p>  While our priority remains helping to secure the UK's place in the EU, we will continue to take a vigilant and comprehensive approach, across Government, to ensure that Ireland's interests are best protected in the case of a British departure from the EU.</p></reply>

However, the Department of Social Protection has an important role to play in assisting households in the immediate aftermath of emergency events such as flooding or severe weather.  The Community Welfare Service of the Department closely engages with the Local Authorities and other bodies to ensure that all households that require assistance are identified and provided with access to supports.</p>  <p>  Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, the Department may make a single exceptional needs payment (ENP) to help meet essential, once-off and unforeseen expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income.  ENPs are payable at the discretion of the officers administering the scheme taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case in order to ensure that the payments target those most in need of assistance.  In addition to the payment of ENPs, SWA legislation also provides for assistance in the form of an urgent needs payment (UNP).  In certain circumstances, this payment can be made to persons who would not normally be entitled to SWA.  Examples of situations where such assistance may be provided would be in the aftermath of flooding or a domestic fire where the immediate needs, such as food, clothing, fuel and household goods of the people affected may be met by a UNP in cash or in kind.  The Government has provided &euro;29 million for the ENP and UNP schemes in 2015</p>  <p>  The humanitarian assistance scheme was approved by Government in November 2009.  The Government authorised the spending of up to &euro;10 million in humanitarian aid to households affected by flooding.  An additional sum of &euro;15 million was approved by the Government in 2014 to ensure that there were adequate resources to meet the required responses.  In 2014 some &euro;1.26 million was spent under the humanitarian assistance scheme.  The scheme, which is means tested, provides emergency financial assistance to households who are not in a position to meet costs for essential needs in the period immediately following flooding or severe weather events.  The scheme aims to provide financial support to people who have suffered damage to their homes and in doing so provide hardship alleviation, as opposed to full compensation.  Repairs for structural damage caused as a result of the flooding or severe weather events can also be considered under the scheme.

The Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2008 provided for the transfer of responsibility for the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) to the Citizens Information Board (CIB), under the aegis of the Department of Social Protection.  CIB delivers on its remit to provide services to the public by supporting a network of delivery partners which includes 42 local Citizens Information Services (CIS) and 51 local Money Advice and Budgeting Services (MABS).  </p>  <p>  The legislative provisions governing Board membership of the CIB are contained in the Comhairle Act 2000, the Citizens Information Act 2007, and the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2011.  In September 2014, the Government agreed new arrangements for filling State Board vacancies and new Guidelines on Appointments to State Boards were issued in November 2014.  Vacancies on the Board of CIB are filled in accordance with these new Guidelines and the legislative requirements.</p>  <p>  As part of the implementation of its Strategic Plan 2012-2015, CIB commissioned a feasibility study to identify options for organisational integration by its delivery partners.  This work was carried out by a company called Pathfinder and overseen by a Steering Group, comprising national representatives from Citizens Information Services staff and Boards, MABS staff and Boards and staff from the Citizens Information Board.  The work included extensive and comprehensive consultation with all stakeholders, including representatives of CIB's delivery partner services (CIS and MABS) at local level.  It identified a number of options for consideration.  Following on from this, the Board of CIB agreed to the establishment of a Design Group tasked with outlining and recommending possible new structural models.  The Design Group includes members of the voluntary boards and staff of a number of the CIS and MABS services, together with representation from CIB management.  Submissions were sought by CIB from the representatives of Boards and staff of CIS and MABS, to inform the deliberations of the Design Group, which will report back to the Board in due course.  Accordingly, I am satisfied that the level of engagement in the process involving all the relevant CIB delivery partners, including the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, will reflect the inputs and views of all stakeholders and will contribute to the development of more effective service delivery structures which will enhance outcomes for all citizens.</p></reply>

There are currently approximately 70,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;298 million for 2015. </p>  <p>  The Department is also actively engaging with Tusla and non-Government organisations in providing the necessary support to vulnerable young people leaving care who are experiencing homelessness or in insecure situations.  These cases are managed on a case by case basis and the payment of deposits and rent in advance is considered.  This form of assistance is very important to those on low incomes who are at risk of, or who are homeless, or who rely on the private rented market to meet their housing needs. </p>  <p>  In 2014, the Department made a total of some 3,000 payments of rent deposits/rent in advance at a cost of &euro;1.48 million throughout the country, of which some 850 payments at a cost of over &euro;360,000 were made to persons aged under 25 years.  </p>  <p>  The Department continues to  engage in inter-agency responses to homelessness and through its work in the Homeless Persons Units in Dublin and participation on Homeless Action Teams throughout the country which provides assistance to people in sourcing the most appropriate accommodation available.</p>  <p>  The reduced rates of jobseeker's allowance encourage young jobseekers to improve their skills and remain active in the labour market in order to avoid the risk of becoming long-term unemployed and will help them to progress into sustainable employment.  Where a person is in receipt of a reduced rate of jobseeker's allowance and he or she participates in a course of education or training a higher rate of &euro;160 applies. </p>  <p>  In addition to the measures in place under rent supplement, the Youth Guarantee sets a medium-term objective of ensuring that all young people receive an offer of employment within four months of becoming unemployed.  The main plank of the guarantee is assistance to young people in finding and securing sustainable jobs, through earlier and enhanced engagement processes.  For those who do not find employment, additional offers are provided for.  Most such offers are in further education or training.  Others are in community-based employment programmes such as CE, Gateway and T&uacute;s, or through the JobsPlus employment subsidy for private employment. </p>  <p>  In addition, additional places on a number of programmes and youth-oriented variants of existing schemes have been rolled out.  First Steps will offer young jobseekers aged between 18 and 25 the opportunity to gain valuable work experience and training with the help of dedicated assistance from Departmental  case officers.

The Universal Retirement Savings Group (URSG) has been established to consider the constituent factors involved in constructing an efficient and effective universal retirement savings system and to bring forward a recommendation in the form of a roadmap and estimated timeline for introduction.</p>  <p>  The URSG consists of senior officials from a range of key Government departments and those public bodies with a particular responsibility and expertise in the area.  Membership also includes international representatives from the UK's Department for Work and Pensions and the OECD who bring significant expertise in designing, delivering and assessing supplementary pension systems. </p>  <p>  Two meetings of the URSG have taken place to date.  As the Group is managing the deliberative process which will underpin the development of the roadmap, material relating to deliberations will be available after it has been considered by Government.  In undertaking specific or specialised areas of its work programme the Group will consult with, and invite submissions from, pension's experts external to the Group.  This will include establishing reference groups to utilise expertise and facilitate input from various sectorial interests such as those from the pensions industry, representatives of employers, trade unions and consumer/interest groups.

The income received by participants on T&uacute;s is treated as income from employment for PRSI purposes and, in the same manner as other workers, is subject to Class A PRSI.  This provides the participants on these schemes with access to the benefit of full insurability, including future entitlement to short-term benefits such as illness and jobseekers benefits and contributes towards establishing entitlement to pensions.  </p>  <p>  A central payroll service is provided for T&uacute;s participants on behalf of the Department and weekly remuneration is paid to the participant&rsquo;s bank account.  It is worth remembering that T&uacute;s is an employment activation opportunity aimed at those who are unemployed.  The scheme supports the goals of providing and developing important skills to participants, including general work readiness. One aspect of work readiness is the operation of a personal account for lodgement of wages and to support further financial transactions. The majority of employers today will only offer the payment of wages directly into an employee's account for reasons of safety, security, economy and visible audit trails. The Department is the biggest client of the post office network, using it for both mail and cash services.  The operations of all schemes funded by the Department are monitored with a view to making any necessary improvements and to ensure they operate to take account of any changes arising on other schemes or policy initiatives.</p></reply>

The PSC is designed to replace other cards within the public sector such as the free travel pass and the social services card of this Department and to make it easy for providers of public services to verify the identity of customers. The introduction of the card, in addition to providing a more efficient service for customers, is also helping to deter and prevent irregularities, including personation and identity theft. </p>  <p>  The PSC project is earmarked as a key initiative in the Public Service Reform Plan with the aim to &ldquo;expand the use of the PSC to cover a greater range of services&rdquo;.  Approximately 1.3 million cards have now been issued.  These include some 385,000 Free Travel variants.  PSC registration is currently being expanded to encompass all applicants for a Personal Public Service (PPS) Number and people applying for, or in receipt of, social protection payments or benefits, including Jobseeker payments, Free Travel entitlement, Child Benefit payments, State Pensions, and One Parent Family payments.</p>  <p>  A PSC is currently issued following a registration process involving the capture of an individual&rsquo;s photograph and signature and the verification of identity data already held by the Department. Registration is taking place countrywide in 89 offices of the Department. Registration is something that a person will need to do once, and usually takes between 15 and 25 minutes to complete.</p>  <p>  The legislation governing entitlement to social protection payments requires a person, when requested, to authenticate his or her identity. This is, in itself, a valuable control measure. Where a person requested to attend is unable to do so at the specified date time or location, and notifies the Department of this, the appointment will be re-scheduled to a date, time or location that suits him or her better. In relation to providing appointments outside of normal working hours, this is being looked into at present. An on-line appointment system is being developed and this is expected to be in operation in the second half of 2015, which should also facilitate persons in making appointments more suitable to their own circumstances.  There are no plans to introduce measures to assist persons in travelling to registration centres.</p></reply>

It also takes account of the positive experience of the use of JobBridge as part of the pilot Youth Guarantee programme in Ballymun.</p>  <p>  The aim of First Steps is to bring disadvantaged young people closer to the labour market by providing them with a work placement experience, where they gain the opportunity to learn and develop basic work and social skills in organisations in the private, public, voluntary and community sectors.</p>  <p>  It is proposed that, at any one time, 1,500 &ndash; 2,000 people will have access to First Steps.  Letters have been issued to more than 3,500 employers in the private, public, voluntary and community sectors, inviting them to participate as a sponsor in the programme and seeking expressions of interest.  </p>  <p>Subject to responses from employers, it is expected that the first intake to the programme will be in April/May 2015.  Referrals to the scheme can commence subject to the provision of places by sponsoring employers. </p>  <p>  The participation of clients, once referred, will be non-discretionary and legislation provides that penalty rate sanctions will apply to a jobseeker who fails, without good cause, to participate.</p></reply>

There are currently approximately 70,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;298 million for 2015. A breakdown of rent supplement recipients and the maximum rent limits is provided on a county basis in the attached tabular statement. The numbers of persons per county for each rent limit is not available. </p><p>The Department continues to allow for flexibility within the administration of the rent supplement scheme with each tenant&rsquo;s circumstances considered on a case-by-case basis, and rents increased above prescribed limits if deemed appropriate, through the Department&rsquo;s National Tenancy Sustainment Framework, and also the Interim Tenancy Sustainment Service, operated in conjunction with Threshold in Dublin and Cork areas.</p><p>Section 25 of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2007 provided that a payment of rent supplement can be refused in respect of accommodation which is situated in an area notified to the Minister for Social Protection by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, as being an area of regeneration. The lifting of the condition for rent supplement with respect to the Ballymun regeneration area is a matter for my colleague the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government. </p><p>The measures provided for in Section 25 are not a blanket refusal of rent supplement in areas of regeneration. Specific provision is made to ensure that: </p><p>- people already residing in such areas and in receipt of rent supplement may continue to receive payment; and </p><p>- people already residing in such areas in private rental accommodation and who may have recourse to rent supplement in the future would not have their entitlement restricted. </p><p><b>Tabular Statement A: Rent Supplement

Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives. To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension, all contributions paid over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement. </p>  <p>  As provided for in Budget 2012, from September 2012, new rate bands for State pension were introduced.  These additional payment rate bands more accurately reflect the social insurance history of a person and ensure that those who contribute more during a working life benefit more in retirement than those with lesser contributions.</p>  <p>  Those with lower earnings and those with lesser contribution histories continue to obtain the best value for money from the Social Insurance Fund.  Even for those with an average of only 20 contributions per year (i.e. 38% of the maximum), reduced rate State pensions of &euro;196 are now paid, i.e., a higher rate than the full rate in 2007, so that those retiring after September 2012 who are being paid a reduced amount under the new bands are still receiving more, in real terms, than the maximum rate of pension that was payable for pensioners during most of the period of their working life.</p>  <p>  Work has commenced on replacing the current averaging approach with a total contributions approach, where the difficulties raised by the Deputy would not arise.  It is expected that this approach to pension qualification will replace the current average contributions test for State pension (contributory) from 2020, although that date is subject to change, as it is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative and technical challenges to be overcome in its implementation.  It is my intention that changes would be announced well in advance of their introduction, to allow workers factor this into their retirement planning.</p>  <p>  For those with insufficient contributions to meet the requirements for a State pension (contributory), they may qualify for a means tested State pension (non-contributory) which has a maximum personal rate of &euro;219, or just over 95% of the maximum rate of the State pension (contributory).  Alternatively, if a person&rsquo;s spouse or civil partner is in receipt of a State pension (contributory) they may instead qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult of up to &euro;206.30, which is just less than 90% of the maximum personal rate of the State pension (contributory). </p></reply>

This does not prevent the use of two documents under the heading &quot;Photographic ID&quot; for the identification of name, date of birth and address.  A social welfare card by itself may not accepted by itself to prove identity but could be used in combination with other documents to confirm identity.</p><p>Guidelines on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering and terrorist financing are available on my Department's website at . Appendix 2 of these guidelines is a non-exhaustive and non-mandatory list of alternative documents that can be used to verify identity in circumstances where a prospective customer cannot, for justifiable reasons, meet the standard identification and verification requirements, or has experienced difficulties in the past when seeking to open accounts. </p><p>On the issue more generally, it is a matter of good commercial practice that any firm should know its customers.  It is particularly important that a financial institution confirms the identity of their customers because financial institutions often undertake high value transactions on behalf of their customers. In addition, EU directives require that financial institutions ascertain the identities of their customers in order to prevent the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering and terrorist financing. </p><p>If an individual is not happy with the way that a regulated financial institution has treated them, they can make a complaint to the institution.  If they are not happy with the outcome of the complaint made they can refer the matter to the Financial Services Ombudsman (FSO).  Further information on how to make a complaint to the FSO is available at www.financialombudsman.ie. The FSO can investigate, mediate and adjudicate on complaints made about the conduct of regulated financial service providers involving a failure or refusal to provide a service.</p></reply>

Under the current funding model, the objective of the regulations is to raise approximately 50 per cent of the cost of financial regulation directly from the regulated financial service providers. There are some exceptions where credit institutions fund 100 per cent of the cost of their regulation. For example, Irish authorised credit institutions admitted to the ELG Scheme 2009. In addition, credit institutions directly and indirectly supervised by the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) will be required to fund 100 per cent of the budgeted costs of SSM-related activities incurred by the ECB. </p><p>A review of the current funding model is underway. A joint Working Group led by my Department with representatives from the Central Bank has been established to examine the introduction of a funding model that moves from the current partial funding model to a model that covers the full cost of regulation. </p><p>The following table outlines the Net Annual Funding Requirement (nAFR) for regulated financial services entities for 2014.<table><tr><th>Category</th><th>Description</th><th>2014 nAFR (&euro;'000)</th></tr><tr><td>A1a</td><td>Irish authorised Credit Institutions admitted to the ELG Scheme 2009 and their subsidiaries </td><td>13,543</td></tr><tr><td>A4</td><td>Supplementary Levy for Credit Institutions </td><td>21,793</td></tr><tr><td>A1b/A2</td><td>Irish authorised Credit Institutions not in A1a/EEA Branches </td><td>8,022</td></tr><tr><td>B</td><td>Insurance Undertakings </td><td>12,167</td></tr><tr><td>C</td><td>Intermediaries </td><td>2,519</td></tr><tr><td>D/E2</td><td>Securities &amp;amp; Investment Firms and Investment Fund Service Providers </td><td>9,498</td></tr><tr><td>E1</td><td>Investment Funds </td><td>2,974</td></tr><tr><td>F</td><td>Credit Unions</td><td>1,400</td></tr><tr><td>G</td><td>Moneylenders</td><td>293</td></tr><tr><td>H</td><td>Approved Professional Bodies </td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>J</td><td>Bureaux de Change </td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>M</td><td>Retail Credit/Home Reversion Firms </td><td>98</td></tr><tr><td>N</td><td>Payment Institutions &amp;amp; E-Money Institutions </td><td>540</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Total</td><td>72,874</td></tr></table>There are a number of exceptions to the 50% funding model as follows:</p><p>- Credit Institutions: Credit Institutions admitted to the Eligible Liabilities Guarantee Scheme 2009 are required to fund 100 per cent of supervisory costs.  Where appropriate, individual credit institutions are also required to fully fund costs incurred by the Central Bank in carrying out any external review of the institution.</p><p>- Credit Unions: The amount of the levy payable by a credit union is currently capped at 0.01per cent of their total assets as at 30 September in the previous year.  As a result, credit unions currently contribute approximately 8% to the cost of their regulation.</p><p>- Securities Market Supervision Costs: The excess of costs</p><p>- incurred by the Central Bank in performing its responsibilities under the Prospectus, Transparency, Market Abuse, Short Selling, Securities Financing Transaction Regulation Directives together with the European Markets Infrastructure Regulation over</p><p>- Transparency fees and Prospectus Approval and related fees is currently funded by the Central Bank by way of subvention.</p><p>Credit Union Restructuring Board (ReBo)</p><p>- Stabilisation Levy</p><p>Credit unions have to pay a stabilisation levy for the purpose of building up a fund that can be used, in certain circumstances and subject to certain conditions, to assist credit unions that have fallen below their statutory reserve requirement but are otherwise considered viable. 2015 is the first year in which credit unions are required to pay this levy. Hence it did not raise any money in 2014. The stabilisation levy contributions that individual credit unions have to pay is based on a percentage of their total assets.  </p><p>- ReBo Levy</p><p>For the year 2014, a ReBo levy of &euro;1.4 million was provided for by Statutory Instrument. This has been charged to credit unions and &euro;1,354,586 had been collected by late-March of 2015.

The yield from this levy in 2014 was &euro;27.85 million. </p><p>- Levy on general insurance premiums under Section 125 of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999. The yield from this levy in 2014 was &euro;1.97 million.</p><p>- Levy on Health Insurers under Section 125A of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999. Insurers incur the levy. The yield from this levy in 2014 was &euro;581.71 million. </p><p>These insurance levies are payable by the relevant insurers and the legislation does not provide for them to be passed on to the insured persons. Insurers may of course reflect some or all of any levy in the premium they charge to insured persons.</p><p>Furthermore, the Deputy may be aware of the pension fund levy under Section 125B of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999. It is a stamp duty charge that applies to the market value, on the valuation date, of assets under management in pension funds and pension plans approved under Irish tax legislation. The chargeable persons for the levy are the trustees or other persons, including insurance companies, responsible for the management of the assets of the pension schemes or plans. The payment of the levy is treated as a necessary expense of a pension scheme and the trustees or insurer, as appropriate, are entitled where needed to adjust current or prospective benefits payable under a scheme to take account of the levy. In accordance with the provisions in section 125B of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999, the stamp duty levy on pension fund assets will end after 2015. The yield from this levy in 2014 was &euro;743 million.</p></reply>

The Commissioners also inform me that, while no licences were revoked prior to the introduction of the new licensing regime in late 2011, 3 mineral oil traders' licences were revoked in 2013, including 2 in Dublin and 1 in Cork, and 2 mineral oil traders' licences were revoked in 2014, both in Waterford. No licences have been revoked to date in 2015. In addition, Revenue has refused licence applications from mineral oil traders in this period, including 17 applications in 2012, 22 applications in 2013, and 4 licence applications in 2014. To date in 2015, Revenue has refused one licence application.  The distribution of refusals on a county basis is not readily available. </p><p>The number of premises that are currently licensed per county is set out in the schedule below. The Commissioners advise me that the number of licences that relate specifically to filling stations is not readily available. A register of auto fuel and marked fuel traders' licenses is published on the Revenue website and these details are updated monthly. The data can be accessed by the public at the following links to the relevant webpage:</p><p>In relation to fuel deliveries to filling stations in Co Mayo, I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that licensed operators of filling stations are required to submit monthly Returns of Oil Movements (ROM 1) showing the total volume of petrol and diesel delivered to their premises each month. The licensing year for Auto Fuel and Marked Fuel Traders runs from 1st July to 30th June annually.  Accordingly, an analysis of data on oil movements is more accurate if confined to that period rather than based on the calendar year, as licence holders may change at the renewal stage and this would distort the data.</p><p>An analysis of the data on petrol and road diesel movements to filling stations in Mayo extracted from ROM1 returns has been undertaken for the period 1st July 2013 to 30th June 2014 inclusive (the most recent full licensing year for which such data is available).  This analysis reveals that there was an average of 554 inward movements of road diesel per month, amounting to an average delivery of 118,143 litres per month to each filling station.  The average amount delivered was 18,349 litres per delivery, with an average of 6.4 deliveries per filling station per month. The average total volume of petrol delivered to filling stations in Mayo during the period amounted to 5,134,555 litres, giving an average of 65,339 litres of petrol delivered to each filling station per month. As licence holders may aggregate their deliveries of petrol on their returns, showing a total monthly figure per supplier, it is not possible to provide data on the number of petrol deliveries or the average volume per delivery. </p><p><b>Schedule </b><table><tr><th>Current Mineral Oil Traders' Licences by County at 25th March 2015.</th><th></th><th></th></tr><tr><td>County</td><td>Auto Fuel</td><td>Marked Fuel</td></tr><tr><td>Carlow</td><td>39</td><td>22</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan</td><td>80</td><td>65</td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>94</td><td>57</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>267</td><td>132</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>146</td><td>129</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>260</td><td>92</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>166</td><td>135</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>109</td><td>57</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>94</td><td>51</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td>52</td><td>38</td></tr><tr><td>Laois</td><td>57</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim</td><td>28</td><td>23</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>133</td><td>66</td></tr><tr><td>Longford</td><td>34</td><td>33</td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td>88</td><td>57</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td>114</td><td>102</td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td>92</td><td>47</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan</td><td>82</td><td>66</td></tr><tr><td>Offaly</td><td>53</td><td>29</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon</td><td>48</td><td>45</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td>48</td><td>44</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary</td><td>133</td><td>83</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>62</td><td>29</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath</td><td>67</td><td>42</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>116</td><td>79</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>59</td><td>32</td></tr><tr><td>Totals</td><td>2521</td><td>1585</td></tr></table></p></reply>

They undertake, on an ongoing basis, an extensive programme of compliance and enforcement actions to ensure adherence to the legal requirements governing the supply and sale of mineral oil and to allow action to be taken against fraud. Among the key elements of this programme are the carrying out of control and compliance inspections at critical points of the fuel supply chain, including visits to mineral oil traders, to check records and take samples, and the checking and inspection of bulk fuel transportation vehicles (involving, from time to time, the taking of fuel samples from such vehicles).</p>  <p>  The focus of Revenue's control and compliance actions at a particular point depends on the nature of the issue being addressed. In the case of reported problems with petrol quality, and the suggestions that these problems are attributable to petrol stretching, the priority has been to check out petrol stations about which a complaint was received. I am advised that the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that this represents the best use of the investigative resources available to them in addressing this particular matter.</p>  <p>  The Revenue Commissioners advise me that their activities to combat petrol and fuel fraud are based on risk evaluation and intelligence, and that fuel samples are taken mainly from where fuel is stored, at both wholesale and retail levels. The taking of samples from bulk fuel transportation vehicles is  carried out essentially as a backup to other compliance and enforcement activities.</p>  <p>  As I indicated in my reply to the Deputy's Question No. 191 of 10 March 2015, all complaints received have been investigated and samples of petrol have been taken from the petrol stations concerned. Some 345 samples, from stations and other sources, have been referred to the State Laboratory.</p>  <p>  The scientific analysis required is complex and time-consuming and the State Laboratory has conducted an extensive series of test and re-tests on the samples. Despite this, evidence of the presence of prohibited stretching agents has been found in only two samples, both from one location. The conclusive results received from those tests have resulted in the seizure of the product, and files are being prepared with a view to prosecution.</p>  <p>  Following a series of further tests conducted by the State Laboratory, results were received which indicate the presence of traces of road diesel in several samples take from a variety of locations. This could indicate that petrol was contaminated with road diesel at some point in time. If the problems that came to light were caused by unintended contamination as a result of diesel being inadvertently mixed with petrol at some point along the supply chain, there would be no Revenue offence involved. However, the Revenue Commissioners are investigating vigorously the possibility of tax fraud being associated with the identified problems.

The assets of the National Pensions Reserve Fund (NPRF) were transferred into the ISIF on its establishment. The National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) is responsible for management of the ISIF and the Investment Committee of the NTMA is responsible for making decisions about the acquisition and disposal of assets of the ISIF. </p>  <p>  The NTMA is required to report each year on a number of matters including an assessment on a regional basis of the distribution of investments made by the Fund. While it is standard practice that companies report financial information to their investors, the ISIF mandate will also require metrics that can be used to help assess economic impact.  Reporting on economic impact therefore requires a completely new data set to be obtained from funds and projects in which ISIF has invested and from underlying companies in which such funds have invested and a data gathering exercise is currently ongoing. The first ISIF economic impact report, which will include an analysis of the regional distribution of investments, is expected to be published in Quarter 2 2015. </p></reply>

I have not recently met with Prime Minister David Cameron. The corporate tax rate in Northern Ireland is a matter for the UK Government and Stormont Executive.</p>  <p>  Ireland is fully supportive of fair tax competition and of any measures which would bring positive economic benefits to the Island of Ireland as a whole. The 12.5% rate is a pillar of the Irish taxation system but it is important to remember that attracting foreign direct investment and stimulating growth is about much more than just having a competitive tax rate. As I have stated previously, the Irish system is built upon the 3 Rs and while rate is a key feature, the other two Rs - regime and reputation are equally important in forming a competitive taxation landscape.</p>  <p>  The OECD has stated that a competitive but stable corporate tax rate as well as a broad base has been shown as the best way to foster economic growth. Reform of the corporate tax rate in Northern Ireland has the potential to bring many benefits to both parts of the Island.</p></reply>

With effect from 1<sup>st</sup>January 2012, the administration of RCT moved from being a manual system to an electronic one (the eRCT system).</p><p>As the Deputy's Question was directed in the first instance to Minister Bruton, I think it useful to point out that, while the eRCT system facilitates the deduction of income tax at source from payments made under contracts in the construction, forestry and meat processing sectors, it is not intended to, nor does it, underpin, or relate to, matters such as employment rights (including rates of pay), the (former) Relevant Employment Agreements (REAs), pensions or PRSI entitlements.</p><p>The eRCT system, being a tax deduction system, is under the care and management of the Revenue Commissioners.  As the Deputy may be aware, under Section 101 of the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act 2011, the Revenue Commissioners are independent in the performance of their functions under, or for the purposes of, a relevant Act such as the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  </p><p>The Deputy's Question does not set out the detail or extent of the alleged wide-spread abuse. However I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the allegations probably relate to what is known as 'bogus self-employment' in the construction sector, that is, erroneously describing an employee as a self-employed contractor.</p><p>There are safeguards, which have been designed into the eRCT system, for those individuals who may have concerns that they are caught up in &quot;bogus self-employment&quot;.  Firstly, a principal contractor has a statutory obligation to notify Revenue through the eRCT system of details of all contracts entered into with a sub-contractor and secondly, on receipt of these contract details, Revenue issues a &quot;Contract Confirmation&quot; letter directly to the individual who is described by the principal as being the sub-contractor.  On receipt of the &quot;Contract Confirmation&quot; letter, a sub-contractor is obliged to notify the Revenue Commissioners if they believe that they are not a sub-contractor but are more correctly an employee and Revenue will take the necessary steps to investigate the matter. </p><p>The construction sector is an acknowledged area of high risk internationally and in Ireland it is no different.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the monitoring of abuses of the tax and duty systems in the construction sector forms part of Revenue's ongoing compliance programmes into which they commit significant resources.  I am further informed by the Revenue Commissioners that there were over 14,000 tax compliance Risk Interventions in the Construction Sector in 2013 and over 15,000 such interventions in 2014.  In addition, the Revenue Commissioners work closely with the Department of Social Protection and the National Employment Rights Agency including conducting joint operations in the construction sector with both bodies. </p><p>As to allegations of abuse of the tax system, I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that if the Deputy has specific information relating to individuals or business groups in the constructor sector who are abusing the tax system, he may pass that information directly to the Revenue Commissioners for investigation.  I am also informed that the Revenue Commissioners have provided a specific template on their website at which facilitates anyone who wishes to report instances of shadow economy practices.</p></reply>

While this may be the case, the Irish tax and social welfare system is the most effective at reducing income inequality, of the OECD member countries.</p>  <p>  The redistributional impact of the Irish tax and social welfare system is the largest in the OECD and leaves Ireland's level of inequality at around the OECD average. Consequently it is unfair to characterise Ireland as unequal, when compared to its peers. Nor is it true to say that the gap is widening over time. Despite the significant economic decline that has occurred over the past 7 years, the level of disposable income inequality in Ireland has been stable over the period. This has been achieved in part because of the Government's commitment to making everyone in society pay their fair share.  For example, the changes introduced in Budget 2015 will ensure that the top 1% of tax units (by income) will pay 20% of all income tax and USC collected in 2015, up from 19%. In contrast, the bottom 76% of income earners will pay only 21% of all income tax and USC collected.</p>  <p>  As I have pointed out many times before, it was never intended that the USC would be a temporary measure. It was designed and incorporated in to the Irish taxation system as part of its permanent structure and the revenues collected play a vital part in meeting the many expenditure demands placed on the Exchequer. In addition, it is difficult for higher earners to shelter income from the charge to USC through the use of various income tax reliefs and incentives. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the above, since coming into government, I have made several significant changes to the USC which has increased its fairness. As a result of a Review of USC by my Department, the Government decided in Budget 2012 to increase the entry point to the Universal Social Charge from &euro;4,004 to &euro;10,036 per annum. It is estimated that this removed almost 330,000 individuals from the charge.  In Budget 2015, I further extended this exemption threshold to &euro;12,012 to apply from 1 January 2015 onwards. This exempted a further 87,000 individuals from the charge. This means that 28% of all income earners are not paying any Universal Social Charge at all. Furthermore, I also reduced the two lower rates at which USC is charged and extended the threshold before the 7% rate becomes chargeable. These measures, together with the introduction of a new 8% rate on income over &euro;70,044, as well as a rate increase from 10% to 11% on self-assessed income over &euro;100,000, has further enhanced the existing progressive nature of the USC.</p>  <p>  As a result of the changes to income tax and USC in Budget 2015, all those who currently pay income tax and/or USC have seen a reduction in their tax bill this year compared to 2014, where incomes are equal. The Government has committed to continue to reform the tax system in this manner in the coming years, contingent on having the fiscal space to do so.</p></reply>

Submissions advocating reform were received in the main from representative bodies, from some tax practitioners as well as from Revenue. Following Government approval for the drafting of the Finance (Tax Appeals Commission) Bill, the draft Heads of Bill were sent to the Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform in December 2014 for pre-legislative scrutiny. As part of this pre-legislative scrutiny, the Committee, of which the Deputy is a member, on 27 January 2015 heard from officials from my Department and from the Office of the Revenue Commissioners and also from representatives of the Consultancy Committee of Accountancy Bodies Ireland, the Irish Tax Institute and William Fry-Tax Ireland. In a subsequent session on 25 February 2015, the Committee heard from Mr. O'Callaghan, one of the Appeal Commissioners. My Department and Revenue have since provided the Committee with further briefing material. Both sessions produced a wide-ranging and interesting discussion and highlighted some important policy considerations for my Department. I look forward to receiving the Committee's report in due course.</p><p>Pending the receipt of the Committee's report, the Office of the Attorney-General has been proceeding with the drafting of the Finance (Tax Appeals Commission) Bill and this work is at an advanced stage. I am conscious that reform of the tax appeals system has been advocated by the various stakeholders for a long number of years and, now that it is finally underway, I am anxious to proceed with the publication of the Bill as quickly as possible and, following publication, to have it debated by the Oireachtas.</p><p>Revenue has provided information in relation to the number of cases that are currently under appeal with them and an explanation for the source of this information. When an appeal is received from a taxpayer who has an actual outstanding tax liability showing on Revenue's main IT system, it is necessary to suspend the collection and enforcement process pending the finalisation of the appeal. This suspension of collection is indicated by the presence of an appeal marker (called a 'stop 16') that is input to the IT system by the Revenue officer responsible for the particular case.  Revenue has an automated reporting system that it uses to identify current 'live' appeals and that operates by extracting all of the cases containing an appeal stop 16 from its main IT system. For this reason, the information that can be obtained is captured at a particular point in time and is not retrospective or cumulative. It is constantly changing, according as appeals are decided either by determination by the Appeal Commissioners or the Courts or by agreement with Revenue, and as new appeals are received.</p><p>The numbers given below relate to 27 March 2015. There are currently no 'live' appeals relating to the years 1995, 1997, 1998, 2000 and 2003.</p><p>Number of taxpayers at 27 March 2015 -</p><p>- who have appealed to Revenue,</p><p>- whose appeals have not yet been referred to the Appeal Commissioners to arrange a hearing, and</p><p>-  who appear on Revenue's IT system as having an outstanding tax liability in relation to which collection has been suspended.<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Taxpayers*</th></tr><tr><td>1996</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>1999</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>2001</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>2002</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>2004</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>2005</td><td>77</td></tr><tr><td>2006</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><td>2007</td><td>21</td></tr><tr><td>2008</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>300</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>236</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>84</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>104</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>161</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>358</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>157</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>1528</td></tr></table><b>*</b>Figures are provided in relation to the number of individual taxpayer appellants. However, it should be noted that a single taxpayer may have more than one 'live' appeal. For example, a person may have multiple appeals involving the same issue for several two-monthly VAT periods, but these appeals would effectively be treated as a single appeal. It is felt that in general the number of taxpayers is a more representative and meaningful figure than the number of appeals.</p><p>In general, the reason for the delay in progressing the older appeals is that these appeals are being held at the Revenue stage of the appeal process until such time as a test case involving the same disputed issue is determined by the Appeal Commissioners or by the Courts. </p><p>Revenue estimates that there are currently about 800 other 'live' appeals that are not captured on its main IT system because there is no outstanding tax liability and thus no need to suspend collection and enforcement action. For example, there are taxpayers who have appealed against Revenue's refusal to allow a repayment, against a Revenue determination that a transaction is a tax avoidance transaction or against a Revenue decision about a taxpayer's country of residence for tax purposes. Revenue is carrying out an exercise to get the latest information in relation to these cases and expects to have this exercise completed by early April.</p><p>I have been informed by Revenue that appeals are managed on a case by case basis in individual Revenue tax districts. It has not been the practice to date to keep centralised records in relation to the average time taken for an appeal to either be settled by agreement with the taxpayer (without referral to the Appeal Commissioners) or to be referred to the Appeal Commissioners to arrange a hearing. </p><p>Revenue's view is that there is no standard or average time during which it would be expected that an appeal might be processed. The primary focus of Revenue officers is to try to settle appeals by agreement with taxpayers and a substantial majority of appeals settled in this way without ever reaching the stage of a formal appeal hearing by the Appeal Commissioners. The length of time it takes to reach such agreement (or, indeed, to decide that agreement is not possible) varies widely depending on such factors as the nature or the complexity of the matter being appealed and the difficulty in obtaining the appropriate information to establish the correct tax liability. For example-</p><p>-  an appeal about the quantification of the profits earned by a taxpayer who did not keep proper books and records may involve an extended period of negotiation; </p><p>-  a disagreement about the interpretation of a point of tax law may be referred to the Appeal Commissioners within a relatively short period of time; </p><p>-  a number of appellants participating in a disputed tax avoidance scheme may be held at the Revenue stage of the appeal process to await the outcome of a test case appeal before the Appeal Commissioners (and possibly the Courts) before deciding whether to proceed with their own individual appeals.</p><p>As the Deputy is probably aware, my intention is that appeals under the reformed system will be made directly to the Appeal Commissioners and not via Revenue as currently happens. Decisions about whether it is appropriate to have a formal appeal hearing to determine a disputed issue and the timing of such hearings will be made by the Appeal Commissioners. The reason for this measure is to ensure that the Appeal Commissioners act independently of Revenue in the performance of their duties and that they are seen to be independent. Under the reformed system, Revenue will still be able to settle appeals by agreement with taxpayers but the key difference is that this process, and the timeframe within which it happens, will ultimately be managed and controlled by the Appeal Commissioners and not by Revenue.</p></reply>

I have no statutory role in relation to regulated financial institutions passing on the European Central Bank interest rate change or to the mortgage interest rates charged.  It is a commercial matter for each institution concerned.  It is not appropriate for me, as Minister for Finance, to comment on or become involved in the detailed mortgage position of mortgage holders.</p><p>The Central Bank has responsibility for the regulation and supervision of financial institutions in terms of consumer protection and prudential requirements and for ensuring ongoing compliance with applicable statutory obligations. The Central Bank has no statutory role in the setting of interest rates by financial institutions, apart from the interest rate cap imposed on the credit union sector in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Union Act, 1997 and the requirement to be notified of penalty or surcharge interest imposed in respect of arrears. </p><p>As I stated in previous Parliamentary Questions, a previous Deputy Governor indicated that, within its existing powers and through the use of persuasion, the Central Bank would continue to engage with specific lenders which appear to have standard variable rates set disproportionate to their cost of funds and this is a course of action I expect the Central Bank to continually appraise.</p><p>The Deputy should be aware that the Governor of the Central Bank, Patrick Honohan, in his opening statement to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform last November stated that, as in most advanced economies, including Ireland, it has long been understood that tight administrative control over the rates charged by banks would be counterproductive in ensuring a sufficient flow of properly priced credit on a lasting basis. Such control would strongly discourage new entrants. In this regard, ongoing competition in the banking sector will be crucial in ensuring that the economy is provided with efficient and cost effective banking services. In this regard, there has been some movements on mortgage interest rates of late by a number of institutions which suggest that the market may well be entering a new and more competitive phase.</p><p>The mortgage interest rates that financial institutions operating in Ireland charge to customers are determined as a result of a commercial decision by the institutions concerned. This interest rate is determined taking into account a broad range of factors including European Central Bank base rates, deposit rates, market funding costs, the competitive environment and an institution's overall funding.  However, as part of the Central Bank's work on mortgage arrears, lenders were asked to consider all avenues to help customers in arrears, including interest rate reductions. </p><p>The Central Bank of Ireland has introduced a quarterly series on new mortgage loan drawdowns. This new series contains data for interest rates on new loan drawdowns as of December 2014 (i.e. renegotiations are not included) and notes a standard variable rate of 4.2% which is close to the SVR rates quoted by the main banks.  Further details of the quarterly series is available on the Central Bank's website  .</p></reply>

There is also provision for subsequent appeal to the independent Valuation Tribunal and to the High Court on a point of law. I understand that appeals have been lodged on revalued wind farms in Limerick. The outcome of these appeals has a bearing on the what the ultimate impact of rates has on these and other wind farms and the independent process of valuation and appeal has to be allowed to take its course. I understand that the initial appeal to the Commissioner will be completed in the near future. </p>  <p>  The result of the appeal or appeals, and I do not know if there will be any change or not, has to be considered before any conclusion can be drawn  as to whether  legislative change might or might not be an appropriate response to the concerns of wind farm operators.</p>  <p>  The Energy Sector is the responsibility of the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources who is also aware of this issue.      </p></reply>

This competition was launched in order to create panels of qualified individuals from which departments and public service bodies may draw when filling sanctioned vacancies.</p>  <p>  The first stage of the selection process comprised tests and assessments to which candidates were invited to complete online.  Those who reached the qualifying standard were ranked for each of their selected regions. </p>  <p>  Candidates who had chosen regions for which vacancies have been notified to PAS and who were placed highest at the first stage are then called to supervised testing. Based on the results of these supervised tests, candidates who reach the qualifying standard and who are placed highest are invited to interview.  Depending on the outcome of this interview and their position on the order of merit candidates may be considered for appointment to a vacancy. </p>  <p>  To date clerical panels have been created for Dublin and Limerick/ Tipperary.

The Commissioner indicated that there is, nonetheless, a rationale to investment protection.  By lowering the risks of expropriation or discrimination, it gives investors reassurance and therefore encourages them to invest, meaning more growth and jobs.     The Commissioner emphasized that the EU wants to reform the investment agreements used in the past, and that the TTIP is a key step in that process.  The features of a new investment arbitration system that the Commissioner is currently considering include fully independent arbitrators, a proper appeal system, clear rules to prevent companies from trying to get around domestic legal systems, and an unambiguous statement that governments have the right to make policy in the public interest. </p>  <p>  The ideas set out by the Commissioner seem reasonable.  The Commission has not yet made any formal proposals, but I am open to considering proposals that can achieve a reasonable and workable arbitration system that address the shortcomings identified in existing Agreements and which have given rise to concern.  </p></reply>

The trade union is seeking to engage with the company on these issues and the matter was referred by the union to the Labour Court under section 20(1) of the Industrial Relations Act, 1969 in October of last year.</p>  <p>  The company was not represented at the Labour Court hearing. In this regard, the Court found it regrettable that the company declined to participate in the investigation of the dispute or to put forward its position on the union's claims.</p>  <p>  In its recommendation of 14th November 2014, the Court reaffirmed earlier recommendations it had made by noting that the Company and the union were parties to a collective agreement signed in 1996 which provides a procedural framework within which industrial relations disputes and differences arising between the parties can be resolved by negotiation and dialogue. The Court pointed out that the dictates of good industrial relations practice requires parties to honour their collective agreements in both spirit and intent. </p>  <p>  I am disappointed that the company decided against attending the Labour Court hearing, contrary to good industrial relations practice in that regard. In my view, the experience and expertise of the Labour Court offers the most appropriate and effective avenue for resolving such issues. </p>  <p>  I would urge both parties to avail of the services of the State&rsquo;s industrial Relations machinery who remain available to assist the parties, if requested. It is my opinion that engagement with the State's industrial relations machinery offers the best way whereby the parties involved in this dispute can hope to resolve their differences.</p>  <p>  Neither the Labour Court, nor I, can compel a company to comply with such recommendations. Ultimately, responsibility for the settlement of a trade dispute rests with the parties to the dispute.  However, I would like to see an early and fair settlement to this dispute.  </p>  <p>  As regards representation rights, Cabinet approval was obtained at the end of 2014 to legislate for an improved framework for workers who are in dispute with their employer regarding their terms and conditions in situations where there are no arrangements with their employer to resolve the matters through collective bargaining. </p>  <p>  This legislation will mark the fulfilment of one of the most significant commitments in the Programme for Government which indicated that reform in this area was needed. In developing these proposals Minister Bruton and I have been keen to respect the positions articulated by stakeholders to develop proposals that sustain our voluntary system, but also ensure that workers have confidence that, where there is no collective bargaining, they have an effective system that ensures they can air grievances about remuneration, terms and conditions and have these determined based on those in similar companies and not be victimised for doing so.</p>  <p>  I expect this legislation to be published during this D&aacute;il session and enacted as expediently as is possible thereafter.</p>  <p>  As regards workers being on part-time or flexible contracts, in accordance with the Statement of Government priorities, I recently commissioned the University of Limerick (UL) to carry out a detailed study into the prevalence of zero hour and low hour contracts and the impact of such contracts on employees. While such contracts can provide flexibility to the benefit of both employees and employers in some situations, without pre-empting the outcomes of the report, if there is a need to legislate to address issues raised, we will do so.  </p>  <p>  The study will have a broad scope, covering both the public and private sectors, with a particular focus on the retail, hospitality, education and health sectors. The study will examine how zero and low hour contracts operate in practice and how they impact on employees. It will assess the advantages and disadvantages from the perspective of employer and employee and assess the current employment rights legislation as it applies to employees on such contracts. The study will also consider recent developments in other jurisdictions, including the UK in particular.  The study may also identify how the information gap might be addressed in the future.  </p>  <p>  A wide range of stakeholders are being canvassed to contribute, and I expect the study, which commenced recently, to be completed within months.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that I cannot anticipate the outcome of the study or the Government&rsquo;s consideration of the study&rsquo;s findings.</p></reply>

Right to regulate: The Commission has floated two ideas to address this: a full possible article in the text of any Agreement that would make clear that governments are free to pursue public policy objectives and they can choose the level of protection that they deem appropriate, and a clause providing that says that investment protection rules offer no guarantee for investors that the legal regime under which they have invested will stay the same.</p>  <p>  2. Improving the way the tribunals work: To address concerns that the system creates conflicts of interest because arbitrators are also lawyers and might expect to get business from the investors in future, the Commission's idea is for governments, long before any actual cases are launched, to nominate a limited list of arbitrators who would decide on all TTIP investment cases.  To get onto the list, the arbitrators would have to be sufficiently qualified.  For example, they would have to be eligible to be judges in their home systems.  There have been some calls for creating a permanent investment court, with permanent judges, and the Commissioner supports the idea, but considers this a more long-term project that would be best undertaken as a multilateral project, not just a TTIP project.</p>  <p>  3. Appeals mechanism: The idea is to include an appeals body, with permanent members, within TTIP.  The Commissioner believes that this would ensure consistency of interpretation and review of decisions.  The Commission will, in parallel, also be proposing an appeals mechanism to other negotiating partners, with the aim of achieving a multilateral appeal mechanism.</p>  <p>  4. Relationship between domestic legal systems and ISDS: In order to address the perception that ISDS gives investors a second chance to overrule the decisions of national courts, the Commissioner is considering two possible options: Require claimants to choose between national courts and ISDS from the outset, so they would not be allowed to use ISDS once a case had begun in national courts; or, to avoid the risk that this might encourage claimants to avoid national courts altogether, provide that they would have to abandon any proceedings they have started in national courts if they launch an ISDS case.  Recourse to ISDS would not be possible if the claimant decided to exhaust local remedies.</p>  <p>  The ideas set out by the Commissioner seem worthy of further exploration.  The Commission has not yet made any formal proposals, but I am open to considering proposals that can achieve a reasonable and workable arbitration system that addresses the shortcomings already identified in historic models of ISDS and that have given rise to concerns.   </p></reply>

Priority under the National Reserve is given to &lsquo;young farmers&rsquo; and to &lsquo;new entrants to farming&rsquo;.

This is done to afford the farmer sufficient flexibility to arrange the test in a way that best suits his or her farming enterprise.  </p>  <p>  The test notification letter also advises the farmer to avoid giving routine treatments in advance of the test.  The reason for this is (i) to avoid the risk of inadvertently interfering with the test result and (ii) to avoid treated animals having to be retained on farms to comply with the post-treatment withdrawal period.  This approach is in line with the key objectives of the Scheme, which are to have reactors removed from the farm as quickly as possible to minimise the restriction period and minimise risk of in-herd spread of the disease.   </p>  <p>  However, it should be stressed that a number of mechanisms are built into the arrangements to facilitate farmers in treating their animals.  First, farmers are permitted to carry out urgent treatments, including for animal welfare related reasons, and this is made clear in the test notification letter.  In addition, provision is made for farmers to bring forward the test date in order to facilitate their routine treatment schedules.  Provision is made to address circumstances where a farmer finds it necessary to postpone a test because of particular circumstances. </p>  <p>  In summary, I believe that it is necessary to have arrangements in place to deal with the medication of animals in a manner which is consistent with the objectives of the TB Scheme and that there are sufficient flexibilities built into the system to ensure that there are no animal welfare implications arising from these requirements. </p></reply>

Research conducted over the years by the Department and others has demonstrated that the eradication of bovine TB disease is not a practicable proposition until the issue of the reservoir of infection in badgers, which is seeding infection into the cattle population, is addressed.  It is therefore necessary to eradicate TB in both species.  In view of this, the comprehensive TB Eradication Programme as implemented by my Department has incorporated a badger removal policy since 2004.  I should emphasise that badgers are only removed in areas where an epidemiological investigation carried out by my Department&rsquo;s Veterinary Inspectorate has found that badgers are the likely source of infection.  </p>  <p>  While the culling of badgers is cost effective and has contributed significantly to the very significant improvement in the disease situation in recent years, badger culling alone will not enable my Department to achieve its ultimate objective of eradicating TB in cattle.  Accordingly, my Department intends to incorporate badger vaccination into the eradication programme when data are available to ensure that it can be incorporated in an optimally effective and sustainable manner.  A number of field trials are ongoing in Ireland with this objective in mind.  Some 1,575 badgers have been vaccinated to date.  It is estimated that it costs approximately &euro;21 to microchip and vaccinate each badger.  In addition, there are extra costs for manpower used in the programme, but these are difficult to quantify in view of the fact that the staff involved are also engaged in other official duties.  It will be a number of years before a viable oral delivery method can be put in place and, therefore, targeted badger removals will continue in the medium term. </p></reply>

The payments audited covered the period from 2008 to 2012 during which over &euro;9 billion was paid to farmers in Ireland under the Direct Payment Schemes.  I have always been opposed to the imposition of flat rate penalties and particularly so in this case.  I have strongly refuted the application of this proposed correction as disproportionate to the true level of risk involved and on this basis my Department sought a hearing with the Conciliation Body.  </p>  <p>  Officials from my Department met with the Conciliation Body on 10 December 2014.  At the Conciliation Hearing, my Department outlined Ireland&rsquo;s fundamental objection to the flat rate correction and argued that the risk to the Fund should be a calculated amount.   My officials informed the Body regarding the amount of work undertaken by my Department to identify and remove all ineligible features from the LPIS database, the technical improvement in the LPIS system and the time and resources used by my Department to address all issues raised by the Commission.   </p>  <p>  The Conciliation Body acknowledged the amount of work done by my Department over such a short period of time and expressed the opinion that the issues with the Commission hinged on only a few, though important, elements of this work. </p>  <p>  The Conciliation Body report concluded that conciliation seemed within reach and that the two parties should continue discussing the matter with a view to an agreed settlement.  On foot of this my Department has maintained contact with the Commission with a view to bringing the matter to a conclusion and further work has recently been carried out to quantify the level of risk to EU funds and this information is with the Commission.  To date, approximately &euro;4 million has been collected from those applicants who included ineligible areas and features in their declarations. </p></reply>

In addition, 1,679 cases are in the process of either ground verification visits or administrative validation.  To date, 433 cases have been referred to the LPIS Appeals Committee for consideration.    </p>  <p>  My Department is bound, under EU Regulations, to maintain the accuracy of the Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS) which underpins the direct payments.  At the start of each year, my Department issues colour maps of all land parcels declared by farmers in the previous year together with a covering letter.  In that letter, farmers are informed of the need to carefully examine each map carefully and to identify and exclude from their application all unfarmed land, ineligible features such as buildings, farmyards, scrub, roadways, forests, lakes etc. included in the land parcels.  There is, therefore, an onus on all farmers to ensure that the area of land declared by them as eligible for payment under the Direct Payment Schemes is accurate.  They are also given the means to do so by making the ortho-photos available to them on an annual basis.  These requirements are also made clear in the Terms and Conditions of the Schemes, which accompanies the pre-printed application form issued to all farmers. </p>  <p>  In the letters which issue where ineligible areas have been identified, considerable detail regarding the issues and maps to advise of the particular over-claims, are provided, in addition to which farmers are also informed of the appeals process, should they disagree with my Department&rsquo;s findings.  The appeals process I have introduced is both robust and comprehensive; in the first instance, applicants are entitled to have their case reviewed by submitting their appeal on the form provided by my Department.  If they are not satisfied with the outcome of the review, they can appeal their case to the independently-chaired Land Eligibility Appeals Committee. </p></reply>

Under these regulations each Member State is allocated a volume quota of milk, above which a super levy (of 28.6 cents/litre) has to be paid to the EU Commission by producers who contribute to the over production.  It is not possible for me on a unilateral basis to adjust these super levy rules.  </p>  <p>  I have, on numerous occasions, proposed action at EU level to mitigate the impact of the super levy, primarily via utilisation of an adjustment to the butterfat coefficient, as this would not have required an amendment to existing regulations.  Other options previously discussed included the front-loading of the remaining quota increases, a reduction in the super levy, or a type of EU flexi-milk arrangement which would have operated providing overall EU production was within quota.  However, given the opposition of a blocking minority of Member States, some of which have gone so far as to seek to link the issue to possible measures to regulate supply after quotas are gone, there is no realistic prospect of any movement on the super-levy. </p>  <p>  With respect to the impending super levy, there are a number of initiatives which I as Minister have taken to help ensure that the Irish dairy sector enters the post quota era as smoothly as possible.  Flexibility has been secured from the European Commission for farmers to pay the superlevy fine on a phased basis over 3 years and my Department is working on the details of a scheme to give effect to this flexibility at national level.  This announcement will serve as a major boost to dairy farmers in helping to ease the cashflow burden of paying the superlevy bill. </p>  <p>  On-going contact has been maintained with the Minister for Finance to ensure that existing and future taxation policy reflects the Government&rsquo;s commitment to agriculture.  Of interest to dairy farmers here will be the announcement in last October&rsquo;s budget to provide for income averaging over five years when it comes to paying income tax bills.  I have also ensured that priority has been given to measures for the dairy sector in the Rural Development Programme.  In addition, in regular meetings with the Irish banks I have impressed upon them the need to show flexibility in their dealings with farmers experiencing temporary cash flow difficulties in 2015.   </p>  <p>  Furthermore Teagasc, in late January and early February, held a series of very well attended dairy seminars throughout the country to help dairy farmers to manage their dairy enterprises through 2015, while also planning the efficient development of their dairy business in a non-quota environment.  This complemented the Cash Plan Programme, supported by my Department in 2014, which was aimed at encouraging recent entrants to dairying to engage in a programme to improve farm planning, cash flow management and to minimise the cost of producing a litre of milk by managing the factors that influence this cost.   </p>  <p>  The abolition of milk quota presents a massive opportunity for the Irish dairy sector and one which we should look forward to with confidence.  However, it is important that dairy farmers plan prudently for this new era.  I believe we have the right balance of measures in place to ensure that Irish dairy farmers can enter the new era with full confidence. </p></reply>

It also provides scope to include an optional provision whereby Member States may use the National Reserve to allocate new entitlements or give a top-up on the value of existing entitlements for persons who suffer from a &lsquo;Specific Disadvantage&rsquo;.  With regard to the group of young farmers who established their holding in 2008 and 2009, but who missed out on both the Young Farmer Installation Scheme which closed to applications in 2008 and the Young Farmer priority category under the National Reserve which includes young farmers who commenced since 2010, I am glad to say that this category can be considered as a &lsquo;group suffering from specific disadvantage&rsquo;. </p>  <p>  The positive result of this development is that these young farmers will be eligible to apply under the 2nd phase of the National Reserve to be given new entitlements or be given a top-up on the value of existing entitlements.</p>  <p>   Applications will be made available in early April 2015.  This is a very welcome outcome that I feel will address an anomaly in the system and allow for fair and equal treatment for this particular category of young active farmers.</p></reply>

The categories listed below account for 88,290 farmers, out of an approximate 130,000 Irish farmers who will be eligible to participate under the 2015 Basic Payment Scheme.<table><tr><th><b>National Summary</b></th><th><b>Number of Farmers</b></th></tr><tr><td>Less than 10K in 2014 &amp;amp; Greater than 10K 2019 </td><td>3038 </td></tr><tr><td>Less than 10K in 2014 and less than 10K in 2019 </td><td>78,887 </td></tr><tr><td>Greater than 10k in 2014 &amp;amp; Less than 10k in 2019 </td><td>2534 </td></tr><tr><td>Between 10 and 20k in 2014 and Less than 10k in 2019 </td><td>2527 </td></tr><tr><td>Between 10 and 20k in 2014 and Greater than 20k in 2019 </td><td>546 </td></tr><tr><td>Greater than 50k in 2014 &amp;amp; Less than 50k in 2019 </td><td>676 </td></tr><tr><td>Greater than 50k in 2014 &amp;amp; Greater than 50k in 2019 </td><td>82 </td></tr></table>For the purposes of comparison, the estimate of 2019 payments is based on the entitlements held by a farmer under the Basic Payment Scheme plus the payment the farmer will receive under Greening. In some cases farmers who fall within the specified categories will also be eligible for an additional payment under the Young Farmers Scheme and/or for a further allocation of entitlements or increase in value of entitlements from the National Reserve. It is not possible to include such additional payments in the presentation of this data although such payments or allocations would significantly increase the 2015 payment received by such farmers. </p><p>The processing of any outstanding applications for the 2014 or earlier scheme years for individual farmers included in any one of the above categories may alter their values and result in minor changes to the above data. </p><p>Given the complexity of the changes, the information requested by the Deputy took some time to compile. In addition, a number of changes will take place in the system of direct payments between the 2014 scheme year and the 2019 scheme year which are reflected in this data. The national direct payment ceiling available to Ireland reduces from &euro;1,216,547,000 in 2014 to &euro;1,211,066,000 by 2019, a reduction of &euro;5,481,000. In addition, for the purposes of calculating the value of new entitlements under the Basic Payment Scheme, payments received under the Grassland Sheep Scheme in 2014 are incorporated into the value of entitlements held by those farmers who participated in that Scheme. This data also reflects the introduction of an estimated 6,000 new farmers into the system of direct payments through the implementation of the Scottish Derogation.</p></reply>

In relation to Spurdog, the EU Total Allowable Catch (TAC) is set at zero and the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas (ICES) has advised that the stock is depleted. Spurdog spawning biomass is currently at the lowest observed level, although stable in recent years. Spurdog is a long-lived, slow growing, and late maturing species and therefore is particularly vulnerable to fishing mortality. ICES advice is that there should be no target fishery and that by-catch in mixed fisheries should be minimised. It recommends that by-catches should be managed as part of a rebuilding plan, including close monitoring of the stock and fishery.    The Marine Institute supports ICES advice and further notes that spatial avoidance measures should be put in place as part of a rebuilding plan to avoid large accidental catches. The Marine Institute advise that, considering the low stock size over the last two decades and the very low productivity of the stock, it is not possible to identify any non zero catch that would be compatible with the Maximum Sustainable Yield approach. On this basis, the EU Commission&rsquo;s proposal for a zero TAC for 2015 was accepted by the EU Council.</p>  <p>&ldquo;Re- classification&rdquo; as suggested by the Deputy would not change the reality of the depleted sate of this stock.   </p>  <p>In relation to lesser Spotted Dogfish, this stock is not subject to a TAC and quota regime. It is mainly a bait fishery and was not permitted under technical measures introduced in 2009 to protect the cod and whiting stocks in Area VIa (off the Donegal coast). Trials by BIM, supported by the Marine Institute on the impact of a fishery targeting lesser spotted dogfish on cod, haddock and whiting was prepared and it allowed Ireland to successfully make the case for an amendment to the EU Regulations to allow for this fishery. This derogation was introduced in Regulation (EU) No. 227/2013 of 13 March 2013. The Regulation, inter alia, provided for arrangements to allow for a lesser spotted dog fishery off the north Donegal coast. The fishery is subject to a number of technical measures including a restriction on the area, length of gill net that may be deployed, maximum period of soak time, restrictions on by-catches. In order to participate in this lesser spotted dogfish fishery, vessels over 10m, must be authorised in the Days at Sea Scheme to fish with Gill Nets in area VIa.   </p></reply>

Priority under the National Reserve is given to &lsquo;young farmers&rsquo; and to &lsquo;new entrants to farming&rsquo;. The Regulations governing the operation of the National Reserve also include an optional provision whereby Member States may use the National Reserve to allocate new entitlements or give a top-up on the value of existing entitlements for persons who suffer from a &lsquo;Specific Disadvantage&rsquo;.  Following my Department&rsquo;s consultation with the EU Commission, I recently announced that the group commonly known as &ldquo;Old Young Farmers&rdquo;, who established their holding between 1 January 2008 and 31 December 2009, and who, due to the timeframe of setting up their holding, did not benefit from either the Installation Aid or the Young farmer category of the National Reserve, can be considered as a &lsquo;group suffering from specific disadvantage&rsquo;.  The result is that this group will be eligible to apply to the National Reserve under Phase 2 which will open for applications in early April.</p>  <p>  With regard to the group of farmers to which the Deputy refers who commenced farming prior to 2008, officials from my Department are meeting tomorrow with representatives of this group to discuss their particular circumstances.   </p>  <p>  In establishing the National Reserve I opted for the maximum available 3% of the Basic Payment Scheme financial ceiling, which is estimated at providing a fund of approx. &euro;24 million in 2015. I expect that there will be significant demand for the two priority categories of young farmer and new entrant under Phase 1 of the National Reserve. These two priority categories close for applications tomorrow and the estimated cost of the applications will be assessed. My Department will then have an indication of the level of resource remaining in the National Reserve to cater for the categories under Phase 2 of the Reserve which will open for applications in early April.   </p></reply>

The main producers are Italy, Bulgaria, Greece, Spain and Poland. These countries account for 85% of the EU tobacco growing. Tobacco cultivation represents 100,000 hectares along with 60,000 specialist producers for this sector.  The EU produces up to 200,000 tonnes of dried tobacco leaves per year which is less than 3% of the global yearly raw tobacco production, and imports some 400,000 tonnes a year, mainly from Africa and America. The EU exports up to 100,000 tonnes a year.</p>  <p>In April 2004 the EU Council of Agriculture Ministers decided to reform the raw tobacco sector along the same principles as the CAP reform of June 2003. The system of production quotas was abolished and financial support was decoupled from production. EU Member States covered by the tobacco regime were given a transition period to adjust between 2006 and 2009.  During this period, these Member States could either completely break (decoupling) the link between production and the financial link provided to the tobacco sector or continue to link part of the provided aid to production.  Decoupling aid from production allows producers to grow other crops if they wish while maintaining incomes.   </p>  <p>Since 1 st January 2010 the EU has not granted any specific subsidies for raw tobacco production with 50% of the previous tobacco aid incorporated in to the direct payment system and the other 50% went into the EU&rsquo;s Rural Development Programmes, particularly in tobacco growing regions. The tobacco crop is now treated along with other crops for example cereals under the Single Payment Scheme of the Common Agriculture Policy.   </p></reply>

Ireland&rsquo;s draft Rural Development Programme 2014-2020 states, &lsquo;Ireland will keep the possible use of financial instruments under review during the programming period&rsquo;.    My Department and I have been active in exploring new and more competitive sources of funding and will continue to do so in the context of evolving market requirements. The recent announcement by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland of a new product, &lsquo;Agriculture Investment Loans&rsquo;, is a welcome addition to the sources of funding currently in the market. This credit is available, subject to qualifying criteria, at favourable terms (i.e. longer term and lower interest rate) for investments by agricultural SMEs involved in primary agricultural production, the processing of agricultural products or the marketing of agricultural products.</p>  <p>In relation to accessing finance and credit terms generally, I have recently been in contact with the main banks. I emphasised that this is a critical phase in Ireland&rsquo;s dairy expansion and that the increased investment and output from production and processing will have significant downstream benefits across the economy generally, including for the banking sector. In order to support the on-going development of the dairy sector and to mitigate the current difficulties caused by milk price volatility, I asked them to explore the full range of potential measures that could serve to alleviate the loan repayment burden facing farmers and offer maximum flexibility for dairy farmers in what will be a difficult year ahead. I believe that it is essential that short term cash flow difficulties are not allowed to undermine prudent investment plans or the longer term competitiveness of their operations. I will continue to communicate with the main banks on issues affecting the sector.   </p></reply>

Using data from Enterprise Ireland we can see that over the past 2 years some &euro;729M has been invested in 36 dairy and Infant Milk Formula plants. This represents significant investment and whilst much of the information about specific plants is commercially sensitive, details regarding many of the larger investments are in the public domain.  These would include the Glanbia project in Belview, involving an investment of &euro;235M. Other companies have also shown their confidence in the sector. Danone announced a &euro;50m doubling of capacity in its infant-formula manufacturing plant in Macroom in Co. Cork in 2010. Kerry Foods has built a global innovation centre - involving the creation of 900 jobs - in Naas, Co. Kildare; Dairygold is investing &euro;120m in a phased project to incrementally expand its production capacity; and Lakeland Dairies has recently began a &euro;36m investment in an expansion of its milk-powder processing operations at Bailieborough, Co Cavan.  Companies of this calibre do not commit to programmes of investment on such a large scale unless they have confidence in the sector and in its stakeholders.</p>  <p>  The deputy will also be aware of study that was undertaken via the Cork Institute of Technology which sought to examine the economic benefits and infrastructure requirements for future expansion of the dairy industry in Cork. The results from the survey of dairies in Cork indicated that the level of investment in dairy processing is higher than previous estimates for the country in total. Based on the survey of Cork dairies in this study, processing investment in Cork alone is estimated to be about &euro;77 5 million between 2010 and 2020.</p>  <p>  There has been significant investment at farm level too. A joint study by Teagasc and Bank of Ireland presented in early 2015 showed that Dairy farmers invested almost &euro;2 billion in the 2007 to 2013 period, with just under half of this investment in buildings, and almost &euro;70 million in milk quota over the period.  Teagasc estimates a requirement for further investment of &euro;1.4 billion at farm level to meet the Food Harvest 2020 targets.  A &euro;4 billion Rural Development programme will help to bridge the infrastructural gap at farm level through targeted investments in equipment and facilities.</p></reply>

The European Commission&rsquo;s Joint Research Centre has found that Irish dairy production has the lowest Carbon-intensity, with Austria, in the EU. </p><p>The potential impact of the increased production envisaged in Food Harvest 2020 on the environment was considered to be slightly negative overall in the Food Harvest 2020 Environmental Report (published in January 2014). A number of recommendations were made in the report that would mitigate any such impacts, and these are informing policy development. In order to ensure sustainability in production, significant investment is being targeted to address potential negative impacts. Measures include:</p><p>-  research aimed at developing and refining best practices</p><p>-  investment through the Rural Development Programme and</p><p>-  the identification and confirmation of sustainability credentials for Irish agricultural production. </p><p>Early analysis suggests that further efficiency improvements are possible such as the more efficient use of fertiliser and manure, grassland management, improved breeding and better fertility. Essential ongoing research into new technologies is being undertaken to maintain our economic and environmental competitive advantages. The level of emissions from agriculture has been steadily decreasing in recent years and my Department will continue to work with state and industry stakeholders so as seek even greater future efficiencies in a sustainable Irish agriculture sector. </p><p>Ireland has engaged in intensive discussions with the European Commission in recent years to highlight the importance of ensuring a coherent approach to the twin challenges of food security and the greatly increasing global demand for food in the coming decades with EU climate ambition. </p><p>The extent of the challenge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, in line with our EU commitments, is well understood by Government, as reflected in the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill 2015. While there will be a significant compliance challenge in the years 2017-2020, the development of an Agricultural Sectoral Roadmap under the Climate Bill 2015 will examine in particular what the sector can contribute to the overall national emissions target for 2020, through cost-effective mitigation measures while maintaining economic sustainability and efficiency in the sector. The Teagasc Marginal Abatement Cost Curve (2012) and the Rural Development Programme 2014-2020 will be very important to informing this process. The Government Bill outlines &ldquo;approach to carbon neutrality in the agriculture and land-use sector, including forestry, which does not compromise capacity for sustainable food production&rdquo;; the challenge will be how to maximise our productive agricultural capacity while maintaining our commitment to sustainability, the Food Harvest 2020 theme of &ldquo;smart, green, growth&rdquo; at its core. </p><p>The approach in the current Effort Sharing Decision, in terms of GHG reduction targets for 2020, treats the biogenic emissions from agriculture in essentially the same way as anthropogenic emissions from sectors such as transport and does not take into account the limited cost-effective mitigation options available in the sector. While the 2020 targets remain binding, Ireland has consistently pointed out that if emissions reduction targets continue to be set in this rather blunt manner into the future, the only way that the EU agriculture sector could move to compliance would be through reduced production. This would lead to carbon leakage to other less efficient production systems, and would be a perverse consequence of a short-sighted climate policy in the EU which would in fact lead to increased levels of emissions globally. Ireland has stressed that there is currently a disconnect between EU food security policy and climate ambition to 2020. </p><p>As a direct result of Ireland&rsquo;s leading role over the past two years in discussion with the Commission on the EU 2030 Climate &amp;amp; Energy Framework, the EU Heads of State and Governments agreed (inter alia) the following critical text at the October 2014 European Council meeting:</p><p><i>&ldquo;The multiple objectives of the agriculture and land use sector, with their lower mitigation potential, should be acknowledged, as well as the need to ensure coherence between the EU's food security and climate change objectives&rdquo;.</i></p><p>The recent report published by the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission entitled <i>&lsquo;Economic assessment of greenhouse gas mitigation policy options for EU agriculture'</i>confirms what Ireland has been saying in recent years to the Commission and reinforces the text of the October 2014 European Council Conclusions. If there are blunt emissions reduction targets for agriculture that do not take account of the limited cost-effective mitigation options, then reduced production and land abandonment is the major risk associated with compliance. </p><p>Officials from my Department are continuing to work with colleagues in other Departments to ensure a whole of Government approach to building upon the October text, and working with the Commission to ensure that EU climate and food policies to 2030 and beyond are coherent and consistent in recognising the reality of the global challenges that we are facing. </p><p>Reduced production is not an option for the Irish agriculture sector - we are committed to ensuring that the sector continues to grow sustainably so that Ireland can play its part in meeting the increasing global food demand while having regard to Ireland&rsquo;s climate obligations. </p><p>I have established a high-level committee that includes leading stakeholders in the Irish agri-food and environment sectors to develop a new ten year agri-food strategy to 2025. Independent consultants are working in tandem with the committee to carry out an environmental analysis of the strategy that includes an appropriate assessment and strategic environmental assessment.</p><p>While I cannot pre-empt the outcome of this important work the emphasis must be placed on encouraging sustainable intensification of food production in light of the growing global demand so as to reduce the carbon intensity of product, as well as contribute to both food security and greenhouse gas mitigation objectives.</p></reply>

This must include details of the slaughterhouse and de-boning hall in which the animal was processed, as well as the country in which it was born and reared.</p><p>In 2011 the European Union passed the Food Information for the Consumers (FIC), Regulation 1169/2011, which has updated the requirements for consumer information and labelling in a number of areas. In particular, the FIC Regulation extends mandatory origin labelling to meats other than beef for the first time. The implementing provision is Commission Regulation No. 1337/2013, which introduces mandatory origin labelling for meat from pigs, poultry, sheep and goats with effect from tomorrow, 1<sup>st</sup>April 2015.  Under this regulation, <b>labelling is required to identify the Member State or third country of rearing and the Member State or third country of slaughter for these meats</b>. The term &lsquo;<b>Origin&rsquo; can also be used where the country/member state of birth </b>is the same as the country of rearing and slaughter.</p><p>Ireland has been a strong proponent of such rules and I am today signing into law a new Statutory Instrument to ensure that the necessary provisions are in place to implement this mandatory labelling requirement from tomorrow.</p><p>As the deputy will also be aware, the Minister for Health has overall responsibility for general food labelling legislation. However, my Department plays an important role in the labelling of food together with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI). Under EU law primary responsibility for the safety and traceability of food placed in the market place lies with food business operators. The role of my Department is to verify compliance by the food business operators with this requirement.</p><p>Regulation (EC) No. 178 of 2002, which sets out the general principles and requirements of EU food law, stipulates, among other things, that food business operators at all stages of production, processing and distribution within the businesses under their control must ensure that foods satisfy the requirements of food law. Specifically in regard to traceability, the regulations require that food business operators must have systems in place to be able to identify any person from whom they have been supplied with a food. They must also have a system in place to identify the other businesses to which their product has been supplied. In other words a food business operator at each and every stage in the food chain must be able to identify the source of its inputs as well as having details of the first recipient of its output. This is commonly referred to as the &ldquo;one step forward one step backward&rdquo; traceability system. </p><p>My Department has a permanent veterinary presence at all its approved slaughter plants. Controls at stand-alone secondary processing plants are carried out at a frequency which is based on an annual risk assessment for each plant. An annual audit of imported products is carried out in each Department approved meat plant. The audit includes physical identity, labelling and documentary checks for product originating both in EU Member States and third countries. In addition, labelling and documentary checks form part of the routine checks conducted by Department officials.</p><p>The import of products of animal origin from third countries is governed by a comprehensive and robust legislative framework laid down at EU level, controlled by EU Member States in the first instance, and audited by the European Commission&rsquo;s Food and Veterinary Office, to ensure compliance with all of the relevant food safety standards. The legislation imposes a series of health and supervisory requirements, designed to ensure that imported products meet standards at least equivalent to those required for production in, and trade between Member States.</p><p>Import controls on products of animal origin arriving from third countries must be performed at an EU Border Inspection Post approved for that category of product being presented. Consignments for import requiring veterinary checks must be notified in advance to the Border Inspection Post of import and presented on arrival for checks with all the appropriate documentation. Border Inspection Posts in Ireland are operated by my Department. The import controls procedures on products of animal origin are highly prescriptive and strictly audited by the FVO to ensure compliance. Reports of the findings of inspections are published on the FVO&rsquo;s website.</p></reply>

As the deputy is aware, the main targets in the Food Harvest report are, by 2020, to increase the value of:</p><p>-Primary output in the agriculture, fisheries and forestry sector by 33%</p><p>-Agriculture, food (including seafood) and drink exports by 42%</p><p>-Value added production by 40%;</p><p>Progress on these targets is monitored and reviewed on an ongoing basis and the most recent data indicates that the value of primary production had almost reached its target by 2014, up 31% compared to the 33% target; exports had grown by 27%, also by 2014, compared to their 2020 growth target of 42%; and GVA had grown by 29%, by 2012 (the most recent year&rsquo;s data), compared with the target of 40%. In addition, Food Harvest 2020 also had set a target of increasing the volume of dairy production by 50% by 2020, the removal of the milk quota limits from tomorrow will allow milk levels to increase by that amount over the next five years. </p><p>Based on these statistics, all targets are currently well on track to be achieved over the next five years.</p><p>Nonetheless, I regard it as prudent to continually review the internal and external environment so that we will continue to maximise the opportunities available to this indigenous sector. To that end, I have appointed a 2025 Agri-Food Strategy Committee to report back to me by end June with any key recommendations and actions they consider necessary to allow us set ever more challenging goals for the longer term.</p></reply>

However this need not imply a move away from family farming, which has always been the backbone of the European model of agriculture. On the contrary, in my view, structural change is vital to ensure that our family based farming systems continue into the future &ndash; with fewer farms, but farms that are stronger in terms of economic viability, production efficiency and long-term sustainability.   </p>  <p>  Our vision must be to undertake food production and distribution in a manner that is sustainable in all its dimensions &ndash; economically, socially and environmentally. This is directly linked with the production of important public goods such as an attractive landscape, clean air and water and a vibrant rural economy. And family farms are the bedrock for achieving these added benefits. </p>  <p>  The challenge therefore is to ensure that our family farms are supported so that they are competitive and productive on the one hand and so that they can deliver these added environmental and social objectives on the other. </p>  <p>  The reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, agreed in 2013, provides this support and stability into the future. The Direct Payments system allows farmers to respond to the needs of the market while retaining some income stability. CAP Pillar 2 allows Member States to underpin the socio-economic development of our farms &ndash; improving competitiveness and sustainability and encouraging positive structural change. And the overarching flexibility incorporated into the reform allows these measures to be tailored to local needs, which is crucial in supporting the diversity of farming across the Union.</p></reply>

A key element of the new CFP is the setting of fishing levels on the basis of MSY (Maximum Sustainable Yield). This should ultimately lead to healthy fish stocks, higher quotas for both Irish and EU fishermen and lead to more sustainable fishing patterns. The new Common Fisheries Policy specifically calls for the progressive restoration and maintenance of populations of fish stocks above biomass levels capable of producing MSY. I am committed to the ambitious objective of achieving MSY by 2015 where possible and by 2020 at the latest. As president of the Council during the CFP negotiations it fell to me to broker an agreement on this important issue between the co-legislators. In line with the CFP, I consider that for some stocks we will need to phase in delivering MSY if its immediate application seriously jeopardises the social and economic sustainability of the fishing fleet. The TACs and quotas for 2015, as agreed at the December Agriculture &amp;amp; Fisheries Council of Ministers meeting, take account of delivering MSY for 2015 where possible and on a progressive, incremental basis at the latest by 2020 for all stocks.</p>  <p>  The introduction of a landing obligation/discarding ban on a phased basis, as set out in the CFP, represents a fundamental shift in fisheries policy and fishing practices. A discards plan for pelagic stocks in North Western Waters, developed by Ireland, the UK, the Netherlands, France and Belgium in consultation with the Advisory Council, has been in place since the 1st January 2015. Work on a discard plan for the whitefish &amp;amp; demersal stocks is already underway and is due to come into force on the 1st January 2016.  This work is carried out in close consultation with both the Advisory Council and other Member States with fisheries interests in North Western Waters. It is expected that over time the landing obligation will lead to an improvement in the state of the stocks of importance to Ireland and will result in increased fishing opportunities for the Irish fishing industry.   </p>  <p>  From the outset of the Common Fisheries Policy revision process, Ireland&rsquo;s overarching goal was to ensure a sustainable, profitable and self reliant industry that protects and enhances the social and economic fabric of rural coastal communities dependent on the seafood sector, while balancing these objectives with the need to safeguard fish stocks for future generations. This will ensure that families dependent on fishing can look forward to being part of a vibrant, productive and resilient Irish fishing industry and can expect to continue to achieve a reasonable return for their efforts and investment.</p></reply>

Evidence suggests that the sector can have a significant impact on local economies. The emergence of Ireland&rsquo;s artisan food sector, supported by growing consumer demand for niche products and a strong entrepreneurial spirit, has generated many new small food companies. Most are owner managed, frequently have a farming basis, and produce diverse products, demonstrating high potential for innovation. Artisan food also has potential to attract visitors and tourists as evidenced at Bloom and many food festivals.</p>  <p>  Within the artisan sector, the farmhouse cheese sector includes over 50 cheese-makers producing more than 150 types of cheese valued at over &euro;12 million per annum at farm gate level. My Department is supporting a three year programme managed by Bord Bia under the EU Promotion Scheme to promote and increase awareness of farmhouse cheese. It is projected that with the overall increase in milk production following the abolition of milk quotas, farmhouse and specialty cheese output could increase to just over 4,500 tonnes per annum worth around &euro;33 m without requiring significant additional capital expenditure. </p>  <p>  The Food Harvest 2020 strategy identified the artisan sector as having growth potential and has stimulated innovative programmes to support the sector including Food Academy, a programme developed by Bord Bia, the Local Enterprise Offices and Musgraves/Supervalu to support small producers to build businesses. This has generated new business and employment. Food Works, an initiative of Bord Bia, Teagasc and Enterprise Ireland, has also been successful.</p>  <p>  The development of a new 2025 strategy for the food and drink sector is underway and will encompass how best to capitalise on the positive growth prospects for the sector, which are driven by increased consumer interest in the provenance of food, environmental concerns, health and a desire to support the local economy.</p></reply>

Due to its reputation and significant global footprint, the dairy sector in Ireland retains significant future growth potential. The removal of quotas will be a key driver in this respect.  Ireland exported dairy products worth &euro;2.3Bn in 2010 and by last year this had risen by over one-third to over &euro;3bn. A number of trends are evident when comparing Ireland&rsquo;s dairy export profile with that which prevailed 5 years ago. Key among these would be a broadening of the Irish dairy sector&rsquo;s export base, with some 40% of Irish dairy trade destined for international markets, with this trade worth approximately &euro;1.24bn in 2014. Last year, Irish dairy products were exported to approaching 130 countries. Another key trend is the move towards higher value added products such as infant formula. This is reflected in the fact that in 2010, Ireland exported less than &euro;600M worth of infant formula globally and by 2014 this figure had increased by more than 50% to well over &euro;900M.</p>  <p>  I am acutely aware of the need to develop as many market outlets as possible for Irish dairy products. Notwithstanding our successful trade performance, I continue to work with industry to raise the profile of the Irish dairy sector, and the Irish agri-food sector generally, in emerging markets in the Far East, North Africa, the Gulf States and elsewhere. China is an obvious destination for certain dairy products and in particular for dairy based infant formula and I have led two very significant trade missions there since taking office in addition to trade missions to the Gulf States and the US to promote Irish dairy. My Department, along with Bord Bia, is working very closely with the industry to build on our presence in all of these locations. I have been very active in developing relationships in new and expanding markets in order to build the kind of confidence in Irish production and control systems that provide a platform for long-term trading relationships in the future.</p>  <p>  Most market analysts predict that medium term prospects for global dairy markets are good, with growth in world population and wealth expected to stimulate strong levels of demand for dairy products. My aim is to help position the Irish dairy sector to be able to take advantage of this opportunity.</p></reply>

Indigenous production of cereals is of course, an important part of primary agriculture production. In addition to generating an income for our tillage farmers, the cereals sector is a key source of seed production, grain for the milling and malting industry and feeding stuffs for the livestock sector. The long-term average cereal production in Ireland is in the region of 2.2 million tonnes per annum and it is desirable to sustain this level of production in order to avoid over dependence on imported cereals.  The 2014 harvest is estimated in the region of 2.5 million tonnes, well above the long-term average production of 2.2 million tonnes.</p><p><b>Since Ireland is a deficit market for cereals, prices here are greatly affected by world prices and supplies</b>. Despite lower direct and overheads costs, the lower value of output led to lower incomes in 2013 and 2014. Cereal prices are highly sensitive to global supply and demand and volatility in prices is likely to become a constant feature of Irish cereal prices in future and grain producers should factor such fluctuations into their planning and marketing strategies.</p><p>My Department operates a range of services aimed at improving the level of production, quality and viability of the Irish cereal sector. These services include seed certification, seed testing, variety testing and the publication of recommended lists of varieties, research funding through the &lsquo;Stimulus&rsquo; competitive research programme and funding for the quality assurance scheme. In addition, Teagasc provides research, training and advisory services for cereal producers. The value of all these support services is reflected in the fact that Irish cereals producers have consistently achieved some of the highest yields in the world. Teagasc estimates the area planted for 2015 winter crops at: wheat (55,000 ha); barley (75,000 ha); oats (8,000 ha), while comparable areas for 2014 were: wheat (64,000 ha); barley (60,000 ha); oats (10,000 ha).</p><p>Food Harvest 2020 outlined a number of challenges facing the cereal sector in the coming years including price volatility, climatic and disease issues, high input prices, small and fragmented holdings and the cost of rented land. However, the report also pointed to positive projections for cereal prices as markets are relatively well-balanced and world cereal prices are projected to be higher than in the last decade. </p><p>It is known that global grain production is struggling to meet the increasing demand for food, feed and industrial uses. In addition to a rising global population creating a bigger demand for cereals, an increasing demand for meat is disproportionately increasing grain demand even further. It is predicted that global demand for cereals will reach 3 billion tonnes by 2025 compared with 2.3 billion tonnes currently.</p><p>The European Union is one of the largest grain producers in the world and plays an important role in both exporting and importing cereals, oilseeds and their derived products. Europe consumes around 414 million tonnes of grains and derived products per year, catering for food, feed and industrial needs: 339 million tonnes of these agricultural goods are produced in the EU and 75 million tonnes are imported from third countries. Despite EU producers&rsquo; efforts to increase their productivity, demand outstrips supply and thus EU operators are dependent on imports from the world market.</p><p>The primary growth in requirement for Irish cereals in the years ahead is likely to be for animal feed, given the targets for increased livestock output proposed in Food Harvest 2020 and the lifting of milk quotas which is expected to give rise to a considerable expansion in the dairy herd, as well as an increased level of feeding and production per livestock unit. However, considerable potential also exists in grains for the drink industry such as malting barley and recent significant investments by the large brewing and distilling companies here in Ireland are proof of such potential. Further, it is envisaged that there will be increased demand for Irish oats milled for human food for the home and export markets and in this context, the success of the Agribusiness sector in securing, long-term contracts with US-based Foods companies to supply milled Irish oats to a premium Irish oatmeal brand in the US market, is particularly welcome.</p></reply>

Current beef prices in Ireland stand at 103% of the EU15 average. As of the end of last week, the average prices paid (excluding VAT) for an R3 steer stood at &euro;4.03/kg and an R3 Heifer at &euro;4.14, an increase on the previous week and almost 10% higher than the beginning of the year in both cases.</p><p>Margins and input costs are also impacted by a number of factors other than price and these are the areas where I have focused my efforts since becoming Minister. I established the Beef Round Table forum last year in order to bring all stakeholders together and to facilitate open discussion between industry and farming organisations. At the fifth meeting of the Round Table in January, the stakeholders agreed to a broad range of outcomes which address areas of concern for the sector relating to product specification, price transparency and a weight limit moratorium until December 2015.</p><p>The Round Table allows stakeholders to engage in a positive way on strategic goals for the sector. As an example, the most recent meeting of the RoundTable held in February resulted in the establishment of a stakeholder group, led by Teagasc, which was tasked with preparing written guidelines for beef farmers which would act as a blueprint for those currently producing bull beef or those considering developing bull beef production systems, taking into account production efficiency and market dynamics.</p><p>The Deputy will also be aware that I have provided a package worth over &euro;70 million for the beef sector in 2015. This includes &euro;52 million for the Beef Data and Genomics Programme (BDGP) which forms part of Ireland&rsquo;s draft Rural Development Programme, and will involve a budget of some &euro;300m over a six year period. The proposed BDGP is intended to deliver an accelerated improvement in the environmental sustainability of the beef herd through the application of genomics technology. This will help farmers to manage their enterprises in a sustainable way that is cognisant of Ireland&rsquo;s climate change commitments, while supporting improved quality and traceability in the national suckler herd. It will also place Ireland at the global forefront in the application of genomics technology and cement our reputation as one of the most important and export focussed beef producing nations in the world.</p><p>Of course, new market opportunities for both beef and live cattle exports also impact on the eventual returns to farmers. The recent openings of the US and Chinese markets to Irish beef are major achievements in this regard. Given China&rsquo;s strict safety standards and cautiousness around granting market access and with a market of over 6 million tonnes and growing, it is a clear endorsement of Ireland&rsquo;s food safety standards and a huge economic boost to the beef sector .</p><p><b><i>Sheepmeat</i></b></p><p>2015 is proving to be a good year for sheep producers so far, with average factory prices for the first eleven weeks of the year running at 11% ahead of the corresponding period in 2014. Slaughterings during the same period are down by 2%, reflecting a lower carryover of hoggets from 2014.</p><p>While recent currency movements would have an impact on the cost of imported input materials for farmers in general, the problem is not particularly acute for sheep farmers as they are mainly fed on grass.</p><p>The vast majority of our sheepmeat is exported to high-value markets in Northern Europe. However it is important to develop alternative market opportunities and I intend to continue to drive this process. My Department in consultation with the meat industry and in cooperation with Bord Bia and the Irish Embassies abroad is constantly pushing for new markets and opportunities. In 2014 we agreed veterinary health certificates with Lebanon, Namibia, Hong Kong and The Philippines allowing for the export of Irish sheepmeat to those countries. Also, during my visit to China leading a Trade Mission in November 2014, I was able to hand over the completed version of a sheep questionnaire which we had been asked to complete in connection with our efforts to gain access to the Chinese market for sheepmeat. This represents the first milestone on the road which will lead, I hope, to Ireland gaining access to the Chinese market for sheepmeat in the future. While in the US recently, we also had the opportunity to raise access for Irish lamb but we were informed that the next step in the process, which is the lifting of their TSE ban, is still sometime away.</p><p><b><i>Pigmeat</i></b></p><p>The development of the pigmeat sector is a priority for me given the crucial role which the industry plays in supporting approximately 7,000 jobs including production, slaughter, processing, feed manufacture and services. The sector accounts for 5% of the total agri-food sector and is the third largest individual component. In 2014 export volumes were up 10% continuing the growth seen in previous years, against export values of 3%, somewhat constrained due to price pressures. Pigmeat prices tend to be cyclical in nature with periods of lower prices and production followed by recovery and this has remained the case for many years. Price declines in the latter part of last year resulted in the end of year price falling below levels unseen in the previous three years. However due to recent price gains the average Grade E pig price currently stands at &euro;142.93, 6% lower than the same week last year. I am hopeful that with the recent opening of Aid to Private Storage for the pigmeat sector and seasonal demand, recent price rises will continue and that this will result in improved margins for pig producers. </p><p>Support is provided by my Department for the development of the pig sector in a number of ways. Firstly I have included provision in 2015 and throughout the whole RDP for an on-farm capital investments scheme, TAMS II, with an overall budget of &euro;395 million across all sectors, with &euro;37 million allocated for 2015. Among the areas identified for initial funding are investments on pig farms for energy, water meters and medicine dispensers. </p><p>Other supports for development of the sector come through Teagasc which, through its Moorepark pig research facility and courses in pig production, plays an important role in improving production at farm level. Through its Joint Research Advisory Programme, Teagasc supports Irish pig producers by providing advice, research and education across a range of issues of importance to the sector. The high level objective of the programme is to enhance the sustainability of Irish pig meat production, including improvements in economic, social and environmental standards. This will result in improvements in the production and marketability of Irish pigmeat. </p><p>I am also conscious of the need to promote the consumption of Irish pigmeat in domestic and overseas markets. Bord Bia provides assistance to the pigmeat sector through its marketing and promotional activities, and the pigmeat quality assurance scheme helps to consolidate the position of Irish pigmeat on the domestic market and helps expand its presence on EU and third country markets. </p><p>International trade is expected to improve in 2015, reflecting the ongoing increase in demand in response to growing per capita wealth in China, and the redirection of pigmeat usually directed towards the Russian market to different locations such as South Korea and the Philippines. For my part I have undertaken to ensure that as many alternative markets as possible are open to Irish Pigmeat processors. In this regard I was pleased to announce last year the opening of the markets in Vietnam and the Philippines for Irish pigmeat which are already serving as valuable alternative markets to Russia for Irish pigmeat exports. I am also continuing in my efforts to secure new third country markets, which has been a priority of mine since assuming office and my Department will continue to engage with the Russian authorities and with a view to lifting the pigmeat restriction as a priority. </p><p>It is important to remember that pigmeat remains the most consumed meat worldwide and this will continue to present opportunities for Irish producers, given our self-sufficiency. In addition, the progress made in the last few years in establishing and consolidating a presence in important international markets will better position Irish producers to take advantage of growing demand. </p><p><b><i>Poultry </i></b></p><p>Poultry meat has long been seen as a value for money food and this has underscored an increase in demand, particularly in recent years. The sector has faced considerable challenges in recent years with rising input and energy costs combined with significant pressure from lower cost imports. While input prices reduced somewhat, producer and wholesale prices in the sector eased slightly throughout 2014. </p><p>Support is provided by my Department for the development of the poultry sector in a number of ways. Provision is made through the RDP, TAMS II, for poultry investments. In addition knowledge transfer groups will be established to optimise producer productivity and profitability in the poultry sector.</p><p>In terms of marketing supports, on a national level Quality Assurance plays a fundamental role in promoting food and horticulture and provides the platform for consumer promotion of product quality. The primary outlet for Irish-produced poultry is the fresh retail trade where Irish product is still dominant. A very important instrument in that market is the Bord Bia Poultry Quality Assurance Scheme (PQAS). The Quality Assurance mark is recognised by consumers as a guarantee of traceability and reliability and is sought after by Irish retailers.</p><p>In terms of exports, Ireland exports poultry meat to almost 40 international markets and export values grew by an estimated 20% in 2014 to &euro;310 million, underpinned by strong growth in the export of processed products. Irish production is forecast to remain stable during 2015 as EU and international production is estimated to increase marginally.</p></reply>

Our Seafood sector is worth in the region of &euro;850 million annually to our economy, with exports growing by 70% since 2009 to &euro;540 million. Seafood is widely recognised as a high growth area of our economy. Through Food Harvest 2020 and this new Seafood Development Programme, I am targeting growth of the seafood industry to &euro;1 billion by 2020, with growth in employment of 3,000 to 14,000 people employed in our coastal communities. The new Seafood Development Programme will be a key element in achievement of that growth target. It will provide the capital to assist seafood enterprises to sustainably grow their production, add value to our seafood exports and create much needed employment in our coastal communities.</p></reply>

A key element of the new CFP is the setting of fishing levels on the basis of MSY (Maximum Sustainable Yield). This should ultimately lead to healthy fish stocks, higher quotas for both Irish and EU fishermen and lead to more sustainable fishing patterns. The new Common Fisheries Policy specifically calls for the progressive restoration and maintenance of populations of fish stocks above biomass levels capable of producing MSY. I am committed to the ambitious objective of achieving MSY by 2015 where possible and by 2020 at the latest.</p>  <p>  Scientific information on the state of the fisheries resources exploited by the Irish fleet is compiled by the Marine Institute and is published in the Stock Book each year.   </p>  <p>  The 2014 Stock Book informs us that in relation to stocks of a healthy biological state, there was an improvement in 2014 compared with 2013 on the state of the resource base in relation to pressure indicators.  In all 73 stocks are subject to the scientific advice of the Marine Institute.  This is an increase from 59 stocks last year, mainly due to the addition of a number of skates and rays stocks.    There is a higher number, 25 stocks, assessed to be sustainably fished in 2014, up from 20 last year.  The proportion remains the same due to the higher number of stocks being assessed overall this year.  The number of stocks overfished has also increased from 14 in 2013 to 22 in 2014.  This is due to the inclusion of 4 new stocks (rays and sea bass) and 4 stocks have gone from unknown status or underfished to overfished.  The number of stocks with unknown status is 26, which is similar to last year. </p>  <p>  In respect of the biomass of stocks, that is the quantity of mature fish in the sea, approximately one quarter, or 17 stocks are in a positive state with above biomass trigger points.  The number of depleted stocks has increased from 7 to 12 and now 16% of stocks are assessed to be depleted.  The number of stocks with unknown Spawning Stock Biomass (SSB), no assessments or undefined maximum rate of fishing mortality (Fmsy) remains relatively high involving 44 stocks.  Many of these stocks have good information on biomass trends and this informs scientific advice for the stocks.  </p>  <p>  A Key element of the new CFP is the setting of fishing levels on the basis of Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY). This will be phased in gradually, applying by 2015 where possible and by 2020 at the latest for all stocks. This will result in more fish being left in the sea to mature and reproduce leading to increased abundance of fish, and over time to higher quotas for Irish fishermen. </p>  <p>  The EU Commission has noted that the state of fish stocks in European Atlantic and nearby waters continues to improve which I believe indicates that we are finally starting to see the benefits of prudent and responsible fisheries management practices. </p></reply>

When completed this programme will release 125 full-time Garda equivalents to core Garda duties.  The programme includes the use of civilian immigration officers to undertake front line immigration checks at Dublin Airport.  The initiative involves the deployment of 80 civilian staff at the airport at border control booths on a 24/7 basis.  The project is now underway and the move to a 24/7 civilian operation in Terminal 1 is expected to be completed this summer (since 30 March 2015, civilians have been operating in Terminal 1 from 07:00 to midnight - Monday to Friday; 35 civilian staff are currently deployed there)  with Terminal 2 to be completed by December 2015. </p>  <p>  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform gave sanction to proceed with the various elements of the project in August 2014 based on a detailed business plan submitted by my Department.</p>  <p>  I am looking at further deployment of civilian officers to other major ports of entry to the State (where this makes sense from a cost and efficiency perspective).</p></reply>

One of the three headline indicators for the Strategy is "An increase in the level of disclosure and reporting, as a result of improved opportunities for disclosure and confidence in the response system". This work will continue (with the support and advice of the Non-Governmental Organisations) under the next National Strategy for the Prevention of Domestic, Sexual and Gender based-Violence currently being developed by Cosc, the National Office for the Prevention of Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence, which is an executive office of my Department. </p>  <p>  In addition, I am giving priority to the implementation of the EU Victims Directive. </p>  <p>  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Policy on the Investigation of Sexual Crime, Crimes against Children and Child Welfare includes specific directions in relation to the referral of  victims of crime to "relevant services in the area, both statutory and voluntary, which may be of assistance to her/him."  </p>  <p>  The policy specifically directs that in all cases of sexual crime, the investigating member will provide the victim with a copy of the relevant sexual crime information literature and make the complainant aware of the relevant services in the area.  The policy lists an extensive range of services to be considered, including -  Rape Crisis Centre; Crime Victim&rsquo;s Helpline;  Local Women&rsquo;s Support Groups;  Family Law Courts; the Legal Aid Board; and any other agency which may be of assistance.  The policy outlines that where literacy issues may arise, information should be explained verbally and where language is an issue, the information should be provided in a language which the victim can understand or interpreted to the victim. </p>  <p>  The policing priorities for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for 2015 include work to prevent domestic, sexual and gender-based violence and to effectively tackle such violence when it occurs with a view to ensuring timely responses. Support for victims of crime is also a priority in the Policing Plan for 2015. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has also taken important steps to follow through on the Garda Inspectorate&rsquo;s recent recommendations regarding the investigation of crime with the establishment of an Implementation Steering Group to focus on the implementation of the short, medium and long-term recommendations in the Report.   The Commissioner has established a new Child Protection, Domestic Violence and Human Exploitation Unit under the direction of a Chief Superintendent in the National Support Services of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. I welcome in particularly the fact that Garda Victim Services Offices have now been established in each Division.</p>  <p>  I can also inform the Deputy that the Legal Aid Board provides a legal advice service free of charge to complainants in prosecutions for certain rape and sexual assault cases. </p>  <p>  A person seeking this service is not required to undergo a means test or to pay a financial contribution. The accused must have been charged with the offence before the service may be provided. The service is provided by solicitors in the Board&rsquo;s law centre network. Persons who seek this service will be provided with advice on procedures at pre-trial stage and depending on the case occasionally at the trial itself.</p>  <p>  The Legal Aid Board also provides a legal aid service in certain rape and sexual assault cases where the complainant&rsquo;s prior sexual history has been raised by the defence in the course of the trial. </p>  <p>  A person who seeks to avail of this service does not have to undergo the means test, the merits test or to pay a financial contribution.  The Board will appoint a solicitor and a barrister to represent the complainant when the issue of previous sexual history is being raised.</p></reply>

This is the first step in delivering the Government's undertaking in the Statement of Government Priorities 2014 - 2016 to legislate to reduce the length of time protection applicants spend in the system. </p>  <p>  This reform will simplify and streamline existing arrangements and provide applicants with a final decision on their protection application in a more straightforward and timely fashion and will also, as a consequence, reduce the length of time that applicants spend in the Direct Provision system.  </p>  <p>  In accordance with the Government decision I have forwarded the General Scheme of the Bill to the Attorney General for the detailed drafting of the legislation which, subject to the approval of the Government at a future time, will be presented to the Oireachtas for enactment into law.  My aim is for the legislation to be enacted by the end of this year.</p>  <p>  The General Scheme proposes transitional provisions in relation to applicants who are already proceeding through the existing asylum system.  It is proposed that certain categories of applicants will be brought within the scope of the new single procedure while preserving decisions already made by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  Applicants who are not brought within the scope of the new procedure will continue to have their applications processed in accordance with the existing legal framework.</p></reply>

There are also considerable societal benefits associated with resolving disputes other than within the adversarial environs of the courts. The Courts Service in cooperation with the Legal Aid Board and the Family Mediation Service have introduced, for example, a mediation initiative in the areas of access, custody and guardianship at the main District Court family law court office in Dolphin House offering information on mediation to persons who have made contact with the office with a view to issuing proceedings. A formal mediation process is then offered to parties willing to engage thus avoiding the personal turmoil and stress associated with formal court hearings. This initiative has been particularly successful and is now being extended to other selected offices. The Service, within the resources available, regularly cooperate with other state agencies and Non- Governmental Organisations in developing new initiatives particularly in the area of family law.</p>  <p>  The Courts Service has confirmed that it has taken best practice in other jurisdictions into account in reviewing family law issues, for example, the Pilot project carried out on Family Law reporting in October 2007 and more recently the submission of the Family Law Court Development Committee of the Courts Service Board on a new Family Court Structure.</p>  <p>  My Department had initiated a consultation process with interested parties in relation to the establishment of family law courts and in that regard hosted a seminar in July 2013 to discuss how such courts might operate.  An eminent judge from the Australian Family Court attended the seminar and shared experiences of their system.  The current position is that my Department is finalising proposals for future legislation based on the outcome of the seminar, submissions received and ongoing consultations with interested parties. I intend to bring proposals to establish the new Family Court to Government as soon as they have been finalised. The draft General Scheme of the Bill will then be subject to the usual pre-legislative scrutiny by the Justice Committee.</p></reply>

An additional worker was employed in the GYDP concerned from September 2009.  Despite the difficult economic climate, which required across-the-board reductions in funding to GYDPs, funding to this organisation has now been maintained without further cutback since 2012. This is equivalent to a 32% increase in funding in the period 2008-2014.</p></reply>

When enacted, the Bill will facilitate full compliance with the criminal law provisions of a number of EU, UN and Council of Europe legal instruments.  The Bill will also implement the recommendations of a number of Oireachtas committees, reform the law on incest and update the Sex Offenders Act 2001.

The second is the more serious offence of purchasing a sexual service from a trafficked person and carries a potential penalty of up to 5 years imprisonment and/or a fine.  In both cases, the person selling the sexual service will not be subject to an offence. </p><p>These proposals have been developed following extensive consultation, initiated by my Department, dating back to 2012.  The new offences also implement the recommendation from the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence which called for the introduction of an offence criminalising the purchase of sexual services. </p><p>The Bill is priority legislation and is currently being drafted, with a view to publication in this parliamentary session.  <b><font color="#000080"></font></b></p></reply>

Firearms Dealers registered with my Department routinely apply for transfer documents / export licences to remove specific firearms from Ireland to another jurisdiction within the EU.  The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation process applications to export firearms to Non EU countries. </p>  <p>  The main legal provisions governing the export and removal of firearms from the State are Section 16 of the Firearms Act, 1925 and Regulation 6 of the EC ( Acquisition and Possession of Weapons and Ammunition) Regulations 1993, as amended.  In effect, this means that a firearms dealer exporting firearms must obtain a removal order from the relevant Garda Superintendent for the specific firearms being removed and then an application can be made to my Department for a transfer document/ export licence.  This requirement of a removal order applies to both specific export licences and a Continuous Export Licence (CEL).   An application for a CEL is judged on its merits.  A CEL is issued in exceptional circumstances to a very limited number of dealers who have high volumes of trade within the EU for a period not exceeding three years.</p></reply>

This will also provide an opportunity to consider other issues with regard to the operation of such leaves, including the question raised by the Deputy.</p>  <p>  Currently section 7 of the Maternity Protection (Amendment) Act 2004 provides for postponement of maternity leave when the child is hospitalised.  A request for such a postponement can only be made when at least 14 weeks of the maternity leave has been taken and the employer agrees to the postponement.  I should make the point that it is a requirement of EU law that at least 14 weeks maternity leave is taken after the birth of a child.</p>  <p>  The current entitlement with regard to maternity leave is 26 weeks together with 16 weeks additional unpaid maternity leave.  This is above the European average and there is also a provision of 18 weeks parental leave for each parent per child.  This leave is unpaid.</p></reply>

However, an Administrative Filter for Garda Vetting Disclosures was introduced with effect from 31st March 2014.

When such disclosures concern information relating to a prosecution, it is the responsibility of the organisation in question to use the information provided appropriately, fairly and only as one factor in an overall recruitment decision.  Decisions on the suitability for the recruitment/engagement of the person concerned rest at all times with the recruiting organisation.</p></reply>

The scheduling of court cases and the allocation of court business is a matter for the Presidents of the courts and the presiding judge who are under the Constitution independent in the exercise of their judicial functions.</p><p>The Judges of the Court of Appeal have developed new procedures for dealing with the caseload of the court which are designed to ensure that cases are managed from the date of the appeal.  In order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has informed me that the Court of Appeal sits every day in the Criminal Courts of Justice to hear criminal appeals with two courts sitting on Monday of each week.  In relation to criminal appeals, upon lodgement of the necessary written submissions by an appellant a hearing date can now be scheduled within 3 - 4 months. In relation to the civil business of the court, the Supreme Court transferred a caseload of 1,345 civil matters to the Court of Appeal, including 258 cases that were already certified as ready for hearing.  A further 275 new cases have been lodged.<b></b>Newly lodged cases are being listed on an ongoing basis within 3-4 months of the date of lodgment and dates have been allocated in respect of over 150 of the certified appeals transferred to the court. Additional sittings are to be held before the end of July 2015 to allocate dates for the remaining certified cases transferred to the court. Any party to a transferred appeal may apply to the court for a hearing date pursuant to the terms of a Practice Direction put in place by the court for such purpose.</p><p>I am also informed that the Supreme Court has made significant progress in dealing with its backlog and, in particular in the last eighteen months, has been engaged in a proactive review and management of its total caseload under the direction of the Chief Justice. In 2014 the Court disposed of a total of 794 appeals which represents a very sizeable increase on previous years. Subsequent to the establishment of the Court of Appeal in October last year the Supreme Court transferred 1,345 appeals to that Court. The Supreme Court retained 827 appeals for determination and it also dealt with a further 18 applications under the provisions of Article 64 of the Constitution.  The Supreme Court currently retains a caseload of 712 appeals for determination. The Court continues in this transitional phase to actively manage its legacy caseload and, in addition, applications under its new Constitutional jurisdiction. I am informed that the Court hopes to dispose of the remaining legacy caseload as quickly as is possible in the circumstances subject to the level of new jurisdiction applications which it receives in the medium term.</p></reply>

I will write further to the Deputy in relation to statistics on the other matter raised by him.</p><p>On 30th March 2015 there were 504 prisoners (11.4%) on temporary release across the prison system. This included 133 prisoners who were serving less than 3 months solely for the non-payment of a Court ordered fine and 178 prisoners who were on structured temporary release programmes such as the Community Return Programme or Community Support Scheme.</p><p>The legislative basis for making decisions on temporary release are fully set out in the Criminal Justice Act 1960, as amended by the Criminal Justice (Temporary Release of Prisoners) Act 2003.</p><p>A prisoner may apply through the prison Governor for consideration for temporary release.  Their family or their legal representative can also apply for consideration of such a concession. It is very important to note that it does not necessarily follow that a prisoner will receive temporary release even if the recommendation made by the prison authorities and/or therapeutic services is to that effect. Each application is considered on its individual merits and a number of factors are taken into account when making a decision on whether to grant temporary release.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the Irish Prison Service Three Year Strategic Plan 2012-2015 and the Joint Prison Service/Probation Service Strategic Plan 2013-2015 includes working towards the objective of ensuring that all prisoners released early from custody are placed on appropriate structured programme of temporary release.</p><p>The Community Return Scheme is an initiative whereby carefully selected prisoners, serving sentences between 1 year and 8 years, can be granted reviewable temporary release coupled with a requirement to do community service work such as painting, gardening or graffiti removal in a supervised group setting. The type of work involved is intended to assist the community and the scheme is involved with a large number of charitable organisations and local community groups.</p><p>In addition to Community Return, a Community Support Scheme has also been introduced to reduce recidivism rates of short term prisoners by arranging for additional support structures post release and by providing for a more structured form of temporary release.</p><p><b>Table - Breakdown by Establishment</b></p><p><table><tr><th><b>Establishment</b></th><th><b>Total</b></th></tr><tr><td>Castlerea Prison</td><td>28</td></tr><tr><td>Cloverhill Remand Prison</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>Cork Prison</td><td>117</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick Prison</td><td>59</td></tr><tr><td>Loughan House</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>Midlands Prison</td><td>48</td></tr><tr><td>Mountjoy Prison (Female)</td><td>31</td></tr><tr><td>Mountjoy Prison (Male) </td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>Portlaoise Prison</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Shelton Abbey</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>The Training Unit</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>Wheatfield Place of Detention</td><td>56</td></tr><tr><td><b>Total</b></td><td><b>504</b></td></tr></table></p></reply>

These are companies registered under the Companies Act which are established for the management of such areas, the members of which are the owners of residential units within the development.</p><p>The general position is that the purchaser of a residential unit in a multi-unit development, including residential estates with an OMC structure, obtains a long lease on his or her residential unit and becomes a member of the OMC. The OMC in turn owns not only the common areas of the development or estate but also the reversion, whether freehold or leasehold, in all the residential units. These arrangements and the related legal obligations, including requirements to pay service charges and contributions to a sinking fund, are normally contained in the owner's title deeds. Any subsequent failure by the owner to comply with obligations set out in the title deeds could give rise to conveyancing difficulties in the event of an intended sale or transfer of the residential unit concerned.<b><font color="#000080"> </font></b></p><p>Section 2(2) of the Act applies the sections set out in Schedule 2 to multi-unit developments containing houses, whether detached, semi-detached or terraced, and which have an OMC structure.

As regards the taking in charge of such developments by local authorities, I am aware that the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government has issued a guidance document to the local authorities on this matter.</p></reply>

It detailed disturbing and significant levels of historic abuse of children, who were placed by the Irish State, in residential institutions run by religious orders. The Government accepted all of the recommendations of the Ryan Report, and in response developed a detailed Implementation Plan, published in July 2009. The Implementation Plan set out a series of 99 actions which addressed the recommendations to improve services to children in care, in detention and at risk.</p>  <p>  A Monitoring Group was established to oversee the Implementation of the Plan. The Monitoring Group included representatives from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, the HSE (now the Child and Family Agency), the Health Information and Quality Authority, the Irish Youth Justice Service, the Department of Education and Skills, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Children&rsquo;s Rights Alliance and was chaired by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.

The impact of vacancies on service provision is risk-assessed on an ongoing basis to ensure that social work team members are never allowed to fall below what is considered necessary to provide a safe service. Such risk-assessments take account of issues such as case loads and referral numbers. Where necessary, temporary staff  are brought in immediately to cover vacancies until such vacancies are filled on a permanent basis.</p>  <p>  Stability, experience and capacity of staff working in the area of child protection and child welfare are extremely important. The Agency is committed to producing a Workforce Development Strategy by end of Quarter Two in 2015. This is to ensure that strategic and operational workforce development plans and processes are established as key activities in the Agency. This development presents the Agency with a significant opportunity to improve resource deployment, skill and grade mix and staff motivation to the benefit of the children and families. The workforce development plan will consider issues around recruitment, retention and turnover of key staff. This will also include further developing supports through structured professional and career development.</p>  <p>  While I would prefer to have a zero rate of vacancies in this specialised area of work, it is important to acknowledge that staffing vacancies arise for a variety of reasons, including retirements, career breaks, paid and unpaid leave (including maternity and other family related leave) and resignations. In that context there will always be gaps in timing around the filling of posts. The turnover rate of social workers at the Agency for 2014 was just under 8% which compares favourably with experience in other countries. Every effort is being made by the Agency to speed up recruitment and develop a comprehensive workforce development plan in 2015 which will assist in addressing staff turnover rates and lower them further. </p></reply>

As part of this process, all staff working directly with children in pre-school services must hold a major award in early childhood care and education at Level 5 on the National Framework of Qualifications, or the equivalent. This minimum qualification, which will be a requirement under the Pre-School Regulations, will apply to all pre-school services from September 2015.

The funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 380,000 young people and involve approximately 1,400 youth work staff in 477 projects and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country.  My Department, along with all government departments, was required to deliver substantial savings on all funding programmes in line with the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure (CRE) in the years 2012, 2013 and 2014.  In determining the annual allocations for youth programmes, while having regard to the CRE, my Department sought to ensure that, as far as is possible, the focus was maintained on the front line youth services particularly those for the most vulnerable young people. In 2015, funding of &euro;49.93m has been provided to my Department for these schemes and there has been no reduction in the overall allocation for youth services in 2015 which was a key priority for youth organisations.</p>  <p>  Funding of &euro;242,216 has been allocated to this project in 2015, no change from last year. I am also pleased to inform the Deputy that the project was awarded &euro;3,393 under my Department&rsquo;s 2014 Youth Capital Funding Scheme for some equipment for the project.</p>  <p>  I am aware of the challenges that the budgetary constraints raise for the youth services throughout the country.

The Government accepted all of the recommendations of the Ryan Report, and in response developed an Implementation Plan. The Implementation Plan set out a series of 99 actions which addressed the recommendations to improve services to children in care, in detention and at risk.</p>  <p>  The Government has approved the Fourth and Final Monitoring Report of the Ryan Implementation Group which illustrated that the vast majority of the recommendations (i.e. 94 out of a total of 99), have been implemented or are being implemented on an ongoing basis. It should also be noted that the Monitoring Group, which authored the Report, welcomed the significant positive developments that have taken place over the lifetime of the Implementation Plan. </p>  <p>  As regards the cost of implementation, additional funding of &euro;24m has been provided to implement the Plan. &euro;15m was provided in 2010, the majority of which was allocated to the Health Service Executive to progress various actions, in particular the recruitment of additional social work staff. Funding was also provided to the Health Information and Quality Authority to allow for the commencement of work on standards and inspections of child protection services. This allocation of &euro;15m remains in the allocations of the relevant agencies in the current year. A further allocation of &euro;9m was also made on a once off basis in 2011 to provide for implementation of actions. </p>  <p>   I share the concern of the monitoring group that five of the actions are incomplete. These incomplete actions are in relation to the erection of a memorial to the survivors of institutional abuse; a longitudinal study of children in care; the maintenance of records of children in care and the development of an archive for same, and research into best practice in family law court processes. As the Government has committed to the full implementation of all 99 of the Implementation Plan actions, I will continue to liaise with relevant Government colleagues and the Child and Family Agency as regards implementation and I have also undertaken to keep the Government informed of progress until full implementation is achieved.  </p></reply>

Since its establishment in 2007 HIQA has carried out its monitoring and inspection functions in a manner that has earned public confidence and trust for its independence and impartiality.  </p><p>This independence and impartiality is essential to ensuring that its findings and conclusions are complete, and to ensure that its findings are robust and  provide the greatest possible learning from any investigation. It is essential that there is confidence in the reliability and accuracy of HIQA findings on the part of the patients and families concerned in particular investigations but also on the part of the healthcare providers and staff who participate in the investigation and at whom findings and recommendations are directed. </p><p>In undertaking an investigation under the Health Act 2007 HIQA, at its own instigation or at the request of the Minister for Health, sets the terms of reference for the investigation based on the purpose and circumstances of the investigation.  There is no legislative requirement on HIQA to submit draft investigation reports to the HSE in advance of publication.  However, it is completely accepted as best practice and due process that relevant parts of drafts of investigation reports and findings are circulated to relevant individuals who participate in investigations before reports are finalised for publication. Any investigation report requires a robust factual accuracy checking process and natural justice and due process procedure.  </p><p>As Minister for Health I fully respect the statutory independence of HIQA to carry out its functions in an independent and impartial manner. I intend building on that independence and public confidence by seeking to extend and strengthen the regulatory remit of the Authority in the area of healthcare services in the future.

Regulations were made in 1971, 1973 and 1975 specifying the conditions covered by the LTI Scheme, which are as follows: Acute Leukaemia; Mental handicap; Cerebral Palsy; Mental Illness (in a person under 16); Cystic Fibrosis; Multiple Sclerosis; Diabetes Insipidus; Muscular Dystrophies; Diabetes Mellitus; Parkinsonism; Epilepsy; Phenylketonuria; Haemophilia; Spina Bifida; Hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide. </p>  <p>  Under the LTI scheme, persons suffering from only these prescribed conditions are provided free of charge with the drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances required for the treatment of those conditions.  As Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are not one of those prescribed illnesses it is not possible to provide medication free of charge under the LTI scheme.  There are no plans to extend the list of conditions covered by the LTI scheme.</p>  <p>  Assistance with the cost of medication is provided under the Drug Payment Scheme whereby no individual or family pays more than &euro;144 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, under the provisions of the Health Acts, medical cards are provided to persons who are, in the opinion of the HSE, unable without undue hardship to arrange GP services for themselves and their dependants. In the assessment process, the HSE can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.</p></reply>

There is a nine month grace period, which expires on 30 April 2015, during which time as many people as want to can take out health insurance without incurring loadings.  From 1 May 2015, late entry loadings will be applied to those who join the private health insurance market at age 35 or over, set at 2% per year for each year over the age of 34, up to a maximum loading of 70% at age 69 and over.</p>  <p>  There are exemptions available for people who previously had health insurance but cancelled it.  A credited period can apply for any periods of inpatient cover when a full adult premium is paid in respect of anyone, including spouses and dependant students.  Therefore, where a person was named on a health insurance contract and the policyholder dies, all prior cover is recognised under LCR.  Loadings can be avoided where the individual maintains their health insurance cover or has a break in cover of less than 13 weeks.  There is a distinction between the treatment of the period of cover for adults and children, whereby the period of cover for children where child premium rates are paid is not taken into account for the purposes of LCR.</p></reply>

The NIO runs regular media campaigns highlighting the importance of immunisation and has a dedicated website (www.immunisation.ie) which provides information tailored for public and professionals.  Information is also available to download. </p><p>There are a number of vaccines which protect against meningitis and those used in Ireland include:<blockquote>- Hib - Hib is part of the combined 6 in 1 vaccine that protects against diptheria, tetanus, pertussis (whooping cough), polio and Hib.  This vaccine is recommended for babies at 2, 4 and 6 months of age.  A Hib booster is offered at 13 months of age;<br /><br />- MenC -MenC is currently offered to babies at 4, 6 and 13 months of age;<br /><br />- Pneumococcal (PCV) - Pneumococcal vaccine is offered to babies at 2, 6 and 12 months of age;<br /><br />- Viral MMR &ndash; MMR prevents against some forms of viral meningitis.  MMR is recommended at 12 months of age with a booster given in school between the ages of 4 and 5 years; and<br /><br />- MenB vaccine is used in the control of clusters or outbreaks of Meningococcal B disease.</blockquote>My Department continues to monitor the development of new vaccines and immunisation strategies in relation to this disease.  It recently received a letter from the Chairman of National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) regarding the introduction of the Meningitis B vaccine into the Primary Childhood Immunisation Schedule.  In this letter NIAC recommends the inclusion of Meningococcal B vaccine in the primary immunisation programme, if the vaccine can be made available at a cost-effective price.  My Department is currently considering this recommendation.</p><p>The introduction of any new vaccine into the primary childhood immunisation schedule will be considered in the context of recommendations from NIAC, the outcome of cost- benefit analysis, the conclusions of the review of vaccination services currently being carried out, and resource availability.</p></reply>

The Health Service Executive (HSE) and voluntary disability agencies recognise the importance of employment to people with disabilities and are committed to supporting the participation of people with disabilities in the social and economic lives of their communities.</p><p>People with intellectual disabilities can avail of a range of community-based services and in many cases have priority in accessing these services.  The relevant community services may include Public Health Nurses, Home Helps, Personal Assistance, Psychological Services, Speech and Language Therapy, Occupational Therapy, Social Work Services, Physiotherapy, Day Care, Respite Care and Medical/Surgical Aids and Appliances.</p><p>In general, community services for people with disabilities are accessed on the basis of need.  However they may be subject to specific eligibility criteria, such as a holding a Medical Card or Long Term Illness card, although individuals who do not meet these criteria will be considered by the HSE on a case by case basis.</p><p>I appreciate the importance of the medical card to people with disabilities and the value that is placed on it by the person and their family.  Under the relevant legislation, eligibility for a medical card is based primarily on residency and means and not on the basis of having a particular medical condition or disease.  The Deputy will be aware of the publication of the <i>Report of the Expert Panel on Medical Need for Medical Card Eligibility</i>and the <i>Medical Card Process Review</i>in November 2014.  A key recommendation of the Expert Panel was that a person&rsquo;s means should remain the main qualifier for a medical card.</p><p>However, the Government recognises that the health service needs to be responsive to the circumstances of people with significant medical needs.  Following publication of the two reports in November 2014, the Minister for Health and I announced a series of measures to enhance the operation of the medical card scheme and make it more sensitive to people&rsquo;s needs, especially where serious illness is involved.</p><p>Where deemed appropriate in particular circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card even though an applicant's means exceed the prescribed threshold.

In our statement of Health priorities for 2015, the Minister for Health and I have reiterated our commitment to implementing the Strategy.</p>  <p>  The National Positive Ageing Strategy provides a vision for an age-friendly society and includes four National Goals and underpinning Objectives to provide direction on the issues that need to be addressed to promote positive ageing.  As Minister of State with responsibility for older people, I am driving implementation at political level.  The Strategy is a cross-Departmental one and my Department has an overall coordinating and collating role and a more direct role for the health-related objectives.</p>  <p>  A key objective of this Strategy is to change the mindsets of decision makers across Government agencies and to raise the priority that is given to the concerns of older people.  The first step in doing this is to establish a system of regular reporting on actions and initiatives that impact on older people, and these reports are regularly sought and collated by my Department.  The fact that such reports are already and will continue to be required will in itself increase the focus that is given to older persons' issues, and these reports will be submitted for the consideration of the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy and Public Sector Reform chaired by An Taoiseach.</p>  <p>  It is important to point out the many initiatives already in train which contribute to the Strategy's goals.  For example, in the health sector, in the area of older people&rsquo;s services and supports, the Review of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme will be completed shortly.  The Single Assessment Tool, which will allow for a systematic assessment of need and allocation of services to older people, is being developed by the HSE; measures are being taken to ensure integrated care for older patients, and palliative care services are being improved.  The Deputy will also be aware of the recent initiative which saw an additional &euro;  25million provided to address the issue of delayed discharges in acute hospitals.  The majority of these patients are older people, and these funds are being applied across both long term and short term residential services and at community level.  As a result the waiting time for funding of approved patients under the Nursing Home Support scheme has fallen to eleven weeks now from fifteen weeks a short time ago.</p>  <p>  A Healthy and Positive Ageing  Initiative (HaPAI) has also been established to implement the research objective of the National Positive Ageing Strategy.  It is a joint initiative between the Department of Health, the HSE&rsquo;s Health and Wellbeing Programme and the Atlantic Philanthropies and will run from October 2014 to December 2017, with a commitment to Department of Health funding for a further two years.  The Initiative will monitor changes in older people&rsquo;s health and wellbeing linked to the Goals and Objectives of the Positive Ageing Strategy.  This will be done primarily through the development of positive ageing indicators to be published every two years.  The HSE will also develop a physical activity communications campaign under the Initiative.</p></reply>

The Deputy will be aware of the publication of the <i>Report of the Expert Panel on Medical Need for Medical Card Eligibility</i>and the <i>Medical Card Process Review</i>in November 2014.  A key recommendation of the Expert Panel was that a person&rsquo;s means should remain the main qualifier for a medical card.</p><p>However, the Government recognises that the health service needs to be responsive to the circumstances of people with significant medical needs.

Where a person does not qualify for a medical card, they may be provided with a GP Visit Card, appropriate therapy or other community supports or drugs.</p><p>The medical card system is now operating in a more sensible and sensitive manner. The HSE is exercising greater discretion, as is evident in the increase in the number of discretionary medical cards in circulation - by over 55% from about 52,000 in mid-2014 to over 81,000 at the end of February this year.</p><p>The Irish National Dementia Strategy was published in December 2014 and the Government, together with the Atlantic Philanthropies foundation, pledged &euro;27.5 million to change how the illness is treated and understood over the next four years.  The primary focus of the Strategy is to enable people with dementia to live well in their own homes and communities for as long as possible, and it sets out ways of achieving this.  It includes the provision of intensive home care packages, an information campaign and resources for GPs, who are most often the first port of call for people worried about dementia.</p></reply>

Each of the other 15 maternity units is based in either a Model 4 or Model 3 Hospital.</p>  <p>  In line with the Chief Medical Officer's Report on perinatal deaths in Portlaoise, it is intended to establish managed clinical maternity networks across all Hospital Groups.  This will ensure that smaller maternity services are supported to provide quality and safe maternity care for women and babies.

I understand that current market practice for the health insurers is to apply a cancellation charge equal to the stamp duty levy to customers who cancel policies or opt to change provider mid-contract.  An administration fee may also be charged. </p>  <p>  It is a matter for the insurance companies as to the extent, if any, they pass this levy on to their customers.  Provisions for the payment of the levy are contained in Section 125A of the Stamp Duty Consolidation Act 1999, and are administered by the Revenue Commissioners.  The Revenue Commissioners has issued guidelines to insurers which  in addition to setting out the payment verification procedures agreed with insurers, also highlight that only one levy is payable in any twelve month period for each insured person.</p></reply>

They are not political or Ministerial decisions. </p>  <p>  The HSE received an application for the inclusion of Fampridine in the GMS and community drugs schemes.  The application was considered in line with the procedures and timescales agreed by the Department of Health and the HSE with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association for the assessment of new medicines. </p>  <p>   In accordance with these procedures, the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics conducted a pharmacoeconomic evaluation of Fampridine and concluded that, as the manufacturer was unable to demonstrate sufficient effectiveness and a fair price for Fampridine in the Irish healthcare setting, it was unable to recommend the reimbursement of the product. </p>  <p>  On foot of this, the HSE decided that it was not in a position to add the drug to the List of Reimbursable Items supplied under the GMS and other community drug schemes. </p>  <p>  It is open to the supplier, at any time, to submit a new application to the HSE for the inclusion of Fampridine on the community drugs schemes incorporating new evidence which demonstrates the cost-effectiveness of the drug, by offering a reduced price or both.  A revised application was received by the HSE on 25 July 2014.  The HSE has since been engaging with the company seeking an improved commercial offering and these engagements have been completed.  It is not possible to say when a decision on the funding of this medication will be made as the HSE is considering the outcome of those commercial engagements as well as the outcome of discussions which the HSE has had with clinical experts regarding this drug.</p></reply>

This is considered necessary to maintain numbers at the level required to support service delivery.  Retention of these graduates has been an issue for both the private and public health system, due to the moratorium on recruitment.  </p><p>One source of supply is the recruitment of nurses trained outside of Ireland.  Such nurses are required to register with the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland (NMBI).  According to the NMBI it takes up to 90 days to assess qualifications in this context provided all necessary documentation has been supplied by the applicant. The Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland following assessment of qualifications may require an applicant nurse to undertake a period of adaptation of assessment as a pre-requisite to registration.</p><p>In 2014 the HSE facilitated 151 nurses to complete such a period of adaptation for the private nursing home sector, and 195 places will be available in 2015. Nursing Homes Ireland has requested a further 272 places in 2015 to meet the needs of nursing homes, but there is no capacity for additional placements onto the nationally coordinated programme. </p><p>Discussions on possible alternative approaches for the provision of clinical adaptation are scheduled for the coming weeks between Nursing Homes Ireland, the HSE Office of the Nursing and Midwifery Services Director and the Office of the Chief Nursing Officer of the Department of Health.</p><p>With regard to the requirement for workforce planning Action 46 of <i>Future Health: (DoH, 2012)</i>commits the Department of Health to work with the HSE to implement an approach to workforce planning and development that achieves the objectives of recruiting and retaining the right mix of staff; training and upskilling the workforce; providing for professional and career development; creating supportive and healthy workplaces.  This approach will include the development by the Department of Health of a national integrated strategic framework for health workforce planning during 2015.</p><p>My Department will convene a cross-sectoral Working Group to develop the national integrated strategic framework in the near future. Preparation of terms of reference is well advanced and consultation with key stakeholders will form part of the Group&rsquo;s work.</p><p>A review of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme will be completed very soon.  The review, as well as considering how the Scheme has operated to date, will also consider broader issues including the future financing of the full range of supports for older people, how community and residential supports and services should be balanced, and how prices are set for residential care. This Review will be publicly available in due course.</p></reply>

Key elements of the initiative include:- </p><p>- the rollout of a programme of Intensive Home Supports and Homecare Packages for people with dementia;</p><p>- the provision of additional dementia-specific resources for GPs, who are the critical and initial point of contact with the health system for those with dementia;</p><p>- measures to raise public awareness, address stigma, and promote the inclusion and involvement in society of those with dementia.</p><p>The Strategy contains a set of priority actions capable of implementation within existing resources or by reconfiguring resources.  It also contains a number of additional actions which may require resources additional to what is currently available and which will be considered as these become available in the future.</p><p>In relation to the detailed queries raised by the Deputy, as these are service matters, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly.

However, in schools where there are more applicants than places available a selection process may be necessary.  </p><p>This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.  However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</p><p>Section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 provides for an appeal by a parent or guardian to the Secretary General of my Department, or in the case of an Educational Training Board (ETB) school to the ETB in the first instance, where a Board of Management of a school, or a person acting on behalf of the Board, refuses to enrol a student in a school, expels a student or suspends a student for 20 or more days in any school year.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that Government gave approval in March last year for drafting the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill.  The Bill is on the Government legislative programme for publication in the Spring/Summer session.</p><p>The objective of the Admission to Schools Bill is to provide an over-arching framework to ensure that how schools decide on who is enrolled and who is refused a place in schools is more structured, fair and transparent.</p></reply>

At that time I noted that there was a group of school abuse cases which had not been progressed for a number of reasons, including those which might have been discontinued after receiving letters from the SCA.  I asked the SCA to review these cases to clarify the exact position as to whether the cases had been formally discontinued or not.  The SCA has completed its review and my Department is considering its report.  I expect to be in a position to report to Government on this matter shortly at which time the Government will consider whether any measures will be taken in relation to these cases.</p><p>  As I have outlined previously, due to a lack of available information in relation to the precise circumstances of the 45 cases current at the time of the ECHR judgment in January 2014 it is not possible to say in how many of these cases settlements will be offered.  Since then a number of new cases have also been initiated or have sought to join the State to existing proceedings.  The SCA will engage with the solicitors in these cases also.  It is likely that there will be cases that will not come within the terms of the ECHR Decision.</p></reply>

This report, which was published in 2006, and which is available at www.ncse.ie,  made recommendations which suggested that additional investment over a period of years of up to &euro;235m per annum, across the education and health sectors, would be required to fully implement the EPSEN Act.  My Department's opinion is that the level of investment required would be greater than that envisaged in the NCSE report. However, a total estimate of this amount has not been quantified.  Further consideration of this issue would also have to take account of pricing adjustments in the period since the publication of the NCSE report. </p><p>In light of the very difficult economic situation and the significant costs involved in fully implementing the EPSEN Act, the previous Government deferred the full implementation of Act.</p><p>While awaiting the full implementation of the EPSEN Act, the NCSE has published a number of policy advice papers which make recommendations aimed at developing a better or more effective alternative to the current resource allocation model, and which aims to move the system towards ultimate implementation of the EPSEN Act.  These reports include the NCSE policy advice on Support Students with Special Educational Needs in Schools (2013) and The Report of the Working Group on a Proposed New Model for Allocating Teaching Resources for pupils with Special Educational Needs (2014). </p><p>  It is intended to bring into effect many of the good ideas contained in the EPSEN Act, on a non-statutory basis initially, through policy developments across a range of areas, in conjunction with NCSE policy advice.</p></reply>

The criteria used for the allocation of teachers to primary schools is published annually on the website of the Department of Education and Skills. The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September.

The cash contributions of &euro;54.42m under the Indemnity Agreement have been received.  These contributions include collective contributions from the congregations.  Of the &euro;54.42m cash, &euro;12.7m was earmarked for former residents and their relatives in the form of grants to assist them access educational services. This money was expended via the now dissolved Education Finance Board while the remaining &euro;41.72m and the associated interest, i.e. a sum of &euro;42.259m, has been expended on the Redress Scheme.  At the end of 2014, payments totalling some &euro;1.2 billion had been made on Redress Board awards and associated costs. In response to the call for further substantial contributions towards the costs of redress made in the aftermath of the publication of the Ryan Report, the congregations made offers which they valued at &euro;348.51m, including cash, property and other elements. Subsequent offers and the value of a particular property offer amounted to &euro;4.1m, bringing the total contribution offers to &euro;352.61m.   As the Deputy will be aware, the Government agreed to use &euro;110m, the cash contributions, to fund the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund.To date, some &euro;81.6m, comprising post Ryan Report contributions from congregations, associated interest and cash from property disposals has been lodged to the special investment account opened by the National Treasury Management Agency pursuant to the Residential Institution Statutory Act, 2012.  I understand that a further &euro;9m is expected to be contributed by congregations between now and 2018 while another congregation is providing the proceeds of property disposals as they arise. I have been advised by the Christian Brothers that the Congregation is reviewing its assets and liabilities and will be contacting me on completion of this review regarding its outstanding contribution offer of &euro;20m. Work is underway on the transfer of those properties offered by the congregations in the aftermath of the publication of the Ryan Report which were accepted in principle and work is continuing to finalise the arrangements in relation to the properties under the 2002 Indemnity Agreement.</p></reply>

My Department has no role in relation to processing applications for enrolment to schools.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that a range of placement options for pupils with special educational needs, including autism, is provided, in order to ensure that all pupils can receive a school placement. Many pupils with special educational needs will be able to attend a local mainstream school, whereas for pupils who have needs which require more specialist interventions, special class and special school placements are provided for. </p><p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), is responsible for processing applications from primary and post primary schools for special educational needs supports, including the establishment of special classes in various geographical areas as required. The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.</p><p>  Parents may contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs and to seek assistance in identifying placement options, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.  </p><p>  The NCSE have advised that SENOs are, at all times, available to parents to discuss their child's special educational needs.</p><p>  In primary schools, additional teaching supports for pupils with special education needs are provided through two channels. </p><p>  Under the terms of the General Allocation Model (GAM) of teaching supports, schools are resourced to cater for pupils whose educational psychological assessment places them in the high incidence, or less complex, disability category. All mainstream Primary schools have been allocated additional teaching resources under the GAM to cater for children with high incidence special educational needs. </p><p>  Separately, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) allocates additional resource teaching hours to schools for children who have been assessed within the low incidence, or more complex, category of special need, as defined by my Department's Circular Sp Ed 02/05. The NCSE operates within my Department's established criteria for the allocation of Special Education supports and the staffing resources available to my Department.</p><p>  As the Deputy has raised a particular issue in relation to the provision of support to an individual child by the NCSE, I have arranged for the matter raised in relation to the child referred to by the Deputy to be forwarded to the NCSE for their attention and direct reply to the Deputy. </p></reply>

The criteria used for the allocation of teachers to primary schools is published annually on the website of the Department of Education and Skills. The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September.

The NCSE observed that such a model would overcome difficulties potentially affecting all children with mild general learning disabilities, who have additional difficulties, including children with Down syndrome, as they would, under the new model, be supported according to their level of need and in line with their learning plan process.</p><p>I recently announced that I am not proposing to change the way teachers are allocated to schools for children with Special Educational Needs for the coming school year. In taking this decision, I have been guided by the advice of the NCSE Working Group report, which recommended sufficient time be allowed for consultation before the new model is implemented. </p><p>Through consultations, there was a broad welcome for the proposed new model from Parents, disability groups, schools and stakeholders. However, there has not been sufficient time to address all of the concerns which have been raised in advance of the 2015 school year.</p><p>In the context of the recent announcement that the proposed new model for allocating resource teachers to schools will not now be introduced from September 2015, I have reviewed the position in relation to what steps might be taken to improve educational provision for children with Down syndrome in mainstream schools. </p><p>On 24th of March, I announced that the Government has agreed that additional resources will be allocated to schools, as an interim measure, to support those children with Down syndrome, who are not already supported through the National Council for Special Education's (NCSE) annual allocation process.  </p><p>This measure is being introduced now in recognition of the length of time it will take to introduce the new resource teacher model which was recommended by the NCSE. </p><p>Under the interim measure schools will receive 2.5 resource teacher hours per week for each qualifying child. </p><p>This new allocation means there will now be certainty regarding the provision which will be made for children with Down syndrome with a Mild General Learning Difficulty. </p><p>As my Department is continuing to develop the new allocation model for schools and is currently working to devise a pilot of the new model, I do not propose to amend the current list of low incidence disabilities pending the introduction of a new allocation model.</p><p>I can confirm, however, that interim allocations for children with Down syndrome, as set out above, will remain in place until such time as the proposed new model for allocating teaching supports to children with special education needs comes into force.  </p></reply>

The GAM/EAL allocation for each school is based on the number of mainstream classroom teaching posts in the school. In addition, a differential in the GAM/EAL allocation for DEIS Band 1 schools is applied on the basis of 0.4 of a post if the school has 200 or more pupils and 0.2 of a post for DEIS Band 1 schools with less than 200 pupils.

This profile is to take account of the number of pupils with complex needs, the percentage of pupils performing below average in standardised tests and the social context and gender breakdown of the school.</p><p>The NCSE report recommended that a school's social context should be used because it can contribute strongly to the level of learning needs that students have. The report considered that, on the basis of available research evidence, the use of a school's social context is valid in developing an educational profile, as socioeconomic disadvantage is associated with the incidence of certain types of special educational needs, including low achievement in academic learning and emotional or behavioural disorders.</p><p>Accordingly, it was recommended that consideration of a schools social context should form part of any proposed new resource allocation model.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that I recently announced that I am not proposing to change the way teachers are allocated to schools for children with Special Educational Needs for the coming school year. In taking this decision, I have been guided by the advice of the NCSE Working Group report, which recommended sufficient time be allowed for consultation before the new model is implemented. </p><p>Through consultations, there was a broad welcome for the proposed new model from Parents, disability groups, schools and stakeholders.

This allocation can increase or decrease from year to year depending on a variety of factors.  My Department has no control over the allocation process to schools and is not in a position to influence the allocation process in light of the fact that the NCSE has been established as an independent statutory body by order of the Minister for Education and Science in December 2003.</p>  <p>  Where schools receive a reduced SNA allocation, this is usually because pupils for whom the school had previously received an allocation in the school have left, or have declining care needs. These reduced allocations are counterbalanced by new allocations in respect of new enrolments elsewhere.  It is also important to point out that, as part of the Budget 2015 announcements, the Government advised that it was making an additional 145 SNA posts available for allocation to the end of 2014 and an additional 220 posts available for 2015.  This will bring to 11,330 the total number of SNA posts available for the NCSE to allocate to schools to work with children who have assessed care needs requiring SNA support in primary, post primary, and special schools.  This is the largest number of posts that has ever been available for allocation and will ensure that my Department's policy of ensuring that every child who is assessed as needing SNA support will receive access to such support.</p>  <p>  In relation to the specific matter raised I have noted the Union decision to ballot SNAs for industrial action.  I have asked IMPACT to contact officials in my Department with a view to exploring those issues which are now of concern to IMPACT, prior to the instigation of any industrial action by SNAs.</p></reply>

Accordingly, Irish Water is in full State ownership.

To further strengthen this protection of the State&rsquo;s ownership of the company, section 2 of the Water Services Act 2014 provides that any future proposal for legislation that would involve a change in the State ownership of Irish Water must be put to a plebiscite of the people.

KCS answers calls made from many quarters over a number o f years for national standards to aid consistency in fire services provision by local authorities.  Fire services can now be benchmarked against these national standards, using an Area Risk Categorisation process set out in KCS.  The KCS development process had the benefit of oversight and international expertise from Strathclyde Fire and Rescue and the overall approach is aligned with international best practice in this field.  As well as having statutory duties under the Fire Services Acts, local authorities are governed by other legislation in undertaking their functions. Risk assessments are a statutory requirement for employers under safety, health and welfare at work legislation.  As employers, local authorities have appropriate Safety Management Systems in place for their fire services, including risk assessments.</p><p>A range of guidance has been developed by the Local Government Management Agency and the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management to support local authority fire services in meeting their statutory obligations.  These include:</p><p><i>- </i><i><i>Fire Services Ancillary Safety Statement</i></i>(2007) details Generic Risk Assessments;</p><p>- The <i><i>National Incident Command System</i></i>(2007) introduced <i>Dynamic Risk </i>Assessment at fire service operations;</p><p>- Standard Operational Guidance (issued in a number of tranches from 2010to 2012) gives Situational Risk Assessments for the range of common incident types attended by fire services; and</p><p>- Additional guidance, titled <i><i>Managing Safety in Fire Services,</i></i>was issued in 2014 to align safety, health and welfare provisions in fire services with general local authority policy.</p><p>The above documents provide the basis for fire services&rsquo; risk assessments and are available for downloading from my Department&rsquo;s website:</p><p><i>.  </i>Additionally, risk assessments are developed, to ensure the safety of personnel, and to comply with a statutory responsibility under Section 19 of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, (1989) where significant changes are proposed in fire services&rsquo; operations.  The Research Document <i><i>Fire Services Task Analysis and Crewing Levels</i></i><i></i>(28 March, 2013) provides guidance on how the main tasks that may need to be carried out for identified incident types can be carried out safely with normal crew levels.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-03-31a.1325.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/964" speakername="Ann Phelan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015033100074#WRX04000"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 614 to 616, inclusive, 619, 622, 630, 631, 634, 637 and 683 together.</p><p>The LEADER element of the Rural Development Programme 2014&ndash;2020, will provide &euro;250 million in financial resources to support the development of sustainable rural communities.  Ireland is reconfiguring the way in which local and rural development interventions are implemented. This is in line with Government policy to ensure that local government is well positioned to support the effective and efficient delivery of local and rural development. In this context, &euro;220 million of the overall programme complement for the 2014-2020 period has been allocated based on administrative or county boundaries to 28 sub-regional areas.</p><p>The EU Regulations which govern the Programme state that it is the responsibility of the Member State to <i>&ldquo;</i><i>define criteria for the selection of community led local development strategies&rdquo;.</i>In this context, it was decided to determine county allocations in advance of beginning the LEADER selection process. This approach will enable any entity that wishes to make an application to deliver the LEADER element of the Programme to develop a strategy which is consistent with the funds available for their area. I believe that this process will support the design and development of more robust and implementable strategies.</p><p>A further &euro;10 million has been allocated to the cooperation element of the Programme. &euro;15 million has been allocated for the delivery of two agri-food schemes which will be managed jointly by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine and my Department. In addition, &euro;5 million is being held in reserve for the purposes of supporting the Rural Economic Development Zones (REDZ) initiative, pending the successful outcome of a Pilot scheme as identified in the report of the Commission for the Economic Development of Rural Areas (CEDRA).</p><p>In determining the county allocations, three objective criteria were used, namely, minimum allocation, population density and a Resource Allocation Model (RAM). Each county was given a minimum allocation of &euro;3 million to ensure that each received a viable allocation. However, Cork County was allocated &euro;6 million as a minimum in order to ensure a viable allocation to each of the three administrative districts within the county, as the overall population outside of the city is almost twice that of any other county. While a specific cost benefit analysis was not conducted, the methodology used to calculate the allocations was designed to ensure that the available funding was weighted towards the most rural populations and those experiencing most rural disadvantage.</p><p>Using this methodology, which I am satisfied is fair and consistent, each county was allocated a proportionate share of the funding available through the LEADER elements of the RDP. Cork has been allocated almost &euro;14 million under the Programme. This is the highest allocation nationally and is almost &euro;5.5 million or 60% greater than the average county allocation.</p><p>While the allocation for the LEADER element of the 2014-2020 Programme is less than the value of the LEADER element of 2007 &ndash; 2013 programme, I am confident that within the confines of the fiscal environment we have experienced in the recent past, the Government has allocated the maximum amount possible to support the LEADER elements of the 2014-2020 programme. This funding, coupled with the Government&rsquo;s drive to increase coordination at a local level and the commitment to the delivery of the recommendations in the CEDRA report, will ensure that the impact of the funding, while decreased, will be maximised to support the sustainable development of our rural communities.</p><p>LEADER funding for the 2007-2013 programming period was not allocated based on county boundaries but to individual Local Action Groups on completion of the Local Development Strategy process. In addition to this, the allocations changed in 2012 when the EU co-financing rate changed due to the financial crisis and this resulted in a decrease in the overall programme allocation. Table 1 below details the initial allocations for each Local Action Group for the 2007-2013 programme period as well as the 2013 revised allocations. Table 2 below details the county allocations for the 2014-2020 programme period as announced on 10 March 2015.</p><p>Table 1<table><tr><th>Local Action Group </th><th>Original Allocation </th><th>Revised Allocation </th></tr><tr><td>Avondhu Blackwater Partnership Ltd. </td><td>&euro;9,057,810 </td><td>&euro;7,563,093 </td></tr><tr><td>Ballyhoura Development Ltd. </td><td>&euro;11,673,519 </td><td>&euro;18,832,677 </td></tr><tr><td>Carlow County Development Partnership Ltd </td><td>&euro;8,878,177 </td><td>&euro;7,619,278 </td></tr><tr><td>Cavan-Monaghan LEADER </td><td>&euro;12,035,118 </td><td>&euro; 10,235,403 </td></tr><tr><td>Cill Dara Ar Aghaidh Teo </td><td>&euro;12,282,448 </td><td>&euro; 10,642,073 </td></tr><tr><td>Clare Local Development Company Ltd. </td><td>&euro;14,028,529 </td><td>&euro; 16,175,841 </td></tr><tr><td>Co Kilkenny LEADER Partnership </td><td>&euro;11,523,729 </td><td>&euro; 13,587,910 </td></tr><tr><td>Co Wicklow Community Partnership </td><td>&euro;11,135,560 </td><td>&euro; 9,128,172 </td></tr><tr><td>Co.

Ireland is reconfiguring the way in which local and rural development interventions are implemented.  This is in line with Government policy to ensure that local government is well positioned to support the effective and efficient delivery of local and rural development. In this context, &euro;220 million of the overall programme complement for the 2014-2020 period has been allocated based on administrative or county boundaries to 28 sub-regional areas.</p><p>The EU Regulations which govern the Programme state that it is the responsibility of the Member State to &ldquo;<i>define criteria for the selection of community led local development strategies</i>&rdquo;.  In this context, it was decided to determine county allocations in advance of beginning the LEADER selection process. This approach will enable any entity that wishes to make an application to deliver the LEADER element of the Programme to develop a strategy which is consistent with the funds available for their area.  I believe that this process will support the design and development of more robust and implementable strategies.</p><p>A further &euro;10 million has been allocated to the cooperation element of the Programme. &euro;15 million has been allocated for the delivery of two agri-food schemes which will be managed jointly by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine and my Department.  In addition, &euro;5 million is being held in reserve for the purposes of supporting the Rural Economic Development Zones (REDZ) initiative, pending the successful outcome of a Pilot scheme as identified in the report of the Commission for the Economic Development of Rural Areas (CEDRA).</p><p>In view of the size of the Cork County area, excluding the city, and taking into consideration that there are three administrative areas within the County, it was decided that there should be three sub-regional areas for County Cork for the purposes of LEADER.</p><p>In determining the county allocations, three objective criteria were used, namely, minimum allocation, population density and a Resource Allocation Model (RAM).  Each county was given a minimum allocation of &euro;3 million to ensure that each received a viable level of funding.  However, Cork County was allocated &euro;6 million as a minimum in order to ensure a viable allocation to each of the three administrative districts within the county, as the overall population outside of the city is almost twice that of any other county.</p><p>As the value of the LEADER element of 2014-2020 Programme is less than the LEADER element of the 2007-2013 Programme, the allocations made on a county basis under the new Programme, including the allocation for Cork, have inevitably reduced.  Nevertheless, using the methodology outlined above in relation to the 2014-2020 Programme, which I am satisfied is fair and consistent, Cork has been allocated almost &euro;14 million.  This is the highest allocation nationally and is almost &euro;5.5 million or 60% greater than the average county allocation.</p></reply>

While it is a matter for individual local authorities to manage their own day-to-day finances in a prudent and sustainable manner, my Department is in regular consultation with the Council in relation to its financial position, including in relation to the agreement of a long term financial plan.  Local Property Tax (LPT) was introduced to provide an alternative, stable and sustainable funding base for the local authority sector, providing greater levels of connection between local revenue raising and associated expenditure decisions.  In accordance with the decisions taken by Government, 80% of LPT will be retained locally to fund vital public services in 2015.  The remaining 20% will be re-distributed to provide top-up funding to certain local authorities that have lower property tax bases due to the variance in property values across the State and to ensure that their 2015 LPT funding levels are at least equalised at 2014 General Purpose Grant levels.  Every local authority has the power, from 1 July 2014, to vary the basic rate of LPT by up to 15%. In the event that a local authority decides to increase LPT rates, they will retain 100% of the additional LPT collected. </p>  <p>  Where a local authority decides to reduce LPT rates, the full cost of that reduction will be reflected in a reduced LPT allocation to that local authority. In particular, for those local authorities entitled to receive funding from the equalisation fund, as is the case with Sligo County Council in 2015, the Government has decided that the level of funding they will receive from the equalisation fund will be set at the level that they would be entitled to had they not reduced LPT rates.  As such, local authorities will not be compensated for the loss of income arising from the downward variation of the rate.</p>  <p>  Sligo County Council&rsquo;s provisional Local Property Tax allocation in 2015 is &euro;9,993,352.  This includes an allocation of &euro;1million in additional funding for 2015 for the Council to assist it to take the steps necessary to move to a more sustainable financial position.  The payment of the additional funding for 2015 remains fully conditional on a realistic and achievable financial plan, which charts a path to long term financial sustainability, being agreed between my Department and the Council; this process is on-going.  Matters relating to equalisation levels and distribution of LPT for future years will be reviewed as necessary and appropriate.  My Department is in regular communication with the Chief Executive of Sligo County Council and his staff in relation to the development of this essential financial plan and have agreed the approach to financial projections that should be adopted in relation to both future funding and expenditure lines as is normal practice in the development of multi-annual financial projections for any organisation.</p></reply>

The HAP scheme will bring all social housing supports provided by the State under the aegis of local authorities. The scheme will remove a barrier to employment by allowing recipients to remain in the scheme if they gain full-time employment. HAP will also improve regulation of the rented accommodation being supported and provide certainty for landlords as regards their rental income.  Further to the enactment of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014 on 28 July 2014, the first phase of the HAP statutory pilot commenced with effect from 15 September 2014 in Limerick City and County Council, Waterford City and County Council and Cork County Council. HAP commenced in Louth, Kilkenny, South Dublin and Monaghan County Councils from 1 October. Subsequently, on 18 December, Dublin City Council became part of the statutory HAP pilot, with a specific focus on accommodating homeless households.  Dublin City Council is implementing the HAP pilot for homeless households in the Dublin region on behalf of all 4 Dublin local authorities, including D&uacute;n Laoghaire Rathdown County Council.</p><p>During the legislation&rsquo;s passage through the Oireachtas in July 2014 an undertaking was given that a report would be prepared for the relevant Oireachtas Committee.  Data for this report are being gathered from pilot sites and a progress report will be submitted to the Oireachtas Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht shortly.  Based on data gathered for the review, consideration is currently being given to the sequencing of local authorities to commence HAP on an incremental basis this year.</p><p>To date, in all bar one case, where a HAP applicant has qualified for social housing support and the Local Authority is in receipt of a valid and complete HAP application; the application has been processed and set-up.  TheHAP application of the household referred to was rejected due to anti-social behaviour issues. </p><p>The following table details the number of households supported by HAP at 27 March 2015:<table><tr><th>Statutory Pilot Phase - Current Local Authorities </th><th>Households supported by HAP at 27/03/2015 </th></tr><tr><td>Cork County Council </td><td>195 </td></tr><tr><td>Dublin City Council </td><td>1 </td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny County Council </td><td>282 </td></tr><tr><td>Limerick City &amp;amp; County Council </td><td>395* </td></tr><tr><td>Louth County Council </td><td>160 </td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan County Council </td><td>58 </td></tr><tr><td>South Dublin County Council </td><td>77 </td></tr><tr><td>Waterford City &amp;amp; County Council </td><td>130 </td></tr><tr><td>Total </td><td>1,298 </td></tr></table>*One application rejected due to anti-social behaviour issues.</p></reply>

The capped annual charges will be &euro;160 for single adult households and &euro;260 for all other households until the end of 2018.  All households will know what their capped bills will be until the end of 2018, which is particularly important for larger households or those with high usage due to medical needs.  In addition, a water conservation grant of &euro;100 per year will be available to qualifying households.  The Department of Social Protection will administer the grant on behalf of my Department, which will be available to households (principal private dwellings) that complete a valid response to Irish Water&rsquo;s customer registration process. </p>  <p>  The water conservation grant replaces the tax rebate and social protection measures previously announced and is a more straightforward means of addressing water issues for all households on equal terms and will reduce households&rsquo; outlay on water services both now and in the future. </p>  <p>  The charges structure was revised with a view to making it simpler and fairer, providing more clarity and certainty to households.  The overall cost for those who register with Irish Water, net of the &euro;100 water conservation grant, is either &euro;1.15 a week for single adult households or &euro;3 a week for all others.  Water supply will not be reduced under any circumstance.  </p>  <p>  When it comes to payment, a range of easy pay options will be in place, including direct debits, electronic funds transfer, payment by cash at any retail outlet with a paypoint or payzone sign or a post office where a bill can be paid in full or part payments of a minimum of &euro;5 can be made.  Irish Water also intends participating in the Household Budget scheme.  This facility, operated by An Post on behalf of the Department of Social Protection, provides customers with a facility to have their household utility bills and social housing rents deducted directly from their weekly social welfare payment.</p></reply>

A copy of the form used for complaints to the Courts regarding barking is available from local authorities.  It is a matter for the authorities themselves to determine the most appropriate arrangements, including administrative arrangements, for purposes of implementation.  While complaints in relation to barking dogs are largely dealt with under the provisions of the Control of Dogs Acts, the position in relation to noise nuisance generally is that a person experiencing noise nuisance may contact their local authority, which may initiate proceedings on grounds of noise nuisance under the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992.  This Act also provides for any person, or group of persons, to seek an order in the District Court to have noise giving reasonable cause for annoyance abated.  The procedures involved have been simplified to allow action to be taken without legal representation. </p><p>A public information leaflet, <i>A Guide to the Noise Regulations</i>, outlining the legal avenues available to persons experiencing noise nuisance, is available on my Department&rsquo;s website: </p><p>.</p><p>The <i>Programme for Government</i>includes a commitment to take further steps to address noise pollution, inter alia, through consideration of the introduction of fixed payment notices (also known as on-the-spot fines).  The development of new noise legislation by my Department is being considered in the context of this commitment.  However, as indicated in the Government&rsquo;s Legislation Programme published on 14 January 2015, it is not possible at this time to indicate when such a Bill might be published, having regard to the broad range of legislative priorities to be progressed across my Department&rsquo;s remit.</p></reply>

This is broadly equivalent to the &euro;240m in Exchequer resources devoted to the Water Services Investment Programme in 2013.  A further capital contribution of &euro;222m in respect of 2015 has also been provided to Irish Water by the Minister for Finance.   </p>  <p>Irish Water received a subvention of some &euro;439 million from the Local Government Fund in 2014 for operational expenditure, to fund water-related expenditures incurred heretofore by local authorities and which would, historically, have been met by local authorities from their own resources, non-domestic water charge revenues and general purpose grants from the Fund. </p>  <p>  In relation to the broader water sector reform programme, my Department has provided funding of some &euro;21m during the period 2012 to date.  The majority of this expenditure related to funding provided to local authorities to meet the costs of the pre-installation survey required as part of the domestic metering programme and the staffing costs of the Water Services Transition Office, which was put in place to ensure appropriate arrangements for engagement with the local authority sector during the reform process.</p></reply>

Under the 1995 scheme, discounts were related to the length of tenancy rather than income, with no provision for the State to share in any profits arising from the resale of dwellings. In contrast, discounts under the new incremental purchase model are much higher than under the 1995 scheme and, because the discounts are income-related, they will enable tenants to purchase their homes earlier in their tenancies than was the case under previous schemes.  The new scheme will encourage tenant purchasers to remain in their dwellings for a reasonable length of time after purchase, thus fostering stable and sustainable communities.</p><p>The Government&rsquo;s <i>Social Housing Strategy 2020</i>, which was published in November 2014, includes a commitment to introduce the new tenant purchase scheme in the second quarter of 2015.  Full details of the new scheme will be set out in Regulations that will be made in advance of its introduction.  </p></reply>

Applications for a new round of funding, which commenced on 1 July 2014, were subject to an appraisal process.  55 applications were approved for funding for the two-year period from 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2016.  A number of previously funded organisations were not approved for funding on this occasion.  Pobal were asked to undertake the management of the scheme and, in that context, put in place a dedicated team to deal with any inquiries from applicants and to provide detailed feedback.  Furthermore, an appeals process was put in place, on foot of which Pobal submitted a report, which is currently being considered.</p><p>On 18 July 2014, it was announced that bridging funding of &euro;1.4million would be allocated for a twelve month period to a number of previously funded health, disability and other organisations that were not approved for funding under the new scheme, pending the carrying out of a review of the public funding of national organisations in the health and disability sector.  This bridging funding in 2014/2015 will enable organisations to plan for their future, whether with or without State support, such as that provided under the SSNO. Details of the bridging funding provided are set out in the table below. </p><p>The review process is well underway and is being advanced in consultation with the Department of Health.  The review is designed to rationalise the funding of these organisations to ensure efficiency in the use of public money and avoidance of duplication, while providing appropriate support to organisations working in the sector.  The Health Service Executive and Pobal are also participating in the review.  All organisations in receipt of bridging funding have been contacted to make submissions as part of the review process.  I intend to complete and publish the outcome of the review in the coming months.<table><tr><th>Bridging Funding Provided 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2015</th><th>&euro;</th></tr><tr><td>Arthritis Ireland</td><td>53,882</td></tr><tr><td>Asperger Syndrome Association of Ireland Ltd </td><td>41,448 </td></tr><tr><td>Asthma Society of Ireland </td><td>41,448 </td></tr><tr><td>Breaking Through Limited </td><td>58,028 </td></tr><tr><td>Chronic Pain Ireland Limited </td><td>37,304 </td></tr><tr><td>Dyslexia Association of Ireland </td><td>62,172 </td></tr><tr><td>Genetic and Inherited Disorders Organisation Ltd </td><td>16,580 </td></tr><tr><td>GROW in Ireland </td><td>16,580 </td></tr><tr><td>Huntington's Disease Association of Ireland Limited </td><td>19,066 </td></tr><tr><td>Irish Deaf Society The National Association of the Deaf Limited </td><td>62,172 </td></tr><tr><td>Irish Heart Foundation </td><td>41,448 </td></tr><tr><td>Irish Mountain Rescue Association </td><td>58,028 </td></tr><tr><td>Irish National Council of Attention Deficit Disorder Support (INCADDS) </td><td>33,158 </td></tr><tr><td>Irish Stammering Association </td><td>24,868 </td></tr><tr><td>Migraine Association of Ireland Ltd </td><td>29,014 </td></tr><tr><td>Motor Neuron disease Association </td><td>24,868 </td></tr><tr><td>MOVE Ireland </td><td>41,448 </td></tr><tr><td>Muintir na T&iacute;re </td><td>70,462 </td></tr><tr><td>Muscular Dystrophy Ireland </td><td>37,304 </td></tr><tr><td>National Association for Youth Drama Ltd </td><td>29,014 </td></tr><tr><td>New Communities Partnership (NCP) Ltd </td><td>74,606 </td></tr><tr><td>Peter Bradley Foundation Limited </td><td>41,448 </td></tr><tr><td>Post Polio Support Group Limited </td><td>24,868 </td></tr><tr><td>Safe Ireland </td><td>74,606 </td></tr><tr><td>Show Racism The Red Card Limited </td><td>29,014 </td></tr><tr><td>Suas Educational Development </td><td>37,304 </td></tr><tr><td>The Alzheimer Society of Ireland </td><td>62,172 </td></tr><tr><td>The Carers Association Limited </td><td>62,172 </td></tr><tr><td>The Multiple Sclerosis Society of Ireland </td><td>49,738 </td></tr><tr><td>The Neurological Alliance of Ireland </td><td>49,738 </td></tr><tr><td>The Union of Voluntary Organisations of People with Disabilities </td><td>45,592 </td></tr></table></p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-03-31a.1427.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1088" speakername="Alan Kelly" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015033100077#WRAA00800"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 658 to 660, inclusive, and 662 together.</p><p>Enforcement in relation to illegal diesel laundering activities is primarily a matter for the Revenue Commissioners from the point of view of avoiding loss of revenue to the Exchequer. My Department assists local authorities in carrying out their role as competent authorities under waste legislation, which is to take the necessary measures, on behalf of the State, to ensure that any waste generated and left abandoned by diesel launderers is disposed of without endangering human health and without harming the environment.</p><p>Approximately 1,200 incidents of diesel laundering waste dumping have been dealt with by local authorities to date and my Department has up to now reimbursed the costs associated with such disposal on a case by case basis. The majority of the clean-up operations have taken place in Louth and Monaghan with 596 and 509 sites, respectively. Similar clean-up operations have also been carried out in Counties Cavan, Donegal, Offaly, Meath and Waterford.</p><p>Details of the significant amounts provided by my Department from the Environment Fund since 2011 on a per county basis are set out in the following table:<table><tr><th>Year </th><th>Louth County Council </th><th>Monaghan County Council </th><th>Offaly County Council </th><th>Cavan County Council </th><th>Donegal County Council </th><th>Total </th></tr><tr><td>2011 </td><td>&euro;939,315 </td><td>&euro;89,588 </td><td>N/A </td><td>N/A </td><td>N/A </td><td>&euro;1,028,903 </td></tr><tr><td>2012 </td><td>&euro;1,452,267 </td><td>&euro;347,350 </td><td>N/A </td><td>&euro;23,458 </td><td>N/A </td><td>&euro;1,823,075 </td></tr><tr><td>2013 </td><td>&euro;693,048 </td><td>&euro;150,946 </td><td>N/A </td><td>N/A </td><td>&euro;40,753 </td><td>&euro;884,747 </td></tr><tr><td>2014 </td><td>&euro;706,159 </td><td>&euro;601,244 </td><td>N/A </td><td>N/A </td><td>N/A </td><td>&euro;1,307,403 </td></tr><tr><td>2015 </td><td>Nil to date </td><td>Nil to date </td><td>Nil to date </td><td>Nil to date </td><td>Nil to date </td><td>Nil to date </td></tr><tr><td>Total </td><td>&euro;3,790,789 </td><td>&euro;1,189,128 </td><td>&euro;0 </td><td>&euro;23,458 </td><td>&euro;40,753 </td><td>&euro;5,044,128 </td></tr></table>There is strong and active co-operation on this and other waste management issues between the relevant enforcement authorities on both sides of the Border, involving An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Police Service of Northern Ireland and other enforcement agencies.  Given the likely origin of at least some of the material from Northern Ireland, there is a clear need to ensure that efforts to tackle the issue and support remediation measures have full cross border support.  My own Department, as part of on-going cooperation on repatriation of illegally deposited waste in Northern Ireland, has held discussions with the Northern Ireland authorities on the need to develop a mechanism for dealing with waste from cross-border diesel washings which would be factored into the overall discussions on waste repatriation. These discussions are on-going.</p><p>In relation to the pollution of water courses, the primary responsibility for ensuring prevention of water pollution rests with local authorities, which are in turn supervised by the Environmental Protection Agency for this purpose.  The Local Government (Water Pollution) Acts carry a general prohibition on the entry of any polluting matter to waters.  Any persons causing or permitting polluting matter to enter waters is liable on conviction on indictment, to a fine not exceeding &euro;15,000,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years, or both.</p><p>Recent media reports have alleged pollution discharges to waters in Northern Ireland that feed into the River Fane system, which is the source of the drinking water supply for Dundalk.  It is the responsibility of Irish Water to assess the risk of contamination to public water drinking sources and to monitor any such risks to ensure that it provides safe and secure drinking to its customers.  Following on from an EPA audit of the Cavanhill water treatment plant, Irish Water has confirmed that the necessary technical steps have been taken to protect the plant and the drinking water supply from the potential entry of pollutants including hydrocarbons.</p><p>Monaghan County Council, consistent with its environmental monitoring obligations under the Local Government (Water Pollution) Acts, has undertaken site-specific water quality monitoring and results indicate that water quality in the Fane River at the three sampled locations is not contaminated with hydrocarbons.  The Council intends to continue a comprehensive monitoring programme in the area.</p><p>As indicated previously, I have written to my counterpart in the Northern Ireland Executive, Minister Mark Durkan, to highlight again the problems being faced by border counties exposed to the consequences of environmental crime and I have signalled to him that this is an issue that I will be raising at the next meeting of the North South Ministerial Council in May.  The Council meets in the Environment Sector in order to make decisions on common policies and approaches in a cross-border context in areas such as environmental protection, pollution, water quality management and waste management and this is, I believe, the most appropriate forum to address this serious issue from a waste and water quality perspective.</p><p>The illegal deposition of waste material arising from diesel laundering activities presents the local authorities with major difficulties as the task of cleaning up the material needs to be dealt with to avoid threats to the environment.  The laundering process requires the use of chemicals such as sulphuric acid and bleaching agents and results in a waste by-product, a tar-like chemical compound or sludge, with significant potential for environmental pollution, particularly in relation to watercourses.</p><p>I believe that a complete solution to this problem must necessarily involve effective and co-ordinated enforcement of the law from both a revenue and waste management perspective. In that context, my Department continues to liaise with representatives of the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, the local authorities concerned and the EPA&rsquo;s Office of Environmental Enforcement to seek to identify more effective enforcement solutions and these engagements will continue.  This multi-agency approach whereby all of the agencies, working within their particular remit, bring their particular skills, expertise and powers to the task at hand represents the best approach to tackling such irresponsible and dangerous environmental crime.</p></reply>

It would, therefore, not be appropriate for me to comment on the proposed wind energy project referred to in the Question.  If this proposed project advances to planning application stage, members of the public can contribute to the deliberative process by making submissions to the relevant planning authority.  My Department is currently conducting a review of the 2006 Wind Energy Development Guidelines focused specifically on noise and shadow flicker. As part of this process, my Department wrote to the Department of Health in September 2013 inviting any input that they might have on the health aspects, if any, of wind farms.</p>  <p>  Preliminary feedback was received from a Deputy Chief Medical Officer (CMO) of the Department of Health on 11 November 2013, which indicated that wind turbines do not represent a threat to public health.  This feedback was based on a 2009 literature review conducted by the Australian Government&rsquo;s National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC).</p>  <p>  The Deputy CMO subsequently wrote to my Department on 11 April 2014 to advise that Australia&rsquo;s NHMRC had updated their evidence in relation to this matter.  In that letter, the Deputy CMO states &lsquo;This review again supports previous advice that there is no reliable or consistent evidence that wind farms directly cause adverse health effects in humans'. The Deputy CMO also referred to the limited number of peer reviewed articles and research in this area and that Australia&rsquo;s NHMRC may recommend further high quality research.</p>  <p>  Australia&rsquo;s NMHRC released a statement on 11 February 2015 stating that &ldquo;after careful consideration and deliberation of the body of evidence, NHMRC concludes that there is currently no consistent evidence that wind farms cause adverse health effects in humans&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to liaise with the Department of Health, particularly in relation to the findings of any further international peer reviewed research on this subject, including any implications for people with autism.  The Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources has also been made aware of this ongoing dialogue in the context of the implementation of its renewable energy policy (including wind energy).</p></reply>

However, as in the 2007-2013 programme my Department will have no role to play in the selection of individual projects at local level.</p></reply>

Statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of accommodation and related services for homeless persons rests with the housing authorities.</p><p>On 20 May 2014, the <i>Implementation Plan on the State's Response to Homelessness</i>was published in which the Government's approach to delivery on its objective of ending involuntary long-term homelessness by the end of 2016 was outlined. A copy of this plan is available on my Department's website:</p><p>.</p><p>Local authorities are responsible for the detailed planning of social housing provision based on the needs of their areas. In this case, it is a matter for Waterford City and County Council to identify the appropriate initiatives to respond to their housing need. This includes consideration by them of options to acquire available properties, as well as building, leasing and the provision of housing supports through the private rental sector. </p><p>The recently published <i>Social Housing Strategy 2020: Support, Supply and Reform</i>sets out clear, national targets to increase the supply of social housing, while Budget 2015 has provided increased funding to support these targets. My Department will work with Waterford City and County Council and other local authorities within the context of the increased funding now available, to meet the Social Housing Strategy targets for 2015 and beyond.</p><p>Successfully tackling the current homelessness issue demands that a higher priority be afforded to homeless households in the allocation of housing and accordingly I issued a Ministerial Direction to a number of local authorities, including Waterford City and County Council, on27 January 2015. The Direction to prioritise homeless households and other vulnerable groups will see at least 30% of the dwellings available for allocation over the six-month period from 27 January to 26 July 2015 to such households that had qualified for social housing support on or before 1 December 2014. </p></reply>

The elected members of a local authority have direct responsibility in law for all reserved functions of the authority, which include adopting the annual budget and authorising borrowing, and are democratically accountable for all expenditure by the local authority.    The continued deterioration of Sligo County Council&rsquo;s financial position is of serious concern to me. While it is a matter for individual local authorities to manage their own day-to-day finances in a prudent and sustainable manner, my Department is in regular consultation with the Council in relation to its financial position, including in relation to the agreement of a long term financial plan to address these issues; this process is on-going. </p>  <p>  Under the Local Government Act 2001 local authorities must obtain the consent of the appropriate Minister to borrowing, including for overdraft borrowing which requires the consent of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government. Given the nature of how local authority expenditure is funded/ recouped, it is accepted that local authorities may have recourse to overdraft from time to time as: </p>  <p>  -  capital spending by local authorities is funded in arrears by this Department and other relevant Government Departments; </p>  <p>  -  the timing of local authority income &ndash; rates, charges, rents, etc. &ndash; will not always match expenditure; and   </p>  <p>  -  local authorities cannot (in most cases) cease service provision in the event of non-payment of charges. </p>  <p>  In considering sanctioning applications for overdraft, my Department ensures that the level of overdraft sought is not excessive, the purpose for which the overdraft is sought is appropriate and that the overdraft has the approval of the elected members of the local authority (as required under section 106 of the Local Government Act 2001).   </p>  <p>  Sligo County Council had a sanctioned overdraft approval of &euro;13.5m to 31 March 2015. The Council submitted an application to my Department, accompanied by the required resolution from the Members of the Council, seeking approval of an overdraft limit of &euro;13.5m to commence with effect from 1 April 2015. This request has been sanctioned for a period of 6 months by my Department. </p></reply>

The schemes operate by guaranteeing a minimum price for renewable energy generation over a 15 year period. The technologies supported include onshore wind energy, hydroelectricity, landfill gas, waste-to-energy and biomass technologies, including anaerobic digestion. Solar PV is not one of the qualifying technologies for this scheme. Further information is available on my Department's website, <i><font color="#0000FF"> </font></i></p><p>There are tax relief based incentives available such as the Employment and Investment Incentive (EII) Scheme which allows individual investors to obtain income tax relief on investments in renewable energy in each tax year. This scheme supercedes the previous Business Expansion Scheme. It provides a minimum tax relief of 30% with an additional 11% accruing at the end of the third and final year if the business has expanded to employ a designated number of people (or if the investment was used for R&amp;amp;D). The scheme has an investment cap of &euro;750,000 and may thus be suited to small industrial renewable energy projects. A number of financial services companies offer EII Funds or portfolios to investors.</p><p>Additionally, the Accelerated Capital Allowance (ACA) scheme was introduced in 2008 and extended in Budget 2015 for a further three years. The scheme allows companies to offset the cost of investment in qualifying renewable energy generation technologies, against their tax liabilities in Year 1 rather than over a more prolonged period, thus aiding their cash flow.</p><p>Separately, my Department is currently considering the responses to the public consultation on the Green Paper on Energy. The Green Paper, <i>inter alia</i>, sought feedback on the role that alternative technologies, such as solar, could play in delivering our renewable energy ambitions. Views received will be taken into consideration in the preparation of the White Paper on Energy which will be published in September.</p><p>Given the emerging policy context and the requirements of the EU internal market for electricity, my Department will be considering the appropriateness of a new support scheme for renewable electricity, from 2016 onwards. A key component of this will be consideration of the available technologies, their cost effectiveness and the level of support required. The scheme would be subject to State Aid clearance and the initial public consultation on a new scheme will commence in the coming weeks.  </p></reply>

The Directive also requires the involvement of energy distributors and retailers in meeting this obligation</p>  <p>  In Ireland's case, achieving this target requires annual energy savings of 1,102 gigawatt hours (GWh). The Government has decided to meet this target by imposing an annual target of 550GWh on the energy industry, with additional Government measures to deliver the remaining savings required by the Directive. By splitting responsibility for the required savings between industry and Government, an appropriate balance has been struck that allows Ireland to meet its obligation at a lower cost to the consumer. </p>  <p>  To implement this obligation, Energy Efficiency Notices have issued to energy suppliers under Statutory Instrument No. 131 of 2014. These notices impose legally binding energy saving obligations on all energy suppliers that sell more than 600 gigawatt hours of energy for the years 2014-2016. Suppliers have considerable flexibility in how they seek to achieve the required energy savings. However, 75% of the required savings must be delivered in the commercial sector, a further 20% in the domestic sector, with 5% focused on customers experiencing energy poverty. </p>  <p>  The obligation encourages suppliers to offer more innovative energy service products to their customers. Developing the scope for energy consumers to manage their energy use is becoming increasingly important in the transition to a more sustainable energy system.</p>  <p>  It is my intention to publish a report on the operation of the obligation scheme later this year. This report will detail the energy savings achieved in 2014 and the costs associated with achieving those savings. It is my strong intention that this EU obligation would be achieved at minimal cost to consumers. It is up to energy suppliers to decide how they reflect any costs on consumers' bills, subject to the regulatory requirements of the Commission for Energy Regulation.  </p></reply>

While the target is not binding, implementation of a comprehensive range of measures set out in the 2012 Energy Efficiency Directive is obligatory and supports the rationale for a national energy improvement target of 20%. This target is equivalent to 31,925 Gigawatt hours (GWh) and includes a target of 33% for improvement in energy efficiency in the public sector.</p>  <p>  The National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (NEEAP) provides the policy framework for energy efficiency in Ireland and includes the measures through which the Energy Efficiency Directive is being implemented here. In April 2014 my Department submitted Ireland&rsquo;s third NEEAP to the European Commission, reporting our progress to end 2012. At that point Ireland had recorded savings of 11,419 GWh, representing 36% of our national target. That figure had risen to 14,764 GWh by end 2013, or 46%.</p>  <p>  A particular focus of my Department, in co-operation with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI), has been on the public sector target. A Public Sector Energy Efficiency Action Plan is in preparation with a view to its completion by the middle of this year. The purpose of the Action Plan is to set out the actions that each sector within the public service could take to build upon the progress made to date towards the 2020 target.</p>  <p>  Other key deliverables for Ireland's implementation of the Directive include the establishment of Ireland&rsquo;s first National Energy Efficiency Fund to provide financing for large scale energy efficiency projects in both the public and private sectors, and an Obligation Scheme for large energy suppliers requiring them to work with their customers to meet mandatory energy savings targets. The continuing delivery of the Better Energy programme by SEAI is also an important area of action. I was pleased to announce increased support levels for the Better Energy Homes scheme recently. While one in six homes in Ireland have received energy efficiency upgrades under the Better Energy programme, maintaining the momentum on domestic retrofit will remain a central priority in the coming years.   </p></reply>

In developing the electricity grid, EirGrid works to ensure that the latest Smart Grid technologies are deployed to enhance the overall efficiency and capability of the power system for the benefit of all electricity consumers.</p>  <p>  Ireland has a unique opportunity in Smart Grids. No other synchronous electricity system in the world manages the same levels of wind penetration (50%) seen today, much less the target of being able to safely and securely manage real-time penetration levels of 75% by 2020. The island of Ireland is effectively a live laboratory of Smart Grid evolution.</p>  <p>  EirGrid continues to manage the Smart Grid Innovation Hub and the demonstration projects initiative which encourage innovation in new grid applications. In 2013, it also launched a Smart Grid iPhone app which enables users to see key energy related real-time data and facilitates smart energy use decisions.</p>  <p>  In addition, EirGrid established the DS3 programme which is concerned with developing solutions to the challenges associated with increasing levels of renewable generation, particularly with regard to a secure power system operation, as we work towards achieving our 2020 renewable targets. In this regard the DS3 programme brings together many different strands, including development of financial incentives for better plant performance, and development of operational policies and system tools to use the portfolio to the best of its capabilities. Standards for wind farms and conventional plant are also being reviewed to give enhanced operational flexibility for the future.</p></reply>

I have no statutory function in relation to the connection of towns to the gas network.</p>  <p>  The CER, in 2006, approved a new network connections policy, which created the opportunity to reassess the feasibility of connecting certain towns to the gas network. In order for any town to be connected to the gas network, certain economic criteria need to be met as a prerequisite. The policy framework provides that, over a certain period, the costs of connecting the town to the network are recouped through the actual consumption of gas and the associated tariffs. This is designed to obviate against uneconomic projects which would increase costs for all gas consumers. The policy framework allows for the appraisal of a town either on its own or as part of a regional group of towns.</p>  <p>  As regards the connection of Longford to the gas network, the most recent assessment was undertaken a number of years ago. Having full regard to CER&rsquo;s network connections policy, Bord G&aacute;is Networks, and more recently Gaslink, carried out a comprehensive assessment of 39 towns not already connected to the national gas network, with detailed economic analysis based on criteria outlined in the policy. The study was published in April 2010 following approval by the CER. The Gaslink report found that 35 towns, including Longford, when appraised on an individual basis or as a group, did not qualify for connection on economic grounds.</p>  <p>  Gaslink continues to keep under review the towns which did not qualify for connection under that study, and other towns, on an ongoing basis. The key factor which would qualify a town, or group of towns, in any future review would be a significant increase in demand for natural gas, usually resulting from the addition of a new large industrial or commercial facility.</p>  <p>  The CER recently organised a consultation on a GNI submission to it on revisions to the existing network connections policy, as mentioned above. The CER is currently reviewing the submissions received during the consultation period which closed on 13 March 2015.</p></reply>

This will be achieved through a combination of commercial investments and a State led intervention in areas where commercial services will not be provided.  The commercial telecommunications sector is currently investing approximately &euro;2.5 billion in network upgrades and enhanced services with approximately 1.6 million of the 2.3 million premises in Ireland expected to have access to commercial high speed broadband services over the next two years. These very significant investments represent a step-change in the quality of broadband services available.</p><p>Last November I published a national high speed coverage map for 2016. This map is available at . The map shows Ireland with two colours, BLUE and AMBER. The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers plan to deliver high speed broadband services by end 2016. The AMBER areas on the map show the target areas for the State intervention. The website also provides information on a county by county basis with a breakdown of coverage across the townlands in every county including Longford and Westmeath.</p><p>The map can be checked to establish the precise location of individual premises or residences. Any premise within the AMBER area will be included in the State&rsquo;s intervention while any premise within the BLUE area will be serviced by commercial operators.</p></reply>

As a result, the entire route from Dublin to Athlone will be developed using canal tow paths and disused railway lines.  However, it is recognised that not all State lands lend themselves to the development of a high quality greenway proposition and, in many cases, the option to use publicly owned land is simply not available.</p>  <p>  The availability of such options was given due consideration as part of the Route Selection Process for the section of greenway from Athlone to Galway.  While the preferred route corridor for this section was announced late last year, it currently remains at design stage.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the concerns of landowners affected by the preferred route have been brought to my attention and I recently met with a number of elected representatives from the Galway region to discuss those concerns.  Following on from those discussions, I expect to meet with officials from the National Roads Authority and Galway County Council in the coming days to consider the issue further.  I hope to be in a position to bring some resolution to this matter through cooperation and negotiation with all interested parties.  While recognising that this issue must be resolved to everyone's satisfaction, I know that most people can still recognise the unquestionable value of developing a coast to coast greenway in Ireland, with all that it could offer to the regions, particularly the West.</p></reply>

At present, local authorities may use up to 15% of their initial Discretionary Grant towards Local Improvement Schemes should they wish to do so. The local contribution for these schemes is 20% of the total cost of the project.  Furthermore, it is open to local authorities to supplement the percentage of their Discretionary Grant that they can use for the LIS with their own resources.  Some local authorities want a ring-fenced LIS allocation for private roads while others prefer to put the funding into public roads. I think this decision is best made at a local level.</p></reply>

The overall budget for this grant programme in 2015 for all Councils is &euro;5.8 million and Mayo County Council has been allocated &euro;420,000 for low cost safety works.

Two calling male corncrakes were recorded, indicating that there were two or more nesting pairs in the area.</p>  <p>  The Court of Justice of the European Union made a judgement against Ireland in 2007 in case C-418/04, for failing to implement in full the EU Birds Directive. In a significant element of the judgement, the court found that Ireland had not designated sufficient special protection areas for the corncrake. </p>  <p>The Falcarragh to Meenlaragh area has long had a substantial population of this species and therefore was included in the special protection area   network. However, the population has declined in recent years. </p>  <p>The intention to designate the Falcarragh to Meenlaragh special protection area   was advertised in July 2011. Landowners were advised that they could appeal against the proposed designation of the site as a special protection area. The appeals process has two stages: a Departmental review of an objection to the proposed designation, after which landowners who receive an adverse review may opt to take their cases to the Designated Areas Appeals Advisory Board. This is an independently chaired Board which makes recommendations to me, as Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, on such cases. </p>  <p>I have no plans to review the current designation of the Falcarragh to Meenlaragh special protection area  . However, the final boundary of the site may be amended as a result of the appeals process currently in train. In this regard, I understand that some 29 appeals remain to be dealt with. There are 25 appeals before the Designated Areas Appeals Advisory Board in relation to objections by landowners to the proposed boundary of the site. The Board has also recently submitted recommendations on 4 further appeals, which I intend to consider in the near future.</p>  <p>In view of the declining numbers of the corncrake, m  y Department works with landowners, through schemes such as the National Parks and Wildlife Service Farm Plan Scheme and the Corncrake Grant Scheme, to incentivise them to manage and restore the corncrake population. The species is also included in measures under the GLAS scheme, administered by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p></reply>
