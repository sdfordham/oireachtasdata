    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-11-18a.8.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015111800072#WRA00600"><p>All reliefs, including property- and construction-related reliefs, are a cost to the Exchequer and I have previously set out this Government's tax policy basis in relation to any future tax expenditures.  It is our intention to:</p>  <p>- Support economic growth by ensuring that any increase in taxation be effected in the first instance by base broadening including through the elimination or curtailment of overly-generous, poorly targeted or otherwise unaffordable tax reliefs;</p>  <p>- Use tax reliefs only in limited circumstances where there are demonstrable market failures and where a tax-based incentive is more efficient than a direct expenditure intervention;</p>  <p>- Time-limit all tax expenditures and subject those with higher costs to ex-ante evaluation; and</p>  <p>- Conduct a regular programme of reviews of tax reliefs, engaging in public consultation as appropriate, and publish the results.   </p>  <p>  With reference to this last point I might draw the Deputy's attention to my Department's October 2015 "Report on Tax Expenditures", which was published on its website on Budget day, and which includes comprehensive tables setting out the fiscal impact of the range of tax expenditures in effect, or still having an effect, at the time.  It also incorporates the outcomes of eight reviews, five in full and three in summary, completed by or on behalf of my Department in the previous twelve months.  The Report includes data on both property and construction industry reliefs and addresses the whole issue much more comprehensively than I can do in the limited time available to me here: the Deputy will appreciate that an oral Parliamentary Question is perhaps not the best way of dealing with a question where the response is essentially tabular information.</p>  <p>  As regards any additional expenditure resulting from the recent Budget I would mention the Home Renovation Incentive which will now run until 31 December 2016. </p>  <p>  Since the introduction of the incentive, works on 28,911 properties have been notified to Revenue's HRI online system (as of 22 October 2015).  This represents more than &euro;624 million worth of works involving some 6,341 contractors.  The potential total cost to the Exchequer in respect of these properties is approximately &euro;42.5 m.  As a claim for the HRI credit can only be made in the year after works have been paid for, there was no cost to the Exchequer in 2014 (works paid for in the period from 25 October 2013 to 31 December 2013 were deemed to have been paid for in 2014).</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-11-18a.12.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015111800072#WRA00900"><p>The carrying value of NAMA loans and receivables as at 30<sup>th</sup>June 2015 was &euro;11.275 billion.  This comprises gross loans and receivables of &euro;14.7 billion and loan impairments of &euro;3.47 billion.  Further analysis on this is available in Note 14, p. 29, of NAMA's Quarterly Report and Accounts for the period to end June 2015.  These accounts are available on the NAMA website, .</p><p>I would also draw the Deputy's attention to NAMA's Annual Statement for 2016.  Under Section 53 of the NAMA Act, NAMA is required to submit a statement which sets out NAMA's proposed financial objectives for the coming year; the nature and scope of its proposed activities; its proposed policies and objectives; and proposed application of resources.  This statement was laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas in late October and is also available on NAMA's website.</p><p>As previously advised, NAMA is aiming to redeem a cumulative 80% (&euro;24 billion) of its Senior Bonds by the end of 2016 and it hopes that it will have redeemed all of its Senior Bonds by the end of 2018.  NAMA also aims to redeem its Subordinated Bonds (&euro;1.593 billion) in 2020.  These targets are predicated on conditions in the Irish market remaining favourable and on NAMA being in a position to retain specialist staff to enable it to generate the optimal financial return from the realisation of its residual portfolio.</p><p>NAMA has, to date, redeemed &euro;22.1 billion of Senior Bonds, 73% of the &euro;30.2 billion of Senior Bonds originally issued in 2010 and 2011 to acquire bank loans.  Reflecting NAMA's continued progress it has redeemed &euro;5.5 billion of Senior Bonds this year.  NAMA has made major progress in reducing the State's contingent liability through the accelerated redemption of its Government guaranteed Senior Bonds.  Since its inception, NAMA has reduced this contingent liability from &euro;30.2 billion at its peak (over 18% of GDP) to &euro;8.1 billion (4% of GDP) today.  The NAMA Chief Executive has said that NAMA remains confident that this senior debt contingent liability will be eliminated in full by 2018, two years ahead of NAMA's original strategic plan.</p><p>NAMA is ahead of schedule because of its ability to take advantage of favourable Irish market conditions since the end of 2013 to increase the flow of assets to the market.  In addition to ensuring, in accordance with Section 10 of the NAMA Act, that NAMA obtains the best achievable return for the State on its acquired bank assets, such deleveraging creates wider collateral benefits for Ireland.  NAMA's actual and planned accelerated disposal programme has been a material factor in the decision of the credit rating agencies to upgrade credit ratings for Ireland.</p><p>NAMA will continue to take advantage of current favourable market conditions to the greatest extent possible.</p><p>In addition, NAMA is committed to providing substantial funding on a commercial basis to its debtors and receivers to maximise the return that NAMA can generate on behalf of taxpayers from development assets within its portfolio.  The NAMA Board has undertaken to facilitate the timely and coherent delivery of key Grade A office, retail and residential space within the Dublin Docklands Strategic Development Zone (SDZ) and to facilitate increased residential delivery in the greater Dublin area and other locations where residential development may be commercially viable.  The Deputy will be aware, in this respect, of the recent announcement by the NAMA Board that a residential delivery target by 20,000 units on a commercial basis by end-2020 is potentially achievable through NAMA funding.  This is in addition to the 2,000 units delivered through NAMA funding to date.</p><p>NAMA is satisfied, based on current market conditions, that these commercial and residential delivery programmes can be funded without compromising its debt redemption targets and without impacting upon its upper-end projected terminal surplus of &euro;1.75 billion.  </p><p>It is too early to speculate as to what date in the future NAMA will have made sufficient progress on its objectives, including its SDZ and residential delivery funding programmes, as to warrant consideration of its dissolution.  As outlined above, the timeline for full bond redemptions are not expected to be affected by these programmes.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-11-18a.15.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015111800072#WRA01100"><p>Once finalised the proposed Capital Reorganisation of AIB will allow for the redemption of &euro;1.36 billion of the State's Preference Shares for &euro;1.7 billion in cash.  The State will convert its remaining Preference Shares (&euro;2.14 billion nominal) into &euro;2.67 billion of ordinary shares at a price to be agreed with AIB.  The cumulative effect of these measures, along with the expected issuance by the bank of Tier 2 and AT1 instruments, will provide AIB with a strong, market-facing capital structure and will facilitate the first significant return of capital to the State by AIB.</p>  <p>  In relation to other moneys expected to be recouped in the coming years, the conversion of a portion of the Preference Shares fast tracks the bank's ability to remunerate and redeem State aid through the bank's own cashflow and also opens up the possibility of the State monetising some of its equity investment through a sale process in the future.  While the conversion and redemption will bring to an end the annual payment of dividends on the Preference Shares it is important to note that the State will retain 99.8% ownership of AIB into the future.  Following this capital reorganisation I am confident that the bank will be capable of resuming ordinary dividends in the future helping to replace this lost income.  The future payment of these dividends is a matter for the Board of AIB and its regulator and given the fiduciary and regulatory obligations involved, I cannot be specific about the exact timing and quantum that might be involved.</p>  <p>  As I stated in my Budget 2016 speech, the proceeds from the sale and redemption of the State's investments in the banks will be used to reduce the general government debt.  However, any proceeds received beyond the lifetime of this Government, will be a matter for the next Government.</p>  <p>  The receipt of these monies will benefit the Exchequer, reduce the Exchequer Borrowing Requirement and result in debt reduction.  In this regard I would stress the importance of continuing to reduce Ireland's debt ratio over the medium term to ensure market confidence in Ireland and rebuild our fiscal capacity. </p>  <p>  The State also holds &euro;1.6 billion of contingent convertible capital notes (CoCos) in AIB which were issued on 26 July 2011 with a maturity date of 28 July 2016.  It is expected that the full value of the notes will be returned to the State by the bank on the maturity date.  This has been included in the baseline budgetary figures for Budget 2016.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that National Debt is the net debt incurred by the Exchequer after taking account of cash and other financial assets, while general government debt (GGD) is a measure of the total gross consolidated debt of the State compiled by the Central Statistics Office (CSO).  This is the measure used for comparative purposes across the European Union.  </p>  <p>  The redemption of &euro;1.36 billion of the State's Preference Shares for &euro;1.7 billion in cash, is expected to be received in the coming months.  Assuming all other things being equal, the general government debt will reduce by the &euro;1.7 billion in the year in which the cash is received.  Ceteris paribus, this would reduce the debt to GDP ratio by c. 0.75% of GDP. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-11-18a.18.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015111800072#WRA01300"><p>Corporation Tax receipts have been unexpectedly strong in 2015.  At end-October receipts were just under 74% higher than expected and up by over 60% in year-on-year terms.  </p>  <p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the over-performance is a result of a combination reasons and that the improvement is relatively broad based with improved receipts in other sectors and sized firms.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, CT receipts in Ireland are highly concentrated with a high proportion of receipts coming from the multinational sector.  The Department of Finance published a paper (prepared by the Revenue Commissioners) last year on this point. </p>  <p>  The Revenue Commissioners have advised that about half of the increase in CT receipts in 2015 is from a small number of large multinationals and is attributable to a variety of reasons including improved trading conditions, positive currency fluctuations, some timing factors and a number of one-off payments.  </p>  <p>  Although CT is concentrated in the multinationals sector, it is important to point out that the improvement is relatively broad based.  In this regard, I am further advised by the Revenue Commissioners that there has been an increase in the number of companies paying between &euro;100,000 and &euro;5 million up to the end of October this year by 20% when compared with the same period last year.  This is reflected in the receipts which were also up by over 20% from this category.    </p>  <p>  I was very clear last year that the change made to the company residence rules would not, of itself, raise any additional Irish Corporation Tax ('CT').  This change only materially affects companies that typically did not have any substantive Irish operations themselves as their only link with Ireland was the 'label of incorporation', and they therefore are not viewed as Irish for tax purposes.  Such non-resident companies were already taxable in Ireland in respect of any activities undertaken in Ireland through a branch or agency and it was not expected that this would change.  </p>  <p>  The Knowledge Development Box (or 'KDB') is contained in the Finance Bill that is currently at Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il.  It will not come into effect until 1 January 2016, so the first impact on CT receipts would not be expected until 2016 and, as per the analysis published by my Department on Budget day, the KDB is expected to result in less CT being paid. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-11-18a.21.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015111800072#WRA01500"><p>The Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012 (the "2012 Act") was signed into law by the President in December 2012. </p>  <p>  It was agreed at that time that it would be neither practical nor feasible to commence the 2012 Act in its entirety in one fell swoop.  Following on from that, an implementation timetable for the 2012 Act was devised in consultation with stakeholders, including credit union representative bodies. </p>  <p>  Commencement of all sections of the 2012 Act has been aligned with the credit union financial year and the introduction of the underpinning Central Bank regulations, with a view to implementation of the 2012 Act in a coherent and cohesive manner.  This has provided credit unions with the time necessary to ensure that the required processes and procedures are in place prior to implementation of each tranche.</p>  <p>  I have met with the three credit union representative bodies and the perceived impact of the new regulations was discussed.  It is my intention to commence the remaining sections of the 2012 Act on 31 December 2015 in line with the introduction of the regulations by the Registrar of Credit Unions.  These sections of the 2012 Act, when commenced, will replace, amend or supplement existing sections of the 1997 Act. </p>  <p>  As outlined in the Central Bank's feedback statement on CP88, as part of the consultation process I proposed that in the interests of clarity and fairness, credit unions are provided with details of the process of applying for a retention of savings above the limit amount.  I have been informed by the Registry of Credit Unions that all credit unions have been contacted giving further information on its application criteria for the retention of savings in excess of &euro;100,000.  The Registry of Credit Unions intends to engage with the representative bodies and to invite comments from them prior to finalisation of the application process. When the application process is finalised, the Registry will provide an application form and explanatory notes in order to assist credit unions.  It is anticipated that application forms will be available during December 2015.  It is envisaged that applications will be accepted in the first quarter of 2016 and that applicant credit unions will be informed by the end of the second quarter of 2016 on the outcome of the process, which is well within the 12 month transitional period.  Where a credit union has demonstrated that it meets the criteria, it will be in a position to retain members' savings in excess of &euro;100,000 held at the commencement of the regulations. </p>  <p>  I welcome the steps that have been taken to provide clarity for credit unions on the criteria for the retention of savings over &euro;100,000 and also welcome the Central Bank proposed engagement with the representative bodies to seek their comments on the application process.  </p>  <p>  The Central Bank has also informed me that it is committed to undertaking a review of the continued appropriateness of the savings limit, once the impact of the restructuring process can be assessed.  It is envisaged that this review will commence within three years of the introduction of the regulations.  My officials have asked the Central Bank to consider accelerating this review and this is under consideration by the Central Bank.  The Central Bank has agreed to provide regular updates to my Department on developments in this matter. </p>  <p>  The Central Bank has further informed me that it has now contacted all credit unions inviting them to attend upcoming information seminars being held around the country from mid-November to end-November.  These seminars will provide credit unions with the opportunity to engage with the Central Bank on the new regulations and to discuss development of the credit union business model, including any changes to the regulatory framework that might be required to facilitate those developments.  </p>  <p>  The Government's priorities remain the protection of members' savings, the financial stability of credit unions and the sector overall and it is absolutely determined to continue to support a strengthened and growing credit union movement.</p></reply>

He also made a number of suggestions for domestic policy which could bring greater stability to the operating environment for general insurance in Ireland.  Neither the reports from the Governor nor from the international bodies referred to the regulatory model for insurance as a source of difficulty. </p>  <p>  The question of the cost of insurance is a complex one involving a number of  Government Departments, State Bodies and private sector organisations.  The EU regulatory framework for insurance expressly prohibits Member States setting insurance premiums.  However, this does not preclude the Government from introducing measures that may, in the longer term, lead to a better claims environment that would facilitate a reduction in claims costs.</p>  <p>  I have asked officials in my Department to examine the issues being raised from multiple parties regarding the cost of insurance.  This process has already resulted in engagement with a number of parties, both public and private, and it will continue over the coming months.</p></reply>

The approved reorganisation involves a number of elements including a redemption of the State's Preference Shares to the value of &euro;1.7 billion in cash, as well as converting the remaining Preference Shares into Ordinary equity.  The reorganisation will generate a substantial return of capital for the taxpayer and starts the process of the bank repaying the State for its substantial support. </p>  <p>  The reorganisation which involves the removal of non-standard instruments from the bank's balance sheet is a mutually beneficial arrangement.  It allows the State to begin monetising its investment in the bank while allowing AIB make clear progress in its journey towards re-emerging as a competitive, investable bank.</p>  <p>  Between 2009 and 2011 the State invested &euro;20.8 billion in AIB, including investments in EBS which AIB acquired. I believe that, over the course of time, the State will be able to recoup all of that investment through interest, dividends, fees and, ultimately, the sale of our shares. </p>  <p>  As I have previously indicated, all capital returned from the State's investments in the Irish banks, will be used to reduce the national debt.  This is the prudent course of action, it reduces our ongoing borrowing costs and ensures the future strength and stability of our economy.  I have also indicated that while the Capital Reorganisation begins the process of the bank repaying the State aid it was granted, any decision to sell shares in the bank is a matter for the next Government.  Officials in my Department will however continue to work with the bank in the coming months to ensure that the next Government has optionality in this regard.</p>  <p>  On the second part of the Deputy's question, I would broadly agree with the views expressed by the outgoing Governor of the Central Bank regarding the lack of competition.  The Irish banking and financial services sector would benefit from increased competition, though we have made some progress in this regard through initiatives such as the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI), which facilitates competitive loans for Irish industry.  I would anticipate competition in the sector will continue to improve, driven by domestic or international institutions as the economy recovers, the housing sector normalises and demand for new business investment expands.</p>  <p>  While the dynamics of competition naturally affect the performance and profitability of AIB, this is true of any business.  The competitive environment is only one of many factors that influence the value of AIB and it will be up the next Government to decide on the appropriate timing of any sale of shares in the bank.</p></reply>

This is due to the fact that is classified as a 'financial transaction' whereby it is essentially the exchange of one form of asset (shares, equities, loans) for another kind (cash). Consequently, the sale of any shareholding in Allied Irish Bank (AIB) would not count as general government revenue but any additional spending would be supplementary to existing expenditure projections.  Therefore, there will not be increased capacity to spend on capital projects as a result of the sale of shares in AIB without affecting the general government balance. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that as part of Budget 2016 a capital plan for the period 2016-2021 was prepared by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and published by the Government.  Compliance with the fiscal rules that apply to Ireland under the preventive arm of the Stability and Growth Pact was taken into account in the formulation of the capital plan.</p>  <p>  However, while not improving the deficit cash proceeds arising from the sale of AIB shares would result in a reduced requirement for Exchequer borrowing which ultimately results in lower debt.  A lower debt level is not only beneficial in terms of the fiscal sustainability of the State but would also lead to reduced interest payments in future years.  The strategy of reducing the National debt is consistent with the Government policy of repaying the borrowing previously undertaken to finance the bailout of the banking sector during the financial crisis.</p>  <p>  In summary, therefore, my strong view is that public indebtedness rose partly due to the recapitalisation of the Banks; the appropriate way of treating one-off revenue from divesting the State of its banking assets is to use these proceeds towards debt reduction.</p></reply>

To my knowledge, there has been no suggestion of any wrongdoing on the part of NAMA or Cerberus in relation to any aspect of the Project Eagle sale transaction.  Accordingly, I cannot see why NAMA should not proceed with its intention of completing the sale of the Project Arrow portfolio to Cerberus, which, I understand, has submitted the highest bid.  I also note reports that Cerberus has been successful in their recent bid to acquire a major loan portfolio in the UK from a UK Government agency.</p></reply>

The NTMA keeps the suite of State Savings products and the interest rates paid on them under constant review to ensure that the products remain competitive and attractive to savers.  These products have been an important and dependable component of Government borrowing for many years and make a valuable contribution to the national finances. </p><p>There are also possibilities in place for people interested in investing in longer-term Government bonds.  Irish sovereign bonds are available through Primary Dealers recognised by the NTMA.  The NTMA has published information on its website () which gives the names and contact details for institutions which sell bonds to the public, and the fees they charge.</p><p>It also important to remember that any funding available from using savings would not be 'off balance sheet' in General Government terms and there is no fiscal space for any additional expenditure/investment 'on-balance sheet' without equivalent spending cuts or tax increases.</p><p>In terms of 'off-balance sheet' investment, there is currently no shortage of available funding for good projects of a commercial nature - the ISIF/SIB, the Connectivity Fund, the Strategic Housing Fund, the EFSI, etc., are all available to support such projects on a commercial basis. </p><p>I would like to draw the Deputy's attention to the recently announced joint venture between the Ireland Strategic Infrastructure Fund (ISIF) and KKR Credit.  The joint venture, named &quot;Activate Capital&quot; will invest in the development and construction of housing, with &euro;500 million of financing, which will assist in normalising the sector and addressing the housing shortfall.  The venture will be a &euro;500 million vehicle and will be financed through a &euro;325 million investment from the ISIF (its biggest single investment to date) and &euro;175 million investment from KKR.  This is good news for jobs, growth, potential house purchasers, and the construction sector.  This joint venture will be an important source of funding for increasing the supply of medium to large housing developments. </p><p>The ISIF also recently announced an investment mandate with US-based Quadrant Real Estate Advisers which will provide &euro;100 million in financing for high-quality office development and construction projects in Ireland.  It is anticipated that the investment will accelerate the delivery of urgently required prime office space, thereby improving the attractiveness of Ireland for foreign direct investment (FDI).

The REIT framework is designed to produce an after-tax result for shareholders similar to that from direct investment in property, while also providing the benefits of risk diversification and professional management associated with collective investment. </p>  <p>  The acquisition and management of properties by professional REITs is part of a more sustainable, long-term property rental market for both investors and property tenants.  While commercial property investment has been a key focus for some of the REITs launched to date in Ireland, residential property also forms part of the sector's interest and exposure.  It is expected that the sector will continue to develop over time and in so doing to increase the supply of professionally managed, good quality, secure and affordable rented accommodation.</p>  <p>  Historically the private rented sector in Ireland was characterised by small-scale landlords.  The double layer of taxation had tended to result in individual investors holding individual, highly-mortgaged properties.  This had exposed investors to significant risk in times of falling equity and falling rental returns.  Attracting large-scale investment in professionally managed residential property has an important role to play in helping to deliver the professional high-standard sector that tenants deserve.</p>  <p>  The success of REITs has resulted in benefits on a number of fronts.  They have brought new capital into the Irish property market; new listings to the Irish Stock Exchange; and a new risk-diversified property investment option for investors. </p></reply>

I published the report on Budget day and announced in my 2016 Budget statement that I would  be making a proposal to Government to postpone the revaluation date for the Local Property Tax from 2016 to 2019.  This is one of the recommendations in Dr. Thornhill's report.  The postponement of the revaluation date means that home owners will not be faced with significant increases in their LPT in 2017 as a result of increased property values and it gives sufficient time for the other recommendations to be considered in full.  Work on the necessary legislative amendments is under way and I hope to introduce them to the Oireachtas in the near future.  These legislative provisions will also give effect to two of the recommendations in the report in relation to changed approaches to the implementation of the pyrite exemption from LPT, and reliefs from LPT in respect of properties occupied by persons with disabilities, both of which are being implemented on an administrative basis by the Revenue Commissioners at my request.</p></reply>

To put this performance into perspective, as well as being the fastest growing economy in Europe in 2014, the European Commission expects Ireland to be the fastest growing economy in Europe again this year and also in 2016. </p>  <p>  Importantly, economic growth is now better balanced with exports and domestic demand making a strong positive contribution to growth.  Growing employment and rising household incomes are supporting an increase in private consumption the sacrifices made over recent years are now paying dividends. </p>  <p>  Over the medium term, my Department expects that the Irish economy can grow by around 3 per cent per annum on a sustainable basis.  Achieving these growth rates is contingent upon many factors including continued improvements in our cost competitiveness and trading partner growth. </p>  <p>  In that regard, the gains in Irish competitiveness achieved since 2008 have been hard-won through productivity improvements, wage and price moderation. </p>  <p>  It is vitally important that this competitiveness is preserved and continues to support growth.  We must also be cognisant that recent favourable exchange rate movements and gains from the fall in oil prices may unwind in the future.  Therefore, we need to stay focused on continuing to improve Ireland's competitiveness through other channels such as wage restraint and productivity improvements.</p>  <p>  As a key market for Irish exports, it is in all our interests that economic growth in the euro area is revived and this will require a combination of monetary, fiscal and country specific structural reform policies. </p>  <p>  On the domestic front, the Government is focused on sustainable public finances, improving access to credit and reforming the income tax system.  Our capital investment plan will be used to alleviate supply-side bottlenecks and barriers to growth. </p>  <p>  In summary, I am confident that significant economic progress can be made in the years ahead but, crucially, this is contingent upon implementing appropriate polices to ensure continued, balanced economic growth, maintaining our competitiveness and ensuring that Ireland's public finances remain on a stable footing. That is exactly what the Government intends to do. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-11-18a.54.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015111800072#WRA03700"><p>In the recent Budget I introduced a range of measures aimed at ensuring that, for the second Budget in a row, every income earner who currently pays tax or USC will see an increase in their net income as a result of the Budget package.  These measures are aimed at instilling confidence among our citizens that the economic recovery is under way, which should in turn increase domestic demand and support job creation in the retail sector.  </p>  <p>  These measures include the increase in the entry threshold to the Universal Social Charge from &euro;12,012 to &euro;13,000.  In addition, I am reducing the three lowest rates of USC from 1.5%, 3.5% and 7% to 1%, 3% and 5.5% respectively, with effect from 1 January 2016.</p>  <p>  I am also introducing an Earned Income Credit to the value of &euro;550, which will be available to those with earned income who do not have access to the PAYE credit.  This will be a significant benefit to small business-owners right across the country including small retailers, publicans, farmers and tradesmen.</p>  <p>  Budget 2016 also provided for a tapered PRSI credit, to be introduced with effect from January 2016, in order to alleviate the PRSI step effect across a range of incomes.  This will bring individuals into the charge to PRSI on a more gradual basis and will ensure that many low income earners will see an improvement in their net incomes.  This will remove a disincentive for employees to supply labour in the range of incomes affected by the PRSI step, which should be of benefit to employers in terms of employee availability for work.</p>  <p>  The entry point to the top rate of employer's PRSI is also being increased by &euro;20 per week to &euro;376 per week with effect from January 2016.  This will ensure that the increase in the minimum wage does not result in the weekly income of a full-time minimum-wage worker entering into the higher rate of employer's PRSI. This will ameliorate the cost of the minimum wage increase to retail employers.  The PRSI changes are being brought forward by my colleague, the Minister for Social Protection, in the current Social Welfare Bill.</p>  <p>  In my Budget speech, I referred to a number of measures which would support retailers and other merchants by reducing costs and incentivising electronic payments.  At present, the fees retailers in Ireland face for accepting card payments are excessive.  A new EU regulation is halving interchange fees to 30 basis points for credit cards, and the corresponding fee for domestic debit cards will be halved to 10 basis points.  These changes significantly reduce the costs of accepting card payments and, combined, these reductions will save retailers an estimated &euro;36 million in fees per year.  These changes come into effect on 9 December this year.  In addition, the transaction limit on contactless payment cards was raised from &euro;15 to &euro;30 on 31 of October.  </p>  <p>  To support these EU and industry changes, I decided to abolish the stamp duty charge on debit/cash machine cards and replace it with a 12c per transaction charge for withdrawing cash from an ATM, capped at an annual maximum of &euro;2.50 or &euro;5, depending on card type.  There will be no charge for debit card transactions.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2016 I also announced also a number of measures which, while not specifically targeted at the retail sector, would be applicable there.</p>  <p>  The Employment and Investment Incentive (EII) is targeted at job creation and retention and provides tax relief for investment in qualifying SMEs.  The scheme allows an individual investor to obtain income tax relief on investments, up to a maximum of &euro;150,000 per annum.  Relief is initially available to an individual up to a maximum of 30% of the amount invested.  A further 10% tax relief is available where it has been proven that employment levels have increased at the company after 3 years or where evidence is provided that the company used the capital raised for expenditure on research and development.  Following changes made in Budget 2016, the scheme is available to the majority of small and medium-sized trading companies trading for under 7 years.  SMEs who have been operating longer than 7 years may also qualify, subject to certain conditions.</p>  <p>  Also, the three-year corporation tax relief for start-up companies under section 486C of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 is being extended to start-up companies which commence a new trade in 2016, 2017 or 2018.</p>  <p>  In addition, I announced the introduction of a new entrepreneur relief applying a lower 20% rate of capital gains tax to the disposal of qualifying business assets up to a lifetime limit of &euro;1 million of qualifying gains.  This policy is intended to encourage and reward entrepreneurial activity and associated job creation generally.</p>  <p>  Finally, I would also advise the Deputy that the recent Finance Bill includes a measure by which an employer may provide an employee with a single annual non-cash benefit to a maximum of &euro;500 without applying PAYE, PRSI and USC to that benefit.  I would expect this measure also is likely to act as a stimulus to the retail sector.</p></reply>

Therefore, the condition of a property is not relevant where the property is actually occupied as a dwelling house. </p>  <p>  Where a property is not occupied and is in such bad condition that it is not suitable for occupation as a dwelling house, it is not liable to LPT.  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that it is not possible to provide a prescriptive set of criteria that a property must meet to be treated as not suitable for occupation as a dwelling house.  As LPT is a self-assessment tax it is up to a property owner to assess whether a property is liable or not, and to assess the chargeable value of the property where it is liable.  In cases where the property owner assesses a property as non-liable due to its being unsuitable for use as a dwelling or assesses a property at a reduced value because of fire safety or other structural issues, Revenue will consider the facts and circumstances of the particular case. </p>  <p>  I have no plans to introduce an exemption along the lines suggested by the Deputy.</p></reply>

The primary claimant may, if he or she so wishes, relinquish it to a "secondary claimant" with whom the child resides for at least 100 days in the year.</p>  <p>  In relation to families living in Northern Ireland, I would draw the Deputy's attention to the fact that, in order to qualify for any credit provided for in the tax code of the State, an individual has to be within the charge to tax in the State.  A person who is resident in Northern Ireland will not, in general, have an entitlement to the tax credit in question and as a consequence will not be in a position to relinquish such a credit to any secondary claimant who may be resident in the State.</p>  <p>  In the majority of cases entitlement to the single person child carer credit is not in any way dependent on the payment of child benefit under Part 4 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act, 2005.  In allocating the SPCCC, the person who receives the child benefit payment was used as the initial indicator by the Revenue Commissioners to identify the individuals most likely to qualify for the new credit, but it is important to point out that in the majority of cases the child benefit payment is not the determining fact in deciding who can claim the new credit.  The credit will in the first place go to the person who cares for the child for most of the year.  However, subsection 2(a) of section 462B provides for the particular circumstance where a child is the subject of a court order relating to custody and under that order the child resides with each parent for an equal part of the year of assessment.  In those circumstances the subsection provides that the primary claimant is determined as the parent who is in receipt of a child benefit payment.</p>  <p>  However, as I have already noted, where the primary claimant is outside of the charge to Irish tax the question of entitlement to the credit does not arise.</p></reply>

The policies that we announced were the culmination of analysis on the part of our two Departments as well as other Departments, including the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The time taken in formulating the package reflects the complexity of the issues affecting the housing market and importance of developing effective policy interventions.</p>  <p>  The package includes a number of targeted and time-bound initiatives that seek to overcome some of the bottlenecks that are inhibiting housing supply.  Given the pressing need to tackle these problems, the set of measures included in the package will be in place by January 2016.</p>  <p>  In terms of specific actions intended to increase housing supply, the package includes:</p>  <p>- A targeted rebate of development contributions for housing supplied under certain price levels in Dublin and Cork;</p>  <p>- An agreement by the Irish Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) to examine funding for housing infrastructure on a case-by-case basis;</p>  <p>- The introduction of New National Apartment Planning Guidelines which should reduce the cost of apartment buildings in Dublin by around &euro;20,000 per unit; and</p>  <p>- A review of the operation of Strategic Development Zones to enable swifter adjustments that meet market requirements.</p>  <p>  To address the issue of rent stability, rent reviews will be extended from 12 months to 24 months for a period of 4 years.  In developing these proposals, officials were cognisant of the international evidence on the effects of rent controls and their potential impact on investment.  In this regard, the measure as set out ensures rents continue to be set by the market but will also provide a degree of rent stability for tenants in the short term as the market returns to equilibrium and housing supply increases. </p>  <p>  Another important measure contained in the package is the increase in the deduction available to landlords for mortgage interest repayments from 75% to 100% where they let to tenants in receipt of rent supplement or social housing assistance payments. </p>  <p>  This package complements those actions seeking to improve the housing market that have been implemented through Construction 2020 and the Social Housing Strategy, as well as the recent announcement by NAMA to target the delivery of 20,000 additional residential units before the end of 2020.</p></reply>

Within her independent regulatory discretion, the Registrar acts to support the prudential soundness of individual credit unions, to maintain sector stability and to protect the savings of credit union members.  As such the imposition of lending restrictions is a matter for the Registrar who recognises the need for credit unions to grow income as a requirement for sector viability and for the need for credit unions to ensure that they are in a position to grow their income from their traditional lending business.</p>  <p>  I have been informed by the Central Bank that it has been necessary to put lending restrictions in place in credit unions where there are regulatory concerns and resultant risk to members' savings.</p>  <p>  The majority of lending restrictions in place still enable credit unions to lend amounts in the range of &euro;10,000 to &euro;30,000 and the lending restrictions are reviewed on a regular basis to determine whether or not they are still set at appropriate levels. </p>  <p>  In February 2015 the Central Bank commenced a lending restriction review initiative, whereby credit unions that are subject to a lending restriction, but are satisfied that they have made the necessary improvements and have embedded these improvements in robust risk sensitive lending practices, could apply for a review of their lending restriction.</p>  <p>  The closing date for receipt of applications to review lending restrictions under this initiative was 30 September 2015.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank further informs me that 59% of applications received have been reviewed.  Of the applications which have been fully reviewed, 83% have had their lending restriction lifted and are now operating under the board's stated credit risk appetite. c.40% of credit unions that applied made their application in September.  These applications are currently under review.</p>  <p>  This review has reduced the number of credit unions with lending restrictions as currently approximately 39% of credit unions have a lending restriction compared with 52% at the start of the review process.</p>  <p>  As indicated in the Central Bank consultation paper CP88, where credit unions can demonstrate improvements in their credit risk management practices in line with strengthened regulatory framework, it is anticipated that the use of credit union specific lending restrictions as a regulatory tool will reduce over time.</p></reply>

Central Bank data for Q2 2015 which was published on 2 September 2015 shows just how much progress has been made - the number of Principal Dwelling Home mortgages (PDH) in arrears continued to fall in Q2 2015, marking the eighth consecutive quarter of decline and a 22% reduction since Q2 of last year.  PDH mortgage accounts in arrears over 90 days also continued to fall in Q2, the seventh consecutive quarterly decrease and also a reduction of 22% since Q2 2014.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Central Bank September data shows the impact that has been made when borrowers engage with their lenders.  Almost 120,000 PDH mortgages were classified as restructured at the end of June 2015 meaning that families can, by working with their financial institution, find a mechanism to make their mortgage commitments affordable.  Of these restructured accounts, 86.5% were deemed to be meeting the terms of their current restructure arrangement. </p>  <p>  However the number of accounts in arrears for more than 720 days at 38,041 remains the biggest challenge.  It is important to note, however, that the pace of increase in this category has reduced significantly in recent quarters with the increase in Q2 of this year being the smallest increase in this category to date.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware of the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA), which provides a strong consumer protection framework for co-operating borrowers to ensure that they are treated in a fair and transparent manner by their lender.  Last May the Government also announced further measures to help indebted borrowers and to increase awareness of, and access to, the Insolvency Framework.  Building on action previously taken, the measures include:</p>  <p>- Reform of the Personal Insolvency framework to give Courts the power to review, and where appropriate, to approve insolvency deals that have been rejected by creditors;</p>  <p>- Enhancement of the role of the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS).  Representatives of MABS and the Insolvency Service are now present at Court sessions to offer support and advice to borrowers who are the subject of repossession proceedings.</p>  <p>  These new measures in conjunction with schemes which are already in place such as Mortgage to Rent can assist borrowers in their efforts to agree restructure arrangements with their lenders. </p>  <p>  In conclusion, I must reiterate that active engagement by indebted borrowers with their lender is key to achieving a sustainable resolution, and I would urge borrowers in arrears, who have not already done so, to take that first step by contacting their lender directly or MABS for an independent assessment of their situation and advice on available resolution options.</p></reply>

Some of these cases may have been availing of the PAYE credit. The estimate did not take into account the ability of the credit to be fully absorbed. </p>  <p>  The figure of 111,600 provided in answer to question 254, is the estimated number of individuals expected to benefit from the Earned Income Credit as introduced in Budget 2016.  This credit was specifically designed to benefit self-employed individuals who have an active trade or profession, and who do not have access to the PAYE credit.  This is therefore a smaller subset consisting of self-employed individuals having trading or professional income taxable under Cases I, II or III of Schedule D, including proprietary directors, and who do not have another source of PAYE income. </p>  <p>  Where a person has both employment and self-employment income, a claim can be made for both credits but the maximum credit value available to each taxpayer is &euro;1,650, being the maximum value of the PAYE credit.  This is in line with the functioning of the existing PAYE credit employees who work in two different employments are not entitled to claim two PAYE credits, for example.</p>  <p>  Therefore all self-employed persons with an active trade or profession, who do not have access to the PAYE credit, should be in a position to claim the Earned Income Credit in 2016.</p></reply>

Following on from that, an implementation timetable for the 2012 Act was devised in consultation with stakeholders, including credit union representative bodies. </p>  <p>  Commencement of all sections of the 2012 Act has been aligned with the credit union financial year and the introduction of the underpinning Central Bank regulations, with a view to implementation of the 2012 Act in a coherent and cohesive manner.  This has provided credit unions with the time necessary to ensure that the required processes and procedures are in place prior to implementation of each tranche.</p>  <p>  I have met with the three credit union representative bodies and the perceived impact of the new regulations was discussed.  It is my intention to commence the remaining sections of the 2012 Act on 31 December 2015 in line with the introduction of the regulations by the Registrar of Credit Unions.  These sections of the 2012 Act, when commenced will replace, amend or supplement existing sections of the 1997 Act. </p>  <p>  As outlined in the Central Bank's feedback statement on CP88, as part of the consultation process I proposed that in the interests of clarity and fairness, credit unions are provided with details of the process of applying for a retention of savings above the limit amount of &euro;100,000.  I have been informed by the Registry of Credit Unions that all credit unions have been contacted giving further information on its application criteria for the retention of savings in excess of &euro;100,000.  The Registry of Credit Unions intends to engage with the representative bodies and to invite comments from them prior to finalisation of the application process.  When the application process is finalised, the Registry will provide an application form and explanatory notes in order to assist credit unions. It is anticipated that application forms will be available during December 2015.  It is envisaged that applications will be accepted in the first quarter of 2016 and that applicant credit unions will be informed by the end of the second quarter of 2016 on the outcome of the process, which is well within the 12 month transitional period. Where a credit union has demonstrated that it meets the criteria, it will be in a position to retain members' savings in excess of &euro;100,000 held at the commencement of the regulations. </p>  <p>  I welcome the steps that have been taken to provide clarity for credit unions on the criteria for the retention of savings over &euro;100,000 and also welcome the Central Bank proposed engagement with the representative bodies to seek their comments on the application process.  </p>  <p>  The Central Bank has also informed me that it is committed to undertaking a review of the continued appropriateness of the savings limit, once the impact of the restructuring process can be assessed. It is envisaged that this review will commence within three years of the introduction of the regulations.  My officials have asked the Central Bank to consider accelerating this review and this is under consideration by the Central Bank. The Central Bank has agreed to provide regular updates to my Department on developments in this matter.  </p>  <p>  The Central Bank has further informed me that it has contacted all credit unions inviting them to attend upcoming information seminars being held around the country from 17 to 30 November.  These seminars will provide credit unions with the opportunity to engage with the Central Bank  on the new regulations and to discuss development of the credit union business model, including any changes to the regulatory framework that might be required to facilitate those developments. </p>  <p>  The Government's priorities remain the protection of members' savings, the financial stability of credit unions and the sector overall and it is absolutely determined to continue to support a strengthened and growing credit union movement</p></reply>

In this regard, I am further advised by the Revenue Commissioners that there has been an increase of over 20 per cent in the number of companies paying between &euro;100,000 and &euro;5 million up to the end of October this year versus the same period last year.  This is reflected in the receipts which were also up by over 20 per cent from this category.</p></reply>

In September I concluded a series of follow up meetings with these banks and the reality is that the majority have put options in place to allow borrowers reduce their repayments. </p>  <p>  It is up to the individual banks themselves to advertise their rates and products but as I am sure you are aware, some banks have focussed on fixed rate offerings or rates based on loan-to-value, while others have reduced their variable rates.  I had asked the banks to provide options by which borrowers could reduce their monthly repayments and I believe options have been put in place.</p>  <p>  Obviously, it is a matter for each individual borrower to decide what suits their circumstances but I encourage borrowers to contact their bank to see what is available to them or consider moving to another bank, where possible, if the offer is not satisfactory.  For example, some fixed rates are now substantially lower than some variable rate products and therefore could result in significant savings for customers.</p>  <p>  The reality of the situation is that the majority of lenders have put options in place to allow borrowers reduce their repayments, however my Department will continue to keep the situation under review. </p>  <p>  There has been discussion in the public domain regarding whether the regulation of interest rates would lead to a reduction in mortgage costs for borrowers.  I believe that competition rather than regulation represents the best long term solution to this issue and Central Bank and ESRI research supports this position. </p>  <p>  In this regard, the Governor of the Central Bank has indicated his opposition to the administrative control of interest rates.  While he acknowledged that a reduction in bank interest rates benefit the economy at large, it was his firm belief that the introduction of administrative control on interest rates in Ireland would be bad for the country as a whole in the medium term including because of its negative effect on the entry of other banks to the market.</p>  <p>  You will also be aware that on 12 November the Central Bank published a consultation paper on proposed increased protections for variable rate mortgage customers.  This is called Consultation Paper CP98 and is available on their website.  The suggested measures fall under three broad categories:</p>  <p>  -  Lenders would be required to publish a summary statement of the factors that impact on their variable rate and the criteria and procedures that apply to setting such rates;</p>  <p>  -  On an annual basis lenders would be required to notify variable borrowers of alternative mortgage options.  They would also have to notify borrowers of these options when increasing SVR rates and provide borrowers with a link to the Competition and Consumer Protection (CCPC) website to assist borrowers who wish to switch;</p>  <p>  -  The Central Bank is consulting on increasing the notification period for variable rate increases (it is currently 30 days) and they are also consulting on a proposal to require the lender to state the reason for changing the rate.</p>  <p>  The closing date for submissions to the public consultation is 12 February 2016.</p></reply>

This is important for both our economy and the ongoing development of excellent relations between Ireland and the UK; Ireland is perhaps the Member State which would be most affected by any change in the EU/UK relationship.  It is the Government's stated position that the EU itself is stronger and more effective with the UK as a member.</p>  <p>  The UK's continuing membership within the Union is therefore a strategic objective for the Government.  In this regard, Government Departments, including my own, have been working on this matter for some time.  Under the Department of Finance/Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) research programme agreement, my Department commissioned research to be undertaken on scoping the potential economic implications on Ireland of a change in the EU/UK relationship. The research was published on 5 November and is an important contribution in deepening our understanding of the potential issues arising.

Among the exemptions are those which relate to personal information, information covered by legal privilege, records relating to parliamentary matters, information relating to law enforcement and public safety, information obtained in confidence, commercially sensitive information and information which impacts upon the financial and economic interests of the State.  In addition, certain records relating to purchasers or potential purchasers of assets or loans, market counterparties or investors or potential investors in projects, fall outside the scope of Freedom of Information, as set out in Schedule 1, Part I of the Act.</p><p>A total of 29 requests out of 97 have been refused by NAMA, according to the exemptions as set out under the Act.

Following on from that, an implementation timetable for the 2012 Act was devised in consultation with stakeholders, including credit union representative bodies.</p>  <p>  Commencement of all sections of the 2012 Act has been aligned with the credit union financial year and the introduction of the underpinning Central Bank regulations, with a view to implementation of the 2012 Act in a coherent and cohesive manner. This has provided credit unions with the time necessary to ensure that the required processes and procedures are in place prior to implementation of each tranche.</p>  <p>  I have met with the three credit union representative bodies and the perceived impact of the new regulations was discussed. It is my intention to commence the remaining sections of the 2012 Act on 31 December 2015 in line with the introduction of the regulations by the Registrar of Credit Unions. These sections of the 2012 Act, when commenced, will replace, amend or supplement existing sections of the 1997 Act.</p>  <p>  As outlined in the Central Bank's feedback statement on CP88, as part of the consultation process I proposed that in the interests of clarity and fairness, credit unions are provided with details of the process of applying for a retention of savings above the limit amount.  I have been informed by the Registry of Credit Unions that all credit unions have been contacted giving further information on its application criteria for the retention of savings in excess of &euro;100,000.  The Registry of Credit Unions intends to engage with the representative bodies and to invite comments from them prior to finalisation of the application process. When the application process is finalised, the Registry will provide an application form and explanatory notes in order to assist credit unions. It is anticipated that application forms will be available during December 2015.  It is envisaged that applications will be accepted in the first quarter of 2016 and that applicant credit unions will be informed by the end of the second quarter of 2016 on the outcome of the process, which is well within the 12 month transitional period. Where a credit union has demonstrated that it meets the criteria, it will be in a position to retain members' savings in excess of &euro;100,000 held at the commencement of the regulations. </p>  <p>  I welcome the steps that have been taken to provide clarity for credit unions on the criteria for the retention of savings over &euro;100,000 and also welcome the Central Bank proposed engagement with the representative bodies to seek their comments on the application process.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank has also informed me that it is committed to undertaking a review of the continued appropriateness of the savings limit, once the impact of the restructuring process can be assessed. It is envisaged that this review will commence within three years of the introduction of the regulations. My officials have asked the Central Bank to consider accelerating  this review and this is under consideration by the Central Bank. The Central Bank has agreed to provide regular updates to my Department on developments in this matter.  </p>  <p>  I have been informed by the Central Bank that it has been necessary to put lending restrictions in place in credit unions where there are regulatory concerns and resultant risk to members' savings. These  lending restrictions are reviewed on a regular basis to determine whether or not they are still set at appropriate levels.</p>  <p>  In February 2015 the Central Bank commenced a lending restriction review initiative, whereby credit unions that are subject to a lending restriction, but are satisfied that they have made the necessary improvements and have embedded these improvements in robust risk sensitive lending practices, could apply for a review of their lending restriction. The closing date for receipt of applications to review lending restrictions under this initiative was 30 September 2015.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank further informs me that 59% of applications received have been reviewed.  Of the applications which have been fully reviewed, 83% have had their lending restriction lifted and are now operating under the board's stated credit risk appetite. C.40% of credit unions that applied made their application in September. These applications are currently under review.</p>  <p>  This review has reduced the number of credit unions with lending restrictions as currently approximately 39% of credit unions have a lending restriction compared with 52% at the start of the review process.</p>  <p>  As indicated in the Central Bank consultation paper CP88, where credit unions can demonstrate improvements in their credit risk management practices in line with strengthened regulatory framework, it is anticipated that the use of credit union specific lending restrictions as a regulatory tool will reduce over time.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank has further informed me that it has now contacted all credit unions inviting them to attend upcoming information seminars being held around the country from 17 to 30 November. These seminars will provide credit unions with the opportunity to engage with the Central Bank  on the new regulations and to discuss development of the credit union business model, including any changes to the regulatory framework that might be required to facilitate those developments.  This engagement will also enable the Central Bank gain a better understanding of the sector's objectives regarding longer term lending, including the provision of  mortgages to members. and to review the conditions that currently apply for credit unions to be approved to extend their longer term lending limits.</p>  <p>  The Government's priorities remain the protection of members' savings, the financial stability of credit unions and the sector overall and it is absolutely determined to continue to support a strengthened and growing credit union movement.</p></reply>

Funds established under section 44 do not require the approval of the Central Bank.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank has informed me that it is supportive of such initiatives by credit unions provided they fall within the provisions of section 44. These provisions include a requirement that funds paid into such a special fund can only be paid out of the annual operating surplus of a credit union and that no funds may be paid into such a special fund unless adequate provision has been made out of the annual surplus to cover all current and contingent liabilities and to maintain proper reserves. The payment of funds into the special fund should not affect the financial stability of the credit union. In addition section 44(3) of the 1997 Act specifies that the amount of funds which may be paid out of the annual operating surplus into such special fund shall not exceed 0.5% of the value of the credit union's assets. Where an individual credit union intends to establish such a fund, the Central Bank informs me that it would expect the credit union to also take account of the need to ensure the protection of the funds of its members.</p>  <p>  While section 44 is not being replaced or amended, the remaining sections of the Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012, when commenced, will replace, amend or supplement certain existing sections of the 1997 Act which will, in effect, remove some of the requirements (including limits) that currently exist in certain sections and will provide regulation making powers to the Central Bank.</p>  <p>  The power to make regulations in relation to investments in projects of a public nature is specifically referenced in the legislation and therefore such investments could be facilitated by future regulations, where appropriate, when specific proposals are formed by the credit union sector. The Central Bank will be engaging with the credit union sector in the coming months with a view to gaining a better understanding of how credit unions want to develop their business model and to identify whether any changes are required to the regulatory framework to facilitate prudent development. The Central Bank is open to considering well thought through business proposals in this area including the type of regulations that would be required to facilitate proposals.</p>  <p>  The Government's priorities remain the protection of members' savings, the financial stability of credit unions and the sector overall and it is absolutely determined to continue to support a strengthened and growing credit union movement.</p></reply>

Prior to that there was no statutory right to repayment, though a taxpayer could sue for repayment under common law.</p>  <p>  The Minister at the time indicated that, in introducing the new arrangements, he was satisfied that they achieved the necessary balance between establishing a fair and uniform system for taxpayers while providing necessary protection for the Exchequer.</p>  <p>  At the same time, the general right of the Revenue Commissioners to raise assessments or make enquiries as respects taxpayer returns was also reduced to four years, though in certain circumstances, for example, where fraud or neglect is suspected or in the context of the application of general anti-avoidance rules, Revenue's right to enquire etc. is not time limited. Previously, the general time limit on the raising of assessments by Revenue had been ten years.</p>  <p>  The convergence of these various time limits on four years creates parity between a taxpayer's right to repayment and Revenue's powers to raise assessments.</p>  <p>  In response to recent representations on the issue I indicated that I would, without commitment, instruct my officials to examine the issue in the context of the Budget and Finance Bill process. However, in the light of this examination no change has been recommended.</p></reply>

We discussed NAMA's involvement in Northern Ireland's economy generally and the recent interest expressed in NAMA's Northern Ireland portfolio.</p>  <p>  NAMA's strategy in Northern Ireland was aimed at generating sustainable activity and transactions in the Northern Ireland property market both through orderly sales and through targeted initiatives such as vendor finance and joint ventures that were designed to overcome the lack of funding in the market and enhance the future value of Northern Ireland assets through a programme of investment funding.</p>  <p>  We also discussed how NAMA's concerns reflected the concerns of members of the Northern Ireland Executive about the negative impact "fire sales" would have on the economy.</p>  <p>  We discussed the very strong level of engagement NAMA had in Northern Ireland with all key stakeholders, which was supported by NAMA's Northern Ireland Advisory Committee.  NAMA was investing to enhance the value of its assets in Northern Ireland and had advanced significant amounts of new money into the Northern Ireland economy to assist in such projects as the construction of a new 95-unit housing development in Milmount, Dundonald, close to Belfast and to complete Lanyon Plaza and the Soloist Building which form part of a landmark office development in the centre of Belfast. This investment came at a time when there were very few other sources of funding for projects in Northern Ireland. As was also being reported in the press at the time, NAMA was working closely with local housing authorities and approved housing bodies in Northern Ireland and had recently announced the sale of over 50 apartments to Oaklee Housing Association in Belfast.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, prior to this meeting, on 24 June 2013, I had received an unsolicited expression of interest for the NAMA Northern Ireland Loan Book, via the then NI Minister for Finance Sammy Wilson, from Brown Rudnick on behalf of its client, PIMCO.</p>  <p>  The Brown Rudnick letter had suggested a semi-exclusive sales process and put forward a number of suggestions regarding the future management of the portfolio for Minister Wilson to consider.  Typically this would not be a cause for concern.  An interested party will often seek a closed or exclusive sales process because it is in their interest to remove competition and increase their chances of success.  So, while it may have been somewhat naive to suggest such an approach, it was not surprising and gave me no cause for concern as I was aware NAMA would favour conducting an open market process for any such sale.</p>  <p>  In my reply to Minister Wilson, of 25 July 2013, I advised that Brown Rudnick should approach NAMA directly with their expression of interest and clarified that NAMA would not run an exclusive process but would have to run a competitive and transparent sales process.  At that time, I also referred the letter I had received to NAMA for their information.</p>  <p>  These documents are in the public domain and are available on the Department of Finance website.</p>  <p>  Following my receipt of this letter and prior to this meeting in Stormont, NAMA also had received a third party approach on behalf of PIMCO to sell the loan portfolio on an exclusive basis.</p>  <p>  As a result of these communications, it was known to all at the meeting that an interest had been expressed on behalf of PIMCO in acquiring NAMA's Northern Ireland portfolio on an exclusive basis.</p>  <p>  During the meeting I stressed two key considerations that NAMA would have to take into account in any potential sale: process and price.  That is, NAMA would not enter into any exclusive sales process, as this would militate against achieving best value for its assets.  Rather, if a sales process was undertaken, NAMA would openly market its assets as part of a competitive process.  Furthermore, NAMA would have to be satisfied that it had achieved best value.</p>  <p>  I acknowledged that, to my knowledge, at that point in time, only one party had expressed interest in acquiring NAMA's Northern Ireland portfolio which we know was PIMCO.  I acknowledged this during the meeting as a challenge to moving forward with PIMCO's interest, pointing out that a sales process could not be undertaken with a single interested party.  As I had stated previously in my reply to Minister Wilson on 25 July 2013, a single expression of interest would present a challenge because NAMA would not launch an exclusive sales process.</p>  <p>  However, I indicated that there was likely to be a way forward if this expression of interest was credible.  It was reasonable to expect that if one party had expressed credible interest, there may be other parties who may also be interested.  I indicated that as in the past, as the result of single expressions of interest, it was open to NAMA to test the market and determine if there was sufficient interest (i.e. other interested parties) to conduct an open sales process that would maximise value.</p>  <p>  As is now well established, following the expression of interest from PIMCO, NAMA did test the market interest in its Northern Ireland loan book and ultimately appointed Lazard, a major international investment bank, in January 2014 to advise on and oversee the sales process for Project Eagle.  Based on its assessment of the market, Lazard invited eight other major global investment groups, alongside PIMCO, to participate in the process.  NAMA, in line with its well established policy on asset and loan sales, instigated a competitive market sales process in February 2014.</p>  <p>  Sales processes often emerge through reverse enquiries.  This is a normal commercial practice in any market.  After an approach is made at an attractive price, the key for NAMA is to test that by reference to an open market process, which was clearly the case in this instance.</p>  <p>  With respect to the recently published minute of this meeting taken by the Private Secretary to the First Minister, I would point out that - while not inaccurate - this was not an agreed minute of the meeting and so would not have had the benefit of comment by myself or my officials.  The minute would naturally have reflected the elements of the meeting deemed most important by the minute taker and as it is not a verbatim record of a meeting will naturally reflect the minute taker's interpretation of what was said as opposed to what may have actually been said or intended.</p>  <p>  Regarding a reference to "working together" in the minute - as I have previously outlined (PQ41 of 3 October 2013) both sides shared an understanding of the importance of NAMA to the economy in Northern Ireland and the care needed in dealings in Northern Ireland regarding NAMA's management of the portfolio.  I did not intend to imply that my administration would work with PIMCO or any other potential buyers in any way but rather I would have expressed my confidence that NAMA would be able to work with potential buyers to overcome any difficulties and I would have committed to maintaining an open dialogue between administrations to the extent that was helpful.</p>  <p>  As is on the public record, subsequent to this meeting, I discussed the progress of the sales process on a limited number of occasions with my counterparts in the Northern Ireland Executive.  Through all of these discussions, I made it clear and maintained that the commercial decisions, as always, remained solely  for NAMA.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-11-18a.205.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015111800080#WRJ01100"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 72, 75, 78, 82 and 85 together.</p>  <p>  In general, recent indicators have been positive, indicating that the recovery is strengthening in a more sustainable manner.  The latest data show that GDP increased by 6.7 per cent year-on-year in the second quarter of this year. This comes on the back of an increase of 7.2 per cent in the first quarter. As a result, GDP per capita is now above its pre-crisis peak. In Budget 2016, published in October of this year, my Department forecast that the economy would grow by 6.2 per cent in 2015 and 4.3 per cent in 2016.</p>  <p>  Importantly, the recovery is now being felt in the domestic economy with consumption up over 3 per cent in the first half of this year and investment up over 20 per cent. In fact, last year domestic demand made its strongest positive contribution to economic growth since the crisis began. This is very important as the domestic sectors are both jobs-rich and tax-rich. The external sector is also showing continuing signs of growth with exports increasing by almost 14 per cent in the first half of this year.</p>  <p>  The economic recovery is also clearly evident in the labour market where we have now had twelve successive quarters of solid annual employment growth. As a result, the unemployment rate has fallen by over 6 percentage points since its peak in early 2012.</p>  <p>  The recovery is also helping improve Ireland's credit rating. The impact of the economic and financial crisis resulted in a number of rapid downgrades to Ireland's credit rating. For example, Moody's reduced Ireland's rating from AAA to sub investment grade within 24 months. Importantly, Moody's returned Ireland to investment grade at the start of 2014 as the Government's fiscal and economic strategy began to bear fruit. 2014 also saw Standard and Poor's and Fitch increase their credit ratings to an A rating.</p>  <p>  Over the medium term, my Department expects that the economy can grow by around 3 per cent per annum on a sustainable basis. However, achieving a sustained economic recovery cannot be taken for granted and is contingent upon a number of factors including sustainable public finances, maintaining our competitiveness position and ensuring inflationary pressures remain in check over the medium term.</p>  <p>  Substantial progress has been made in terms of improving Ireland's competitiveness in recent years.  There has been a significant improvement in Ireland's economy-wide cost competitiveness. The European Commission in its autumn forecasts estimated that relative unit labour costs in Ireland fell by 1.6 per cent annually in 2015. This is one of the largest declines across all EU Member States and compares with a 0.4 per cent fall in the EU, and increases of 1.2 per cent in the UK and 0.3 per cent in the US over the same period. Competitiveness gains have been achieved through productivity improvements. In fact, according to Commission forecasts, Ireland experienced the fastest productivity growth in the EU this year.</p>  <p>  It is vitally important that this competitiveness is preserved and continues to support growth.  We must also be cognisant that recent favourable exchange rate movements and gains from the fall in oil prices may unwind in the future.  Therefore, we need to stay focused on continuing to improve Ireland's competitiveness through other channels such as wage and price restraint and productivity improvements.</p>  <p>  For instance, relatively low consumer price inflation over the last five years has meant that Irish price levels have fallen considerably relative to our euro area peers. In fact, annual HICP inflation in Ireland has been below that of the euro area average for every year since 2008.</p>  <p>  Inflationary pressures remain subdued with annual HICP inflation at 0.0 per cent to end-October. The main factor depressing inflation over the past year or so has been energy prices.  Core inflation - which strips out energy and unprocessed food - is a better indication of underlying developments in the domestic economy and has averaged 1.2 per cent over the past year.  It is anticipated that the annual rate of inflation will pick-up gradually as the domestic recovery continues, supported by quantitative easing, to rates consistent with price stability, i.e. close to but below 2 per cent, without the need for corrective action.</p>  <p>  As well as monitoring the overall performance of the economy, my Department also monitors individual sectors on an ongoing basis.  Key sectors of the economy are subject to scrutiny as part of this process and inflation is one, of many, economic indicators that is carefully analysed. My approach has been to help rebuild the economy sector-by-sector, by implementing targeted measures to support the most affected sectors. Government policy will continue to monitor for and to guard against the build-up of sectoral imbalances and to avoid over-dependence on a single sector, as was previously the case with Ireland's construction sector.</p></reply>

Over 118,500 PDH mortgage accounts were classified as restructured at end-June, reflecting a quarter-on-quarter increase in restructured accounts of 1.9 per cent,  86.3 per cent of which were deemed to be meeting the terms of their current restructure arrangement.</p>  <p>  Based on Central Bank data, mortgage accounts with no arrears now make up 87% of all mortgage accounts.  The continuing improvement in data trends shown in the Central Bank quarter 2 mortgage arrears returns are welcome and show that where there is meaningful engagement between lender and borrower, in the majority of cases an outcome that is beneficial to both parties can be reached.</p>  <p>  In addition my Department continues to monitor and publishes Mortgage Restructures data on a monthly basis that covers mortgage accounts for the six main lenders. The figures in the latest publication for September 2015 (published on 12 November 2015) show that Primary Dwelling Home (PDH) mortgage accounts in arrears continue to decline and now stand at 73,060 representing an improvement of almost 24% compared to September 2014.</p>  <p>  In conclusion, I must reiterate that active engagement by indebted borrowers with their lender is key to achieving a sustainable resolution, and I would urge borrowers in arrears, who have not already done so, to take that first step by contacting their lender directly or MABS for an independent assessment of their situation and advice on available resolution options.</p></reply>

A total of 1,500 telephone interviews were conducted with a random sample of Irish micro, small and medium SMEs. The survey shows that, when pending applications are excluded, 85% of credit applications to banks were approved or partially approved. Both AIB and Bank of Ireland have increased new lending significantly year on year. Bank of Ireland recently announced new credit approvals for Irish businesses to the end of September 2015 of &euro;3.6 billion, up c.13% on the same period last year. Permanent TSB have also recently commenced lending to SMEs. The Credit Review Office (CRO) continues to review loan applications which have been rejected by the banks and is overturning 55% of appeals. I would encourage any SME who has had a credit application declined to avail of the services of the CRO ().</p><p>The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland's (SBCI) mandate and objectives include the fostering and driving of competition in SME lending through the provision of low cost long term funding to both banks and non-bank providers of credit to SMEs.  In doing so, it seeks to facilitate the growth of smaller participants and the entry of new market participants by providing them with the low cost liquidity that will enable them to compete with the larger banks.  SBCI funding is offered on substantially the same terms and the same price to all SME credit providers that are credible, credit worthy, can meet its operational requirements and pass on the benefit of the lower cost funding to their SME clients.  This creates a new forum for competition in the use of SBCI funding between banks and non-banks and enables emerging and newly entering SME credit platforms to grow their businesses.  Over 3,200 Irish SMEs benefitted from SBCI loans in the SBCI's first seven months in operation (March to September 2015), borrowing &euro;110 million in total through AIB and Bank of Ireland. More recently, the SBCI has announced its support for two strong emerging non-bank providers of credit to SMEs with a &euro;50 million facility now up and running with Finance Ireland, a provider of leasing and hire purchase financing for vehicles and equipment and a &euro;25 million facility with Merrion Fleet, which provides vehicles and fleet management services to SMEs at a lower cost.  Furthermore the SBCI has a pipeline of new SME credit providers that it intends to bring to the market over the next six months and beyond, which will further enhance competition and support new types of finance in the market.  Further details of the SBCI's current supported products and where they may be accessed are available on its website ().</p><p>The Credit Guarantee Scheme encourages additional lending to small businesses by offering a partial Government guarantee to banks against losses on qualifying loans to eligible SMEs.  The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and my Department have worked on an amendment to the existing guarantee scheme to provide funding to SMEs whose banks are exiting the Irish market. My colleague, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, is bringing legislation to the Oireachtas which will enable the development of a more flexible Credit Guarantee Scheme with longer duration and more products and providers included.</p><p>The Microenterprise Loan Fund, administered by Microfinance Ireland, provides loans of up to &euro;25,000 to small businesses who have been refused credit by commercial banks. Microfinance Ireland works in partnership with the Local Enterprise Offices nationally to administer this fund. This scheme is currently being reviewed by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation with a view to making proposed changes to enhance its effectiveness.</p><p>With over &euro;2bn of Government supports available to small business in Ireland from over 20 Departments and Agencies, it is vital that SMEs can quickly access information on this range of supports available to them. With this in mind, the Supporting SMEs Online Tool, a cross-government initiative, was launched in May 2014. On answering 8 simple questions, the small business will receive a list of available Government supports.  The Supporting SMEs Online Tool is available at .</p><p>The Government remains committed to the SME sector and sees it as the key engine of ongoing economic growth.  Consequently the Department of Finance, working with the other relevant Departments and Agencies, will continue to monitor the availability of both bank and non-bank credit with a view to taking appropriate actions as warranted to ensure that SMEs in Ireland have the opportunity to reach their full potential in terms of growth and employment generation.  In this context, the Action Plan for Jobs 2015 includes a dedicated chapter and associated integrated set of actions to support the financing for growth in the SME sector.</p></reply>

There is no <i>de minimis</i>amount below which DIRT is not operated.  The information that deposit takers are required to return to Revenue in relation to DIRT relates only to aggregate information.  There is no requirement to distinguish in the returns between DIRT from personal deposits and other sources. Revenue is therefore not in a position to estimate the personal savings element of the DIRT returns. </p><p>As and from the 1 January 2014, DIRT is deducted at a rate of 41% on interest earned.  There are a limited number of exceptions to this rule.  Interest is exempted from DIRT mainly in the following circumstances:</p><p><b>Individuals aged 65 or older</b></p><p>An account held by an individual where the individual or his or her spouse or civil partner is aged 65 or older, and his or her total income in a year (including interest earned) is below the annual exemption limit, is exempt from DIRT.  The annual exemption limits are &euro;18,000 in the case of a single person and &euro;36,000 in the case of a married couple or civil partnership.</p><p><b>Permanently Incapacitated Individuals</b></p><p>An account held by an individual where that individual or his or her spouse or civil partner is permanently incapacitated by reason of physical or mental infirmity from maintaining himself or herself and is not liable to pay income tax because of the level of his or her income, is exempt from DIRT. </p><p><b>Companies, Pension Funds and Charities</b></p><p>DIRT is not deducted from interest paid on deposits held by companies, approved pension funds or exempt charities.</p><p><b>Non-Resident Account Holders</b></p><p>Deposit accounts where all of the interest on the deposit is beneficially owned by a person or persons resident outside the State are exempt from the application of DIRT.  However a joint account owned by an Irish resident and a foreign resident would be subject to the retention tax system.</p></reply>

To facilitate this, Government policy since 2011 has been focused on ensuring that all viable SMEs have access to an appropriate supply of credit from a diverse range of bank and non-bank sources.  Officials from my Department regularly meet representatives from the SFA, ISME and Chambers Ireland, whose membership encompasses the hotel sector, to discuss issues around access to finance.</p><p>The Central Statistics Office release &quot;Overseas Travel July-September 2015&quot; (<i></i>) shows that in the period January to September 2015, there were over 6.64 million visits to Ireland.  Overall trips to Ireland were up 12.5% in the first nine months of 2015 compared to the same period in 2014.  For the three-month period from July to September 2015, overseas trips to Ireland increased by 13.5%.</p><p>Tourism delivers income and jobs in every town and city in the country.  The reduction in VAT to 9% in the tourism sector and the abolition of the air travel tax improved Ireland's competitiveness.The 9% VAT rate is a major benefit to the tourism sector and is much sought after by other sectors in the economy.  I announced changes to the Employment and Investment Incentive scheme last year subject to compliance with European State Aid provisions.  With specific regard to the hospitality sector, I extended the inclusion of hotels, guest houses and self-catering accommodation in the scheme by a further 3 years.  The benefit of these policies can be seen in tourist numbers, new businesses, the survival of established businesses and, most of all, in employment.</p><p>Turning to the banking sector, AIB and Bank of Ireland are concentrating on growing their balance sheets.  In this context, both banks recognise the need to increase business lending and have put on record their commitment to the SME sector. </p><p>My Department has been involved in a range of initiatives to encourage access to credit for small and medium sized businesses.  The SME State Bodies Group provides a forum for the development and implementation of policy measures to enhance SMEs' access to a stable and appropriate supply of finance, and includes representation from F&aacute;ilte Ireland. </p><p>Some of the main policies introduced by this Government to encourage access to credit for small and medium businesses include:</p><p>- The Supporting SMEs Online Tool, a cross-government initiative, was launched in May 2014. On answering 8 simple questions, the small business will receive a list of available Government supports. </p><p>- The Supporting SMEs Online Tool is available at<i></i><i>.  </i></p><p>- The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland has been established as a means of ensuring that SMEs are provided with sufficient finance for growth.  In the last number of weeks the SBCI announced the first non-bank finance partnership with Finance Ireland worth &euro;50 million and the second non-bank partnership with Merrion Fleet providing an additional &euro;25 million in funding to SMEs.  Non-bank finance is a vital source of funding to a growing economy.  The SBCI has reached a significant milestone as &euro;110 million has now been drawn down by 3,200 SMEs. More information on the SBCI can be found on<i></i><i>.</i></p><p>- The Credit Guarantee Scheme encourages additional lending to small businesses by offering a partial Government guarantee to banks against losses on qualifying loans to eligible SMEs.  My colleague, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, has recently brought legislation to the Oireachtas which will enable the development of a more flexible Credit Guarantee Scheme with longer duration and more products and providers included. </p><p>- The Microenterprise Loan Fund, administered by Microfinance Ireland, provides support in the form of loans for up to &euro;25,000, available to start-up, newly established, or growing micro enterprises employing less than 10 people, with viable business propositions.  Microfinance Ireland works in partnership with the Local Enterprise Offices nationally to administer this fund ().</p><p>- The Credit Review Office helps SME or Farm borrowers who have had an application for credit of up to &euro;3 million declined or reduced by the main banks, and who feel that they have a viable business proposition.  They also examine cases where borrowers feel that the terms and conditions of their existing loan, or a new loan offer, are unfairly onerous or have been unreasonably changed to their detriment.  This is a strictly confidential process between the business, the Credit Review Office and the bank.  The Credit Reviewer John Trethowan and his team have overturned 55% of the refusals that have been appealed to the Office.  Further details are available at <i>.</i></p><p>My Department has not carried out a specific examination of the credit requirements of the tourism sector.  However, my Department and the Credit Review Office, working with the other relevant Departments and Agencies, will continue to monitor the availability of both bank and non-bank credit on both a macro and sectoral basis in order to ensure that sufficient access to finance is available to facilitate participants in the SME sector to reach their full potential in terms of growth and employment generation.  In this context, the Action Plan for Jobs 2015 includes a dedicated chapter and associated integrated set of actions to support the financing for growth in the SME sector.  </p></reply>

I have no statutory role in relation to the charges applied by credit institutions.  Section 149 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995 requires that credit institutions, prescribed credit institutions and bureaux de change must make a submission to the Central Bank if they wish to introduce any new customer charges or increase any existing customer charges in respect of certain services. Section 149 does not cover interest rates rather it applies to fees and commissions only.  The Central Bank may direct the institution not to impose the new or increased charge or it may approve the charge, or approve it at a lower level than requested by the institution.  Once approved, the bank is entitled to impose the charge.  </p><p>My Department published a report on the review of the regulation of bank fees and charges in December 2013.  This contains a detailed description of the process by which the Central Bank makes decisions on whether or not to approve proposed charges.  It is available on my Department's website at <i>.  </i>Among the key findings of the review was that while fee and commission income has become a more important source of income to the banks in recent years, net fee and commission income in Irish banks was well below the average of their European peers. </p><p>The European Communities (Payment Services) Regulations 2009 (the Payment Services Regulations) include requirements for banks and other payment institutions to provide information to the consumer about charges, interest and exchange rates on the accounts and these are reflected in the Central Bank's Consumer Protection Code 2012, which contains requirements in relation to the provision of information on charges to consumers.  The website of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) also lists the various charges imposed by the various financial institutions in Ireland for different types of transactions<i></i><i>.</i></p><p>Irish financial institutions have varying models for charges and have different regimes and conditions under which they are willing to grant transaction free banking.  Individuals' use of their bank account will be specific to each individual and I would strongly encourage people to look at this comparison site with their specific circumstances in mind in order to decide which institution offers the best product for their pattern of account usage. </p></reply>

Following this meeting, a report by the Central Bank on the factors influencing standard variable mortgage rates in Ireland was submitted to my Department and published shortly thereafter.  The report found that the current interest rates in Ireland are determined by a large number of factors including nationally specific features such as increased credit risk resulting from high levels of non-performing loans and lengthy and uncertain processes of collateral recovery, limited competition, and the constraints on bank profitability arising from legacy issues of the financial crisis, such as an increased regulatory requirement for capital. </p>  <p>  The Central Bank data in the report show that the average interest rate on outstanding loans in Ireland was close to the median across a sample of twelve euro area countries.  However, this largely reflects the composition of interest rate types in the Irish mortgage market where low interest rate tracker mortgages represent a large proportion of outstanding loans bringing down the average. </p>  <p>  The most recent data covering rates at end September 2015 was published in a Statistical Release by the Central Bank on 13 November.  They show that the rate for new floating rate loan agreements for house purchase in Ireland was 3.24% and the equivalent euro rate was 2.07%. </p>  <p>  I held meetings with senior management of the six principal mortgage lenders in May and September to discuss the issue and the banks were asked to review their rates and to provide options by which mortgage holders might be able to reduce their repayments.  Over recent months, the main lenders have announced a number of new products and initiatives that have reduced the cost of borrowing.  While nationally specific features may inhibit full convergence with European rates, a more competitive mortgage provision market will create greater consumer-focused dynamics around pricing and other terms of credit. </p></reply>

This is important for both our economy and the ongoing development of the excellent bilateral relations Ireland and the UK now enjoy; Ireland is perhaps the Member State which would be most affected by any change in the EU/UK relationship.  We also believe that the EU itself is stronger and more effective with the UK as a member.</p>  <p>  The UK's continued membership of the Union is therefore a matter of strategic importance for the Government.  In this regard, Government Departments, including my own, have been working on this matter for some time.  Under the Department of Finance/Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) research programme agreement, my Department commissioned research to be undertaken on scoping the potential economic implications on Ireland of a change in the EU/UK relationship.  The research was published on 5 November and is an important contribution in deepening our understanding of the potential issues arising.  Although the research was commissioned under the Department of Finance/ESRI research programme agreement, it is important to underline that the ESRI is an independent institution.</p>  <p>  My Department, and other Government Departments, are continuing our assessment of all the issues involved in protecting Ireland's economic interests.  However, I want to emphasise that the main focus of our work is now on examining how to support UK membership of the Union, rather than planning for its withdrawal.  In this context, the Deputy will be aware of the publication of Prime Minister Cameron's letter to the President of the European Council on 10 November 2015 in which he sets out in broad terms the changes that the UK intends seeking in the renegotiation of its membership of the EU.  We are now entering a phase of discussions at EU level, leading up to the December European Council. Ireland will be very engaged both at political and official level.</p>  <p>  Given the very preliminary stage of the discussions, and with details of the UK's proposals still to be clarified, it is too early to be definitive on specific Irish positions or to comment on what changes in the EU/UK relationship might materialise.  Our focus, for now, must be on contributing constructively to negotiations, working with EU partners to reach pragmatic solutions, while also of course protecting the economic interests of Ireland.  </p></reply>

This factory has been in operation there since 1974, providing substantial levels of employment since then, with the workforce now standing at 240 employees.  The company is proposing to seek a buyer for the site.</p>  <p>  The announcement by Roche that it is planning to exit the site and market it to alternative investors arises from a global process undertaken by the company, which is resulting in the closure of other Roche facilities in the USA, Spain and Italy. </p>  <p>  The State enterprise agencies have a strong record in finding alternative employment in facilities earmarked for closure, in particular where there is a long lead-in time which allows the site to be marketed effectively. It is of note in this case that the company has not planned any redundancies and plans to continue operation for a considerable period.  I have directed the Agencies that no effort be spared in the search for an alternative investor for this facility.</p>  <p>  I have spoken to senior executives at the company on these issues. IDA Ireland has been engaging with the company on these issues, and will continue to engage with the companies as the Agencies seek a buyer for the plant.</p>  <p>  It is encouraging that in a number of similar situations where closures have been announced, the State enterprises have been able to find alternative investors, including GSK/Stiefel in Sligo, Pfizer/Amgen in Dun Laoghaire, J&amp;J/Amneal in Tipperary. It is important also to remember stories like Talk Talk/Eishtec in Waterford and also Bausch and Lomb.</p>  <p>  I have directed the IDA to actively pursue a new buyer for the plant and they will work proactively with the company, who are also committed to seeking a buyer. The IDA will draw up a detailed prospectus with the company.  IDA will highlight the attractions of this facility for both its existing client companies and potential new investors, who may be interested in such a facility throughout its wide international network.  The gradual wind-down period will give a welcome window in which to pursue this objective. </p>  <p>  Despite some challenges in the pharma sector in recent years in Ireland,  it is worth pointing out that the sector has adapted very well to a fast changing landscape and, between 2011 and 2014  (data for 2015 is not yet available) employment numbers in Agency-supported companies in the pharmaceutical and chemical sector has actually increased by 7%.  In addition, the profile of the Irish industry has changed significantly with huge levels of investment having taken place by companies and we now have a very impressive footprint in the growing biopharmaceutical sector, in particular.  </p>  <p>  Since the launch of the National Action Plan for Jobs, we have seen 7,000 extra at work in the Mid West. This is in contract to 20,000 job losses in the previous 3 years. We have also seen the start of a strong recovery in Clare. In 2014, an additional 700 people are at work in enterprises supported by the Agencies of my Department: IDA, EI and LEO. The Live Register in Clare also fell by 10% in the past 12 months. </p>  <p>  While all regions have experienced job growth &ndash; the recovery the Government believes we can do better with dedicated Regional Enterprise Strategies.  The Mid-West Regional Action Plan which includes Counties Clare, Tipperary and Limerick, was launched last month and has a comprehensive set of proposals to drive job creation there in the years ahead. </p>  <p>  In terms of wider FDI, it is also important to remember that Ireland continues to be competitive in attracting new investment. Over 1,000 multinational corporations have chosen Ireland as their strategic European base. </p>  <p>  The Government's job creation efforts are illustrated in yesterday&rsquo;s CSO employment data which shows our unemployment rate to have fallen again, to 9.1%, with an additional 56,000 jobs having been created in the year to Q3 2015. From a regional perspective, over the last 4 years unemployment in the Mid-West region has fallen from 17% to 9.8% which is a very impressive achievement.</p></reply>

While estimates, based on satellite imagery, indicate that less than 1% of the national forest area (approximately 8,000 hectares) was affected, the damage has been particularly extensive at a local level, especially in the south and parts of the midlands where substantial quantities of timber have been blown down.A taskforce, chaired by Mr Tom Hayes TD, Minister of State, was established to assess the damage nationally and to identify the various issues arising as a result of this severe windblow event and to agree on a course of action to deal with these issues. One of the many suggested action points arising from this task force was the establishment of a Windblow Reconstitution Scheme specifically for forests damaged as a result of the winter storms of 2013/2014. Staff of the Department have been working on the specific rules of this scheme in conjunction with forestry stakeholders and a draft scheme has been finalised. A proposal to seek funding for this scheme has been made to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and we are awaiting their response.</p></reply>

This does not include the value of pollinators in terms of non-food crops and maintaining bio-diversity in the wild. The value of honey produced in Ireland in 2014 was estimated at slightly over &euro;3m.</p>  <p>  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has not conducted a study to assess the possible impact of a significant bee disease outbreak, however I fully recognise that a disease outbreak, and especially an exotic disease outbreak, could have a significant negative impact on the Irish bee population. </p>  <p>  My Department recognises the importance of maintaining and further developing a healthy honey bee population. With this in mind, the signing into law of the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 repealed the out-dated 1908 Bee Pest Prevention Act. American Foulbrood and the Small Hive Beetle are both notifiable diseases under the Notification and Control of Animal Diseases Regulations 2014 (SI No 110 of 2014). While American Foulbrood has existed in Ireland for many years the Small Hive Beetle has never been found in Ireland. In response to the 2014 outbreak of Small Hive Beetle in Italy my Department established a sentinel apiary programme earlier this year. This programme was established with the support of the Federation of Irish Beekeeping Associations and the Native Irish Honey Bee Society. Volunteer beekeepers in areas which are considered to represent greatest risk for the introduction of pests such as the Small Hive Beetle, as well as other beekeepers are participating in this programme. Over 20 beekeepers providing a representative geographical spread across the country are involved. A similar programme has also been rolled out across Northern Ireland. The sentinel apiary programme is designed with the objective of providing early notification in the event that any exotic pest or disease affecting honey bees arrives in Ireland. My Department co-ordinates the programme and has provided the equipment and guidelines to the beekeepers and also provides the diagnostic service to implement the programme.</p>  <p>  In addition, a bee diagnostic service is operated from the Teagasc laboratories at Teagasc, Oakpark in Carlow. Analysis of approximately 300 samples submitted by beekeepers each year is carried out and my Department is informed where a case of a notifiable disease is detected. Officials in my Department follow up where appropriate.</p>  <p>  The option of national action to limit or ban imports of bees must respect the primacy of EU Regulations. The EU has strict bee health certification requirements which apply to the international trade in bees. In accordance with Article 3 of Council Directive 92/65/EEC European Union Member States must not prohibit or restrict for health reasons the international movement of bees once all requirements set down in EU legislation have been met.

In view of this, earlier this year, my Department wrote to farmers who had retained PI animals stating that it was expected that some movement controls aimed at protecting the vast majority of clear herds would be introduced in the course of 2015. In June 2015, officials from my Department commenced issuing Restriction Notices to farmers who were retaining PI animals born before 2015. Having regard to the importance placed by the BVD Implementation Group on the early removal of PI animals, it was decided that the movement controls should be as restrictive as possible. In the near future, restriction notices will be issued to herdowners that are retaining PI animals born in 2015.</p>  <p>  I would like to emphasise that officials from the regional veterinary office of my Department have been in contact with the herdowner concerned by telephone several times and have also visited him with a view to resolving the issue. </p></reply>

I anticipate that it will require recommital to Committee stage in order to allow a full and considered discussion of the amendments that I intend to bring, and to allow the opposition to fully consider those amendments.</p><p>Before the Bill could be enacted, a 2013 UK Court of Appeal judgment necessitated a review of the disclosure provisions in both the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 and the Spent Convictions Bill.  This judgment in the UK Courts found that the policy of disclosure of <i>all</i>criminal convictions under the UK's vetting legislation was contrary to Article 8 of the European Convention of Human Rights.  The UK Courts found that there must be some assessment of the relevance and proportionality of offences, in particular old, minor offences. The UK Courts also found that there must be a coherence between vetting legislation and legislation dealing with spent convictions.  The Court found that the rules governing vetting or spent convictions must be sufficiently clear and understandable as to allow any person applying for vetting, or relying on spent convictions provisions, to be aware what convictions will and will not be disclosed/deemed spent. </p><p>Following the Court of Appeal Decision the Government agreed that the provisions of both the Spent Convictions Bill and the Vetting Act would both require amendment to harmonise their provisions within the principles set out in the UK Court decision. </p><p>As I have indicated in previous replies to PQs, following a very detailed review of procedures an Administrative Filter  for Garda Vetting Disclosures has been introduced, which provides that certain minor offences that are over 7 years old are no longer disclosed.<b><font color="#000080"> </font></b>This Administrative Filter already gives effect to most of the main provisions likely to be contained in the amended Act.  I would point out that under the provisions of this filter well over 80% of all convictions will no longer be disclosed and these same provisions will also apply in regard to Spent Convictions.  I should also point out that these provisions are more generous than those currently in the Spent Convictions Bill as this Administrative Filter removes the limit on the number of minor motoring and minor public order convictions that can become spent.  Since such motoring and public order convictions account for a very high proportion of all convictions in the courts this will provide a considerably more generous provision in regard to spent convictions.  Although the Administrative Filter requires disclosure of all Circuit Court Convictions where a person is applying to work with children or vulnerable adults, I should state that it is my intention that the Spent Convictions Bill will allow certain Circuit Court convictions to become spent for other purposes.</p><p>A copy of this Administrative Filter is set out.</p><p><b>Garda Vetting Procedures</b></p><p><b>Administrative Filter</b></p><p>In anticipation of the amendment and commencement of the National Vetting Bureau Act 2012, an administrative filter in respect of Garda Vetting Unit Disclosures will operate in accordance with the following procedural guidelines. </p><p><b>A. Criminal Convictions to be disclosed in all cases: </b></p><p>1) Offences Against the Person.</p><p>2) Sexual Offences</p><p>3) Convictions on indictment.</p><p><b>B. District Court Convictions which will not be disclosed: </b></p><p>1) Motoring Offences: </p><p><b>District Court</b>convictions for motoring offences will not be disclosed after 7 years even where more recent offences have been committed.  This is because it is considered that old minor motoring offences would not be relevant due to the passage of time. </p><p>2) Minor Public Order Offences: </p><p>The following convictions under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 will not be disclosed <i>if</i>the offence is over 7 years old even where more recent offences have been committed:</p><p>- Section 4 (Intoxication),</p><p>- Section 5 (Disorderly conduct),</p><p>- Section 6 (Threatening, abusive or insulting behaviour),</p><p>- Section 7 (Distribution or display of material which is offensive),</p><p>- Section 8 (Failure to comply with direction of Garda),</p><p>- Section 9 (Wilful obstruction).  </p><p>3) Other minor offences &ndash; 1 Only:</p><p>District Court<b></b>convictions for any other minor offence will not be disclosed after 7 years where the person has <b>one such offence only (excluding motoring or public order offences over 7 years old)</b>.  This provision does not apply to offences against the person or to sexual offences.</p><p><b>C. Probation Act Provisions</b></p><p>Where persons have been dealt with by a district court in accordance with the provisions of section 1(1) (i) or 1 (1) (ii) of the Probation Act 1907, the offences will not be disclosed <b>except</b>in cases where the circumstances of the offence gives rise to a bona fide concern that the person concerned may harm a child or vulnerable person. </p><p>Where persons have been dealt with by a court in accordance with section 1 (2) of the Probation Act, these will be disclosed in all cases.

It is the responsibility of the Minister for Justice and Equality to approve or refuse such applications, having regard to the circumstances of the case and the legislation.  This assessment is discharged by designated officials of my Department and is informed by medical reports and previous Court judgments in Garda Compensation Act cases.</p>  <p>  Before a decision to approve can be taken and the matter progressed to the High Court, certain conditions must be met.  The injury being claimed for must not be minor in nature, and confirmation must be received from the Garda Commissioner that the incident occurred on duty and that it was not caused as the result of wilful default or negligence on the member's part.  A full report from the Garda Chief Medical Officer is also sought, in addition to information from the applicant's legal representatives, sometimes including independent medical assessments.  Inevitably this can be a long process even in relatively simple cases.  Unfortunately  in some cases this has added to the amount of time spent processing applications before a decision to refuse or approve is made.  This matter is being addressed and the intention would be to reduce the processing time back down to normal levels over the coming months.</p>  <p>  As of end October 2015, the number of applications being assessed in my Department, that is those applications for which the necessary information has been received from the Garda authorities to allow a decision to approve or refuse to be made, was 317.  Information is awaited from the Garda authorities in another 550 or so cases.  As my Department is dependent on receiving reports from the Garda authorities, including the Garda Chief Medical Officer, before a decision to approve or refuse can be made, the years in which these applications were received varies greatly.  Computerised records are not maintained in a manner that facilitates a breakdown by the year in which each application was received and such information could only be obtained by the expenditure of a disproportionate amount of staff time and resources.</p></reply>

When a child cannot live with their parents and is received into care, it is Tusla policy to place them in care settings, preferably in foster care, as close as possible to their home and community.</p>  <p>  A very small minority of young people under 18 years of age have highly specialised needs arising from severe behavioural or other difficulties, due to their childhood experiences or in some cases as a result of injury, accident or disability. The care needs of these young people are generally met by directly provided residential services or a privately commissioned service within Ireland.  While services continue to be expanded and improved in Ireland, including the development of secure mental health facilities, there may be instances where the need for a particular specialised placement is not available here.</p>  <p>   For a small number of young people, Tusla is on occasion required to make arrangements for their placement in care and treatment facilities outside of the State, primarily in the UK, to allow for access to an individually tailored mix of care and therapeutic services and psychiatric treatment not currently available in this country. This is done on as infrequent a basis as possible and only where such placement is considered to be in the best interest of the child.  Placements where a child will be detained are made under the order and supervision of the High Court. </p>  <p>  The units in which the children are placed are inspected and regulated by their national authorities and Tusla is attentive to the standards of care delivered in these specialised units.  Tusla ensure that these placements are suitable and the child's social worker visits regularly and makes arrangements for family or carers of the child to also visit. At the end of August 2015, there were five children placed in an out of state secure placement. All five children had an allocated social worker and an up to date written care plan. There were also ten children in an out of state placement, either with relative or general foster carers, in a general residential placement and in other placements. </p>  <p>  The Department of Health has advised that the HSE is developing a new national forensic mental health service to replace the Central Mental Hospital.  A 10 bed forensic CAMHS (Child Adolescent Mental Health Service) is included as part of this development and should be operational by mid-2018. A residential setting for long-term care will not be included in this development given the lack of demand and the range of diagnosis and needs that would have to be catered for, as evidenced by the small number of children requiring such a facility currently. </p></reply>

I have recently brought legislation to the Oireachtas to put this entitlement to an aftercare plan, with some improvements to the eligibility criteria, on a statutory footing to make it an explicit duty to assess a young person's needs on leaving care.  </p>  <p>  The transition to independent adulthood can be challenging for many young people and a key factor in achieving success is ensuring that assessment, preparation and planning for leaving care begins in the years prior to leaving care and continues as part of the care planning process.  This work is based on collaboration with the young person, their carers and partner agencies to generate an aftercare plan that is specific to the individual young person's needs.</p>  <p>  The supports provided to the young person will be based on their assessed needs.  The needs of young people vary widely. Financial support is one element of this support.  Advice, guidance, support and signposting are key elements of this service and these supports are available to all care leavers.  For those young people who are not in training or education, aftercare services have a key role in providing support to them in liaising with the relevant departments and agencies in accessing financial assistance, employment opportunities, training or supporting them to return to education.</p>  <p>  Tusla became aware that a situation had evolved historically where there were uneven and different rates of financial supports being made available for young people leaving care around the country.  As part of the implementation of its national policy, Tusla addressed this inequitable approach and has introduced a Standardised National Aftercare Allowance of &euro;300 per week.  </p>  <p>  The introduction of this aftercare allowance demonstrates Tusla's commitment to an aftercare service that offers consistent supports to ensure that young people leaving care and aftercare reach their potential in adult life. Tusla is also conducting a review of other aftercare supports provided by external bodies such as supported lodgings and aftercare workers.

It is essential that all young people leaving care and provided with the type of transitional support that their individual situation requires. The most important requirements for young people leaving care are for continuity of relationships; secure, suitable accommodation as well as further education, employment or training. </p>  <p>  Overall, of the approximately 6,400 children in State care, 93% are in a foster care family placement. A sizable number of young people, on reaching 18 in foster care remain living with their foster carers, either full-time, or part-time if they leave home to continue in 3rd level education. </p>  <p>  The most vulnerable group of young people are those leaving residential care or short-term foster care placements. Children, who come into care late, in their mid to late teens, may not have developed the relationships with staff or aftercare workers that help them achieve good outcomes. Young people who do not have family support from a foster carer or family base are assisted in finding accommodation in supported lodgings, sheltered housing or independent accommodation and encourage and supported financially in furthering their training and education. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Child Care (Amendment) Bill 2015 is currently progressing through the Houses of the Oireachtas. The Bill obliges the Child and Family Agency, following as assessment of need, to prepare an aftercare plan identifying relevant aftercare supports for an eligible child or eligible young person. The legislative provisions regarding aftercare are being strengthened in response to concerns that there was insufficient focus in this area and that such planning was not taking place on a properly structured and consistent basis.</p>  <p>  The transition to independent adulthood can be challenging for many young people and a key factor in achieving success is ensuring that assessment, preparation and planning for leaving care begins in the years prior to leaving care and continues as part of the care planning process. This work is based on collaboration with the young person, their carers and partner agencies to generate an aftercare plan that is specific to the individual young person&rsquo;s needs. In instances where a young person leaving care has experienced trauma and / or a developmental delay and is not yet ready to embrace independent living, due regard will be given within the aftercare planning process to linkages with appropriate, specialist, adult services.</p>  <p>  Some young people, on leaving care, declare themselves independent of state services and are reluctant to engage. As adults, they are entitled to refuse an aftercare service if that is their wish. </p>  <p>  However, the current Bill provides that a young person may reengage with the Agency up until they are 20 years old (inclusive) to request an aftercare plan where none was previously prepared. Also, the Bill provides that the Agency shall review the operation of an aftercare plan when requested to do so by a young person (or someone acting on their behalf) where</p>  <p>  (i)  There has been a significant change in the circumstances of the young person or</p>  <p>  (ii)  The assistance being provided under the aftercare plan does not meet the need identified or</p>  <p>  (iii)  Additional support requirements for the young person have arisen.</p>  <p>  Also, it is current practice for the Child and Family Agency to continue to attempt to engage with particularly vulnerable young people and this practice will continue.</p></reply>

The most recent inspection report was published on the HIQA website on the 5th November 2015. </p>  <p>  Of the seven standards inspected in the centre, one standard was met, five required improvement and significant risk was identified in one.  Some of these risks were external to the centre and could not be mitigated completely.  The staff worked in partnership with the social work department, parents and other professionals to manage these risks.  This was effective for some of the young people but not for others. DCYA finds, on the evidence in the report, that the staff and management showed a real commitment to the young people in their care despite the challenging behaviour displayed by the young people.</p>  <p>  The HIQA inspection report raised the problem of a young person who, when discharged from Special Care, continued to put him/herself at risk. This young person continues to be cared for in the community with enhanced supports.  Tusla has also informed me that the risk taking behaviour presented by this young person has been decreasing in the last number of weeks. A young person may only be detained in a Special Care Unit by way of a High Court Order, and only for the shortest time possible. </p>  <p>  To address the lack of suitable placements, Tusla is developing a special care campus with a further ten places that it intends to bring on stream towards the end of 2016.  It is also hoped that the many initiatives developed by Tulsa including Children and Young People's Services Committees, Family Support Networks and the Meitheal approach to addressing un-met needs, together with a newly developed and targeted commissioning strategy, will ensure investment in community based services for children and young people in need will reduce the overall need for special care places over time. </p>  <p>  Many of the young people with the most specialist needs in our community based centres are linked in with Tusla&rsquo;s Assessment, Consultation and Therapy Service (ACTS) multidisciplinary therapeutic team.  Further specialist supports are also routinely made available as needed and many centres have specialist skill-sets, therapeutic modalities or links with same in their local communities to meet the varying need of the young people in their care.</p></reply>

Aftercare is provided to all eligible young people leaving care which includes advice, guidance and practical (including accommodation and financial) support. The additional needs would be taken into account when the young person is a parent. Tusla has advised that 88.5% of 18-22 years olds in aftercare at the end of March 2015 were in stable accommodation, which includes young care leavers with children.</p>  <p>  Every year, between 450 and 500 young adults leave the care of the State.  The majority of those are currently eligible for an aftercare plan.  The Government has decided to amend the legislative provisions regarding aftercare.

In other cases, funding supports are available to facilitate independent living or supported lodgings.  Additional supports are also provided by other State bodies such as young adults leaving care aged 18-24 receive a higher rate of jobseekers allowance than other job seekers of the same age.</p>  <p>  Tusla has continued to develop its aftercare service since the introduction of its National Leaving and Aftercare Policy of 2011.  The implementation of this policy has seen the introduction of new practices, including the establishment of steering groups, which are area based multidisciplinary teams who provide a forum to ensure enhanced inter-agency partnership to meet the needs of young people leaving care and aftercare, as well as the  standardisation of the aftercare allowance.

The Implementation Plan set out a series of 99 actions which addressed the recommendations and it also included additional proposals considered essential to further improve services to children in care, in detention and at risk.</p>  <p>  It was agreed that an annual report would be submitted by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs to the Oireachtas providing an update on progress made on each of the 99 recommendations contained in the Implementation Plan for a period of four years.

A care plan for each child who is received into care is required under the Child Care Regulations, 1995. The regulations stipulate that all care plans are to be reviewed and updated on a regular basis and sets out the frequency for these reviews to take place. A review of the care planned for a child under the Child Care Act 1991, as amended, is a process to monitor and review the progress of the plan and to update it if required.  A key consideration for the social worker is to consult with the child, family members, foster carers, and other people involved with the child to ensure that his or her needs are being met and that the care being provided is optimal.</p>  <p>  Children, depending on their identified need, may be placed in foster care either with relatives or general foster carers, residential care, special care or other placement types.  The majority of children are placed in long term stable placements.</p>  <p>  The latest figures from Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, indicate that, in August 2015, there were 6,345 children in care. Of these, nearly 93% are in foster care, either with relatives or a general foster placement. Of all children in care, 92% (5,857) have an allocated social worker and 90% (5,737) have a written care plan. It is known that outcomes for children in care are better when there is evidence of a careful assessment, thoughtful planning and proactive case management. All decisions made, and support provided, for children in care must be grounded in a high-quality assessment of their needs and potential risk of harm. Matching appropriate placements is key, and is achieved by the sharing of information and discussion involving all relevant professionals, the children and their families (where appropriate), and the proposed foster carers or residential centres, their families and other children in the placements. </p>  <p>  The increased budget for Tusla for 2016 should result in higher levels of children in care having an allocated social work as well as an increase in the number of written care plans.</p>  <p>  Matching carers with children and young people is outlined in the National Standards for Foster Care (2003), and the National Standards for Children&rsquo;s Residential Centres (2001) outlines the need for suitable placements in residential care.</p></reply>

From September 2016, I am expanding the ECCE programme to allow children to access free pre-school from the time they are 3 years of age until they start primary school.  There will be three intakes of eligible children during the pre-school year: children who reach the age of 3 between April and August can access the programme from September; children who reach the age of 3 between September and December can access the programme from January; and children who reach the age of 3 between January and March can access the programme from April. </p>  <p>  Under this extended programme, the number of weeks of free pre-school a child will benefit from will depend on their birth date and on the age at which they start primary school. This number ranges from 38 weeks (for children born between April and August who start school at age 4) to 88 weeks (for children born between January and March who start school at age 5).  This equates to an estimated  23 additional weeks on average. </p>  <p>  My Department estimates that the number of children benefiting from the ECCE programme will increase from 67,000 to over 127,000 in a given programme year.  </p>  <p>  The cost of this extended provision, which  includes the cost of restoring capitation rates to providers to pre-2012 levels from September 2016, is estimated to be an additional &euro;47 million in 2016. As this initiative will begin in September 2016, the total additional annual costs of this extended provision - estimated to be &euro;112 million - will not be realised in full until 2017. </p>  <p>  The cost of further extending this free pre-school provision from 38 weeks to 48 weeks (with effect from September 2016 ) in a given programme year would not be realised until 2017. This cost, which is estimated to be approximately &euro;86 million, assumes all 127,000 children expected to benefit from free pre-school in the 2016/2017 programme year receives an additional 10 weeks free pre-school. It also assumes 33 per cent of children are attending higher capitation services (as is currently the case).</p></reply>

My Department has lead responsibility for the implementation of this commitment and has concluded an intensive process of deliberation and consultation on the matter in conjunction with my Department of Health and the Department of Education and Skills (and relevant stakeholder) by bringing  forward a new model of supports to facilitate the full participation of children with a disability in the ECCE Programme.</p><p>As part of Budget 2016, I announced the necessary funding to implement the new model of ECCE supports for children with a disability.  The new model will provide supports including enhanced continuing professional development for early years practitioners; grants for equipment, appliances and minor alterations; and access to therapeutic intervention.  Funding of &euro;15m has been provided to phase these supports in during 2016.

This will increase the number of operational beds nationally to 66.Current staffing difficulties in the Eist Linn Unit in Cork has meant the closure of 8 CAMHS beds.

This is the highest level of SNA allocation that we have ever had and builds on the increases of 365 additional SNA posts provided for in last year's budget announcement and the 390 additional SNA posts announced in December 2013.  In total there has been an increase of 11.7% in SNA posts available for allocation to schools since this Government came to office.</p><p>These extra posts will ensure that the Government's policy of ensuring that every child who is assessed as needing SNA support will receive access to such support.</p><p>I also announced provision for an additional 480 Resource Teachers to take into account increased demand and demographic growth and to ensure that children can continue to have access to additional supports in school.</p><p>In addition, the NCSE has established over 150 new Special Classes in the 2015/16 school year, which means there are now over 1,000 special classes attached to mainstream schools catering for children with special educational needs.</p><p>This Government's continued investment in education will ensure that children with special educational needs can continue to participate in education and be supported in a manner appropriate to their needs.  We have been resolutely committed to protecting, and in some instances increasing, the level of investment being made to support children with special educational needs at a time when there has been a requirement to make expenditure reductions across a range of areas.

It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised.</p>  <p>  All schools were asked to apply for SNA support for the 2015/16 school year by 18th March 2015.  The NCSE also continued to accept applications after this date in recognition that enrolments may not have been completed or where assessments were not completed.</p>  <p>  The NCSE has published details of SNA allocations for schools for September 2015 on its website www.ncse.ie.  Details of SNA allocations for 2014/15 are also available on the NCSE website.</p>  <p>  The website indicates that the school in question had an allocation of 24 whole time equivalent (WTE) SNA posts in the 2014/15 school year, increasing to 28 WTE posts for the 2015/16 school year.</p>  <p>  I understand that the NCSE has recently visited the school on foot of correspondence received from the school in relation to its SNA allocation.  I have been advised that the NCSE will be in further contact with the school in this regard shortly.</p>  <p>  All schools have the contact details of their local SENO, while Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.</p></reply>

The new Programme also provides for devolved funding for additional classrooms for schools outside the plan where an immediate enrolment need has been identified, such as the appointment of an additional teacher.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Programme prioritises projects that have a major deficit of mainstream accommodation capacity for current enrolments, require major refurbishment and replacement of poor accommodation and to provide additional accommodation to meet increases in enrolments.</p>  <p>  The Programme includes 310 major school building projects where construction is expected to commence over the six year period, 2016 to 2021.</p>  <p>  The timeline for when work is expected to proceed is outlined in the announcement. Each project is listed in the year when the commencement of construction works is anticipated.  The Department will be in communication with all those schools on the programme in relation to the next steps to be taken, at the appropriate time, as the projects progress through the various stages of the architectural planning process.</p>  <p>  Details of all projects on the Six Year Construction Programme 2016 &ndash; 2021 are published on my Department's website and this will be updated regularly.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to advise the Deputy that a project for Scoil Chaitr&iacute;ona, Renmore is included in the Programme.</p></reply>

The development of new noise legislation by my Department is being considered in the context of this commitment.  However, as indicated in the Government&rsquo;s Legislation Programme published in September, it is not possible at this time to indicate when such a Bill might be published, having regard to the broad range of legislative priorities to be progressed across my Department&rsquo;s remit.  Over many years, there have been reports of low-level, low-frequency noise, which can be perceived as a hum, from various places around the world.  By its nature, low-frequency noise can be transmitted over long distances, and at low level it can be difficult to distinguish from other sources.  Reported &lsquo;hums&rsquo; have been extensively investigated in both the UK and the USA, where studies found that generally less than 10%, or even as low as 2%, of the population will experience any noise.  Generally, specific noise sources have not been identified as the origin of any particular &lsquo;hum&rsquo; and in the absence of a known noise source, no noise abatement solution or remedy can be applied.</p><p>A public information leaflet, <i>How to Make an Environmental Complaint</i>, has been prepared by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to assist members of the public by advising whom they should contact regarding environmental complaints and what details should be provided to help resolve the problem.

A number of signature events relating to women are already contained in the programme, including conferences to be held in NUI Galway and Dublin City University on the role of women in Irish political life up to the present day.  In addition, a special State ceremonial event will also be held on 8th March 2016, International Women&rsquo;s Day, in the Royal Hospital Kilmainham, which will commemorate the role played by women during 1916.   The 31 local authority plans for next year&rsquo;s centenary commemorations, launched on 8 October 2015 also contain more than 70 events and initiatives relating to women of the Rising and associated themes.

I recognise that the red deer of Killarney National Park and the surrounding area are of national conservation significance and that the subject of culling is quite emotive.  There is a significant challenge in attempting to balance the demands of agriculture, forestry and conservation with the need to ensure that deer populations occupying the same land resources are managed at sustainable levels, and in a responsible and ethical manner.</p>  <p>  Wild deer in the State are protected under the Wildlife Acts.  It should be noted that while the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department does licence hunting of Deer, my Department does not own the deer population.  They roam freely throughout the countryside and are present in many parts of the country.  My Department and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, published Deer Management in Ireland &ndash; A Framework for Action in March this year which recommends a series of actions on deer management and conservation in a number of areas including addressing the impact of deer in places where they are widespread.  An Irish Deer Management Forum has been established to implement the various actions listed in the Report.  The Forum itself comprises representatives from the main stakeholder areas such as landowners, forestry, hunting and conservation organisations as well as representatives from both Departments.</p>  <p>  My Department carries out localised annual deer counts on State lands such as in Wicklow and Killarney National Parks and I am aware that deer species are increasing in range and numbers.  Where appropriate, and depending on the annual count and instances of damage caused by deer to habitats, especially woodland, culls need to be carried out to ensure that deer populations do not reach levels that would have negative ecological consequences.</p>  <p>   With regard to Killarney National Park, every year, as part of the ongoing management of deer populations within the Park, deer numbers may need to be reduced.  It is intended to commence culling this month, once the rut has finished.  This work will be undertaken by qualified and competent National Parks and Wildlife Service personnel of my Department.  The proposed cull is no different to what has happened in previous years.  Park rangers during their normal daily duties often take spot counts of deer on the lowlands. Sika deer numbers are not out of control in the Park and are at much lower densities than can be found in Wicklow.  However the NPWS would like to further reduce the numbers of this non-native species. </p>  <p>  While, red deer numbers have not significantly increased in the uplands of the Park, low land numbers have increased and these deer are very visible.  Unfortunately, Deer cannot be herded like domestic animals so it is not possible to relocate the Deer from the lowlands to the uplands. Deer are large, mobile wild animals.  They will range over considerable areas during an average year in search of food, but herds tend to maintain loose territories which stags will defend.  There are herds on the mountains around Killarney and other herds in lower areas around the lakes. There is not enough food on the mountains alone to maintain all the animals so even if all the deer could be moved up the mountains many would quickly move back down to the lower lands to avail of the food there.</p>  <p>  With regard to the issue of roads safety, I am of the view that improving sight lines for motorists as well as improved (possibly larger) signage is likely to be the most effective measure to assist motorists in remaining vigilant when driving through areas where populations of deer can be expected. Officials from my Department have discussed this with Kerry County Council and I understand that Kerry County Council have prepared a scheme of works (which includes a number of measures including trimming back of overhanging tree branches, enhancement/relocation of road-side signs, etc.) in this regard.</p></reply>
