The Act gives primary responsibility to planning authorities, in this case Kildare County Council, to identify and protect the architectural heritage by including particular structures on the Record of Protected Structures.  </p><p>  Inclusion on the Record of Protected Structures places a duty of care on the owners and occupiers of protected structures and also gives planning authorities powers to deal with development proposals affecting them and to seek to safeguard their future.  The Curragh Camp is, of course, an operating military base of the Defence Forces.</p><p>  The Defence Forces have access to general advice and guidelines published by my Department regarding conservation and maintenance of traditional buildings. The statutory Architectural Heritage Protection Guidelines for Planning Authorities was reissued by my Department in 2011. These guidelines, which outline the general conservation principles that apply to protected structures and to historic structures in general, are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at   .   In addition, my Department has published a series of advice books offering practical advice and guidance on various aspects of maintenance of traditional buildings. This advice series is also available on my Deportment's the website.</p><p>  In relation to the wider heritage of the Curragh Camp, the Curragh Military Museum was awarded &euro;15,000 by my Department under the Local and Regional Museum Scheme 2013 towards the cost of work on the conservation and interpretation of its Chester Beatty Arms Collection. I understand that the Heritage Council, which is funded by my Department, is also supporting the Curragh Military Museum in its expressed interest in joining the Museum Standards Programme of Ireland (MSPI).   The MSPI is intended to raise the standard of care and curatorship in participating museums. The Curragh Military Museum is operated by the Defence Forces under the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Defence.</p></reply>

It specifies that the Council shall consist of a chairperson and 12 ordinary members, each of whom shall, in the opinion of the Minister, have a special interest or knowledge in relation to the arts or matters connected with the functions of the Minister or the Council under this Act. Members are appointed by the Minister for a period of 5 years.</p><p>  On 15 December last, the chair and 5 ordinary members completed their terms of office. Since that date, there have been seven members on the Arts Council. Yesterday I announced the appointment of a new Chair designate, Ms. Sheila Pratschke and five new members to the Council. In line with the procedures for such appointments, Ms. Pratschke's  position will be confirmed following appearance before the Oireachtas Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht at a date to be arranged. The five new members of the Arts Council are Dr &Eacute;imear O&rsquo;Connor, Ms Monica Spencer, Ms Miriam Dunne, Mr Brian Maguire and Ms Joan Sheehy.</p><p>The Chairperson designate, Ms Sheila Pratschke,<b></b>  was Director of Centre Culturel Irlandais in Paris from to 2007 to 2013, and is a former director of both the Tyrone Guthrie Centre from 2001 to 2007 and the Irish Film Institute. </p><p>  I was delighted to announce the new Chairperson designate and members of the Arts Council. Across the range of artforms<i>- </i>  from architecture to the visual arts - the Arts Council plays an extremely important role in supporting individual artists and arts organisations in their work. The arts sector - like every sector in Ireland - has had a challenging time in recent years. The Chairperson designate and new members have a wealth of experience which will benefit the development of the arts in Ireland into the future.</p></reply>

    <ques id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-01-29a.22.q" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1177" speakername="Denis Naughten" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014012900065#WRA01500"><p><i>16.</i> To ask the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht if he will review the content and conditions of contracts issued to turf cutters under the cessation scheme; the number of contracts issued; the numbers returned to date; the number under each compensation/relocation category; and if he will make a statement on the matter. <b>[3959/14]</b></p></ques>
    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-01-29a.23.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1046" speakername="Jimmy Deenihan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014012900065#WRA01600"><p>Under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme, three types of legal agreements have been and are being issued by my Department:</p><p>- The first is a legal agreement for qualifying turf cutters who are signing up to the annual payment of &euro;1,500, index-linked, for 15 years.</p><p>- The second is a relocation interim legal agreement for qualifying turf cutters who have expressed an interest in relocation but no relocation site is currently available for them to relocate to. This relocation interim legal agreement provides for the payment of &euro;1,500, index-linked, or a supply of 15 tonnes of cut turf per annum, while these applicants are awaiting relocation to non-designated bogs.</p><p>- The third is a relocation final legal agreement. This agreement has been issued to qualifying turf cutters where a site has been assessed as suitable for relocation and is ready, or can be made ready, for use for domestic turf cutting. </p><p>Turf cutters who sign and return the applicable legal agreement to my Department will also receive a once-off incentive payment of &euro;500. </p><p>  The interim legal agreement is required in the case of relocation sites because, for the majority of raised bog special areas of conservation, the relocation site and the terms and conditions applicable to those sites will take time to finalise. Turf cutters are being asked to sign the interim agreement on the understanding that when a relocation site is sourced, assessed and agreed, they will be asked to sign a final legal agreement at that time. If it is not possible to find a suitable relocation site - for example, for reasons of quality or quantity of turf, planning requirements, or issues in relation to the purchase or lease of a site - my Department will consult with turf cutters as to the best option to take at that time.  </p><p>  I am satisfied that the legal agreements as set out above are appropriate to the circumstances in these cases.</p><p>  It is the aim of my Department to secure a relocation site for every person who has applied for one and progress is being made in that task. However, relocation is a complex process that does take some time to deliver. The agreements being issued reflect this reality. The interim agreement is designed to give all stakeholders the time to deliver relocation options that work for turf cutters. The clear directions that I have given my officials is to examine all relocation options with a view to securing alternative cutting locations for as many turf cutters as possible within the shortest timeframe. </p><p> 1,692 legal agreements have been issued and my Department is continuing to issue agreements to qualifying applicants. Applicants have been requested to return the completed legal agreements within four months of the date of issue. 1,190 legal agreements have been returned to my Department thus far. To-date in the region of 980 once-off incentive payments of &euro;500 have been made to applicants in respect of these legal agreements. The numbers of legal agreements by type issued by and returned to my Department are not available at this time because of the priorities of my Department in administering the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-01-29a.29.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1046" speakername="Jimmy Deenihan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014012900065#WRA02100"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17, 25, 104 and 105 together.</p><p>  As Deputies will be aware, Waterways Ireland proposes to make new bye-laws which are intended to enhance its ability to manage the canals for the benefit of all canal users. There are over 14,000 registered boat owners on the seven waterways managed by Waterways Ireland. These seven waterways make a vital contribution to tourism, attracting visitors from around Ireland and from abroad.  </p><p>  The proposed bye-laws are intended to support the investment already made by Waterways Ireland in new infrastructure and facilities along the canals. That investment has made the waterways more attractive for boat owners and is helping to develop them as a vibrant recreational and tourist amenity. Given that background, it is now necessary to update the bye-laws to ensure that the rules governing use of the waterways are fit for purpose and best meet the needs of all waterway users. </p><p>  The proposed new bye-laws provide for the management of house boats, defined as a boat on the canals which is being used as the sole or principal residence of the owner or an occupant with the owner&rsquo;s permission, as well as for extended moorings and residential moorings. An Annual Houseboat Mooring Permit will be required for a houseboat not navigating or continuously cruising the canals.  The permit will allow the use of a mooring identified by Waterways Ireland on the canals where the houseboat may moor for more than five days and up to one year. It is not possible to give an accurate estimate of the total number of boat owners who will be required to take out an Annual Houseboat Mooring Permit in the event of the draft bye-laws coming into force. However, I am advised that Waterways Ireland issued 276 Combined Mooring and Passage permits in 2013 for boats to navigate on the Grand and Royal Canals. In addition, 151 Extended Mooring Permits have been issued to boat owners wishing to occupy dedicated berths on these navigations. </p><p>  The proposed bye-laws will also modernise the charging regime. There will also be further provision for the care, management, maintenance and control and the regulation of the use of the canals, moorings on the canals, and their use by the public for recreation and navigation purposes.</p><p>  The proposed new bye-laws will be introduced only after the completion of an open public consultation process, which is currently underway. The Canals Act 1986, as amended, stipulates a 21-day consultation period, which, in the present instance, ends at 3pm on 3 February 2014.  This public consultation process provides stakeholders, including boat residents and anyone who may have any concerns, with an opportunity to submit their views, opinions and written objections on the draft bye&ndash;laws to Waterways Ireland.  </p><p>  I am informed by Waterways Ireland that the main stakeholders, which include the Inland Waterway Association of Ireland, the Heritage Boat Association, the Royal Canal Amenity Group and the Irish Boat Rental Association, have been contacted individually and invited to meet with the Chief Executive and the senior management team of Waterways Ireland prior to submitting their consultation responses. This will afford these groups an opportunity to express their views, opinions and any concerns they may have regarding the proposed bye-laws.  I am also advised that all current permit holders on the Grand Canal have received individual written notice and have been given the opportunity to respond within the consultation timeframe on an individual basis.</p><p>  Following completion of the consultation process, Waterways Ireland will consider all responses and will then finalise its proposed approach. Any discussions that are necessary with Waterways Ireland will take place at that point.</p></reply>

The Government appreciates the importance of the arts, culture and the creative industries to both our society and to our economy.  The arts sector continues to offer vital opportunities for the provision of important cultural, social and employment benefits to communities throughout the country.  </p><p>  In terms of financial impact from the wider arts sector, the total direct and indirect tax revenue earned by the Exchequer in 2011 was estimated to be some &euro;336 million. The overall Gross Value Added contribution of the creative industries, which include all of the sub-sectors of the wider arts sector, was estimated at &euro;4.6 billion, which was equivalent to approximately 2.8% of Irish Gross Domestic Product during 2011.</p><p>  The conservation and promotion of our built and natural heritage also plays a major role in increasing Ireland&rsquo;s attractiveness as a tourism destination, in advancing national economic regeneration and in creating downstream opportunities, such as in the accommodation, catering and retail sectors.</p><p>  A study published by the Heritage Council in 2012 found that the historic environment is a highly significant contributor to Ireland's national economy, directly supporting almost 25,000 jobs. Including indirect and induced effects, it estimated that the historic environment sector supports upwards of 40,000 full-time equivalent employment positions in Ireland. In terms of its contribution to national income, Ireland's historic environment is estimated to account for some &euro;1.5 billion annually to the nation's Gross Value Added, with a contribution to the national economy estimated to be equivalent to 1% of total Irish GVA, and some 2% of overall employment.  In 2014 my Department&rsquo;s voted allocation will fund the activities of the Arts Council and of the Heritage Council; the expansion of access and improvement of facilities at the Department&rsquo;s National Parks and Nature Reserves and the grant-aiding of conservation of the country&rsquo;s built heritage via a number of programmes, including the <i>Built Heritage Jobs Leverage Scheme</i>  , under which a significant fund of &euro;5 million is being made available in 2014 for the repair and conservation of protected structures. All of these activities have an economic component and will help in supporting economic recovery.</p><p>  If the Deputy requires more detail on specific programmes or plans, I will, of course, be happy to provide that.</p></reply>

I wish to reiterate that once a language scheme has been confirmed by the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, in accordance with section 14(3) of the Act, it remains in force for a period of three years from the date on which it was confirmed, or until a new scheme has been confirmed, whichever is the later.  Currently, almost 200 public bodies are covered by 113 language schemes and my Department is actively engaged in the process of agreeing inaugural and subsequent schemes with a large number of public bodies. </p><p>  It is important to reiterate also that the agreement of language schemes is an ongoing process designed to improve the provision of State services in Irish over a period of time. It must be noted that the process can be challenging for public bodies, particularly having regard to current resource pressures. A range of measures to improve the effectiveness of the language scheme process is being considered in the context of the proposed Official Languages (Amendment) Bill 2014, the draft Heads of which will be submitted for Government approval in the near future.  </p></reply>

For the year 2014, the liability date is 1 November.  I would draw the Deputies attention to the fact that the 1 November liability date has been raised and responded to on several occasions in the House previously and, as far back as 27 March last year, in a reply to Question No. 110, I specifically addressed the fact that where a liable person sells their residential property between 2 November 2013 and 31 December 2013, provided that they owned the property on 1 November 2013, they will be liable to pay LPT on that property for 2014.  Furthermore, the LPT liability crystallises on the sale of a residential property and must be paid in full either in advance of the sale or must be deducted from the proceeds of the sale. This includes any LPT that has been deferred by the liable person. This is in accordance with section 126 of the Act.For a tax such as LPT to function properly, legislation must specify a liability date for the tax to have application for a particular year. Whatever date is prescribed, the question of liability when there is a change of ownership has to be managed, and I expect the LPT liability is likely to be factored in during negotiations between the parties on the sale price and the closing date of a particular contract. </p><p>  In relation to the assertion that there is an anomaly created when a property is sold between 2 November 2013 and 31 December 2013, an individual selling a property will often be purchasing another property at around the same time. While a vendor who owns a property on 1 November 2013 is liable for the 2014 LPT on that property, if s/he does not purchase another property before 1 November 2013 s/he will not be liable for the 2014 LPT on that &quot;replacement&quot; property - whoever is the owner as of 1 November 2013 will be liable.As there are a number of LPT issues to be considered when buying or selling a house, I am advised that detailed guidance on LPT issues arising in the context of the sale or transfer of a residential property was prepared by the Revenue Commissioners in consultation with the Law Society and is available since last August on the Revenue website at    and on the Law Society's website.The liability date for 2014 of 1 November 2013 is in the LPT legislation and I have no plans to change it.</p></reply>

It should not be considered as a supplementary source of income, on which the financial support of a parent depends.   </p><p>  The Commission on Taxation acknowledged that the One-Parent Family Tax Credit played a role in supporting and incentivising the labour market participation of single and widowed parents.  However, in its recommendations it concluded that the credit should be retained but that it should be allocated to the principal carer only. The restructuring of the credit will achieve such an outcome.  </p><p>  As regards the potential of this change to interfere with the level of maintenance payments, if such reasoning were to be applied, then any general tax increase, as a result of an adjustment in tax credits, rates or bands could lead to similar situations.  Ultimately, maintenance payments are a matter for parents and if necessary, the courts to decide. It is not possible, and indeed would not be appropriate, for the tax code to take account of every possible variable. However, as a result of the amendment which I brought at Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il, a primary carer can relinquish the credit such that a non-primary carer can claim it. This could be done on alternate years, should the relevant individuals agree. In such manner, both carers would have the benefit of the credit and additional standard rate band but only on alternate years. This goes some way towards achieving the result that your proposal advocates.   </p></reply>

The CCMA provides a strong consumer protection framework to ensure that borrowers struggling to keep up mortgage repayments are treated in a fair and transparent manner by their lender, and that long term resolution is sought by lenders with each of their borrowers.  </p><p>  The CCMA is a statutory Code issued under Section 117 of the Central Bank Act 1989 and lenders are required to comply with the CCMA as a matter of law.  The CCMA sets out the framework that lenders must use when dealing with borrowers in mortgage arrears<b></b>or in pre-arrears<b>. </b>  This framework is known as the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) which sets set out the steps which lenders must follow:</p><p>  Step 1: Communicate with borrower;Step 2: Gather financial information;Step 3: Assess the borrower's circumstances; and Step 4: Propose a resolution. </p><p>  The CCMA provides an integrated and cohesive package of consumer protection measures and it seeks to deliver on the following principles, to:</p><p>  - ensure appropriate resolution of each borrower's arrears situation;</p><p>  - ensure that lenders deal with borrowers in a fair and transparent manner; </p><p>  - support and facilitate meaningful engagement between lenders and borrowers; and  </p><p>  - ensure borrower awareness of the benefits of co-operating with their lender, and the consequences of not co-operating. </p><p>   The Central Bank has advised that, where a borrower believes that their lender has not complied with or in any way disregarded the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, he/she may make a complaint to their lender.  The lender must seek to resolve the borrower's complaint in line with the complaints handling process set out in provisions 10.7 to 10.12 of the Central Bank's Consumer Protection Code.</p><p>  Each lender must also have an appeals process in place to enable a borrower to appeal in relation to a decision of the lender, including:</p><p>  1. Where an alternative repayment arrangement is offered by a lender and the borrower is not willing to enter into the alternative repayment arrangement;</p><p>  2. Where a lender declines to offer an alternative repayment arrangement to a borrower; and</p><p>  3. Where a lender classifies a borrower as not co-operating. </p><p>  For this purpose, each lender must establish an Appeals Board to consider and determine any such appeals submitted by borrowers.  If the borrower remains dissatisfied following the outcome from the complaints or appeals process, he/she may then refer the matter to the Financial Services Ombudsman who deals independently with unresolved complaints from consumers about their individual dealings with all financial service providers.</p><p>  Likewise borrowers should also communicate and engage with their lender regarding a mortgage in difficulty as early and effective engagement between borrowers and lenders is key to resolving cases of mortgage difficulty.  Where there is effective and meaningful engagement, the data shows that an increasing number of durable long term mortgage restructures is being put in place.</p></reply>

Therefore, prior to the recent reform the State was paying 20% of the cost of all private medical insurance premiums.  In Budget 2014 tax relief for medical insurance premiums was restricted to the first &euro;1,000 per adult and the first &euro;500 per child insured. Any portion of premium paid in excess of these ceilings no longer qualifies for tax relief.  The cost of Income Tax relief in respect of medical insurance has increased significantly in recent years, at &euro;404 million in 2011, &euro;448 million in 2012 and is estimated to be &euro;500 million in 2013. Despite the increasing cost of the relief, the numbers insured are estimated to have reduced by approximately 170,000 over the same period, while at the same time the level of medical cover has decreased on some policies. Against this background the increase in costs is unsustainable.</p><p>  The new ceilings will ensure continuing support via the tax system for those who purchase medical insurance policies, while reducing Exchequer exposure to more expensive policies.  It is not possible to estimate by how much a particular individual will be affected by this measure as tax relief on premiums is only one factor that could influence the pricing of premiums by insurance companies. Any change in the net amount payable for a premium could be caused by general increases in the price of the plan and/or changes in the medical procedures or hospitals covered and/or the imposition of the new ceilings for tax relief.</p><p>  It is important to point out that the Government fully supports the elderly in retaining access to medical insurance via community rating of insurance premiums.  Community rating, in principle, provides that everybody is charged the same premium for a particular health insurance plan, irrespective of age, gender and the current or likely future state of their health.  Community rating therefore means that the level of risk that a particular consumer poses to an insurer does not directly affect the premium paid.  It also means that premiums for younger or healthier lives are typically higher than their expected claims would require, whereas for older or less healthy lives, premiums are typically lower than the expected claims would require. Older people who have been paying health insurance premiums for many years will have contributed to intergenerational solidarity when they were younger and could reasonably expect to benefit from it now. The support system that enables community rating involves the charging of a levy on the policies of younger individuals to contribute to a fund that enables risk equalisation.</p></reply>

These Guidelines provide practical advice to primary and post-primary schools on how rental schemes can be established and operated.  The aim of the Guidelines is to help as many schools as possible to start such book rental programmes.  A special &quot;Guide for Parents&quot; was also published, to inform them of how the schemes operate and how parents can help schools to establish and run them.  I have been very clear in my support for book rental schemes.  All of us who are parents know how expensive textbooks can be and what a burden it places on already hard pressed families at the start of every school year.  The Department will continue to provide a book grant as usual to all primary schools.  This grant, can be utilised for the purposes of updating or expanding a school's existing book rental scheme.</p><p>  I want to commend all schools that have used it to help build up book rental schemes over the years.  Their efforts mean that the high costs of school books is being significantly reduced for parents.  At my request, the National Parents' Council surveyed the views of their members in relation to currently operating book rental schemes.  Parents have reported that where book rental schemes operate, they are open to all parents in 95% of cases, and that the cost per child is under &euro;40 per year in a considerable majority of schools.  Perhaps most tellingly, the survey has found that 93% of parents believe that book rental schemes help with the costs of educating a child.  Ensuring that book rental schemes are available to all parents must therefore clearly be our aim.</p><p>  I understand that it feels unfair to those schools who have invested time and money to establish such schemes, that they now cannot benefit from the additional funding which was secured as part of the Budget.  Of course it is unfair, but equally, the status quo was deeply unfair on many parents.  The parents who had no access whatsoever to book rental schemes needed more support.  With the limited funding available, I believe that targeting this funding - to make sure that every parent in Ireland has access to some level of a book rental scheme - was the greatest good that could be achieved.

In this regard public construction projects which are currently underway or which are validly commenced prior to 1 March 2014 will be unaffected by SI No. 9 of 2014.

Projects for which contractual arrangements have previously been entered into but which have not yet commenced will now have to take on board the additional requirements of SI No. 9 of 2014. The suite of public works contracts and conditions of engagement as set out in the Capital Works Management Framework, provides context for addressing the additional statutory requirements and the associated costs.  As part of the competitive process for each project, the standard conditions of engagement require consultants to submit rates for time charges and these tendered rates are evaluated before appointment.  The submitted rates will provide the basis for reimbursement for any additional services required from the consultants arising from the requirements of S.I. 9 of 2014.  The additional cost arising for each project will depend on the particular specifics of that project. </p><p>  The new measures should ensure compliance with minimum building control standards and significantly reduce the incidences of defective building works and the very significant costs that go with carrying out remedial works.</p><p>  Where the OPW is undertaking the design and site supervision of projects through its own staff, there will be no additional cost to those projects.</p></reply>

It is understood that the Council has signed a contract for consultants in the last two weeks to take the development of a scheme forward through design, planning and construction. Cork County Council would be the appropriate body to provide contact details of the appointed consultants.</p><p>  The consultants will be expected to develop a number of flood relief options, identify a preferred scheme and to develop a fluvial flood forecasting system, if it is feasible. Subject to a viable scheme emerging, the consultants will be charged with bringing the scheme through a public consultation stage, either through the planning process  or through the Arterial Drainage Acts. If such a scheme is well received, then it will be followed by detailed design, procurement of a works contractor and construction. </p><p>  While it is too early to say when a scheme will go to construction, it is expected that a preferred scheme will be brought forward to public consultation before the end of this year. The OPW has made provision for the costs of a scheme in its multi-annual budget profiles, but such funding will be subject to review depending on actual budget allocations.</p><p>  Following flooding in Glanmire in June 2012, Cork County Council applied for funding under the OPW's Minor Flood Works Scheme for river cleaning works in order to provide some hydraulic improvement on the Glashaboy River. The application was approved and Cork County Council subsequently availed of funding in the amount of &euro;32,871. The implementation of these works is a matter for Cork County Council, but it is the understanding of the OPW that the works have been completed.</p></reply>

Policy in relation to applications for employment permits continues to focus on facilitating the recruitment from outside the European Economic Area of highly skilled personnel, where the requisite skills cannot be met by normal recruitment or by training.</p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s employment permit system is designed to react to changing labour market conditions and the criteria and eligibility for employment permits are reviewed accordingly and take into account initiatives underway in the education sector.  Employment permit renewals are normally granted subject to the terms and conditions of the original employment permit being met, including salary level and the condition that the employee continues to work for the same employer.</p><p>  As I indicated in my answer of 21 January, there is a cohort of permit holder already working and integrated in the State that is eligible to apply for renewal of the permit when it falls due.

The Government&rsquo;s aim in addressing the skills gap in the meat sector through the training programme being developed by my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills under the auspices of Skillnets, is to ensure that there is an adequate supply of skilled Irish and EEA nationals available to employers in the Irish meat sector, so as to obviate the need for new permits to be issued in this sector in future. </p></reply>

In an effort to help ease cash flow difficulties for Irish small businesses operating under the current economic environment, while at the same time, setting an example for businesses in the private sector to improve their payment record by paying each other more promptly, Ireland has introduced, on a voluntary basis:<blockquote>  A 15 days prompt payment requirement for all central Government Departments to pay their business suppliers within 15 days of receipt of a valid invoice. This arrangement applies to all valid invoices received on or after 15 June 2009;<br /><br />  A similar arrangement has now being extended beyond central Government Departments to our State Agency Sector to include the Health Service Executive, the Local Authorities, State Agencies, and all other Public Sector Bodies, (with the exception of the Commercial Semi-State bodies). These new arrangements apply in respect of valid invoices received on or after 01 July 2011.</blockquote>  The Late Payment Directive that established EU law in the area of prompt payments was originally introduced in 2000 and was recast in 2011 to modernise the law in this area.  The Recast Directive (2011/7/EU) came into effect across the EU on 16 March 2013.  The issue of prompt payment is now covered in Irish law by the European Communities (Late Payment in Commercial Transactions) Regulations 2012 (S.I. No. 580 of 2012).</p><p>  This legislation will act as a deterrent to late payment and as a driver for payment on time by establishing a clear expectation in law that payment will be made according to agreed terms. It lays down the specific deadlines for the payment of invoices and establishes a right to compensation in the event of late payment in all commercial transactions, whether they relate to transactions between private or public undertakings, or between undertakings and public authorities.</p><p>  The Regulations specifically provide that Public Authorities must pay for goods and services that they procure within 30 days.  Payment can be extended up to 60 days only it if is &ldquo;expressly agreed&rdquo; and justified in light of the nature or feature of the contract.</p><p>  For business to business transactions, where no contract exists, the payment period is set at 30 days.  Where a contract stipulating the payment period does exist, normally such a period should not exceed 60 calendar days unless both parties agree otherwise and providing it is not &ldquo;grossly unfair&rdquo; to the creditor.  For small businesses in particular, this contractual freedom to agree payments terms is vital as it provides protection when negotiating payments terms with larger companies. </p><p>  Any harmonisation of payment periods for business to business transactions could lead to a loss of flexibility and contractual freedom by removing the ability of companies, especially SMEs, to compete with payment periods offered to customers.

That Article provides, in effect, that the exclusive power to make laws is vested in the Oireachtas. The Supreme Court took the view that Registered Employment Agreements (REAs) are instruments having the status of laws made by private individuals. While the Constitution allows for the limited delegation of law making functions, the provisions of the 1946 Act went beyond what is permissible under the Constitution.</p><p>  The effect of this decision is to invalidate the registration of employment agreements previously registered under Part III of the 1946 Act, including the REA for the Electrical Contracting Sector, to which the TEEU was a party. In consequence the Labour Court no longer has jurisdiction to enforce, interpret or otherwise apply these agreements.  As a result, all such agreements no longer have any application beyond the subscribing parties and are not enforceable in law.  However, existing contractual rights of workers in sectors previously covered by REAs are unaffected by the ruling. Contractual rights can be altered only by agreement between the parties involved.</p><p>  The Supreme Court judgment is clearly an important issue for many employers and their employees, particularly in relation to rates of pay and tendering for contracts. Having considered legal advice from the Attorney General on the implications of the ruling, I intend to bring forward legislation to address the ruling as soon as possible. Such legislation will be fully informed by the Court&rsquo;s judgment and will provide for a revised framework to deal with those matters.</p></reply>

The person concerned was notified of the Appeals Officer&rsquo;s decision in writing on 27<sup>th</sup> January 2014.</p><p>  There has been a rapid and sustained increase in the number of appeals received in the Social Welfare Appeals Office since 2009 which has placed extraordinary pressure on the office. Up to 2009, the average number of appeals received was 15,000 per annum whereas in 2012 and 2013 the number of appeals received was 35,484, and 32,777 respectively. In order to manage this increased workload significant resources and efforts have been put into reducing backlogs and improving appeals processing times for appellants, including the assignment of 15 additional Appeals Officers, in addition to 10 former Community Welfare Service Appeals Officers who joined the office in 2011, bringing the total number of Appeals Officers to 41; reviewing and improving businesses processes; and implementing a new operating model within the appeals office. A major programme of process redesign and modernisation is also under way in the Department in many of its scheme areas aimed at reducing backlogs and reducing the time taken in the Department to respond to requests from the appeals office for submissions in relation to appeals.</p><p>  These efforts have led to improvements in processing times. In 2011 the average processing time for an appeal requiring an oral hearing was 52.5 weeks and 25.1 weeks for a summary decision.  In 2013 the equivalent average appeal processing times were 33.9 weeks for an oral hearing and 25.8 weeks for a summary decision.  There has also been an improvement in the numbers of appeals finalised from 32,558 in 2012 to 38,421 in 2013. The number of appeals on hands has also reduced - from 20,414 at the 1<sup>st</sup> January 2013 to 14,770 at 1<sup>st</sup> January 2014.</p><p>  The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions in relation to social welfare entitlements.</p></reply>

Participation on the scheme is voluntary.  Given the numbers of unemployed jobseekers holding graduate and post-graduate qualifications, it is obviously necessary that JobBridge is in a position to offer them an internship that reflects their abilities, aspirations and qualifications.  In this regard a previous criticism directed at the Department was that the terms of its jobseeker payments prevented jobseekers, including graduate jobseekers, from taking up internship opportunities as a route into employment.  JobBridge addresses this issue and I am satisfied that it is appropriate to do so.</p><p>  The Department has a number of controls in place to prevent abuse of the scheme.  These include requirements on host organisations to provide a mentor to the intern, to sign and operate a standard agreement, to submit regular monitoring reports to the Department and to co-operate with random monitoring visits.  Over 4,400 monitoring visits have been conducted to date, 98% of which were found to be satisfactory.  There are also limits placed on the number of internships that can be offered by any one organisation related to the number of staff employed by the company and there are restrictions on the repeat or sequential use of internships.  I am satisfied based on the Department&rsquo;s own monitoring visits and the report of the independent evaluation that these controls are working effectively.</p></reply>

Of these, 800 applicants have expressed an interest in relocation to non-designated bogs.</p><p>  Relocation is a very complex process, in terms of investigating suitable sites for turf quality and quantity, the infrastructure/drainage works required, establishing the number that can be accommodated on the site, the cost and feasibility of land purchase or lease, and possible planning and Environmental Impact Assessment requirements.  In that regard, Bord na M&oacute;na has assessed in the region of 100 potential relocation sites at the request of my Department.  Bord na M&oacute;na has also commenced negotiations with landowners in relation to the purchase or long-term lease of sites.</p><p>  Notwithstanding this complexity, progress in relocating turf cutters to non-designated bogs is being achieved in a number of cases.</p><p>  Arrangements for the relocation of turf cutters to non-designated bogs have been made as regards a group from Clara Bog special area of conservation in County Offaly and a group from Carrownagappul Bog and Curraghlehanagh Bog special areas of conservation in County Galway.  The group from Clara Bog commenced turf cutting at the relocation site in Killeranny, County Offaly, in June 2012, where 23 qualifying turf cutters have now been accommodated.  Turf cutting for the 2013 season took place on this site in April last.  My Department envisages that qualifying turf cutters from the group from Carrownagappul Bog and Curraghlehanagh Bog will be able to commence turf cutting in a relocation site from the 2014 turf cutting season.</p><p>  Progress has been made with a view to the relocation of qualifying turf cutters from Ballynafagh Bog special area of conservation in County Kildare to Timahoe North, County Kildare, which is in the ownership of Bord na M&oacute;na.  My Department envisages that qualifying turf cutters from Ballynafagh Bog will be able to commence cutting in the relocation site during the 2014 turf cutting season, provided that final agreement is reached with them.</p><p>  Progress has also been made with a view to the relocation of a small group of qualifying turf cutters from Ballynamona Bog and Corkip Lough special area of conservation in County Roscommon to Togher, County Roscommon, which is in the ownership of Bord na M&oacute;na.  My Department envisages that this group of qualifying turf cutters will be able to commence cutting in the relocation site during the 2014 turf cutting season, provided that final agreement is reached with them.</p><p>  I am advised that of the remaining 49 raised bog special areas of conservation, potential relocation sites have been identified for a further 33 bogs and work is ongoing on identifying and investigating sites.  Relocation is unlikely to be required, or is likely to be small-scale, for another 16 raised bog special areas of conservation due, for example, to the small number that had been cutting turf on these sites during the relevant five year period and would qualify for the relocation option available under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme.</p><p>  A payment of &euro;1,500, index-linked, or a supply of 15 tonnes of cut turf per annum is available under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme to applicants while awaiting relocation to non-designated bogs.</p></reply>

Across the range of artforms - from architecture to the visual arts - the Arts Council plays an extremely important role in supporting individual artists and arts organisations in their work.  The arts sector - like every sector in Ireland - has had a challenging time in recent years.  This year the Arts Council will receive almost &euro;57M in funding from the taxpayer.  The Chairperson designate and new members have a wealth of experience which will benefit the development of the arts in Ireland into the future.</p><p><b>  Ms Sheila Pratschke</b>  was Director of the Centre Culturel Irlandais in Paris from 2007 to 2013, and is a former Director of the Tyrone Guthrie Centre from 2001 to 2007.  She is also a former director of the Irish Film Institute.  Ms Pratschke holds qualifications from UCD as well as a diploma in Applied and Fine Arts from IPAV. </p><p><b>  Dr &Eacute;imear O&rsquo;Connor</b> previously served on the Arts Council having been appointed on September 13th 2011. Dr O'Connor HRHA received her PhD from University College, Dublin, and is an art historian specialising in Irish art, for which she has received several academic accolades.  Dr O'Connor was elected an Honorary Royal Hibernian Academician in 2010 for her contribution to the arts in Ireland. </p><p><b>  Ms Monica Spencer</b> is an actor, director and youth drama facilitator who is involved with the new Creative Communities Limerick Network.  She is a facilitator of C&eacute;im Youth Probation Services and has a strong background in dance. </p><p><b>  Ms Miriam Dunne</b> has extensive experience in working with arts organisations, events and local authorities in Ireland.  Ms Dunne has a particular interest in street theatre and circus and is currently Chairperson of AOIFE (the Association of Irish Festival Events).  </p><p><b>  Mr Brian Maguire</b> is a visual artist, educated at Dun Laoghaire School of Art and the National College of Art &amp;amp; Design. Mr Maguire was appointed professor and head of the fine art faculty at NCAD in 2000 and is a member of Aosd&aacute;na.  His work is held in collections including the Irish Museum of Modern Art, Hugh Lane Municipal Art Gallery in Dublin, the Alvar Aalto Museum in Finland, and the Gemeentemuseum in the Hague, Netherlands.</p><p><b>  Ms Joan Sheehy</b> has been acting professionally for almost 35 years.  She has worked extensively with the Abbey Theatre, the Gate Theatre, and the Project Arts Centre in Dublin and Moscow, Leningrad, New York and the Almedia Theatre in London.  Her film and Television productions include <i>Escape for Virgie</i> for Hill 16 Films, <i>The Stranger</i> for Thames TV, <i>Hard Shoulder, Ann Devlin, The Field, The Playboy of the Western World</i> for Channel 4, and <i>Into the West</i>, <i>Happy Birthday to Me</i>, and <i>Tales from the Poorhouse</i>. </p><p>  The Arts Council is not a representative body wherein members represent their own organisations interests rather than that of the Council's statutory remit.  The Arts Council is a Statutory Board and, therefore, the primary fealty of all members of the Arts Council must be to the Council.  </p><p>  Since the Local Authorities Arts Offices are funded in part by the Arts Council, there is of course also a potential conflict of interest.  </p><p>  For these reasons, I do not think it is appropriate to appoint a representative from the local authorities to the Arts Council.  A corollary would be a request for Arts Council representation on each LA when its annual resources are being allocated across its areas of responsibility (roads, heritage, the arts, housing, etc).</p></reply>

As the Deputy is aware, primary responsibility for the support and promotion of film-making in Ireland, in respect of both the indigenous sector and inward productions, is a matter for the Irish Film Board (IFB). The IFB is the statutorily independent agency responsible for the promotion and development of the Irish film industry and I have no responsibility in relation to its day-to-day operational matters, including the allocation of resources to different support programmes and schemes.</p><p>  The IFB has been allocated &euro;14.037m in 2014 to carry out its functions. </p><p>In regard to the number of films made with support by the IFB, I would direct the Deputy's attention to the annual reports of the IFB, which are lodged periodically in the Oireachtas Library, and also to the publications by the IFB itself on its website .</p><p>  It is difficult to predict with certainty the number of films that will be made in the future. However, consultations between my Department, the IFB and the Department of Finance has resulted in a number of changes to Section 481 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997 (Film Tax Relief Scheme) to ensure that Ireland retains or regains competitiveness in attracting foreign film projects to Ireland. </p><p>  The scheme was extended to the end of 2020 in the 2013 Finance Act and further changes were announced by the Minister for Finance in his budget speech. The budget announcement brings forward the new regime for film tax reliefs to 2015, and also extends the definition of 'eligible individual' in the scheme for film relief to include non-EU talent. This will increase the attractiveness of Ireland as a destination for film investment and allow the audiovisual production sector to maintain existing jobs and hopefully create new ones. </p></reply>

Copies of these documents are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at   . Written submissions are invited until 18 April. </p><p>  In general, turf-cutting on raised bog SACs is incompatible with their conservation and will not be possible in future. There are some exceptions which are dealt with the draft National Raised Bog SAC Management Plan.</p><p>  De-designation of SACs is legally possible only in very limited circumstances, as provided for in the EU Habitats Directive. The draft National Raised Bog SAC Management Plan explores the possibility of using the limited flexibility within the terms of the Habitats Directive for continued turf-cutting on a small number of raised bog SACs where relocation possibilities are shown not to exist. In such a case, a robust case would need to be submitted to the EU Commission under Article 6(4) of the Habitats Directive and compensatory measures provided to make up for any damage to the SAC network.</p><p>  However, it has not been possible at this point to determine whether the draft Plan could form the basis of a case to the EU Commission that an exception should be made for continued turf-cutting on any particular site, notwithstanding the damage it would cause. The issue is dealt with in more detail in Chapter 6 of the draft Plan. </p><p>  I hope that the publication of the draft Plan and the consultation process now underway will encourage further consideration by turf-cutters and their representatives in regard to this issue and their engagement with me and my Department in the finalisation of the Plan.</p></reply>

My Department also works on a range of issues across the area of built heritage, arts and culture and the natural heritage with public agencies in Northern Ireland where opportunities for co-operation arise.</p><p>  My Department provides core funding for the Heritage Council, which supports a range of initiatives, including National Heritage Week that in 2013 included events from Counties Antrim and Down.  The Irish Walled Towns Network includes, as a founder member, Derry City which celebrated the 400th anniversary of the laying out of the ground on which Derry&rsquo;s walls were built in 2013.  In October 2013 I attended the 23rd European Walled Towns Symposium in the Guild Hall in Derry where I had a dialogue about our shared objectives with regard to the promotion of heritage with the Minister for the Environment in the Northern Ireland Assembly.</p><p>  Through the Irish Walled Town Network, the Heritage Council has funded medieval festivals and other activities that highlight the importance of the walls as a community and heritage resource.  Since 2007, &euro;103,500 has been awarded by the Heritage Council through the Irish Walled Towns Network to Derry City Council for medieval festivals and other activities that highlight the importance of the walls as a community and tourist resource.  &euro;6,500 was provided by the Heritage Council in 2013 for Derry&rsquo;s walled town festival.  </p><p>  The Museum Standards Programme of Ireland, which sets out to raise standards of curatorship across Irish museums and galleries, includes, as one of its participants, the Museum of Free Derry. Many of the museums in the programme also participate in cross border initiatives under their own auspices such as Donegal County Museum, Cavan County Museum and Monaghan Museum.  Furthermore, Heritage Officers in border counties often undertake projects in co-operation with their northern colleagues and there is on-going co-operation and collaboration between Local Authority planners in the border counties on heritage issues.  My Department funds Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann which held its largest and flagship annual event in Derry in 2013 to celebrate the Derry Londonderry UK City of Culture.  </p><p>  In September 2013, I hosted a World Heritage Seminar, designed to consider the interest of local authorities and community groups in pursuing full nomination of World Heritage Status for the sites on the Tentative List and to clarify all the elements involved in applying for and retaining such status. The seminar was attended by representatives of Armagh District Council in connection with the possibility of including Eamhain Mhacha / Navan Fort in the Royal sites of Ireland nomination. Arising from the seminar, my Department has established contacts with the local authorities and communities involved with a view to further advancing that process.</p></reply>

This Charter places new responsibilities on Government Departments, agencies, cultural institutions and arts organisations in terms of providing and promoting arts education to children and young people. </p><p>  Both Minister Quinn and I believe passionately in arts education and want to see a joined-up Government approach across Departments, education agencies and arts organisations.  The Charter will see organisations like the Arts Council, the National Cultural Institutions, the Colleges of Education and the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment working with both Departments in order to bring the arts into the classroom and learners into the institutes for the arts. </p><p>  A High Level Implementation Group was established to oversee the implementation of the Art in Education Charter, chaired by Professor John Coolahan, Professor Emeritus, NUI Maynooth. The membership includes Orlaith McBride, Director of the Arts Council, Mary Nunan, Irish World Academy of Music and Dance, University of Limerick, Alan Wall, Director, Department of Education and Skills and Niall &Oacute; Donnch&uacute;, Assistant Secretary, Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  </p><p>  The Group has met on a number of occasions and has been proactive in meeting organisations from both the arts and education sectors.  Progress is being made on a number of initiatives, including developing a website/portal as a key communications and information channel for both the education and arts sectors.  Suitable models for art-rich schools and for artists to become involved in the programme are also being examined by this Group. </p><p>  In 2012, I announced the introduction of a new philanthropic initiative on a pilot basis for arts and culture organisations. &euro;210,000 was made available to arts organisations under this scheme and last year the initiative was directed towards arts and culture organisations seeking support for projects that included an education component.  In 2013 almost &euro;200,000 was made available under that programme. </p></reply>

In 2014, this amounts to &euro;1.448m.  Comhaltas has over 400 branches nationwide and has been to the fore in training young people in the traditional arts.  The Irish Traditional Music Archive based in Merrion Square which is a wonderful resource for those studying traditional music is also supported by The Arts Council.  </p><p>  Other organisations funded by my Department that encourage and foster the traditional arts of music and singing include the Arts Council, Foras na Gaeilge and Eala&iacute;n na Gaeltachta.

Nonetheless, I can assure the Deputy that the competing priorities regarding the preservation and enhancement of the national heritage are kept under ongoing review, having regard to the resources available to my Department.  In this regard, I recently announced the introduction of the <i>Built Heritage Jobs Leverage Scheme</i>   for the repair and conservation of structures protected under the Planning and Development Acts 2000-2012.  A sum of &euro;5 million has been made available to the scheme under the Government&rsquo;s Capital Stimulus programme. </p><p>  This scheme will allow owners throughout the country to apply for funding for conservation works to protected structures at risk.  The scheme is being managed by city and county local authorities, each of which has been given a funding allocation based on population size and number of structures on the Record of Protected Structures in the geographical area they serve.  Applications for funding are currently being made directly to the local authorities. I have requested each local authority to forward a list of eligible applications to me for approval of funding by the end of February 2014.</p><p>  Finally, in relation to sites or buildings at risk, there is a number of ways in which my Department is made aware of possible risk to protected structures, sites or monuments, one of these being the receipt of applications for funding for the improvement, renovation, restoration, conservation, preservation or otherwise making safe of same. In addition, my Department often receives information relating to potential risk to protected structures, sites and monuments from local authorities, the Heritage Council, heritage-based NGOs and members of the public.  However, a single set of comprehensive statistics is not available in respect of the number and location of endangered heritage sites or buildings throughout the country. </p></reply>

This will be achieved by providing:</p><p>- a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment, and </p><p>- a State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.</p><p>  Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway and in some instances have been accelerated in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services. These developments have been facilitated through the implementation of measures in the National Broadband Plan, including the conclusion of ComReg's multiband spectrum auction, and the new regulatory regime for fixed line Next Generation Access and service bundles. Both of these measures are designed to incentivise the rollout of services by operators. </p><p>  The ESB Electronic Communications Bill, which I introduced last week, is a further step in promoting investment in competitively priced high speed broadband. The Bill will, when enacted, enable the ESB to utilise its electricity distribution network to provide telecommunications services in the Irish market. Formal proposals are awaited in relation to the project currently being considered by the ESB and I cannot therefore comment on implementation timescales and specific areas that will be covered. This initiative is however very much in the spirit of the National Broadband Plan which recognising the role of commercial State companies in providing telecommunications infrastructure and services and the role that State assets can play generally in accelerating the roll out of high speed broadband. </p><p>  In tandem with these developments, intensive work is underway in my Department to progress a State-led investment to secure the countrywide introduction of next generation broadband access. In order to progress the State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained. My Department is engaged in a comprehensive mapping exercise of the current and anticipated investment by the commercial sector over the coming years, the results of which will inform the areas that need to be targeted in the State-led investment as envisaged in the National Broadband Plan.</p><p>  Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations, including stakeholder engagement, are ongoing. All relevant matters, including issues related to pricing, will be considered as the process of the detailed design of the intervention develops. The procurement process for the approved intervention will be carried out in accordance with EU and Irish procurement rules and it is expected that it will be launched in 2014.</p><p>  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, I am committed to ensuring that all parts of Ireland have access to high speed broadband, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in, and maximise the benefits of, a digitally enabled economy and society. </p></reply>

In summary, the framework document promotes an approach to sustainability which respects the social, cultural, economic and environmental needs of the present and future citizens of a community in all its diversity; the document is available to view and download on my Department&rsquo;s website ().</p><p><i>Our Sustainable Future</i> identifies some 70 measures to be implemented over the short, medium and long term. Within a year of publication of the framework, 17 of the 70 identified measures were completed or part-completed and other measures were advancing at a satisfactory pace. Local Agenda 21, as described in the framework, supports the integration of sustainable development principles at community level. My Department&rsquo;s Local Agenda 21 Environmental Partnership Fund gives life to these principles by assisting small-scale, non-profit, environmentally beneficial projects at a local level. Details of specific activities supported by the Fund are included in the reply to Question No. 406 of 17 December 2013.   </p><p>  Because it was recognised that effective implementation of the framework would be a key challenge, the Government agreed that the framework should be monitored at the most senior level.  I chair the High-Level Inter-Departmental Group on Sustainability that co-ordinates implementation of measures by Departments, while ultimate oversight is delivered through the Cabinet Committee on Climate Change and the Green Economy, chaired by An Taoiseach. A second meeting of the High-Level Inter-Departmental Group for Sustainable Development is being held in February 2014, focussing on monitoring progress made, obstacles encountered and opportunities for further impact. Following this meeting, the Group will submit a progress report to the Cabinet Committee on Climate Change and the Green Economy.</p><p>  As regards the need for legislation, the framework already incorporates a number of legislative measures and I look forward to receiving a progress report on these from the relevant Departments at our February meeting.</p></reply>

Comprehensive consultation documents were published including Strengthening the Building Control System - A document to inform public consultation on Draft Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2012 which sets out the context in which the reforms will operate and the regulatory impact of these for building owners (including public contracting authorities) and industry stakeholders. In summary terms, it can be said that the arrangements being put in place for the control of building activity may result in   additional design, certification and, possibly, insurance costs which must ultimately be borne by the building owner/contracting authority. Such additional costs would be justified by the enhanced quality and standard of design and construction of the building project concerned in light of several notable instances of non-compliant buildings which failed to meet minimum building standards. It is anticipated that the statutory inspection process will reduce the incidences of defective works on site and the resultant associated costs of carrying out remedial works will reduce accordingly. </p><p>  The new statutory requirements apply to projects for which commencement notices are submitted on and after 1 March 2014. In this regard public construction projects which are currently underway or which are validly commenced prior to I March 2014 will be unaffected by the new requirements. Projects for which tender documents are currently being produced will be advertised having regard to the new statutory requirements, and the contract price will be determined by competitive tender in line with normal arrangements. Projects for which contractual arrangements have previously been entered into but which have not yet commenced will now have to reflect the additional requirements of the new regulations. The suite of public works contracts and conditions of engagement as set out in the Capital Works Management Framework provides context for addressing the additional statutory requirements and the associated costs. As part of the competitive process for each project, the standard conditions of engagement require consultants to submit rates for time charges and these tendered rates are evaluated before appointment. The submitted rates will provide the basis for reimbursement for any additional services required from the consultants arising from the requirements of the new regulations. The additional cost arising for each project will depend on the particular specifics of that project.  </p><p>  My Department&rsquo;s capital programmes include responsibility for Housing, Environmental Protection, Fire Services, Libraries and other capital projects implemented primarily by local authorities. Any additional cost s for projects which are now subject to contract but which have not yet commenced will , in the first instance , be a matter for the contracting authority . Funding provided by my Department for capital works is subject to detailed scrutiny at critical stages, in   line with the Capital Appraisal Guidelines and value for money principles. </p></reply>

The installation programme commenced in August 2013 and will be implemented nationally as quickly as possible.     </p><p>  Up to 300,000 households may not be metered in the initial metering programme due to either the high cost or the technical difficulty of doing so. As the Government&rsquo;s objective is to ensure as many households as possible are metered, my Department provided funding of &euro;570,000 in 2013 to fund the cost of a study by Irish Water on possible approaches to metering properties that will not be included in the current metering programme, including apartments and properties with shared service connections. The study involved the following: desktop studies of data on the properties to be covered in the phase 2 programme including the age, configuration and distribution of the properties; field surveys; pilot studies to investigate design solutions and technological solutions; and sample meter installations in apartment blocks to validate design solutions. </p><p>  This study has very recently been submitted to my Department for consideration and, as such, any proposals for the metering of these properties would need to be considered by the Government in the first instance. The report will be published as soon as possible following its consideration.  The Water Services Acts 2013 provide that the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) will be responsible for the independent economic regulation of Irish Water.  In particular, the CER will be responsible for approving the water charges plans prepared by Irish Water, and for approving codes of practice to be prepared by Irish Water. The primary role of the Regulator will be to protect the interests of customers and to ensure a consistent and appropriate level of service is provided to them.  In discharging its functions, the CER proposes to undertake a public consultation on the approach to the design of domestic water tariffs during 2014. This will include the approach to charges for both metered and unmetered properties.   </p></reply>

In 2014, Irish Water, which now has statutory responsibility for water services, will receive &euro;240m in   equity from the Minister for Finance and some &euro;490m from the Local Government Fund but no other funding from the Department&rsquo;s Vote for establishment or other costs. Irish Water is currently preparing a Capital Investment Plan for 2014 &ndash; 2016 that will provide for the transition of projects previously included in my Department&rsquo;s 2010 - 2013 Water Services Investment Programme. </p></reply>

The primary objective of the affordable homes schemes was to assist households who would otherwise not have been in a position to purchase a home .

The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority. </p><p>  The annual rate on valuation (ARV), which is applied to the valuation for each property determined by the Valuation Office to obtain the amount payable in rates, is decided by the elected members of each local authority in the annual budget and its determination is a reserved function.</p><p>  I am acutely aware of the pressures on small and medium - sized businesses at the present time. Local authorities have been asked by my Department to exercise restraint or, where possible, to reduce commercial rates and local charges for 2014 . Local authorities have responded well to such requests in recent years and in 2013, 87 out of the 88 rating authorities have either reduced their ARV or kept it the same as in 2012.</p><p>  The reorganisation of local governance structures, set out in the <i>Action Plan for Effective Local Government &ndash; Putting People First</i> is being given effect through the Local Government (Reform) Act 2014. A key objective of the reform programme is to reduce the burden on ratepayers and indeed taxpayers generally, by reducing cost and maximising efficiency. </p><p>  The new structures of local government, including the establishment of municipal districts, provide an opportunity to achieve a more coherent approach to rates and charges on a county-wide basis having regard to funding requirements and the need to support employment and business competitiveness. The Act provides for rates harmonisation, to cater for differences between ARVs of towns and counties, to be achieved over a ten year period. While the determination of ARVs will continue to be a reserved function of the new authorities, I am determined that the savings and cost efficiencies that will accrue from the new structures should be passed on to ratepayers in the form of lower charges.</p><p>  I have also provided in the Act for the removal of the liability that is placed on new occupiers of properties for up to two years of outstanding rates of the previous occupier. This is a strong indication of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to removing any barrier to enterprise development and to support business start-ups and those existing businesses wishing to expand or relocate.</p><p>  I will continue to keep the approach to rates by local authorities under active review, and am determined that every avenue will be pursued to optimise efficiency and contain costs in the local government sector.</p></reply>

In this regard I am in ongoing contact with the Garda Commissioner who has assured me that the very significant resources available to the Garda&iacute; are effectively deployed to address policing needs in Tallaght.   Local Garda management closely monitor all crime trends and community safety concerns with a particular focus on preventing crimes of violence against persons and property, and there is also a strong emphasis on active engagement with the community to support crime prevention and reduction.</p><p>  I am further advised that Garda figures for the year 2013 indicate a reduction of 11% in incidents of violent crime as well as a 22% reduction in public order offences in the Tallaght sub-district, in comparison to the year 2012.  These reductions are broadly in line with the overall crime trends nationally, which have seen most categories of crime falling, and reflect well of the work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>  I am very conscious that these positive indicators, and the excellent work which is taking place between Garda&iacute; and the community in Tallaght, do not detract from the impact of violent crime, wherever it occurs, and I am aware of the serious concerns in the Tallaght area arising from two recent violent deaths.  Both incidents are under active Garda investigation and several charges have been brought in respect of one of the incidents.  In the circumstances, it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on those particular cases other that to encourage anyone who has information which might be of assistance to contact the Gardai, either in person or by using the Garda confidential line.</p></reply>

The ISI fully intends to provide quarterly statistics once a statistically meaningful number of applications have been processed.  This is anticipated to be in the second quarter of 2014. </p><p>  With regards to filings for bankruptcy, I am advised by the Courts Service that High Court jurisdiction covers all counties and that the Courts Service is unable to provide a county by county breakdown in relation to filings for bankruptcy.  The Courts Service has provided the following data which relates specifically to applications for self-adjudication as distinct from applications by a creditor to have a debtor adjudicated bankrupt.  In 2013, 19 applications were lodged in the Examiners Office, of which 17 were adjudicated bankrupt and 2 cases were adjourned to 2014.  In 2014, 17 applications had been lodged in the Examiners Office as at 27 January 2014, of which 6 cases are listed before the Courts.  The Courts Service has indicated the remaining cases are expected to be listed before the High Court during February 2014.</p><p>  It is not possible to provide the average cost of engaging a Personal Insolvency Practitioner (PIP) because the ISI has no regulatory power over the level of fees that a PIP may charge. As at 27 January 2014 there are 110 PIPs authorised by the ISI and they have various fee models. Some PIPs do not charge a fee for an initial consultation while others do.  A list of authorised PIPs can be found on the ISI's website, www.isi.gov.ie. In all cases fees, costs and outlays must be in accordance with the provisions of Regulation 15 of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 (Authorisation and Supervision of Personal Insolvency Practitioners) Regulations (S.I. No. 209 of 2013).  The PIP must at the outset of the Debt Settlement Arrangement or Personal Insolvency Arrangement process provide the person in writing with details of the fee arrangements and likely costs involved in entering into an arrangement before appointment.  The fees and costs can be expected to form part of the arrangement and as such creditors will have an opportunity to vote on them.</p></reply>

Direct provision accommodation ensures that all persons awaiting a determination on their asylum or related applications are provided with the basic needs of food and shelter as well as other State services such as health, education and community welfare supports.</p><p>  In the absence of specific detail about what child protection concerns are referred to in the question, I will set out below the suite of supports and services applying within the structures of the direct provision policy and show the level of protection and services available across the relevant State agencies.</p><p>  The accommodation itself provided by RIA in the direct provision system complies with relevant legislative standards.  In addition to the accommodation services, both RIA and other State service providers, particularly the HSE, link in with the direct provision centres and provide on-site services and monitoring of children and families through Public Health Nurse and GP services, social work teams, mental health specialists and through the positive engagement of accommodation centre management teams.  Residents of direct provision qualify for a medical card, entitling them to a range of medical services without charge.  Also, the Community Welfare Service holds clinics in many of our centres to assist families with needs which may fall to be assisted under the Exceptional Needs Payments structures.  These State services link closely with RIA in terms of needs assessments, case conferences and follow-up services.</p><p>  As regards education, children of asylum seekers are linked to local mainstream primary and post-primary schools as well as ECCE pre-school placements in a like manner to the general population and the role of the accommodation centre manager is central to this process.</p><p>  Children of asylum seekers can also access recreational facilities available in the locality in which they are living.  Some Direct Provision Centres have on-site playgrounds.  Many individual centres will provide other facilities and will also facilitate NGO&rsquo;s who organise outings and other activities.  Homework clubs are also provided at certain family centres.  Details of the on-site and local services available to children and families across the direct provision system are set out in the RIA's Annual Report for 2012 which can be found on the agency's website at www.rie.gov.ie.</p><p>  RIA also has a Child Protection Policy based on the HSE's &quot;Children First - National Guidelines for the protection and welfare of children&quot;.  A Child and Family Services unit in RIA is well established and its role is to manage, deliver, coordinate, monitor and plan all matters relating to child and family services for all persons residing in RIA accommodation centres and to act as a conduit between RIA and the HSE.  In conjunction with the HSE, RIA is currently updating its existing Child Protection Policy, in line with the recent revisions to &quot;Children First&quot;.  RIA is currently liaising with the HSE regarding the re-training of the Designated Liaison Officers.  The HSE hopes to be in a position to facilitate this training shortly.</p><p>  All staff of centres under contract to RIA are Garda vetted. It is an important aspect of RIA's Child Protection policy which has, as its principal aim, the minimisation of risk to children and vulnerable adults residing in Direct Provision centres.  In keeping with this policy, children must be supervised by adults at all times.  They are not permitted to be left alone overnight.  In addition, children cannot be accommodated in a room separate from their parents save through interconnecting rooms. </p><p>  Management of accommodation centres are obliged to ensure that all staff working in the centre are aware of, and adhere to, RIA's Child Protection Policy. In addition, the HSE have provided 'Keeping Safe' child protection training to designated officers, and other staff members, in accommodation centres.</p><p>  RIA is also currently finalising, in consultation with Cosc and NGOs, a policy on &quot;Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence and Harassment&quot; to provide guidance and contact information for staff and residents at Direct Provision centres.</p><p>  The system of Direct Provision allows for a level of non-intrusive supervision of residents which would not be found in general alternative living arrangements in the community.  Centre staff, designated liaison officers and management are always available to assist.  Public Health Nurses, General Practitioners, Community and Ethnic Liaison Garda&iacute; and others linked in with an accommodation centre are alert to child welfare issues.  They also provide support for families within the Direct Provision System.</p></reply>

However, this is not always possible for operational and security reasons.  It is worth noting that maintaining family relationships can help to prevent prisoners re-offending and assist them to resettle successfully into their community.  In this regard too, international research has found that prisoners who maintain good family contact are more likely to have employment and housing options on leaving prison and are less likely to re-offend.</p></reply>

It is therefore vital that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.<b><font color="#000080"> </font></b> All applications are processed with a view to establishing whether the applicants meet the statutory conditions for the granting of naturalisation, such as good character and lawful residence, and are submitted to me for decision as expeditiously as possible.  In some instances that can be established relatively quickly and in other cases completing the necessary checks can take a considerable period of time.</p><p>  When I came into office in March 2011 one of my immediate priorities was to address the unconscionably large backlog of applications for naturalisation awaiting decision that had built up over several years.  At that time there were approximately 22,000 applications awaiting decision, many of which had been waiting for three years or longer.</p><p>  Since then I have decided on some 68,000 applications, notwithstanding a significant increase of almost 60% in the volume of valid applications received - from 12,500 in 2010 to nearly 20,000 in 2013.  In the past year I have decided over 30,000 applications and issued certificates of naturalisation to some 28,000 applicants.  Quite clearly, this has also resulted in a huge reduction in processing times, with over 70% of standard applications now being decided within six months.  I think the Deputy will agree that this represents a major turnaround, especially given the 115% increase in valid application levels since 2008, when processing times were more than four times longer.  It is my intention that we will continue to build on this success in 2014 and to further reduce the time taken to reach a decision for most applications.</p><p>  The new arrangements I have put in place since my appointment include improved application forms that are currently available on-line together with streamlined and accelerated procedures for certain types of application.  I have also requested that my officials ensure that all the procedures involved in processing an application are reviewed regularly to ensure that they are conducted as efficiently as possible.</p><p>  The costs paid by applicants on the issue of a certificate of naturalisation were last increased by the Irish Nationality and Citizenship (Fees) Regulations 2008, which came into effect on 1st August 2008. The standard certification fee is &euro;950 while a reduced fee of &euro;200 applies in the case of an application made on behalf of a minor or in certain circumstances when the application is made by a widow, widower or surviving civil partner of an Irish citizen. In the case of refugees and stateless persons no certification fee is charged.  A new application fee of &euro;175 was introduced in November 2011. This fee contributes towards the costs of processing those applications that do not attract any certification fee and helps to reduce the proportion of invalid and ineligible applications being lodged.  The fees are designed to reflect the effort and cost involved in processing applications for a certificate of naturalisation and there are no additional costs to the State relating to the length of time taken to process each application.</p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, I have introduced formal citizenship ceremonies at no extra cost to applicants. These have been universally well received by participants as the ceremonies provide a sense of occasion that serves to underscore the importance to both the State and the applicant of the granting of Irish citizenship.</p></reply>

It set out a number of recommendations aimed at improving the capacity of the RDF and ensuring its continued viability. These recommendations included the consolidation of a large number of under-strength Units into a smaller number of full strength Units. A major re-organisation of the Army Reserve (AR) and Naval Service Reserve (NSR) was implemented in 2013 and the RDF is now organised alongside the Permanent Defence Force (PDF) within a more efficient single force structure. </p><p>  Separately, the VFM Review highlighted an inconsistency where a member of the Reserve could be classed as effective; yet fail to meet minimum training targets that had been set out in plans for the Reserve. The retention of personnel who do not meet minimum training requirements has a detrimental effect on the capacity and morale of the Reserve. In this context, the VFM Review recommended a review of the criteria for categorising Reservists as effective.</p><p>  The military authorities have developed proposals in this regard and this is one of a range of measures aimed at reforming the RDF. I have received no recommendations relating to the introduction of employment protection legislation and I can see no basis for such a recommendation. The intention is that actual training requirements will be accurately reflected in regulations governing retention on the effective strength of the Reserve. In practice this will mean a requirement that Reservists meet training requirements that have been in place for many years rather than an increase in the level of training for the AR and NSR.</p></reply>

I wish to advise the Deputy that as part of establishment of the new Child and Family Agency, a dedicated position of Programme Manager for domestic, sexual and gender based violence is being created. I am pleased to say that the National Programme Manager is due take up the post on 3<sup>rd</sup> February next. Since the establishment of the Child and Family Agency on 1<sup>st</sup> January, 2014 there has been a single line of accountability for all resources made available to services responding to domestic, sexual and gender based violence.  Previously there was a range of local funders in children&rsquo;s services, primary care and social inclusion. I would like to further assure the Deputy that funding is ring-fenced to provide frontline services in this area.</p><p>  With respect to support services, I am advised that Rape Crisis Network of Ireland (RCNI) had a two year contract with the HSE which was due to finish on 31st December, 2013.   This contract was extended to 31st March, 2014, but due to the level of the support services involved and the value of the contract, a tendering process for reappointment of a service is required.  The National Programme Manager with special responsibility for Domestic Sexual and Gender Based Violence will work with the Head of Procurement in the Agency to develop a tender process. It is open to all qualified providers, including the RCNI, to tender for this new contract. As the provision of these supports will involve a tendering process, I hope the Deputy will appreciate that I cannot go into too much further detail in advance of the contracts being placed. </p></reply>

A single national children's hospital, co-located with St James&rsquo;s and, ultimately, tri-located with a maternity hospital, will provide the excellence in clinical care that our children deserve.</p><p>  As part of previous plans for the new children's hospital on the campus of the Mater Hospital, it had been intended that there would be an ambulatory and urgent care centre on the campus of Tallaght Hospital. Following the Government decision in November 2012 to locate the main new children's hospital at St James's, a review of the ambulatory and urgent care centre plan was undertaken. This has now been completed and yesterday I announced that satellite centres of the new children's hospital would be developed on the campuses of Tallaght Hospital and of Connolly Hospital.</p><p>  As well as being a national tertiary hospital for more complex care, the new children's hospital is a regional hospital for children in the Greater Dublin Area. These satellite centres will be an integral part of the hospital, under the same governance and management, providing the same clinical standards and with the same staff who will rotate through the main hospital and the satellite centres. Each centre will provide consultant-delivered urgent care, with observation beds (up to 6 hours stay) and appropriate diagnostics (X-ray and laboratory).  The vast majority of children and young people attending the centre are expected to be treated and discharged.  In addition to providing local access for urgent care, the centres will also provide local access to outpatient care, including general paediatric rapid access clinics for GP referral.</p><p>  The announcement of these satellite centres marks another important milestone for the new children' s hospital, further ensuring that we will deliver better outcomes for our children and young people, well into the future.</p></reply>

The KPMG Independent Review of Maternity and Gynaecology Services in the Greater Dublin Area Report was informed by an international analysis of maternity and gynaecology service configurations and best practice models of care.</p><p>  The report noted that Dublin&rsquo;s model of stand-alone maternity hospitals is not the norm internationally. It recommended that the Dublin maternity hospitals should be located alongside adult acute services and that one of the three new Dublin maternity facilities should be built on the site of the new children&rsquo;s hospital (tri-location of paediatric, maternity and adult services). In this context the proposal was that the National Maternity Hospital was to be relocated to St Vincent's, the Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital to Tallaght and the Rotunda to the Mater. In May this year, I announced the relocation of the National Maternity Hospital to the St Vincent&rsquo;s campus.</p><p>  Recognising the need to plan for the provision of tri-located maternity, paediatric and adult services, and in view of the Government decision to locate the new children&rsquo;s hospital on the St James campus, it will be necessary to review the other maternity-adult co-location plans. This review will take place in the context of the development of a National Maternity Strategy. I confirmed on 10 October last that my Department will lead the development of this Strategy in collaboration with the HSE and its National Clinical Programme in Obstetrics and Gynaecology. The Strategy will provide the blueprint for the safe, effective delivery of maternity services nationally.   The development of the Strategy will build on the work already undertaken as part of the KPMG Independent Review, and on the work underway by the Clinical Programme.</p></reply>

Supporting infrastructure, procured through a combination of public and private investment, will facilitate the delivery of multi-disciplinary primary health care.  The location prioritisation exercise initiated by the HSE in 2012 is a dynamic process, constantly evolving to take account of changing circumstances including the feasibility of implementation using the following delivery mechanisms:</p><p>- direct/own-build (by HSE); </p><p>- by way of the operational lease with the private sector; or </p><p>- through the Public Private Partnership (PPP) project.</p><p>  In addition to the infrastructure already in place thirty four primary care centres have been delivered between March 2011 and December 2013.  These locations are set out in the following table.  The Heath Service National Service Plan 2014 (Appendix 5 Capital Infrastructure Pages 68, 69) advises that an additional 21 primary care centres are expected to open over 2014/Q12015; 19 by way of operational lease and two by direct/own-build.  Significant progress has been achieved using the operational lease mechanism.  The HSE continues to work with the private sector to deliver primary care centres by means of operational lease.  In addition, a further 13 are to be delivered by direct/own-build.  These are St Mary's Orthopaedic Hospital campus, Cork city; Finglas; Grangegorman; Monaghan town; Ballinamore; Sligo town; Manorhamilton; Erris; Ballyshannon; Edgesworthtown; Tullow/Rathvilly/Hacketstown; Loughrea and Dungloe.    </p><p>  In relation to the potential  Primary Care Centres to be delivered under the Public Private Partnership (PPP) Project, the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA) published a Prior Information Notice (PIN) on Friday 15th November 2013 in the Official Journal of the European Union (&quot;OJEU&quot;) through the eTenders Public Procurement portal which can be viewed on the www.etenders.gov.ie website.  Of the 35 primary care centre locations announced under the Infrastructure Stimulus Package in July 2012, 15 locations have been identified as being suitable for the PPP model.  These are Ballymote; Boyle; Westport; Claremorris; Tuam; Limerick City; Dungarvan; Carrick-on-Suir; Wexford Town; Waterford City; Kilcock; Knocklyon/Rathfarnham; Crumlin/Drimnagh; Coolock/Darndale; and Summerhill, north inner city Dublin.  In addition, the HSE has progressed Ballinrobe, which was not one of the original 35, as a suitable substitute.</p><p>  By year end 2013 the HSE had lodged 14 planning applications, details of which will be available on the relevant planning websites.  The submission of Limerick City and Ballinrobe planning applications are to follow as soon as possible.  It is expected that 10-14 sites (indicative number 12 based on affordability) from the above list will be delivered as part of a single PPP contract with the remaining centres to be delivered by the HSE using other procurement means.  As with all other capital projects the further expansion of the primary care infrastructure programme (including locations that have not moved to planning stage) must be considered within the overall capital envelope available to the health service.</p><p>  Your question has been referred to the HSE for direct reply in relation to following:</p><p>- The schedule of suitable primary care infrastructure delivered before March 2011; and</p><p>- Locations at planning stage (other than the locations set out above).</p><p><table><tr><th><b>Count</b></th><th><b>HSE Region</b></th><th><b>County / Area</b></th><th><b>PCT Name / Location </b></th><th><b>Delivery Method</b></th><th><b>Open</b></th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>DML</td><td>Dublin </td><td>Inchicore</td><td>Direct Build</td><td>2011 Q4 </td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>DML</td><td>Dublin </td><td>Ballyfermot</td><td>Direct Build</td><td>2012 Q3 </td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>DML</td><td>Dublin </td><td>Rathfarnham</td><td>Lease</td><td>2012 Q4 </td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>DML</td><td>Dublin </td><td>Churchtown</td><td>Operational Lease</td><td>2012 Q4 </td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>DML</td><td>Dublin </td><td>Dublin City at James's St /Pimlico /Liberties</td><td>Operational Lease</td><td>2012 Q4 </td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>DML</td><td>Kildare</td><td>Newbridge</td><td>Operational Lease</td><td>2013 Q2 </td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>DML</td><td>Laois</td><td>Portarlington</td><td>Operational Lease</td><td>2011 Q3 </td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>DML</td><td>Longford </td><td>Longford Town</td><td>Operational Lease</td><td>2013 Q2 </td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>DNE</td><td>Dublin </td><td>Blanchardstown</td><td>Operational Lease</td><td>2013 Q4 </td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>DNE</td><td>Meath</td><td>Dunshaughlin</td><td>Direct Build</td><td>2012</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>DNE</td><td>Meath</td><td>Ashbourne </td><td>Operational Lease</td><td>2013 Q1 </td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>DNE</td><td>Louth</td><td>Carlingford</td><td>Direct Build</td><td>2012</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>DNE</td><td>Louth</td><td>Ardee</td><td>Direct Build</td><td>2012</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>DNE</td><td>Cavan</td><td>Cootehill</td><td>Direct Build</td><td>2012</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>DNE</td><td>Cavan</td><td>Bailieborough</td><td>Direct Build</td><td>2012 Q4 </td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>DNE</td><td>Cavan</td><td>Cavan Town</td><td>Operational Lease</td><td>2012 Q1 </td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td>DNE</td><td>Cavan</td><td>Kingscourt</td><td>Operational Lease</td><td>2012 Q3 </td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td>DNE</td><td>Cavan</td><td>Cavan Town 2 (Connolly Court)</td><td>Operational Lease</td><td>2013 Q2 </td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td>South</td><td>Wexford</td><td>Gorey </td><td>Operational Lease</td><td>2012 Q3 </td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>South</td><td>Kilkenny</td><td>Kilkenny (at Grange's Road)</td><td>Operational Lease</td><td>2011 Q3 </td></tr><tr><td>21</td><td>South</td><td>Kilkenny</td><td>Callan </td><td>Operational Lease</td><td>2011 Q3 </td></tr><tr><td>22</td><td>South</td><td>Waterford </td><td>Tramore</td><td>Operational Lease</td><td>2011 Q4 </td></tr><tr><td>23</td><td>South</td><td>Cork / South Lee</td><td>Cork City at Mahon</td><td>Operational Lease</td><td>2011 Q4</td></tr><tr><td>24</td><td>South</td><td>Cork / North Lee</td><td>Macroom</td><td>Operational Lease</td><td>2012 Q1 </td></tr><tr><td>25</td><td>South</td><td>Cork</td><td>Schull</td><td>Operational Lease</td><td>2013 Q4 </td></tr><tr><td>26</td><td>South</td><td>Kerry</td><td>Kenmare</td><td>Operational Lease</td><td>2012 Q3 </td></tr><tr><td>27</td><td>South</td><td>Kerry</td><td>West Kerry (Dingle)</td><td>Direct Build</td><td>2013</td></tr><tr><td>28</td><td>West</td><td>Limerick</td><td>Limerick City at Abbey St Mary's</td><td>Operational Lease</td><td>2012 Q1 </td></tr><tr><td>29</td><td>West</td><td>Galway</td><td>Galway City East</td><td>Operational Lease</td><td>2011 Q2 </td></tr><tr><td>30</td><td>West</td><td>Galway</td><td>Athenry</td><td>Operational Lease</td><td>2013 Q3 </td></tr><tr><td>31</td><td>West</td><td>Mayo</td><td>Ballina</td><td>Operational Lease</td><td>2011 Q2 </td></tr><tr><td>32</td><td>West</td><td>Roscommon</td><td>Castlerea</td><td>Operational Lease</td><td>2012 Q3 </td></tr><tr><td>33</td><td>West</td><td>Roscommon</td><td>Monksland South Roscommon</td><td>Operational Lease</td><td>2012 Q4 </td></tr><tr><td>34</td><td>West</td><td>Donegal </td><td>Glenties</td><td>Direct Build</td><td>2012 Q3 </td></tr></table></p></reply>

Medical card holders who are given a prescription by a hospital or clinic must request their GP to transcribe the details onto a GMS prescription form in order for them to receive their medication free of charge, subject to any applicable prescription charges. </p><p>  There is an arrangement under the GMS Scheme for the emergency supply of medicines for medical card holders on discharge from hospital.  Community pharmacists are authorised to dispense a maximum of seven days supply of medicines prescribed for persons who have been in-patients in a hospital or who have attended an Emergency Department and because of the circumstances of their discharge and/or the urgency of the prescribed medication it would not be possible to attend their GP to have the hospital prescription transcribed to a GMS prescription form.  This arrangement relieves any difficulties that patients might encounter due to being discharged from hospital late in the evening or at weekends. </p><p>  I wish to assure the Deputy that it is best clinical practice that a person in need of treatment should regularly attend their GP and that the GP is fully aware of the medication that is prescribed to any patient.  This is entirely consistent with the gatekeeper role played by the GP in the delivery of primary care.  As GPs receive an annual capitation fee per GMS patient there are no extra costs incurred by such patients.</p></reply>

It affects individuals in many different ways.  General practitioners are in the best position to offer advice to sufferers and, where necessary, to refer them to hospital consultants.  While it is not possible to be prescriptive with regard to the precautions that should be taken in individual cases, generally speaking, persons at known risk of anaphylaxis would be well advised to carry an adrenaline pen and, in the case of children, carers and teachers should be made aware of the child's condition and have access to, and be shown how to use an adrenaline pen in an emergency.</p><p>  Adrenaline pens, as injectable medicines, may only be supplied on foot of a prescription.  However, there is provision in the Medicinal Products (Prescription and Control of Supply) Regulations which permits pharmacists, in emergency circumstances, to supply certain prescription-only medicines, including adrenaline pens, without a prescription.

The HSE has also suggested to <i>Dignity 4 Patients</i>   that they consider establishing synergies with other similar agencies, in order that their client group can continue to be supported.</p><p>  Regarding the Deputy's question relating to setting up an Inquiry, I have no plans to set up a further Inquiry on foot of the Drogheda Review.  In October 2009, the then Minister for Health and Children announced the establishment of an independent non statutory review, the &ldquo;Drogheda Review&rdquo;.  The purpose of this review was to advise her on whether a further investigation into the procedures and practices operating at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital Drogheda during the period 1964 to 1995 to protect patients from sexual abuse while undergoing treatment or care at the hospital and to deal with allegations of sexual abuse against a certain doctor, would be likely to provide additional information or insights which would be of significant public benefit in helping to improve best practice guidelines and policies.  This review was carried out by retired High Court Judge T.C. Smyth.  Judge Smyth submitted his report to the Minister in September 2010.  The report recommended that a further investigation should not<b></b>  be held and that, in order to avoid prejudicing any civil or criminal cases, the report should not be published.  I am aware that such proceedings are underway.  A short summary of the report was, however, prepared and supplied to the patient support groups in January 2011.</p><p>  The High Court proceedings with the Information Commissioner and also the Circuit Court proceedings, initiated by the Office of the Ombudsman, are on-going and accordingly I am not in a position to make any further comment as these matters are <i>sub judice</i>.  The legal costs of the Department associated with these proceedings are borne by the Chief State Solicitor's Office vote.  It is not possible to provide a reliable estimate of legal costs to date, or projected full costs for all parties.</p></reply>

The application was considered in line with the procedures and timescales agreed in 2012 by my Department and the HSE with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA). </p><p>In accordance with these procedures, the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE) conducted a pharmacoeconomic evaluation of Eculizumab and concluded that, at a total cost per patient per year of &euro;437,247 and a cumulative gross budget impact over 5 years estimated at &euro;33 million, the therapy did not represent value for money for the treatment of patients in the Irish healthcare setting. In addition, the manufacturer did not include an economic model as part of their submission and failed to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of this therapy. Consequently, the NCPE was unable to recommend reimbursement of the product under the community drug schemes. The report is available on the NCPE's website (  ). </p><p>The NCPE report is an important input to assist the HSE in its decision making process and informs further discussions between the HSE and the manufacturer of the drug. The HSE assessment process is intended to arrive at a decision on the funding of high cost new medicines that is clinically appropriate, fair, consistent and sustainable. The HSE is now carefully considering all the issues which arise in relation to the proposed benefits and costs of this medicine and expects to reach a decision in the near future.</p></reply>

The implementation of individual national road schemes which provide for tolling, is a matter for the National Roads Authority (NRA) under the Roads Acts 1993-2007.  Moreover, the statutory power to levy tolls on national roads, to make toll bye-laws and to enter into toll agreements with private investors in respect of national roads is very specifically vested in the NRA under Part V of the Roads Act, 1993 (as amended).</p><p>  The maximum tolls for each toll year are set in accordance with the toll bye-laws made by the NRA under Section 61 of the Roads Act. Aside from the annual adjustments made in accordance with the bye-laws, there are currently no proposals to vary tolls on national roads.  While toll rates are adjusted annually in line with consumer prices, the base rates are built into the PPP financing arrangements that enabled the high quality motorway network to be built.   Any change to the financial arrangements would clearly have significant implications and would have to be carefully evaluated.</p></reply>

The limited funding available over and above this priority was to be allocated to projects which are affordable, meet overall transport objectives and deliver the best return in terms of economic recovery and job creation. </p><p>  On the heavy rail side the bulk of the funding is required for rail safety and renewal. However the Plan did include funding for new  rail stations at Kishogue, Hansfield, Oranmore and Crusheen.  To date Hansfield and Oranmore stations have been opened while planning issues and other delays have  hampered progress at both Kishogue  and Crusheen.  Capital funding for Irish rail was also reduced in 2012 to support the emergency funding required by the CIE Group at that time.  This led to a re-prioritisation of the heavy rail capital projects and to a longer delivery time line for some projects including the new rail stations. Notwithstanding  the difficulties it is my intention that a rail stop at Crusheen will be provided within the life time of the current capital programme.   </p></reply>
