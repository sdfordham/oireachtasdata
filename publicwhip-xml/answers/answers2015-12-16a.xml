The current layout of road design is likely to be in place for the foreseeable future<font color="#1F497D">.</font>The immediate priority for investment in the rail network is for ongoing maintenance and renewal of existing assets, in order to achieve 'steady state' condition of the network, and the Government has allocated over &euro;140 million this year for this purpose.  It is envisaged that funding will become available for the closure of level crossings during the lifetime of the Capital Plan 2016-2021.</p></reply>

With regard to revenue, the most recent CSO Quarterly Tourism and Travel publication shows that spending in Ireland by overseas visitors (excluding carrier receipts) in the first nine months of 2015 amounted to over &euro;3.3 billion, an increase of 17.5% compared to the same period in 2014.  The indications are that 2015 will break all previous records in terms of our overseas tourism performance.</p>  <p>  Tourism Ireland's targets for 2016 are to grow overseas visit numbers by a further 4%, and grow the associated revenue by 5%.  The longer-term tourism goals, as outlined in the Government's Tourism Policy Statement are that by 2025: revenue from overseas visitors will increase to &euro;5 billion, net of inflation; we would have 10 million visits to Ireland annually; and employment in the tourism sector would reach 250,000 compared to 205,000 at present. </p>  <p>  In July, I established a Tourism Leadership Group to put in place a Tourism Action Plan that will set out the measures required in the period up to 2018 so that the overall objectives in the Tourism Policy Statement can be achieved.  This Action Plan will be published early in the new year. </p>  <p>  In terms of access, as an island destination, direct, convenient and competitive access services are critical to achieving tourism growth.  The zero rate travel tax has seen a very positive response from the airlines with many new routes and increased services coming on stream.  I would also acknowledge the important connectivity role played by sea carriers, particularly in relation to holiday visitors from Great Britain and Mainland Europe.  I should also mention that I recently announced a &euro;1 million funding allocation to support co-operative marketing activity to regional access points which is designed to encourage new access and maximise the potential of existing air and ferry services to the regions.</p></reply>

The planning, design and implementation of individual national road projects is a matter for Transport Infrastructure Ireland (formerly known as the NRA) under the Roads Act 1993, as amended, in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.</p>  <p>  Under section 50 of the Roads Act 1993, either a road authority or Transport Infrastructure Ireland must prepare a statement of the likely effects on the environment of certain road developments, which would include the N59 Oughterard to Maam Cross project.  This in turn reflects EU legislation. </p>  <p>  Under section 51 of the Roads Act 1993, the road authority concerned or Transport Infrastructure Ireland must apply to An Bord Plean&aacute;la for approval of such road developments and must submit the environmental impact statements prepared in respect of the developments to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Any such road developments must not be carried out unless An Bord Plean&aacute;la has by order approved them or approved them with modifications.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la may also refuse to approve such developments. </p>  <p>  An Bord Plean&aacute;la is responsible for giving planning approval for such road developments and I have no function in the matter.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, the implementation of the N59 Oughterard to Maam Cross project is a matter for Transport Infrastructure Ireland and Galway County Council. Galway County Council is working closely with National Parks and Wildlife Service (part of the Heritage Division of the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht) on the development of the N59 Oughterard to Maam Cross Scheme.  This involves the agreement of numerous Method Statements for each stage of the scheme, in accordance with the planning approval for the scheme.  The development and agreement of the method statements is a time consuming process which is reflective of the environmental risks associated with developing new infrastructure through this uniquely sensitive area.</p></reply>

Within its capital budget, the assessment and prioritisation of individual projects is a matter in the first instance for TII in accordance with Section 19 of the Roads Act.  As regards regional and local roads, responsibility for implementation of improvement projects rests with the relevant local authority which is Kildare County Council in this instance.</p>  <p>  The transport element of the Capital Plan provides that work will commence on several roads projects which are targeted at removing critical bottlenecks or upgrading inadequate sections of road, including the M7 widening and the Sallins Bypass. Kildare County Council is responsible for the construction of the Osberstown Interchange. </p>  <p>  As the three projects mentioned by the Deputy need to be implemented in a co-ordinated way, I expect TII to liaise with Kildare County Council in relation to an implementation programme.  At present TII is assessing how best to progress national projects included in the 7 year transport element of the Capital Plan taking into account annual budget allocations.  The timeframe for progressing individual projects will be decided once that process is completed.</p></reply>

I was glad to learn that in the meantime the project team had progressed the detailed design and preparation of contract documents for the project while continuing to explore potential funding sources. </p><p>The cost of delivering the entire greenway is estimated to be in the region of &euro;2.4 million.  I understand from my meeting with the Council delegation that the project can be delivered in 2 phases.  Phase 1 could run for a distance of 8km from the town park in Navan to Wilkinstown which would represent a valuable amenity in itself. </p><p>  Phase 2 will run from Wilkinstown to Kingscourt.  Cavan County Council are also keen to commence this section of the greenway and the planning and design elements are at an advanced stage. </p><p>Given that all Department funding for the purpose of delivering greenways is now fully committed up until 2016, I would urge the Council to continue to progress this project is so far as their own resources allow.</p></reply>

Public transport projects and investment will be considered within the wider context of developing a multi-faceted response to mitigation from the sector.  The responsibility for emissions reduction is a collective one and, when all sectoral inputs have been co-ordinated, the draft Plan will be available for extensive public consultation before being submitted for approval to Government.</p></reply>

Short-term jobseekers have never been eligible for the bonus, and this arrangement continues to apply this year.  </p>  <p>  In the case of most eligible schemes, all recipients of the payment receive the bonus and there is no duration requirement e.g. the State Pension, Widow's Pension, Disability Allowance, Invalidity Pension, Carer's Allowance, etc.</p>  <p>  Recipients of Jobseeker's Allowance (JA) must have in receipt of the payment for a minimum of 15 months (390 days) in order to be eligible for the bonus.  Long-term jobseekers are eligible for the bonus in recognition of their being wholly or mostly financially dependent on their welfare payment for income.</p>  <p>  Participants on JobBridge, who were in receipt of JA immediately prior to participation on the scheme, must have been in receipt of JA for 15 months prior to starting on JobBridge, or have 15 months duration in total combined on JA and JobBridge, in order to be eligible for the bonus.  This arrangement also applies for participants on Back to Education Allowance.  It should be noted that participants on these schemes who were previously in receipt of other eligible payments, such as Disability Allowance or One-Parent Family Payment, are automatically eligible for the bonus.  The 15 months duration requirement applies only to those participants who were previously in receipt of JA immediately before starting on the scheme.</p>  <p>  Two other payments also have the 15 months duration requirement &ndash; Supplementary Welfare Allowance and Direct Provision Allowance.  The Christmas bonus (when paid in the past) was administered for SWA recipients by the Community Welfare Service (CWS) of the HSE.  The CWS transferred into this Department in late 2011. Prior to the abolition of the Bonus in 2009, there was variation in the administration of the bonus across HSE areas.  When the bonus was re-introduced last year, entitlement was standardised for SWA recipients in line with Jobseeker's Allowance.  It should be noted that persons on Basic SWA (with a duration of less than 15 months) who are awaiting a decision on a long term scheme (to which the Bonus applies) will receive the Bonus if entitlement to the relevant scheme is backdated to cover the week in which the Bonus would have been payable for 2015.</p>  <p>  The calculation of the 390 days is contingent on how claims are linked.  If there is a break of up to 52 weeks in a person's JA claim &ndash; for instance, if a person in receipt of JA found employment that lasted for 10 months, or went on an Education and Training Board course, and subsequently claimed JA again &ndash; the time spent on JA immediately prior to the job/course would be combined with the time on the current claim in order to assess eligibility for the bonus.  In this regard, a JA recipient's current claim may be less than 390 days and he or she can still qualify for the bonus, if the claim can be linked to a previous eligible claim.</p></reply>

These families are eligible for social welfare payments on the same basis as Irish citizens and are entitled to apply for relevant social welfare weekly payments such as basic supplementary welfare allowance, jobseekers allowance, one parent family payment and child benefit appropriate to the circumstances of the individual or family.</p><p>  The types of social welfare payments or rates of payments paid to these individuals is a matter between the individuals themselves and the Department.  In general, refugees while resident in the Emergency Reception and Orientation Centre (EROC) receive accommodation, food and other basic services provided by the State.  Social Welfare legislation allows for the assessment of the non-cash benefits provided to the residents and the Department assesses the value of these non-cash benefits when determining appropriate rates of social welfare payments.  This generally results in a reduction of the weekly amount payable taking into account that basic requirements such as food, accommodation and other services are provided.  Refugee families are also entitled to receive child benefit and the back to school clothing and footwear allowance depending on their family circumstances.</p><p>  The Department can make exceptional needs payments (ENPs) to help meet essential, once-off and unforeseen expenditure such as seeking accommodation, which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income.  Programme Refugees and others with refugee status can apply for ENPs to meet needs as they arise, for example for essential items such as clothing or other personal items, travel costs and also rent deposits to support the transition into rented accommodation.</p><p>  Once the period of orientation in the reception centre is over and the families move to accommodation in the community, the means assessment is reviewed and entitlement to the relevant social welfare payment is recalculated to reflect the changed situation.  This would generally result in an increase in payment in line with the scheme rules taking into account the individual circumstances of the individual or family.</p><p>  The amount paid to the individual families in the hotel referred to by the Deputy is a matter between the individuals and the Department.</p></reply>

Long-term recipients of jobseeker's allowance (JA) or supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) are eligible for the bonus if they have been in receipt of their payment for 15 months, in recognition of their being wholly or mostly dependent on their social welfare payment for income. </p><p>  Periods of time spent on another qualifying scheme immediately prior to the award of a SWA claim may also be used to establish eligibility, for example which would include time spent on JA.

Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension, all contributions paid or credited over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement.  Since 1961, when contributory pensions were introduced, the average contributions test has been used in calculating pension entitlement.  Once over 16 years of age, the date a person enters into insurable employment is the date used for averaging purposes. </p>  <p>  The homemaker's scheme makes qualification for State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme, which was introduced in and took effect from 1994, allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age (or caring for incapacitated people over that age) to be disregarded when a person's social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes, subject to the standard qualifying conditions for SPC also being satisfied. </p>  <p>  For those with insufficient contributions to meet the requirements for a State pension (contributory), the State pension system provides alternative methods of support.  If their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension, which by default is paid directly to them.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State Pension (non-contributory), amounting to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate. </p>  <p>  The most recently published Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund confirms that the Fund provides better value to female rather than male contributors.  It further confirms that those with lower earnings and those with shorter contribution histories, mostly women, have and will continue to obtain the best value for money from the Fund due to the distributive nature of the Fund. </p>  <p>  Work is underway to replace the 'yearly average' system with a 'total contributions approach'.  Under this approach, the number of contributions recorded over a working life will be more closely reflected in the rate of pension payment received.  It is expected that the total contributions approach to pension qualification will replace the current average contributions test for State pension (contributory) for new pensioners from 2020, although that date is subject to change, as this is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative, and technical challenges to be overcome in its implementation.  The position of women who were homemakers will be considered very carefully in developing this reform.</p></reply>

If the Deputy wishes to provide more specific information, I will arrange that my officials pass this information on to Revenue and the matter can be followed up in greater detail.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that in general the principle of self-assessment applies to taxes administered by Revenue.  The primary responsibility for calculating and paying the correct amounts of tax rests with the taxpayer.  Revenue does of course offer a significant range of supports to the taxpayer to calculate and pay the right amount.</p>  <p>  Any tax return or declaration made by a taxpayer may be subject to a Revenue compliance intervention to ensure the completeness and accuracy of return or declaration.  Where, in that context, a return or declaration is found to be incorrect, giving rise to an under declaration of tax due, Revenue will seek any additional tax, interest and possibly penalties.</p></reply>

To facilitate this, Government policy since 2011 has been focused on ensuring that all viable SMEs have access to an appropriate supply of credit from a diverse range of bank and non-bank sources.  Officials from my Department regularly meet representatives from the SFA, ISME and Chambers Ireland, whose membership encompasses the hotel sector, to discuss issues around access to finance.</p><p>The Central Statistics Office release &quot;Overseas Travel August - October 2015&quot; () shows that in the period January to October 2015, there were over 7.4 million visits to Ireland.  Overall trips to Ireland were up 12.8% in the first ten months of 2015 compared to the same period in 2014.  For the three-month period from August-October 2015, overseas trips to Ireland increased by 14%.</p><p>Tourism delivers income and jobs in every town and city in the country.  The reduction in VAT to 9% in the tourism sector and the abolition of the air travel tax improved Ireland's competitiveness.  The 9% VAT rate is a major benefit to the tourism sector and is much sought after by other sectors in the economy.  I announced changes to the Employment and Investment Incentive scheme last year subject to compliance with European State Aid provisions.  With specific regard to the hospitality sector, I extended the inclusion of hotels, guest houses and self-catering accommodation in the scheme by a further 3 years.  The benefit of these policies can be seen in tourist numbers, new businesses, the survival of established businesses and, most of all, in employment.</p><p>Turning to the banking sector, AIB and Bank of Ireland are concentrating on growing their balance sheets.  In this context, both banks recognise the need to increase business lending and have put on record their commitment to the SME sector. </p><p>My Department has been involved in a range of initiatives to encourage access to credit for small and medium sized businesses.  The SME State Bodies Group provides a forum for the development and implementation of policy measures to enhance SMEs' access to a stable and appropriate supply of finance, and includes representation from F&aacute;ilte Ireland. </p><p>Some of the main policies introduced by this Government to encourage access to credit for small and medium businesses include:  </p><p>- The Supporting SMEs Online Tool, a cross-government initiative, was launched in May 2014.  On answering 8 simple questions, the small business will receive a list of available Government supports.  The Supporting SMEs Online Tool is available at </p><p>- The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland has been established as a means of ensuring that SMEs are provided with sufficient finance for growth.  The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) is an initiative designed to increase the availability of funding to SMEs at a lower cost and on more flexible terms then have recently been available on the Irish Market in recent times.  The SBCI does not lend directly to SMEs. It uses a network of lending partners known as 'on lenders' to make its funds available to SMEs.  Bank of Ireland, AIB, Finance Ireland and Merrion Fleet Management are all current on lending partners of the SBCI.  The SBCI has reached a significant milestone as &euro;110 million has now been drawn down by 3,200 SMEs.  More information on the SBCI can be found on .</p><p>- The Credit Guarantee Scheme encourages additional lending to small businesses by offering a partial Government guarantee to banks against losses on qualifying loans to eligible SMEs.  My colleague, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, has recently brought legislation to the Oireachtas which will enable the development of a more flexible Credit Guarantee Scheme with longer duration and more products and providers included. </p><p>- The Microenterprise Loan Fund, administered by Microfinance Ireland, provides support in the form of loans for up to &euro;25,000, available to start-up, newly established, or growing micro enterprises employing less than 10 people, with viable business propositions.  Microfinance Ireland works in partnership with the Local Enterprise Offices nationally to administer this fund </p><p>- The Credit Review Office helps SME or Farm borrowers who have had an application for credit of up to &euro;3 million declined or reduced by the main banks, and who feel that they have a viable business proposition. They also examine cases where borrowers feel that the terms and conditions of their existing loan, or a new loan offer, are unfairly onerous or have been unreasonably changed to their detriment.  This is a strictly confidential process between the business, the Credit Review Office and the bank.  The Credit Reviewer John Trethowan and his team have overturned 55% of the refusals that have been appealed to the Office.  Further details are available at </p><p>My Department and the Credit Review Office, working with the other relevant Departments and Agencies, will continue to monitor the availability of both bank and non-bank credit on both a macro and sectoral basis in order to ensure that sufficient access to finance is available to facilitate participants in the SME sector to reach their full potential in terms of growth and employment generation.  In this context, the Action Plan for Jobs 2015 includes a dedicated chapter and associated integrated set of actions to support the financing for growth in the SME sector.</p></reply>

This has involved necessary consultations with relevant stakeholders.  The Office of Public Works is working to progress the scheme as quickly as possible and hopes to submit the scheme to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform for approval shortly.  Allowing for the required independent review by the Minister of the scheme's Environmental Impact Statement the OPW would anticipate works commencing in late 2016.</p></reply>

The Commissioner is independent in the exercise of his duties under the Valuation Acts and the making of valuations for rating purposes is his sole prerogative as provided by those Acts.<b></b></p><p>However, I am advised that any ratepayer dissatisfied with the rateability of a property, the valuation assessed on a particular property or the method of calculation can, on payment of the prescribed fee of &euro;250, apply to the Commissioner who in accordance with the provisions of section 28 of the Valuation Act 2001 will appoint a Revision Manager to investigate the rateability or the valuation of a particular property. If dissatisfied with the outcome of the investigation, the applicant has a right of appeal to the Valuation Tribunal, an independent body set up for that purpose. There is also a further right of appeal to the High Court and ultimately to the Supreme Court on a point of law.</p><p>The basic premise under the Act is that all buildings and lands used or developed for any purpose including constructions affixed thereto are rateable unless expressly exempted under Schedule 4. Agricultural land and farm buildings are expressly exempted under Schedule 4. For the purposes of the Acts, farm buildings are buildings, part of buildings, or other structures, occupied together with agricultural land and used solely in connection with the carrying on of agricultural activities on that land.</p><p>Generally speaking equestrian arenas are commercial enterprises and typically include such facilities as stables for horses, a covered riding arena and ancillary buildings to support the enterprise and, as such, do not come under the specific exemptions contained in Schedule 4.</p></reply>

Drainage Districts are areas where drainage schemes to improve land for agricultural purposes were constructed prior to the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945. The statutory duty of maintenance for these schemes lies with the Local Authorities concerned. </p><p>The Office of Public Works (OPW) carries out its own programme of Arterial Drainage Maintenance to a total of 11,500km of river channel and approximately 730km of embankments around the country. These are arterial drainage schemes completed by the OPW under the Arterial Drainage Acts 1945 and 1995, whose purpose was primarily to improve the drainage of agricultural lands to enhance production.  The Glyde &amp;amp; the Dee, the Inny and the Boyne Scheme include river channels within County Cavan. In accordance with its statutory requirements, the OPW maintains these completed schemes in proper repair and in an effective condition to the standard of the original scheme. The annual maintenance programme typically involves some clearance of vegetation and removal of silt build-up on an average five-yearly cycle.</p><p>The Government's core strategy for addressing those areas at most significant risk and impact from flooding is the Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme. Ballyconnell and Cavan Town are the two Areas for Further Assessment (AFAs) being assessed in County Cavan under the CFRAM Programme. These were deemed to be areas of potentially significant risk and impact from flooding under the Preliminary Flood Risk Assessment (PFRA) which was completed in 2011. The County Cavan AFAs are being assessed under the North Western &ndash; Neagh Bann (NW-NB) CFRAM study. Further information is available on the study website: </p><p>A national public consultation on the draft flood maps is ongoing and will run until 23<sup></sup>December 2015. Details are available on the consultation website </p><p>Local flooding issues are a matter, in the first instance, for each Local Authority to investigate and address, and County Councils may carry out flood mitigation works using their own resources.  The OPW operates the Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme for projects estimated to cost less than &euro;500,000.  The purpose of this scheme is to provide funding to Local Authorities to undertake minor flood mitigation works or studies to address localised flooding and coastal protection problems within their administrative areas.  Further details are published on the OPW website .</p></reply>

Under these regulations, dogs must be at least 12 weeks old in order to be vaccinated against rabies and a waiting period of 21 days post (primary) vaccination is necessary for rabies immunity to take effect. Accordingly dogs may not be under 15 weeks of age at time of export.</p><p>The Regulations allow Member States the option of allowing the importation into their territories of dogs, which are less than 12 weeks old and have not received an anti-rabies vaccination or are between 12 and 16 weeks old and have received an anti-rabies vaccination, but 21 days have not elapsed since the completion of the vaccination. The following member states - Austria, Bulgaria Czech Rep., Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Croatia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovenia and Slovakia - and Switzerland have notified the Commission that they are prepared to accept young pups. The remaining Member States including the United Kingdom do not accept young dogs. Almost all of the 250 dogs that are on average exported from Ireland each week are destined for the United Kingdom. </p><p>The Deputy may be aware that immunity from rabies is one of a number of requirements for export of dogs. Other requirements are that dogs must: </p><p>- come from holdings or businesses which are registered by the competent authority and are not subject to any ban on animal health grounds (including rabies), and which undertake to have these animals regularly examined, to notify possible disease and to comply with the requirements ensuring the welfare of the animals held;</p><p>- be identified by means of a microchip (a transponder readable by a device compatible with ISO standard 11785);</p><p>- undergo (within 48 hours prior to the time of dispatch) a clinical examination carried out by an authorised veterinarian, who must verify that the animals show no signs of diseases and are fit to be transported for the intended journey; </p><p>- be individually accompanied by a passport completed and issued by an authorised veterinarian; </p><p>- be accompanied to the place of destination by a health certificate (model in Part 1 of Annex E to Directive 92/65/EEC as last amended by), issued by an official veterinarian of the Member State of dispatch.</p><p>The new EU regulations, which are in place almost 12 months, are designed to facilitate the movement of pets throughout the EU.

The Schemes involved include the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS) and the Areas of Natural Constraints (ANC) Scheme.  Under EU Regulations, all applications must be subjected to robust administrative checks prior to payment. The main element of the administrative check is an area assessment. This is achieved by using the detailed database of individual land parcels. This is known as the Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS) which currently records, electronically, some 1 million individual land parcels and which is required to be kept fully updated.</p>  <p>  The Department&rsquo;s systems in this critical area must meet demanding EU and national audit requirements. Only valid applications under the BPS and ANC that fully comply with the requirements of the EU legislation are paid.  Consequently, all applications under the Schemes are subject to administrative checks. Cases that do not pass the validation process go into error and cannot be paid pending a resolution of the error concerned.  These errors include over-claims, dual claims and incomplete application forms.  In addition, applicants under the ANC scheme must fulfil stocking density and retention requirements. My Department enters into correspondence, mainly through the issuing of query letters to farmers, in order to resolve these error cases. </p>  <p>  My Department has received approximately 123,000 applications under the BPS from applicants who currently hold entitlements and 102,000 applications from those eligible under the ANC scheme. In relation to the BPS and Greening Payment, I am pleased to confirm that advance payments began issuing in Ireland on 16 October 2015.   This is the earliest that payments can commence under the governing EU Regulations.  In addition, I can confirm that the level of the advance payment was set at 70% for 2015 rather than the normal 50%.  The increase in the advance payment for 2015 is, in particular, due to the difficulties encountered in the dairying and pigmeat sectors. The balancing payments commenced issuing as scheduled on 1 December.   </p>  <p>  Despite the extension of the closing date for the receipt of applications by two weeks, with a consequent reduction of the processing time available, Ireland was among the earliest to pay the BPS/Greening in the European Union. To date, in excess of 119,000 farmers have received payments totalling &euro;1.054 billion - this represents 97% of the applicants. There is no rationale for partial payments, using scarce IT and processing resources, when the Department is targeting a payment figure of 99% by Christmas. In relation to the ANC Scheme, I can confirm that payments commenced, on schedule, on 23 September. To date, in excess of 89,600 farmers have received payments totalling &euro;191 million. Certain of the outstanding farmers will not be paid until next year when they achieve the stocking requirements of the scheme. It is not possible to pay until these farmers are compliant with the terms and conditions of the scheme.   </p>  <p>  As outstanding BPS, Greening and ANC cases are fully processed and are cleared of any outstanding error, they will be processed for payment.  My Department is prioritising the processing of all such outstanding cases with regular payment runs continuing over the coming weeks for all fully processed cases.</p></reply>

This helpline is aimed at providing assistance to farmers, and is dealing with farmers on a one-to-one basis where there is a risk of animal welfare.  Farmers who are experiencing particular difficulty arising from the flooding should contact the helpline at Call Save 0761 064408 or Phone 01 6072379.</p>  <p>  Alongside my Department&rsquo;s Animal Welfare Helpline, I have asked Teagasc to provide dedicated on-farm practical advice and assistance to farmers in flooded areas and ensure farming operations are supported. Contact should be made using the helpline number 0761 113555.</p>  <p>  I have also prioritised payments to farmers at this time. At this point, the vast majority of farmers have been paid over &euro;1.2 billion in EU payments under the Basic Payment Scheme and the Areas of Natural Constraint Scheme (formerly Disadvantaged Areas Scheme) this year. Given that a completely new payment regime has been introduced, this is a significant achievement and I am committed to issuing remaining payments as individual issues are resolved around applications. Payments under other schemes such as REPS/AEOS have been made along with GLAS and Beef Data and Genomics Scheme payments which are being prioritised.   </p></reply>

The funding for any such FIs would have to draw on Ireland&rsquo;s existing RDP allocation of European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development funding as well as National Exchequer funding.</p>  <p>  So far 7 Programmes from 5 Member States have implemented a FI for the current programme period. In order to include a FI as a measure in a RDP an Ex ante assessment is required by EU regulation. This assessment can take between 3 months to a year to complete.</p>  <p>  Once this is done, an agreement must be reached between my Department and any other potential stakeholders/financial institutions on a clear investment strategy that is developed from the gaps, if any, identified in the ex ante assessment. Following this, a new measure description would have to be drafted and inserted into the RDP by way of an amendment. FIs can only be introduced to the RDP this way and currently only one amendment is allowed per year; this could mean that the FI assessment would not be completed in time for Ireland&rsquo;s next amendment in 2016. The European Commission have, however, proposed a change to the Regulation in order to allow Member States to lodge a separate amendment to the RDP in respect of Financial Instruments and this will be decided on in the near future. While this would allow greater flexibility in terms of inserting an FI measure into the RDP, the timeframe from assessment to Commission approval means that the whole process could still take a year or more.</p>  <p>  In the interim my Department has been exploring new and more competitive sources of funding for Irish Agriculture and will continue to do so in the context of evolving market requirements. For example, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, which includes the European Investment Bank as one of its funding partners, launched a new &lsquo;Agriculture Investment Loans&rsquo; product earlier this year. This credit is available at favourable terms for investments by agricultural SMEs involved in primary agricultural production, the processing of agricultural products or the marketing of agricultural products. The features of these products compared with those currently on the market are lower interest rates, loan amounts up to &euro;5 million and increased repayment flexibility. Of the almost &euro;45 million in loans approved and drawn down by SMEs between March and end-June from the SBCI, a third has been accessed by the agricultural sector, including farmers.</p></reply>

As the Deputy will appreciate, substantial changes to legislation as well as new administrative systems in the Department of Social Protection are needed before the benefit and leave arrangements can be implemented. The proposed commencement date of September 2016 is therefore necessary to ensure that all these necessary requirements are in place before paternity leave and payment of paternity benefit can commence.</p>  <p>  This is a very important reform of our family leave arrangements, but it does need time to implement. Whatever commencement date is selected, it will inevitably only cater for cases that arise after that date.</p></reply>

Two men, Hugh Watters and Jack Rooney, were killed when a car bomb exploded outside a licensed premises known as Kay&rsquo;s Tavern and many more people were injured by the explosion. As we approach the fortieth anniversary of this bombing our thoughts are with the families of those who were killed and those who were injured. I extend my sincere sympathies to all of the victims of this attack. </p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that an extensive criminal investigation was carried out at the time of this attack - indeed this is set out in detail in the Barron Inquiry Report - and that it has been comprehensively reviewed subsequently. It is a matter of regret that nobody has been held accountable for this crime. However, the Garda investigation file remains open and any new or additional evidence will be pursued fully.</p>  <p>  This bombing was among a number of incidents that were the subject of a comprehensive inquiry conducted by the late Mr Justice Henry Barron and considered subsequently by a sub-committee of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights. The Barron Inquiry concluded that the bombing was carried out by loyalist extremists who were most probably associated with the Mid-Ulster UVF. This bombing is one among a number of troubles-related violent incidents, including killings, in respect of which allegations have been made of collusion between security forces and paramilitary groups.</p>  <p>  I have requested the Garda Commissioner to provide me with a report on the current situation and on any developments with regard to the bombing and the Garda investigation and I will communicate further with the Deputy when that is to hand.</p></reply>

The premises will provide initial accommodation on a rolling basis to groups of Programme Refugees in the immediate period following their arrival in Ireland. Adult refugees undergo an eight week cultural orientation programme prior to their resettlement in locations, agreed between the OPMI and local authorities, throughout the State.  As an assistance to their orientation programme, children with refugee status are provided with an education programme.  Links to services such as health, transport etc., are also provided for families.</p>  <p>  It is established best practice that on arrival in a new country, refugees need time to rest after what has been a traumatic experience, a very long journey and to acclimatise to their new environment.

Outings to local places of interest will generally be organised at weekends as well as activities for the children.

The HRB is a statutory body under the aegis of the Department of Health and is the lead agency in Ireland supporting and funding health research.  The HRB has a current annual budget  in the region of &euro;40m.</p>  <p>  I am aware of the valuable work of the MRCG and the Deputy may be aware that since 2006, the work of the Medical Research Charities Group (MRCG) has been supported by my Department through annual funding to the Health Research Board (HRB) for the co-funding of research projects with medical research charities.  The level of funding is currently at &euro;900,000 per annum.  This innovative joint funding scheme allows members of the MRCG to support clearly defined research projects in disease areas and patient populations of specific interest to each individual charity, where they might otherwise not be in a position to finance the full cost of that research.  Officials in my Department recently met with representatives of the MRCG and discussed ways in which the Department can support the organisation during 2016.</p>  <p>  Developments in the health sector structures such as the appointment of a Chief Academic Officer to the management teams of the Hospital Groups will put research on the agenda of the healthcare system at a high level.  That, combined with a commitment by my Department to drive a research, evidence and data analytics agenda are important enablers for driving the research agenda.  Indeed, a new Assistant Secretary for Research and Development and Health Analytics, was recently appointed in my Department.  This appointment is further evidence of how I view the crucial importance of health research and data to providing the foundations for sound health policies, practices and outcomes. </p>  <p>  I am committed to embedding research and evidence at the heart of health policy and practice.  My Department is working with the HSE to ensure that this agenda is driven and supported in a co-ordinated way at corporate level by the Executive.  As part of this process options will be explored on how best this can be achieved.  </p>  <p>  In respect of the other areas raised I can inform the Deputy that a revised General Scheme of the Health Information and Patient Safety Bill was approved by Government in November and the Bill is expected  to be published in 2016.  It is  also envisaged that the Heads of the Human Tissue Bill will be progressed in 2016.</p>  <p>  The National Rare Disease Plan recommended that an Oversight Implementation Group of relevant stakeholders led by the HSE and including patients' groups, be established to oversee and monitor implementation of the plan's recommendations.  This group was established by my Department earlier this year and it has met on a number of occasions.  One of the principal recommendations in the Plan was the establishment of a National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases.  This programme will be responsible for, among others: Mapping, developing and implementing care pathways for rare diseases; facilitating timely access to centres of expertise - nationally and internationally; developing treatment guidelines for many rare disorders; and developing care pathways with European Reference Centres for those ultra-rare disorders where there may not be sufficient expertise in Ireland.</p></reply>

Prior to reimbursing any medicine, the HSE considers a range of statutory criteria, including clinical need, cost-effectiveness and the resources available to the HSE.</p>  <p>  The decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds by the HSE on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE).  They are not political or ministerial decisions.  The NCPE conducts the health technology assessment of pharmaceutical products for the HSE, and can make recommendations on reimbursement to assist the HSE in its decision-making process.  </p>  <p>  Vertex Pharmaceuticals, the manufacturer of Orkambi, submitted a Rapid Review application for the drug to the NCPE on 26 November 2015.  The company is expected to submit a full pricing and reimbursement application to the HSE/Primary Care Reimbursement Service in the immediate future. </p>  <p>  Once this application is received, it will be considered by the HSE in line with criteria set out in the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 and using the processes outlined in national pricing framework agreements.</p></reply>

It is not the standard of care that anyone aspires to.</p>  <p>  You will appreciate that I receive a large volume of requests to meet individual patients or their families to discuss their cases.  It is not practical for me to do so in all cases and as you know, I do not have the authority to intervene in individual patient cases anyway.  I am concerned about creating the impression or expectation that I can. That is not my role and in some cases it is even unlawful to do so. </p>  <p>  You will know from the recent Patient Safety Conference about my plans to extend the remit of the Ombudsman to examine clinical matters where the complainant is not satisfied with the response or the hospital or provider.  This will require a change in legislation but I am committed to this proposal.  The Ombudsman can already examine non-clinical issues.</p>  <p>  In this particular case, I think the most appropriate course of action would be a meeting with the hospital CEO or Chairman to discuss the report in the first instance as any changes will have to be made by the hospital which has its own management and board.</p>  <p>  If on foot of that meeting there are still issues that fall into my remit and could be resolved by my personal attention, I shall be happy to reconsider the request on that basis.</p>  <p>  I have asked the hospital to provide me with a copy of the report so that I can read it. They may need to ask permission from the next of kin to this.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, I cannot comment in detail on individual cases.

Ultimately, the decision to release him will be made solely by the Egyptian authorities. Irrespective of any views regarding the fairness or appropriateness of any arrest abroad, the reality is that where an Irish citizen is charged with an offence under the law of a foreign country, it is the foreign law that applies and it is the relevant foreign court which decides matters such as bail and release. </p>  <p>  All actions taken in this case are considered in light of the Government&rsquo;s clear objectives.  First, to see our citizen released by the Egyptian authorities so that he can return to his family and his studies in Ireland, and second to provide consular support for his welfare while he remains in detention.  The considered approach and sustained action that has been taken by my Department to date in this case has been to further these objectives, and most importantly to avoid any action that could be counterproductive or detrimental to his best interests. </p>  <p>  I have engaged closely with the European Union&rsquo;s High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice President of the Commission, Ms. Federica Mogherini, in regard to this citizen&rsquo;s detention and our actions are both carefully considered and closely coordinated.  The Government&rsquo;s Embassy in Cairo is also in frequent contact with the European External Action Service and other European delegations in Egypt. </p>  <p>  My Department retains the flexibility to adapt its approach as and when that may be required, and I will continue to cooperate closely with the relevant stakeholders. </p>  <p>  The matter raised in regard to visits was dealt with privately between my Department and this citizen&rsquo;s family at a meeting last week.  It would not be appropriate to publicly address matters relating to the consular assistance provided to a citizen in public. </p>  <p>  I can confirm that the citizen&rsquo;s trial has indeed begun, with ten adjournments so far.  While the stage of substantive hearings has not yet commenced, the case is considered to be in process, as would also be the case in the Irish judicial system.  I have expressed my deep dissatisfaction at the lengthy adjournments to both Foreign Minister Shoukry and Ambassador Gendi, and will continue to intervene on this citizen&rsquo;s behalf at the appropriate times and in the appropriate ways. </p>  <p>  As both I and the Taoiseach have reported previously to the House, an application for this citizen&rsquo;s release under the Presidential Decree/Law 140 was made in February of this year by the citizen&rsquo;s Egyptian lawyer.  That application was formally supported by the Irish Government by way of diplomatic note and has been followed up on in subsequent meetings with Egyptian officials.  The Egyptian authorities are in no doubt as to the Government&rsquo;s desire to see this citizen released at the earliest possible opportunity.</p></reply>

We work closely with local and international non-governmental organisations to strengthen their capacity to respond to gender-based violence and to support the development and implementation of laws which prevent such violence from occurring.  Our work in this area was recognised by the OECD last year which praised Ireland for the &ldquo;effective agenda setting role it plays on gender equality and women&rsquo;s empowerment&rdquo; including being &ldquo;a powerful force behind the stronger donor focus on tackling violence against women&rdquo;. </p>  <p>  Through its funding to Irish non-governmental organisations, Irish Aid supports a range of programmes focused on the elimination of gender-based violence.  The Department also collaborates very closely with Irish non-governmental organisations through its membership Irish Consortium on Gender-based Violence, a unique grouping of Irish development and humanitarian organizations and the Irish Defence Forces.  The Consortium works to build its members&rsquo; capacity to respond to all forms of gender-based violence in conflict, post-conflict and long-term development contexts and to advocate for the elimination of gender based violence, globally. </p>  <p>  This year, Irish Aid has renewed its partnership with the UN Trust Fund to End Violence against Women.  The Trust Fund is a unique multi-lateral grant-making mechanism exclusively devoted to supporting the work of local non-governmental organisations in developing organisations focused on addressing violence against women and girls.  Since its establishment in 2006, the Trust Fund has awarded $103 million to projects in 136 countries.  I expect that Irish Aid&rsquo;s support to the Trust Fund will continue next year. </p>  <p>  As women and girls are particularly vulnerable to sexual and gender-based violence in emergency situations, Irish Aid prioritises their protection in its humanitarian action.  Earlier this year, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade launched Ireland&rsquo;s second National Action Plan on Women, Peace and Security (2015-2018).  In addition to identifying concrete commitments which will ensure the protection of women and girls in conflict, the new Plan also places an increased focus on the importance of women&rsquo;s empowerment and participation in decision-making in conflict and post-conflict situations.</p>  <p>  At the European level, Ireland has been actively engaged in ensuring commitments by the Foreign Affairs Council to combat gender-based violence, including two sets of Council Conclusions focused on gender and development, in May and October of this year.  In October, the Council launched the EU&rsquo;s second Gender Action Plan (2016-2020), placing an emphasis on the importance of preventing and responding to such violence in emergencies, including in EU and Member State development programmes.</p></reply>

That was the case when I last met Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond in London on 23 November.  I explained to him why the UK&rsquo;s place in the EU matters as much as it does to us and outlined our determination to be as helpful as we can be in the negotiations that lay ahead.  This meeting was the third formal meeting between us in the last 12 months, with the previous two meetings having taken place in Dublin.  We also meet more informally at meetings of EU Foreign Ministers and in other fora.</p>  <p>  The British Government understands our approach to their relationship with the European Union.  The subject regularly arises not just in my discussions with my UK counterpart but also in exchanges between the Taoiseach and Prime Minister Cameron and between our Minister of State for European Affairs and his British counterpart.  Both the Taoiseach and I have also spoken publically in Britain about the potential negative implications for Ireland of a UK withdrawal from the Union to influential audiences such as the British Irish Association, the Confederation of British Industry and Chatham House.</p>  <p>  We are working hard as well to ensure that the Northern Ireland dimension to this debate is taken fully into account by the UK government.  That is because the Government believes that the EU has been a real force for good for everyone in the North, whether in terms of supporting the peace process or by helping to create jobs and growth.  I have made this point in discussions with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Theresa Villiers, with whom I have worked closely since the summer of 2014.  Earlier this month I also spoke at a conference at Queen&rsquo;s University Belfast along with the Northern Ireland Minister for Finance and Personnel, Arlene Foster.  At that conference, I outlined why the uncertainty of a UK withdrawal from the EU would be bad not just for the North but for Ireland as a whole. </p>  <p>  The immediate challenge &ndash; including at tomorrow&rsquo;s European Council &ndash; is to work with both the UK and our other 26 EU partners to reach an agreement that both addresses UK concerns and is acceptable to every EU Member State.  While a deal is unlikely to be reached this week, we hope that the foundations can be put in place so that a solution can be achieved in early 2016. </p>  <p>  The question of the UK&rsquo;s future within the European Union will, however, ultimately be decided by the British people.  While Ireland has much at stake &ndash; and the Government will continue to make its voice heard in the debate &ndash; we need to remain respectful of the democratic process underway in our neighbouring country.</p></reply>

The conflict in Syria - the biggest driver behind this year&rsquo;s migrant flows - has led to the world&rsquo;s largest humanitarian crisis.  But the problem is bigger than Syria.  An estimated 60 million displaced people worldwide are on the move, the highest since World War II.  They are coming not just from Syria but from such places such as Afghanistan, Iraq, Gaza and a dozen or so countries in sub-Saharan and North Africa.</p>  <p>  For most of this year Migration has been at the very top of the EU agenda.  There have been no fewer than five special meetings of Justice and Home Affairs ministers devoted to migration while Heads of State and Government have debated the issue in three special councils.  I and my foreign minister colleagues have also addressed the issue many times this year.</p>  <p>  In June, the Foreign Affairs Council launched EUNAVFOR Med, the EU&rsquo;s naval operation to disrupt the dangerous activities of people smugglers in the Mediterranean, which have tragically resulted in the loss of many lives. As the Deputy will know, the crews of the L.E. Niamh, Eithne and Samuel Beckett have done sterling work in saving more than 8,500 lives. </p>  <p>  In September, the Government decided accept up to 4,000 asylum seekers and refugees as part of the European Commission&rsquo;s comprehensive plan to address the migration crisis. </p>  <p>  As part of its efforts to develop a comprehensive strategy to address the refugee crisis, the EU organised two high level conferences earlier this year.  On 8 October, a conference focusing on migration flows into the EU through the Eastern Mediterranean and Western Balkans route took place in Luxembourg attended by both JHA and Foreign Ministers.  The Conference issued a Declaration endorsing a five-pronged approach to addressing the migration challenge. </p>  <p>  On 11/12 November EU Heads of State and Government met their African counterparts at a migration summit in Valletta.  They agreed to establish a Trust Fund to address the root causes of migration in Africa.  The &euro;1.8 billion Fund is to be augmented by EU member state contributions. Ireland is contributing &euro;3m. </p>  <p>  On 29 November, there was a key meeting of EU Heads of Government with Turkey in Brussels at which the EU agreed to provide a financial package worth &euro;3 billion to help Turkey accommodate the more than two million refugees residing in the country.  As part of the agreement there is to be a concerted effort by Turkey to stem the flow of irregular migrants through its territory. This agreement &ndash; or Joint Plan of Action &ndash; presents a real opportunity to stem the flow of such migrants into the EU.</p></reply>

Globally, there are now more than 59 million people displaced, more than at any time since the Second World War. </p>  <p>  Ireland is firmly committed to responding to the humanitarian needs of those affected by these crises.  Our most significant humanitarian contribution in recent years has been for the people affected by the appalling conflict in Syria, which has created the world&rsquo;s largest humanitarian crisis.  More than 250,000 Syrians have been killed, 6.6 million people are displaced within Syria, and over 4.2 million have had to flee the country in search of safety.  Some 13.5 million people, well over half of Syria&rsquo;s population, are in need of urgent humanitarian assistance. </p>  <p>  Ireland is particularly mindful of the impact of the crisis on Syria&rsquo;s immediate neighbours &ndash; Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey and Iraq &ndash; which have been generous hosts to huge numbers of desperate people, putting huge strain on their own resources. </p>  <p>  We have been supporting efforts to assist refugees affected by the Syria crisis, providing needs-based humanitarian assistance since 2012. </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s humanitarian aid is implemented by our UN, NGO and Red Cross partners, and has helped to provide food, shelter and medical care to those who need it. </p>  <p>  At the Pledging Conference in Kuwait in March 2015, Ireland pledged &euro;12 million in humanitarian assistance for the Syrian crisis this year.  Earlier this week, I announced an additional package of &euro;2.95 million in humanitarian assistance to Syria and the region, bringing the total given in 2015 to &euro;13 million. </p>  <p>  With the number of people in need of humanitarian assistance within Syria greatly exceeding the number of refugees who have fled their home country, I have ensured that half of this package is focused on their needs. </p>  <p>  With more than 2 million children in Syria, and 700,000 across the region not in school, there is a high risk of creating a generation of under-qualified and disaffected youth.  To support the No Lost Generation initiative, which supports education, child protection and engagement of adolescents in their communities, &euro;1 million goes to UNICEF. </p>  <p>  Additionally, &euro;500,000 goes to UNICEF in Jordan for water and sanitation work in the Azraq refugee camp, improving living conditions for Syrian refugees there, and increasing sustainability in this long drawn out crisis. </p>  <p>  By the end of 2015, Ireland will have provided over &euro;42 million to the Syrian people since the beginning of the crisis. I am determined that Ireland will continue to provide appropriate humanitarian assistance to the Syrian people. </p>  <p>  The Syria crisis remains high on the European agenda. On 23 September last, an Emergency European Council was held to address the crisis, resulting in further funding being given.  Since then, the European Council of 15 October, and the informal European Council of 15 November have discussed the crisis in the context of migration.  The Foreign Affairs Councils of 12 October and 16 November both featured Syria prominently on their agendas. </p>  <p>  The EU, collectively, is the world&rsquo;s largest humanitarian donor, and has been a leading donor in response to the Syrian crisis.  The EU (European Commission and Member States) has provided some &euro;4.4 billion in humanitarian assistance to the Syrian people since the beginning of this crisis.  This crisis will remain on the EU&rsquo;s agenda, and will remain a humanitarian priority for the EU, as it is for Ireland.</p></reply>

This provides for an expedited schedule to implement all recommendations of the report which I have accepted to be implemented through appropriate legislative, regulatory and policy level changes in 2016.  Both reports are available to download on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following weblinks: <font color="#1F497D">.</font></p><p>A separate review follows on from the Order made by the High Court on 14 June 2013, quashing that part of my Department&rsquo;s <i>Planning Review Report (2012)</i>relating to Donegal, following a settlement between my Department and the party concerned who had brought judicial review proceedings in respect of that part of the Report.  The matter has been disposed of to the satisfaction of both sides.  In light of these proceedings, my Department subsequently sought the advice of the Attorney General on how best to proceed in the case of issues raised in relation to planning matters in Donegal.  Taking account of advice from the Office of the Attorney General my Department has appointed, on a non-statutory basis, Senior Counsel to prepare a review report in relation to these matters and a report is awaited.</p><p>In addition, I have received approval from Government to publish the Planning and Development (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2015 which will be available on the Houses of the Oireachtas website shortly.  The Bill provides for the establishment of an Office of the Planning Regulator, which will be independent of my Department and whose primary functions will include powers to facilitate enhanced oversight of the planning system by undertaking assessments and evaluations of local development plans, variations of development plans, local area plans and regional spatial and economic strategies to ensure compliance with proper planning and sustainable development particularly regional and national planning policy and guidelines; undertaking research, education and training programmes; and undertaking reviews of the organisation and the systems and procedures used by planning authorities or An Bord Plean&aacute;la in the performance of their planning functions under the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, including a review of any potential risks of corruption in the conduct of their functions. <font color="#376092"> </font></p><p>Part 15 of the Local Government Act 2001 provides an ethics framework for both elected members and employees working in local government.

Elected members are prohibited from speaking or voting at meetings on issues where they have a beneficial interest while employees must refrain from seeking to influence a decision of a local authority in cases where they have a beneficial interest.  The Act also prohibits elected members and employees from seeking, accepting or exacting any fee, reward or other favour for anything done by virtue of a person&rsquo;s office or employment.  My Department has also issued codes of conduct under Part 15 of the Act for the guidance of elected members and employees in carrying out their functions. </p></reply>

Ireland aims to meet this target mainly through the increased use of sustainable biofuels with electric vehicles also making a small contribution.</p>  <p>  The Biofuels Obligation Scheme was introduced in July 2010 as the primary means through which Ireland would meet the transport target and is the principal support for the uptake of biofuels in Ireland. The scheme works by obligating road transport fuel suppliers to bring increasing amounts of biofuel to the transport fuel market. This has seen increased amounts of biofuel used in Ireland since the scheme was introduced and, in 2014, almost 167 million litres of biofuels were placed on the Irish transport fuel market. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Electric Vehicle Grant Scheme supports and incentivises, through grants of up to &euro;5,000, the deployment of electric vehicles in Ireland. These grants are in addition to the Vehicle Registration Tax reliefs of up to &euro;5,000 which apply to electric vehicles (EVs). In addition, where technically feasible, customers who qualify for the grant also qualify for a free domestic charge point installed by the ESB. In 2015, 547 new EVs have been supported through the Electric Vehicle Grant Scheme which represents more than half of the total of the 1,082 EVs supported since the programme began in 2011.</p>  <p>  In 2014, 5.2% of transport energy requirements were from renewable sources.</p></reply>

Works will include the completion of the City Centre Resignalling Programme for the rail network and the construction of a new Central Traffic Control Centre for commuter and intercity rail.  This additional funding will also enable major transport projects, including new Metro North and DART Expansion Programme, to proceed. </p><p>With regard to roads projects, the transport element of the Capital Plan provides that work will commence on several roads projects which are targeted at removing critical bottlenecks or upgrading inadequate sections of road.  In this context, Transport Infrastructure Ireland  (in relation to national roads) and my Department (in relation to regional and local roads) is assessing how best to progress projects over the 7 years of the plan taking into account annual budget allocations. The progression of projects which have not yet received planning approval will of course be conditional on achieving the necessary approvals. The timeframe for progressing individual projects will be decided once TII's assessment process is completed.</p><p>The Government proposes to undertake a Mid-Term Review of the new Capital Plan, which will take stock of progress and provide the Government with an opportunity to reaffirm priority projects. This Review will also provide the Government with an opportunity to consider the scope for increased levels of investment, should Ireland's economic growth and fiscal progress exceed the present forecasts, and the next Capital Plan (post-2021) will also be formulated in that context.</p></reply>

These Directives ensure the protection of endangered habitats and species, which have been selected for conservation within Special Areas of Conservation or Special Protection Areas. These Directives have been transposed into Irish law, primarily through the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011.</p><p>Under these Regulations, my consent, as Minister, may be required in some instances for alteration to the bed or banks of watercourses and waterbodies. However, in most cases, such works require the consent of other authorities, such as the Office of Public Works. In undertaking or consenting to works, the relevant authorities must comply with the legal obligations of the relevant EU Directives, as transposed into Irish law. </p><p>In the exercise of their functions, all public authorities have a responsibility to ensure the conservation of protected habitats and species and to ensure Ireland&rsquo;s compliance with its legal obligations.</p><p>In order to address the legal complexity, my Department worked closely with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, the Office of Public Works, local authorities and other agencies of the State that have responsibilities regarding those Directives and Acts to address as expeditiously as possible the steps that needed to be taken to address the damage caused by storms and flooding in late 2013 and 2014. This led to the publication of a &ldquo;<i>Guide to Works and Development Consents for Repairing Infrastructure Damaged in Storms or other Emergency Events</i>&rdquo;. This guide was published in early 2014 by the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Planning, with input and advice from several Departments, including my own Department.</p><p>In the context of the recent floods, my Department has been attending the meetings at the National Emergency Coordination Centre to contribute, as appropriate to the response.</p></reply>

This Scheme is being developed by the Office of Public Works (OPW). The proposed development is located within and adjacent to a European site and various protected habitats and species therein are protected under Irish and European law, including the Freshwater Pearl Mussel.</p>  <p>  The planning and environmental team acting on behalf of the OPW contacted my Department in 2014 seeking a consultation on the environmental assessment requirements with regard to this project, including an Environmental Impact Assessment scoping. My Department provided observations and information in relation to the environmental assessment requirements, including in respect of the Natura Impact Statement, which must be prepared in order to facilitate the undertaking of an Appropriate Assessment by the relevant consent authorities in due course. My officials met with the project team earlier this year to assist them further in their preparation in this regard.</p>  <p>  In the context of the recent floods, my Department has been attending the meetings at the National Emergency Coordination Centre to contribute, as appropriate to the response.</p></reply>
