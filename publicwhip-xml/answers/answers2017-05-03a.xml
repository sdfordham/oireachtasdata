My officials have been progressing work on the Review process, including putting in place the Review structures, drawing up the Terms of Reference, assessing external expertise requirements, and considering options for stakeholder consultation.  </p><p>The review is being led by my Department and will be overseen by a Steering Group.  The Steering Group is in place and includes senior officials from my Department and the Departments of the Taoiseach and Public Expenditure and Reform, the HSE, and experts with a clinical and academic background.  The Steering Group met for the first time in March, and is meeting again this month.  Also, an independent peer group of international health experts has been established to review and validate the review methodology and findings. </p><p>The Terms of Reference for the review are as follows:</p><p>a)  To determine and review current capacity, both public and private, in the health system and benchmark with international comparators;</p><p>b)  To determine drivers of future demand and estimate impact on capacity requirements to 2030; </p><p>c)  To consider and analyse how key reforms to the model of care will impact on future capacity requirements across the system; and</p><p>d)  To provide an overall assessment, including prioritisation and sequencing, of future capacity requirements on a phased basis for the period 2017 &ndash; 2030 at a national and regional level, cognisant of resource availability.</p><p>My Department has recently gone out to tender for technical, analytical and engagement expertise to assist in the Review process.</p><p>It is essential that this review is progressed sufficiently to enable it to feed into the mid-term review of the capital programme, which will take place later in the year.  While the review will consider capacity requirements over the next decade or so, I am also anxious that it also provides a short-term focus and determine how capital and other investment over the coming years can be best targeted, given the current pressures being experienced within our hospital services.  </p><p>I look forward to the emerging findings later in the year.</p></reply>

Referrals are accepted from G.P&rsquo;s, Public Health Nurses, Senior Medical Officers, Teachers and Parents and urgent cases are prioritised.</p><p>I have been informed by the HSE that there continues to be an increase in referral rates to the Primary Care Occupational<b></b>Therapy<b></b>Services in the Cork and Kerry Community Healthcare Organisation area.  The number of referrals for the months January to March 2017 have increased by 20% on the same period last year which is impacting on the numbers waiting more than a year for occupational therapy services. </p><p>To address the waiting list issue, a pilot initiative to deal with children aged 3 to 5 years, which will have the effect of reducing the waiting lists overall in an 8 month period, is currently under consideration.  If approved, this pilot initiative will get underway later this year.  </p><p>This initiative is in addition to the current work of the HSE National Therapy Service Review Group established to address therapy waiting times, including those for access to Occupational Therapies.  This joint Primary Care and Social Care project will include a detailed analysis of waiting times and resource deployment across the country.  It will seek to make the services more responsive to people's needs and also to put in place a standardised approach to the delivery of Occupational Therapy services across the country.</p></reply>

Many of our largest and most developed health service providers are voluntary organisations, some with religious involvement.  </p>  <p>  Ireland is not unique in the participation of voluntary organisations, including those with religious involvement, in the delivery of publicly funded healthcare.  However, it is proper that the frameworks within which service providers operate in delivering publicly funded heath services are subject to ongoing consideration.</p>  <p>  In recent years, the nature of the relationship between voluntary organisations and the State has been clarified in a number of ways.  The HSE operates a robust Governance Framework which governs grant-funding provided to all Non-Statutory Service Providers and provides for detailed service level agreements.  In the voluntary sector, it is required practice for public capital investment to be accompanied by a lien which protects the State's interest.  All public hospitals are regulated by HIQA and are subject to national clinical standards and guidelines. Moreover, as part of the establishment of hospital groups, voluntary hospitals will be required to plan and deliver services in a manner which integrates service provision with HSE-owned hospitals in the region.  These arrangements and controls are what are paramount in ensuring high quality care and patient safety, robust operational and clinical governance, and value for State investments.</p>  <p>  I am open to giving further consideration to these relationships and the statutory and other controls which support the use of public funds to deliver health policy.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-05-03a.19.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017050300058#WRA01300"><p>In September the HSE launched its Winter Initiative Plan which provided &euro;40 million of additional funding for winter preparedness.  The Initiative concluded at the end of March.  </p>  <p>  A range of practical measures to address ED overcrowding were implemented, including 90 additional beds, aids and appliances for over 4,450 patients, around 1,000 extra homecare packages and 615 additional transitional care bed approvals.   </p>  <p>  During the Winter Initiative delayed discharges reduced from 638 in September 2016 to 434 in December and were maintained below 500 from mid-December through to end February.  This had a positive impact on trolley numbers and freed-up beds for use by patients awaiting admission.  Further, since the start of 2017 there have been approximately 5% less patients waiting on trolleys nationally compared to the same period last year. </p>  <p>  However, since the start of 2017, there has been an increase of around 20% in trolley numbers at Sligo University Hospital.  During March, Sligo ED experienced an increase of nearly 9% in attendances, on March 2016. </p>  <p>  Following the Winter Initiative my Department and the HSE are currently engaged in a process to commence winter planning for next year and to achieve an improvement trajectory in ED performance.  A key learning from this year's Initiative has been the need to put in place measures to support capacity and process improvement in Model 3 hospitals. </p>  <p>  As such, the HSE's Special Delivery Unit will be working closely with Sligo University Hospital to identify improvements that can be made to support patient flow through the Hospital, reduce trolley numbers and improve patients' ED experience.</p></reply>

The assessment of need must commence within three months of receipt of a completed application and must be completed within a further three months. </p>  <p>  There were a total of 3,960 applications overdue for completion at the end of 2016. </p>  <p>  The HSE recognises that it faces significant challenges in respect of meeting the statutory time-frames which apply to the assessment of need process.  Targeted action plans have been in place since early 2011 and measures have included prioritising assessments, holding additional clinics, using therapist in private practices and reconfiguring resources to target areas of greatest need. </p>  <p>  In accordance with the Social Care Operational Plan 2017, the HSE has committed to improving Disability Act compliance for assessment of need with a particular emphasis on putting in place improvement plans for CHOs that have substantial compliance challenges. </p>  <p>  The above measures will have a positive impact on the provision of clinical services for all children requiring access to health related supports. It is expected that the reconfiguration of services under Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People (0-18s) Programme will have a significant impact on our ability to comply with the statutory time-frames set out in the Disability Act and the accompanying regulations</p>  <p>  The requested breakdown in tabular format will be forwarded to the Deputy.</p></reply>

The Board of the new NMH will comprise nine directors; four nominated by St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group, four by NMH, including the Master, and one will be an international expert in obstetrics and gynaecology.  Two of the NMH Directors will also sit on the St.Vincent&rsquo;s Board.</font></p><p>The agreement ensures that a full range of health services will be available at the NMH at Elm Park without religious, ethnic or other distinction.  In that regard, I welcome the confirmation by the Board of <font color="#2F2F2F">St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group</font>that any medical procedure, which is in accordance with the laws of this State, will be carried out at the new hospital.</p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">  I should also acknowledge that the St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group is making valuable land available, at no cost to the State, to facilitate the new NMH.  In doing so, they have foregone the opportunity to put this land to alternative use.</font></p><p>Now that the planning application for the development has been submitted we must now turn our focus to the legal mechanisms necessary to complete the project.  The hospital will be publicly funded, built on lands in the ownership of the <font color="#2F2F2F">St. Vincent&rsquo;s </font>and operated by the new company.  Over the next few weeks I will meet with both hospitals and will consider further the legal mechanisms necessary to absolutely protect the State's considerable investment in the hospital, including the issue of ownership of the new facility.  I have indicated that, prior to the HSE entering into any construction contract, I will formally sanction the necessary arrangements to ensure that the facilities are legally secured on an on-going basis for the delivery of publicly funded maternity, gynaecology and neonatal services commitments.  I should add that over the years we have made very significant capital investment in voluntary hospitals, and such facilities have always continued to be used for the delivery of publicly funded healthcare as intended. </p><p>I intend to report to Government on this project at the end of May.  At that stage I expect to have further details on the legal and other arrangements envisaged and will make this information available publicly.  This will allow for the necessary clarity well in advance of contractual or other commitments being entered into in respect of this project.</p><p>Finally, I would like reaffirm my commitment to this hugely important project.  The facilities at Holles St. are no longer fit for purpose.  It is also acknowledged that for optimal clinical outcomes, maternity services should be co-located with adult acute services.  We need to move on with this project and provide women and infants with modern healthcare facilities.  I look forward to working with all stakeholders to deliver this new NMH.</p></reply>

An Order requiring the defendants to make Discovery was made in the High Court on 28 November 2016 in the most advanced case.  Discovery is a legal process which must be carried out in accordance with Orders made by the Courts and both the Department of Health and the HSE are working to comply with the Order made in this case.  However, the size and complexity of the Discovery means that this is not a trivial or quick process and, to date, the HSE has identified 300,000 records, and the Department over 465,000 records, all which must be examined and scheduled by Counsel.  Consequently, I am currently not in a position to provide the detailed information  requested in this question.</p>  <p>  Nevertheless, it is important to remember the context in which vaccination against influenza type A (H1N1) was introduced.  On 11 June 2009, following consideration by its Emergency Committee, the WHO raised the Influenza type A (H1N1) alert to Pandemic level 6 which officially declares a pandemic.  My Department activated the National Plan for pandemic influenza and, based on the advices of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee, &lsquo;at risk&rsquo; groups were prioritised for vaccination.  Vaccination of children was prioritised as the rates of influenza were highest in those groups at that time.  The public pandemic vaccination campaign ended on 31 March 2010.  </p>  <p>  The first reports of a link between pandemic influenza vaccination and narcolepsy came in the second half of 2010.  In August 2010, the Swedish pharmacovigilance authority reported that it was investigating six cases of narcolepsy reported by health care professionals as a possible adverse event following the use of Pandemrix vaccine during the pandemic.  This was followed later that month by reports from the Finnish National Institute for Health and Welfare noting there had been a more than expected number of cases of narcolepsy in children and adolescents that year.  On 23 September 2010, the Committee on Human Medicinal Products of the European Medicines Agency concluded in its initial review of available data that the available evidence did not confirm a link but that more research was needed.  By the end of March 2011 the Irish Medicines Board, now the Health Products Regulatory Authority, had received reports of two confirmed cases of narcolepsy following vaccination with pandemic vaccines.  My Department and the HSE agreed that the Health Protection Surveillance Centre would work with the Irish Medicines Board and Irish clinical experts in narcolepsy to examine the Irish data and report back the findings.  The Final Report of National Narcolepsy Study Steering Committee was published on 19 April 2012. It found a 13-fold higher risk of narcolepsy in vaccinated compared to unvaccinated individuals and the absolute increased risk associated with the vaccine was five narcolepsy cases per 100,000 vaccinated children and adolescents.</p></reply>

In 2016, Ireland's first National Maternity Strategy was published along with the HSE's National Standards for Bereavement Care following Pregnancy Loss and Perinatal Death and HIQA's National Standards for Safer Better Maternity Services.  Since December 2015, each maternity unit has published a monthly Maternity Patient Safety Statement as recommended by the Chief Medical Officer.  These developments represent key building blocks to facilitate the provision of a consistently safe and high quality service.  </p>  <p>  In addition, a National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme has now been established within the HSE to lead the management, organisation and delivery of maternity, gynaecological and neonatal services.  The Programme will ensure the consistent delivery of high quality care and oversee the development of Maternity Networks.  </p>  <p>  In relation to the Deputy's query regarding University Hospital Kerry, I understand that the provision of a dedicated Obstetric Theatre forms part of a capital submission that is due for consideration by the South South/West Hospital Group (SSWHG).  If approved, this proposal would then be referred to the Acute Hospital Division for consideration in the national context.</p>  <p>  My Department has been assured by the SSWHG that arrangements are in place to mitigate any risk to patients.  In that regard it is understood that theatre scheduling ensures the availability of an Emergency Theatre every day.  In addition, the Consultant teams have worked successfully to date to ensure emergency access is provided if required.  While, occasionally, this can lead to delays for scheduled procedures, the hospital has advised that, to date, no such procedures have been cancelled to accommodate an obstetric emergency.</p></reply>

The vision of the programme is to design standardised models of integrated care pathways for the delivery of clinical care to ensure sustained quality clinical operational management.  Overall, the programme aims to improve quality, access and cost-effectiveness of stroke services in Ireland.</p><p>The programme can point to many improvements in Stroke care since its inception.  The HSE has previously advised my Department that emergency thrombolysis is provided now to patients in all regions of the country by improved hospital and ambulance protocols, health professional training and the appointment of new physicians. </p><p>There is national 24/7 access to safe stroke thrombolysis, the rate of which has increased from 1% in 2006 to a current rate of 13%.  This exceeds the national target of 9%. </p><p>Access to stroke unit care has been shown to improve stroke patient outcomes through reduced mortality rates, reduced dependency and shorter lengths of stay in hospital by patients.  Since the commencement of the National Clinical Programme for Stroke, nine new stroke units have been opened, bringing the total number of stroke units in acute hospitals to twenty-two.  This is a major improvement from the first national stroke care audit report in 2008 which reported one stroke unit in the country.</p><p>The programme has also developed a range of care pathways to assist the streamlining and standardisation of stroke care delivery.</p><p>The cost objectives of the programme have also been met with more stroke patients experiencing improved clinical outcomes. Examples include:</p><p>-  Less stroke patients are dying in hospital: The rate has dropped from 16.2% in 2009 to 14.1% in 2014 &ndash; an overall percentage reduction of 12.9%;</p><p>-  Less stroke patients are discharged to nursing homes &ndash; and therefore with improved disability outcomes: This has reduced from 17.7% in 2009 to 13.8% in 2014 &ndash; an overall percentage reduction of 22.1%;</p><p>-  More stroke patients are discharged directly to home from acute hospitals: The rate has increased from 50.7% in 2009 to 51.6% in 2014;</p><p>-  The median acute hospital length of stay for stroke has fallen from 10 days in 2009 to 9 days in 2014, with an estimated 19,000 bed days saved in the 2011-2014 period.</p><p>This is all good news for stroke patients. </p><p>The HSE has advised my Department that funding for developments are considered annually and submitted to the Department of Health as part of the service planning process.  The HSE will be starting this process in the coming weeks for 2018. Requests for allocation of dedicated funding for the Stroke Register will be considered in the context of the Estimates Process for 2018.</p></reply>

Consequently, the HSE is investing in digital and technological systems to ensure that patients are appropriately reminded. </p>  <p>  One of the solutions eHealth Ireland has proposed is to provide a standardised national patient reminder service using SMS or email.  This solution has the potential to reduce the number of people who do not show up for appointments and reallocate those appointment slots to other patients.  This standardised national text reminder service project has already been initiated. </p>  <p>  In addition, under the new Outpatient Reform Programme, the hospital system will be moving to advanced booking systems which will allow patients two choices of appointment time.  This process has been shown internationally to dramatically reduce patient failure to attend.</p>  <p>  A waiting list validation service has also been proposed. The proposal is to validate waiting lists using SMS reminder messages which will quicken the validation process and increase efficiency.  A pilot is to be initiated shortly for both inpatient and outpatient services.</p>  <p>  These initiatives are being progressed in conjunction with the HSE's Outpatient Waiting List Action Plan 2017 which will be communicated shortly.</p>  <p>  The cost of patients who "Did Not Attend" (DNA) is difficult to ascertain.  In order to ensure that outpatient clinics, and the time of clinical staff, are used to best effect, hospitals usually schedule a greater number of patients so that the clinic is fully utilised in the event that some patients fail to attend.  There is an administrative cost associated with DNAs, which is approximately &euro;25 per patient visit.  According to the latest HSE data, current &lsquo;Did Not Attend&rsquo; rates are at approximately 13%.  This translates into a cost of approximately &euro;12 million.</p>  <p>  With respect to a deposit system, I am not sure it would be effective having regard to the administrative overheads involved and the requirement for a legislative basis for charges.</p>  <p>  With regard to deceased persons, during routine validation of waiting lists by hospitals, deceased patients are removed from waiting lists. The waiting list validation service mentioned above will also assist in relation to this issue in the future.</p></reply>

It provides a valuable source of research on the current and future needs of an ageing population to inform policy responses to population ageing.  Every two years TILDA researchers undertake very detailed interviews with the participants in their home and every four years TILDA undertakes a very comprehensive health assessment with the majority of the participants.  During each wave of research, new areas of data are added bringing new issues to light and building up a more comprehensive picture of older people in Ireland. </p>  <p>  The TILDA Wave 3 report which was published on 7 March and launched by my colleague Minister Corcoran Kennedy highlighted that the prevalence of untreated "treatable" conditions has not changed in four years.  These conditions include hypertension, high cholesterol, osteoporosis, osteopenia and atrial fibrillation which are the key risk factors for stroke, heart failure, kidney failure and injurious falls.  The report highlights that innovative policy interventions to raise awareness of these common and treatable disorders are critical. </p>  <p>  It is disappointing that the prevalence of untreated treatable conditions has not reduced since Wave 1 of TILDA.  It is therefore vital that this and other evidence emerging from TILDA is disseminated widely to inform policy and practice responses to ageing.  With that in mind the latest TILDA findings have been disseminated throughout the Department of Health.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health is strongly supportive of TILDA's work in building an evidence base for health policy and practice and has committed to funding the study for a further five years.  To ensure optimal transfer of the knowledge generated by TILDA, the Health Research Board, which is managing the TILDA contract on behalf of the Department, will set up a Knowledge Translation Group to raise awareness of TILDA among policymakers across Government Departments and solicit suggestions for future evidence needs, as well as optimise the use of TILDA data and inform future waves.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Partnership Government emphasises the priority of increasing access to safe, timely care, as close to patients' homes as possible, and it recognises that general practice needs a new contract to address its changing role in delivering care.</p>  <p>  There have been significant developments in general practice service in recent years, with more services being made available to our citizens.  Developments include a universal GP service for all persons over 70 years, the introduction of a Diabetes Cycle of Care for adult GMS patients with Type 2 Diabetes as well as an enhanced support framework for rural GPs and a revised list of special items of service to encourage the provision of more services in the primary care setting.</p>  <p>  The next phase of discussions on a new GP contract is underway and I look forward to positive and constructive engagements with GP representatives in the months ahead.</p></reply>

In its response of 31 March 2017 to the Deputy, the HSE advised that there were 5,278 safeguarding concerns reported in Q1-Q3 2016, which was anticipated to rise to over 7,500 concerns by the end of Q4 2016.  The HSE has also advised that 2016 represents the first year it collected national data in respect of safeguarding concerns pertaining to older persons and persons with disabilities.</p><p>I will now set out the position in respect of the second element of the Deputy&rsquo;s question, namely the liaison my Departmental officials have had to date with the HSE&rsquo;s National Safeguarding Office regarding the approximate 7,500 safeguarding concerns reported during 2016.</p><p>The safety and protection of vulnerable people in the care of the State is paramount.  This Government&rsquo;s primary concern is that the needs of the residents are being prioritised and addressed.  As the Deputy will be aware, a number of important steps have been taken in recent years to strengthen the protection afforded to vulnerable children and adults in the States&rsquo;s day care and residential care settings.  Some of these measures, such as the establishment in early 2014 of the Child and Family Agency, TUSLA, for example, are outside the remit of my Department.</p><p>Within the health sector specifically, the HSE published its national safeguarding policy and procedures, <i>Safeguarding Vulnerable People at Risk of Abuse,</i>in December 2014.  This safeguarding policy was the first such HSE policy to encompass both elder abuse and concerns of abuse relating to people availing of disability services.  </p><p>A number of important steps have been taken to progress implementation of this policy, including the establishment by the HSE of a National Safeguarding Office, and the establishment of Safeguarding and Protection Teams in each of the Executive&rsquo;s CHO areas.  In addition, a National Safeguarding Committee was formally established in December 2015.  The Committee has multi-agency and inter-sectoral representation, including representation from the Department of Health.  The Committee is independently chaired by Ms. Patricia T Rickard-Clarke.  It has agreed Terms of Reference but its overarching remit is to support the development of a societal and organisational culture, which promotes the rights of persons who may be vulnerable and safeguards them from abuse.  Its remit extends beyond abuse of elderly and disabled persons and recognises that any vulnerable adult can be subject to abuse.  Vulnerability can be a transient or permanent state depending on many influences. </p><p>The Safeguarding Committee published its Strategic Plan for 2017 &ndash; 2021 on 20 December 2016.  One of its strategic objectives is the initiation of conversations with Government and Oireachtas Committees on the development of legislation on adult safeguarding.  The work to date of the National Safeguarding Committee has confirmed that the scope of the issues around the safeguarding of vulnerable adults goes far beyond the area of health and that a much broader, cross-sectoral approach is needed.  I fully support the principle of providing a legislative basis for the safeguarding of vulnerable adults and I am committed to working with my Government colleagues across all the relevant Government Departments to this end.</p><p>My Departmental officials liaise with their HSE counterparts on a regular basis, both in respect of safeguarding policy and in respect of specific individual safeguarding concerns.</p></reply>

Those hospitals/maternity units currently providing anomaly scans accept referrals from other maternity units, if requested. This occurs where the medical team in the referring maternity unit consider that an anomaly scan is clinically indicated. </p>  <p>  The National Maternity Strategy is very clear that all women must have equal access to standardised ultrasound services and, consequently, the issue of anomaly scanning is a priority issue for the newly established HSE National Women and Infants Health Programme.  An early priority for the Programme will be to develop clinical guidance regarding routine detailed scans at 20 weeks.  In the meantime, the Programme will continue to work with the six Hospital Groups to assist in increasing access to anomaly scans for those units with limited availability. </p>  <p>  One of the current challenges to increase access to anomaly scans is the recruitment of ultrasonographers.  In this context it is expected that the establishment of maternity networks across hospital groups will assist in developing a sustainable model that ensures that all women within each hospital group can access anomaly scans.  The Programme has advised that there is some resource available to support this initiative in 2017, and a submission will be made to the estimates process for 2018 for the additional funding.</p></reply>

This group was established by the Department of Health in 2015 and it has met on a number of occasions.  One of the principal recommendations in the Plan was the establishment of a National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases.  This programme was to be responsible for, over time and among other functions, assisting with mapping and developing care pathways for rare diseases; facilitating timely access to centres of expertise &ndash; nationally and internationally; and developing care pathways with European Reference Centres for those ultra-rare disorders where there may not be sufficient expertise in Ireland.</p>  <p>  In line with this recommendation, a National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases was established in 2013 under the National Clinical Strategy and Programmes Division of the HSE.  The programme is a joint initiative between the HSE and the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland.  This clinical programme is the channel for assisting with the advancement of a number of other recommendations in the plan, such as those on National Centres of Expertise for rare diseases; and in this vein, the programme designed a framework for the designation of Irish Centres of Expertise in cooperation with the HSE Acute Hospitals Division in line with the recommendations stipulated in the national plan. </p>  <p>  The Rare Diseases National Plan also recommended that  &lsquo;the National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases through a National Office for Rare Diseases develop the clinical and organisational governance framework that would underpin care pathways and access to treatment for rare disease patients, particularly in the context of transition from paediatric to adult care'.  As such the National Clinical Programme has developed a draft transition model of care which is currently in the public consultation stage.</p>  <p>  The National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases and the Department of Health encouraged designated centres of expertise to participate in European Reference Networks (ERNs) for Rare Diseases in line with the national plan. ERNs are European networks connecting health care providers and centres of expertise so that international expertise on specific rare diseases may be pooled together for the benefit of patients.  Any centre applying for membership of an ERN must have strategies in place to ensure that care is patient-centred; that patients' rights and preferences are respected; and must show a research component to their work.  Hence, the recommendations in the national plan that related to empowering and protecting patients and carers, and research on rare diseases will be fulfilled in part through this process.  It is expected that ERNs will have a major structuring effect by linking thematic expert centres across the EU.</p>  <p>  With the encouragement of the National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases and the Department of Health, five centres of expertise were designated in June 2016 during the first round of calls from the European Commission for participation in European Reference Networks.  Three of these designated centres applied for membership of ERNs and two were approved. </p>  <p>  In 2014, the Minister for Health announced &euro;850,000 for investment into charity-led research priorities, which particularly benefits rare disease research.  Five charities were to provide matching funding bringing the total investment to &euro;1.9 million.  They were to share &euro;850,000 in State funding to take part in international research into rare medical conditions.  In 2016, the next cohort of projects was funded by the State with &euro;1.686M, matched by charity funding of &euro;1.224M.  The total funding of &euro;2.91M is shared between 11 charities.  Six of the 15 projects with a total value of &euro;1.1M address rare diseases.  The next round of this joint funding initiative will open in autumn 2017.  The EU commission now intends to explore the possibility to further strengthen the collaboration between Member States and the Commission in the area of research on rare diseases. </p>  <p>  The establishment of a National Rare Disease Office (NRDO) featured prominently in the recommendations of the Rare Disease plan.  The national office has now been established by the HSE.  It is, among other functions, providing up-to-date information regarding new treatment and management options, including clinical trials.  The NRDO has already performed a preliminary situation analysis of the existing rare disease registries and is in the process of assigning these known registries on our national Orphanet site, which is the international rare disease reference and information portal funded by the EU.</p>  <p>  A number of recommendations about access to appropriate drugs and technologies were contained in the plan.  One chief recommendation in this regard refers to the HSE developing a Working Group to bring forward appropriate decision criteria for the reimbursement of orphan medicines and technologies; and that the approach should include an assessment system similar to that for cancer therapies established under the National Cancer Control Programme.  The HSE Acute Hospitals Division is developing the terms of reference, required membership and reporting relationship for this committee.  This Committee will also be supported by the National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases Clinical Advisory Group.</p>  <p>  The national plan for rare diseases recommended that the Health Identifiers Bill and the Health &amp;amp; Patient Safety Bill be published.  The former was published in 2013 and enacted in 2014.  The Individual Health Identifier part of the project is now being implemented by the HSE.  A revised and much expanded General Scheme of a Health Information and Patient Safety Bill was approved by the government in November 2015 and published on the Department's website.  It is currently with the Attorney-General's Office for formal drafting and with the Oireachtas Committee on Health for Pre-Legislative Scrutiny. </p>  <p>  Two recommendations referred to training in rare diseases for healthcare professionals.  The Department of Health has contacted formally the various healthcare representative and professional bodies about implementing these recommendations.</p>  <p>  The issue of rare diseases and of the creation of an all-island patient register has been raised in the context of ongoing discussions at North-South meetings.  The determination of policy and practice in relation to registers in (the Republic of) Ireland is currently being examined in the context of a broader review of health information policy which is underway within the Department of Health.</p></reply>

I want to ensure that existing GP services are retained and that general practice remains an attractive career option for newly-qualified GPs.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Partnership Government commits to increasing the number of GP training places to 259 places annually.  In July 2016, the GP training intake increased from 157 to 172 places.  The number of training places increased again this year with 186 places offered; however, only 177 places have been formally accepted.  While it is of course disappointing that all the available places were not filled, it must be acknowledged that there has been a huge expansion in the training scheme in recent years.  In 2009, there were 120 places available and in 2017 there are 186 places available.  This is an increase of 55% in seven years.  I am anxious to achieve further increases in the number of GP training places in future years, and to ensure that all the available places are filled, in order to meet the future manpower needs of general practice.</p>  <p>  Further efforts undertaken in recent years to increase the number of practising GPs include changes to the entry provisions to the GMS scheme to accommodate more flexible/shared GMS/GP contracts, and to the retirement provisions for GPs under the GMS scheme, allowing GPs to hold GMS contracts until their 72nd birthday, as well as the introduction of an enhanced supports package for rural GP practices.  These steps should help to address the future demand for GPs by enticing GPs who may have ceased practising for family or other reasons back into the workforce, facilitating GPs to work past the standard retirement age and encouraging more GPs to work in rural areas.</p>  <p>  In addition, I have repeatedly emphasised the need for a new GP services contract which will help modernise our health service and develop a strengthened primary care sector, and health service management have already progressed a number of significant measures through engagement with GP representatives in recent years.  The next phase of engagement on a new GP contract is under way and the sustainability of general practice in rural areas will be considered in this context.  The review process will also seek to introduce further measures aimed at making general practice a fulfilling and rewarding career option into the future.</p></reply>

The Initiative concluded at the end of March.</p>  <p>  A range of practical measures to address ED overcrowding were implemented, including 90 additional beds, aids and appliances for over 4,450 patients, around 1,000 extra homecare packages and 615 additional transitional care bed approvals.</p>  <p>  During the Winter Initiative delayed discharges reduced from 638 in September 2016 to 434 in December and were maintained below 500 from mid-December through to end February.  This had a positive impact on trolley numbers and freed-up beds for use by patients awaiting admission.  Further, since the start of 2017 there have been approximately 5% less patients waiting on trolleys nationally compared to the same period last year.</p>  <p>  Cavan ED performed well this winter and HSE data indicate that there has been an 85% decrease in the number of patients waiting on trolleys so far this year compared to the same period last year.  This has been achieved through improved performance by the Hospital and a 3% decrease in attendances.</p>  <p>  The RCSI Hospital Group has identified the need for development of the resuscitation area in Cavan Emergency Department.  Any future investment in the Hospital must be considered within the overall acute hospital infrastructure programme, the prioritised needs of the Hospital Group and within the overall capital envelope available to the health service.</p>  <p>  During 2017 my Department will work with the HSE and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to conduct a mid-term review of the capital programme.</p></reply>

The HSE has submitted a draft Action Plan to my Department and it is currently being reviewed in detail.</p>  <p>  The most important issue in relation to any changes at Portlaoise Hospital is that patient safety and good quality outcomes must come first.  Any changes to services at Portlaoise, once approved, will be undertaken in a planned and orderly manner to further improve services for patients at the hospital and will take account of existing patient flows and demands in other hospitals, as well as the need to develop particular services at Portlaoise in the context of the overall service configuration in the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group.</p></reply>

In excess of 2,000 daycases will be managed through this process and patients are already receiving appointments.  </p>  <p>  In order to reduce the numbers of long-waiting patients, I asked the HSE to develop Waiting List Action Plans for 2017 in the areas of Inpatient/Daycase, Scoliosis and Outpatient Services.

It sets out a vision where fewer lives are lost through suicide, and where communities and individuals are empowered to improve their mental health and wellbeing.  This vision is to be realised through seven goals. These are better understanding of suicidal behaviour; supporting communities to prevent and respond to suicidal behaviour; targeted approaches for those vulnerable to suicide; improved access, consistency and integration of services; safe and high-quality services; reduce access to means; and better data and research.</p>  <p>  The Cross-Sectoral Connecting for Life Implementation Steering Group was established in 2015 in response to the actions set out in Connecting for Life, the national strategy to reduce suicide.  This strategy contains a detailed and clear plan to achieve each of the goals it proposes, with defined actions and a lead agency and key partners in place for each individual action.  As a whole of government strategy, Connecting for Life requires cross-sectoral leadership, resource structures and teams for implementation. </p>  <p>  The structures exist at national, organisational and local level and include the National Office for Suicide Prevention (NOSP), to oversee the implementation of Connecting for Life; the National Cross-Sectoral Steering and Implementation Group, with responsibility for high-level implementation planning and addressing national blockages to implementation; a National Taskforce on Youth Mental Health, convened to consider how best to introduce and teach resilience and coping mechanisms to children and young people, and to provide national leadership on youth mental health and wellbeing; a Pathfinder project, which is providing the mechanism for shared whole-of-government approach to youth mental health and suicide prevention; a cross-departmental group consisting of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, The Press Council and NOSP focused on improving the reporting of suicidal behaviour within the media; and a multi-agency Central Statistics Office Liaison Group on suicide mortality statistics.</p>  <p>  The 23 lead agencies responsible for actions report twice per year to NOSP on progress against Actions (Action Reporting Template). NOSP collates the activities and provides a report to the National Implementation Group.  The most recent return of this template, in November 2016, showed the number of actions for which progress was achieved in November 2016 was 65 of 69, amounting to 94%.</p>  <p>  The majority of the actions within Connecting for Life will be delivered by the HSE (44 of the 66 individual lead agency actions).  The HSE Cross-Divisional Implementation Group (Primary Care, Acute Hospitals, Health and Wellbeing, Mental Health and NOSP) is fully operational. Oversight is provided by the HSE National Leadership Team.  This committee has established structures and processes to agree a HSE cross-divisional Connecting for Life Implementation Plan. </p>  <p>  Additionally, as part of this national strategy, local implementation plans for each CHO either have been or are being developed.  There will be 26 local suicide prevention action plans by Quarter four, 2017, and work has commenced in all of the nine CHO areas on these.</p></reply>

Approximately &euro;0.6m capital has been spent to date on the interim facilities at Merlin Park to accommodate the ambulance base.</p>  <p>  NAS has been in contact with HSE Estates and hospital management in order to progress the improvements required for the temporary hospital facility as well as the development of a permanent ambulance base on the grounds of Merlin Park.  NAS has also engaged with staff on this issue.  In relation to the new ambulance base at Merlin Park, approval has been granted to progress the design to tender stage.</p></reply>

During the Winter Initiative, delayed discharges reduced from 638 in September 2016 to a low of 434 at the end of December and were maintained below 500 from mid-December through to end February.  This had a positive impact on ED overcrowding and trolley numbers, in freeing up beds for use by patients awaiting admission to hospital.   </p>  <p>  My Department has also commenced a bed capacity review in line with the Programme for Government commitment.  The intention is that this review will be broader than previous exercises that focused solely on acute bed capacity and will examine key elements of primary and community care infrastructure.  This review will feed into the mid-term review of the capital programme.  My Department and the HSE are committed to utilising the key learning from the Winter Initiative to develop a plan focused on working with hospitals to improve performance in relation to reducing the number of patients that have to wait on trolleys and the overall patient ED experience.  This important work will provide a framework around the preparation of the 2017/2018 plans for Winter preparedness. </p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their income and assets while the State pays the balance of the cost.  The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings. </p>  <p>  When the NHSS commenced in 2009, a commitment was made that it would be reviewed after three years.  The Report of the Review was published in July 2015.  Arising out of the Review, a number of key issues have been identified for more detailed consideration across Departments and Agencies.</p>  <p>  An Interdepartmental/Agency Working Group has been established to progress the recommendations contained in the Review.  This Group is chaired by the Department of Health and includes representatives from the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the HSE, the Revenue Commissioners, and when required, the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF).  These recommendations include examining the treatment of business and farm assets for the purposes of the financial assessment element of the Scheme.  This work is currently underway.  An initial report on progress was submitted to the Cabinet Committee on Health in September 2016.</p>  <p>  Once all of the relevant Review recommendations have been considered, any amendments required to the Scheme will be identified.  Changes which require legislative implementation will be addressed collectively; in that regard it is important to remember that the NHSS is largely underpinned by primary legislation.</p>  <p>  The Programme for a Partnership Government has also committed to reviewing the NHSS to remove any discrimination against small businesses and family farms.  This review is currently underway.  I am committed to this review of the position with regard to family farms and small business for the purposes of the financial assessment element of the Scheme. </p></reply>

In 2016, typically in a month, there were approximately 53,000 admissions to acute hospitals on a daycase and an inpatient basis.</p>  <p>  The National ED Escalation Framework sets out procedures to be followed in hospitals during periods of high demand for emergency care, to ensure that safe care is provided to all patients.  In order to respond to surges in ED demand, under the Framework, hospital managers may, in consultation with the relevant clinical leads, review and cancel non-urgent planned electives, where appropriate.  This allows both beds and staff to be redeployed to alleviate pressure in the ED. </p>  <p>  It is essential that hospitals continue to improve how they manage, and balance, the demand for emergency care with the planning of elective procedures, to minimise the impact on patients.  In addition, it is important that the HSE continues to improve its processes to minimise the number sessions lost when patients cancel or do not attend for their procedures. </p>  <p>  Over recent years activity in acute hospitals has increased, with the total number of discharges of inpatients and daycases rising around 34% between 2006 and 2015.  Our hospitals are now carrying out four times more procedures in patients aged 65 years and over,  and twice as many in the under 65 age group since 2000.  Last year alone there was a 4% increase in inpatient and daycase activity over 2015, and in 2016 almost 1.69 million patients received inpatient or daycase treatment in our hospitals, an increase of almost 40,000 on the previous year. </p>  <p>  In response to the particular query raised, I have asked the HSE to provide the specific details and I will forward these on to the deputy when they are received.</p></reply>

In early 2015 an Expert Review Team chaired by Professor Jimmy Walker, Professor of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University of Leeds was established. After the review was made public further examination of cases and contact from further families, 18 cases (that is, 16 families) met the Terms of Reference for the review.</p><p>The family, to which you refer in your question, were unaware of the 2011 review that had taken place in to the death of their daughter.  They should have been previously informed and given an opportunity to be involved in the review.  My Department notes that both Portiuncula Hospital and the Saolta Hospital Group have apologised unreservedly and fully to the family for the failures of care delivered that contributed to the likely preventable deaths of their two daughters.  </p><p>Safeguards are now in place in Portiuncula Hospital with regular and on-going audits in the maternity unit and Saolta Hospital Group have advised that there are no continuing patient safety concerns.  I am advised that the Final Report of the Review Group is due to be published in the next few weeks.</p><p>My Department is continuing to progress an ambitious programme of patient safety reforms.  The new National Patient Safety Office, located in my Department, was launched by me in December 2016.  I have directed this office to work on a range of initiatives, including new legislation, the establishment of a national patient advocacy service, the measurement of patient experience, the introduction of a patient safety surveillance system and extending the clinical effectiveness agenda.  Within the programme of legislation, it is intended to progress the licensing of our public and private hospitals. </p><p>As the Deputy will be aware  provision to support Open Disclosure which is included in the Department of Justice and Equality's Civil Liabilities (Amendment) Bill 2017 was recently accepted at Report Stage by Seanad Eireann.  The provision which is designed to give legal protection/privilege for the information and apology made to a patient is in line with the legislation.  This is intended to create a positive voluntary climate for open disclosure and will support the National Policy on Open Disclosure which was developed jointly by the HSE and the State Claims Agency.  </p><p>The main provisions of the Open Disclosure legislation are to:</p><p>- ensure patients are informed when adverse events happen as soon as is practicable;</p><p>- assist in supporting appropriate patient care;</p><p>- increase trust between patients and their clinicians;</p><p>- create a safe space for staff to conduct open disclosure;</p><p>- support staff in managing adverse events; and</p><p>- improve patient safety and quality of care through organisational learning. </p><p>Open Disclosure and a strong culture of reporting of adverse events provide opportunities to learn, improve, address errors that have happened and apply the lessons to make the service safer for all patients.</p><p>The Health Information and Patient Safety Bill will include a provision that public and private health care providers must notify serious patient incidents (Serious Reportable Events (SREs)) occurring in their services to their relevant regulatory body i.e. the State Claims Agency, HIQA, the Mental Health Commission or the Chief Inspector of Social Services as appropriate.  The provisions intended for patient safety incident reporting and clinical audit in the Bill will provide a comprehensive patient-centred approach to preventing, managing and learning from incidents.  HIQA and the Mental Health Commission are at an advanced stage of development of <i>Standards on the Conduct of reviews of Patient Safety </i>Incidents which expand on the <i>National Standards for Safer Better Healthcare.</i></p><p>The Health Information and Patient Safety Bill is currently the subject of Pre-Legislative Scrutiny by the Oireachtas Committee on Health and I understand that they, following a public consultation exercise, may report in May.</p><p>My Department is committed to introducing a national licensing system in hospitals which will provide a mandatory system of licensing for public and private healthcare providers.  The Patient Safety Licensing Bill is focused on governance and accountability and will ensure that providers do not operate below core standards. Licensing is part of a phased approach to better regulation in the health service. </p><p>The Government is committed to the progressive development of our maternity services. Key building blocks are now in place to facilitate the provision of a consistently safe and high quality service; these include:</p><p>- The National Maternity Strategy;</p><p>- HSE National Standards for Bereavement Care following Pregnancy Loss and Perinatal Death;</p><p>- HIQA National Standards for Safer, Better Maternity Services.</p><p>In 2016, Ireland's first National Maternity Strategy was published along with the HSE's National Standards for Bereavement Care following Pregnancy Loss and Perinatal Death and HIQA's National Standards for Safer Better Maternity Services.  Since December 2015, each maternity unit has published a monthly Maternity Patient Safety Statement as recommended by the Chief Medical Officer.  </p><p>These developments represent key building blocks to facilitate the provision of a consistently safe and high quality service.  In addition, the newly established National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme will lead the management, organisation and delivery of maternity, gynaecology and neonatal services, strengthening such services by bringing together work that is currently undertaken across primary, community and acute care.  The Programme will also drive implementation of the Strategy and oversee the establishment of maternity networks in each hospital group.</p></reply>

Valproate medicines have been authorised via national procedures in all EU Member States and in Norway and Iceland; valproate-containing medicines are also approved nationally in Ireland to treat bipolar disorder.</p>  <p>  In March of this year, the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assesssment Committee of the European Medicine Agency (EMA) initiated a new review of the use of valproate-containing medicines in the treatment of women and girls who are pregnant or of childbearing age.  A previous EMA review of valproate, in 2014, resulted in measures to strengthen the warnings and restrictions on the use of valproate medicines in women and girls, due to the risk of malformations and developmental problems in babies who are exposed to valproate in the womb.  </p>  <p>  The Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) is the competent authority for the regulation of medicines in Ireland.  The HPRA has highlighted the results of previous reviews of valproate to Irish healthcare professionals and provided revised educational materials for both healthcare professionals and patients.  The HPRA has already informed healthcare professionals and relevant patient groups that the new EMA review is underway, and will disseminate the results of the review to Irish patients and healthcare professionals as soon as they become available.</p>  <p>  In October 2016, the HSE's Medicines Management Programme (MMP) launched its Valproate Toolkit, an online resource consisting of a patient information booklet, summary guide for prescribers and a patient/prescriber checklist.  This information highlights that sodium valproate should not be prescribed to girls or women of childbearing age or pregnant women unless other treatments are ineffective or not tolerated.  The MMP is in contact with the HPRA regarding the EMA's current review of valproate, and any further recommendations will be considered.</p>  <p>  Neither my Department nor the HSE has plans to conduct a separate review of the use of valproate by pregnant women in Ireland.</p></reply>

The report of the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly setting out its recommendations is now being prepared and is due to be submitted to the Oireachtas by the end of June.

People with disabilities are only half as likely to be in employment as others of working age.  The reasons for this are complex, and include level of education and skills, fears around loss of benefits, employer know-how, low expectations, and limited re-entry to work following onset of a disability, as well as a higher incidence of ill-health.</p><p>  The Strategy is a cross-government approach that brings together actions by different Departments and State agencies in a concerted effort to address the barriers and challenges that impact on employment of people with disabilities.  In tandem with that, it seeks to ensure there will be joined-up services and supports at local level to support individuals on their journey into and in employment.</p><p> The Strategy's six strategic priorities are to:</p><p>- Build skills, capacity and independence;</p><p>- Provide bridges and supports into work;</p><p>- Make work pay;</p><p>- Promote job retention and re-entry to work;</p><p>- Provide co-ordinated and seamless support;</p><p>- Engage employers.</p><p>  The Strategy is monitored and overseen by the Comprehensive Employment Strategy Implementation Group under an independent chair.  To date, the Group has met on eight occasions in order to review progress, prioritise areas of work and ensure that the 2015 - 2017 Action Plan is being implemented.  The Chair of the Group recently published his first annual report, and this is available at www.justice.ie.  The key issue in relation to the implementation of the Strategy is the co-ordination of departmental efforts in this area, and therefore, while individual actions in the Strategy may have additional cost implications which will require to be included in the Votes of the relevant Departments, taken as a whole, the focus in the Strategy is on better co-ordination and use of existing resources, rather than on additional funding allocations.</p></reply>

I am also advised that the 90-day limit for a short stay visit is the norm in the European Union.</p>  <p>  The 90-day limit is not arbitrary but is linked with the provisions in the Immigration Act 2004 which requires any persons residing in Ireland for more than 90 days to register their permission to be in the State with the relevant immigration office.  In effect, such persons who are in the State for longer than 90 days are considered to be residing in Ireland as opposed to merely visiting.</p>  <p>  A person may apply for a long-stay visa such as a "join family" visa which is appropriate when they wish to reside with a family member for longer than 90 days, for example, following the birth of a child to a family member or to care for a family member who is in poor health.  Such an application would be processed in accordance with the guidelines set out in my Department's Policy Document on non-EEA Family Reunification.  Each visa application is decided on its own merits taking all relevant factors into account. </p></reply>

A report was sought from the Garda Commissioner on the matter at that time and that report was provided to my predecessor in March 2011.  The Commissioner's report noted that no evidence had been established that the person in question had been involved in any criminal activity while in this jurisdiction.  That said, if any evidence of any criminal wrongdoing is available it should be brought to the Garda Authorities in order that it might be fully investigated.</p>  <p>  As I have stated to the House previously, in the light of developments which have taken place outside this jurisdiction since these matters first came to light, including the establishment by the UK Government of an inquiry into undercover policing, I sought a fresh report from the Garda Commissioner on any issues arising.  I will fully consider this report when it is available, including the issue of whether it may be suitable for publication.  In that context there are no plans to establish a further form of inquiry at this time.</p>  <p>  I am advised by the Garda Authorities that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na co-operates with external police services on intelligence-related matters as circumstances dictate.  This is, of course, to be expected given that intelligence gathering and sharing are fundamental duties of any police service.  Any arrangements that may be made are subject to operational requirements; they are governed by strict protocols relating to conduct and confidentiality and must, of course, in all circumstances operate in accordance with the law.  I would emphasise the point I have made previously that there can be no question of any person being permitted to engage in criminal activities here in any circumstances.  Neither is there any question of a police officer from outside the jurisdiction exercising police powers here.</p>  <p>  It is a function of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to investigate crime and in the event that credible evidence is advanced to or uncovered by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that a criminal offence has been committed the matter would be pursued fully in accordance with the law in the normal manner.  Following any criminal investigation it would be a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions to determine whether charges are warranted in any given case.  The facts or consequences of behaviour that may be considered undesirable or of an intimate nature are not matters for criminal investigation by the Garda Authorities in circumstances where no criminal offence is disclosed.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will understand also that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission is the statutory mechanism in place to deal with complaints about the conduct of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></reply>

The policing powers and duties of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are set out in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Acts 2005-2015, including that the direction and control of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are matters for the Garda Commissioner.  Those Acts set out also the mechanisms for oversight of policing services by the Policing Authority and for the investigation of complaints about Garda conduct by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.  Members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are subject not just to the provisions of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Acts but to the law generally and also to the Garda codes and regulations in carrying out their duties, including the Code of Ethics published by the Policing Authority in January.</p><p>The Deputy will appreciate, therefore, that neither I nor my Department would be directly involved in arrangements for or the conduct of day-to-day policing activities, including the conduct of intelligence-gathering operations, whether overt or undercover.  I am sure the Deputy will agree that this separation of responsibilities is as it should be.  Therefore, neither I nor my Department would be in possession of the reports of undercover police work.</p><p>It is also the case that certain covert surveillance activities are governed by the provisions of the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Act 2009.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, allegations regarding an undercover police officer in this jurisdiction were made public in 2011.  A report was sought from the Garda Commissioner on the matter at that time and that report was provided to my predecessor in March 2011.

Any arrangements that may be made are subject to operational requirements and must, of course, in all circumstances operate in accordance with the law.

In this regard, I am advised that NAMA is confident it upheld its mandate in the Project Shift transaction.  </p>  <p>  The Project Shift sale comprised a portfolio of German property assets held by a Northern Ireland based debtor.  I am advised that the marketing process for Project Shift began in June 2013 as an asset sale being conducted by the debtor with NAMA's consent.  This was in advance of NAMA&rsquo;s decision to place the Project Eagle portfolio on the market for sale.  The Project Shift sales process was at the &lsquo;sale agreed&rsquo; stage before the launch of Project Eagle.  However, the sale did not complete prior to Cerberus being selected as the preferred bidder for the Project Eagle portfolio.  Given that the same purchaser was involved in both transactions, it made sense to complete the Project Shift transaction as a loan sale rather than an asset sale and thereby complete the disposal of all of the debtor&rsquo;s loans to Cerberus.  </p>  <p>  I am advised that the debtor's Project Shift sale advisor, Savills, approached some 117 prospective investors and that 12 investors submitted first round offers within the relevant bid deadline.  I am advised that NAMA, acting on the advice of the debtor's sales advisor, consented to the sales advisor inviting eight investors into a second round of bidding.  The eight investors were provided with access to a detailed electronic data room to carry out further due diligence.  I am further advised by NAMA that seven of the shortlisted investors submitted second round offers by the bid date for this transaction.  On the advice of Savills, the debtor's sales advisor, NAMA consented to the debtor entering into exclusive discussions with Cerberus which had submitted the highest bid after an open, transparent and competitive open market sales process.  The Deputy will also be aware that the Comptroller &amp;amp; Auditor General noted, in his review of Project Eagle last year, that the Project Shift sales process was openly marketed and that it had commenced prior to Project Eagle. </p>  <p>  There is no prohibition on debtors engaging with potential purchasers prior to the launch of a sales process. </p></reply>

A REIT generally has a diverse ownership requirement, so no one person or group of connected persons can control the REIT.  REITs originated in the USA in the 1960s, and aspects of the REIT model have now spread to become a globally recognised investment standard in over 35 countries worldwide, including the majority of the world&rsquo;s developed investment jurisdictions.  </p>  <p>  Finance Act (no. 2) 2013 introduced a tax regime for REIT into Irish legislation.  A REIT is exempt from corporation tax on qualifying income and gains from rental property, subject to a high profit distribution requirement to shareholders &ndash; the Irish distribution requirement is 85% of property profits.  A REIT is a collective investment vehicle which provides the same after-tax returns to investors as direct investment in rental property, by eliminating the double layer of taxation at corporate and shareholder level which would otherwise apply.  </p>  <p>  In terms of Irish Investors, individuals are liable to tax at their marginal rates while corporates are liable to tax at 25%.  Institutional portfolio investors are liable to tax on REIT dividends at 12.5%, this being the rate generally applicable to trading income.  Dividend Withholding Tax (DWT) at the standard rate of 20% will be deducted by the REIT from dividends paid to shareholders, and will be available as a credit against tax liabilities.  </p>  <p>  With regard to foreign investors, the REIT will withhold DWT at the standard tax rate of 20%.  Foreign investors resident in treaty countries may be able to reclaim some of this DWT under the relevant tax treaty.  Tax treaty rates on dividends vary from treaty to treaty, but the most common rate applicable to small shareholdings would be 15% - this means that Ireland would retain taxing rights of 15% on dividends paid from Ireland.  </p>  <p>  In relation to the tax treatment of Irish collective asset-management vehicles (ICAVs) and qualifying investor alternative investment funds (QIAIFs), the normal tax treatment afforded to Irish collective investment funds is that the funds invested are allowed to grow on a tax-free basis within the fund.  The income is taxed at the level of the investor rather than the fund, as is standard international practice. </p>  <p>  In order to ensure that the appropriate tax is collected from Irish investors, funds are obliged to operate an exit tax regime and remit the tax deducted in this manner to Revenue.  This charge to tax does not apply in the case of unit holders who are non-resident. In the case of non-resident investors, their liability to tax on gains from the fund will be determined in their home jurisdiction.  </p>  <p>  In the 2016 Finance Act I introduced the Irish Real Estate Fund (IREF). IREFs are investment undertakings (excluding UCITS) where 25% of the value of that undertaking is made up of Irish real estate assets.  </p>  <p>  The legislation was introduced to address concerns raised regarding the use of collective investment vehicles to invest in Irish property.  The investors had been using the structures to minimise their exposure to Irish tax on Irish property transactions.  </p>  <p>  IREFs must deduct a 20% withholding tax on certain property distributions to non-resident investors.  The withholding tax will not apply to certain categories of investors such as pension funds, life assurance companies and other collective investment undertakings.  </p>  <p>  I am of the view that the taxation regime as described above remains appropriate for these entities.  </p></reply>

I also pointed out that the advice of NAMA's loan sale adviser, Eastdil Secured, was that such an approach would ensure competitive tension and significantly enhance the proceeds generated for NAMA.</p>  <p>  In my previous responses, I also noted that preparatory work in relation to the sale took at least two years.  This debtor connection comprised over 180 individual debtors with the majority of the debt concentrated among three principal debtors.  Over that period, I am advised there were extensive discussions between NAMA and the principal debtors.  I am further advised that, at various points during those discussions, references were made by representatives of the debtor connection to informal approaches which had been made by some investors seeking to purchase particular assets.  Given that NAMA no longer has an active engagement with the debtor connection, it is not possible at this time for NAMA to compile accurate data as to which of the original sixteen potential bidders had indicated an interest to the debtor connection in one or more of the assets securing the portfolio.</p>  <p>  I am advised by NAMA that one of the three final bidders had expressed an interest to the debtor connection in one or more of the assets securing the loans in the portfolio and that another of the final three bidders had expressed its interest to both NAMA and the debtor connection.  I am further advised that NAMA was separately approached directly by one other potential bidder, which was not one of the final three bidders.</p>  <p>  I am advised that, in its discussions with the debtor connection, NAMA engaged with representatives of the three principal debtors.  NAMA understands that the three principal debtors were in a position to represent the views of most, if not all, of the other debtors.  Given that the three principal debtors had the majority of the connection&rsquo;s debt, it is likely that any investors interested in acquiring assets would have communicated with these principal debtors.  In addition, I am advised that, before making a decision to sell the portfolio, NAMA engaged in a debtor representations process.  I am advised that this involved writing to all debtors within the connection and requesting their views on NAMA's proposed intention to sell their loans.  This provided all debtors in the connection with an opportunity to raise any matters relating to the loan sale including any feedback regarding the selection of potential bidders.  I am advised that 253 letters seeking written representations from debtors were issued by NAMA as part of this process and that all responses received were reviewed by NAMA's Credit Committee before the final decision to proceed with the loan sale was made.</p></reply>

Separately, assets securing NAMA's loans are owned by the debtor or receiver.  As such asset sales are performed by the debtor or receiver with NAMA's consent with the proceeds of such asset sales being used to repay the debtor's outstanding borrowings.</p>  <p>  I am advised by NAMA that the vast majority of both loan sale transactions conducted by NAMA and asset sale transactions conducted by NAMA debtors or receivers have been openly marketed.  Accordingly, consultation with debtors regarding the inclusion of potential bidders has not been a consideration.</p>  <p>  I am further advised that loan sales are frequently initiated as a result of credible unsolicited approaches from interested potential purchasers (i.e. reverse inquiries) to NAMA or, on occasion, directly to NAMA debtors.  However, if NAMA does not find an approach to be credible it will not pursue such interest as has been the case with many such reverse inquiries.</p>  <p>  When assessing reverse inquiries, NAMA's key considerations are whether the proposed transaction maximises the financial return to NAMA and whether the interested party is a credible bidder.  If NAMA believes that the transaction would maximise its return and that the party making the reverse inquiry has the financial capacity to purchase the portfolio, NAMA will prepare a formal assessment and following appropriate internal approvals, will seek to initiate a formal loan sales process.  The party that made the initial reverse inquiry would typically be included as one of a pool of potential bidders which are given the opportunity to review the portfolio concerned and submit bids if they see fit to do so.</p>  <p>  NAMA advise me that, to date, less than one third of the significant loans sales processes triggered by credible reverse inquiries have subsequently been purchased by the party which made the initial approach.</p>  <p>  I am advised by NAMA that Project Tolka was unique in terms of the particular targeted marketing approach that was adopted and the level of consultation with the debtor connection as regards bidder selection.  As I pointed out in my reply to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 82 and 83 of 13 April 2017, NAMA initiated a targeted marketing process for this portfolio based on the advice of its loan sales adviser, Eastdil Secured.  This advice was that this approach would significantly enhance the sales proceeds generated for NAMA by comparison to all other disposal options.</p>  <p>  NAMA is prohibited by law from disclosing confidential information in relation to debtors and their assets and is therefore constrained from disclosing the particular considerations which formed the basis for the adviser&rsquo;s recommendation that a targeted marketing process would maximise the State&rsquo;s return in this particular instance.</p></reply>

The review process was overseen by a steering committee comprising officials from my Department and from the Departments of Social Protection and Children and Youth Affairs, as well as the Higher Education Authority.</p>  <p>  This is a complex policy area that involved three Government Departments.  The review has examined existing data and the supports that are currently available for lone parents, with a view to identifying the specific challenges faced by lone parents in accessing higher education. The intention was to identify measures and best practice that will address those challenges in the future.</p>  <p>  The review was sufficiently progressed to inform policy discussions between the relevant Departments in advance of Budget 2017.  In this context, I secured additional funding in Budget 2017 to support more lone parents to participate in higher education.  This new funding will be used to respond to the recommendations contained in the review.</p>  <p>  The additional funding I received for lone parents in Budget 2017 will be complemented by measures announced by my colleague, the Minister for Social Protection, to assist lone parents to return to education.  These measures include the reintroduction of the &euro;500 annual cost of Education allowance.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs also is introducing a programme of affordable child care which will be of significant help to lone parents who are using childcare.</p></reply>

The commissioning of a Memorial to recognise the suffering of abuse victims in State run institutions was one of the recommendations.</p>  <p>  To commission this, an international competition was held and the winning entry was called the Journey of Light and was designed by Studio Negri and Hennessy &amp;amp; Associates.  The design concept was that the Memorial would be integrated with the Garden of Remembrance and would provide an enduring symbol of lost innocence to inspire future generations to ensure the protection of all children. </p>  <p>  However, An Bord Plean&aacute;la refused planning permission for the Memorial in November 2013 on the grounds that it would have an adverse impact on the setting, character and function of the Garden of Remembrance.     </p>  <p>  It was suggested that a central Dublin location could be identified on a cost neutral basis with appropriate zoning which could be used as a site for the Memorial.  However, the winning design uses the physical features of the Garden of Remembrance site and the design cannot be created on a different site. None of the other designs entered for the competition were considered appropriate to be commissioned. </p>  <p>  The Department is considering how best to progress the project.  The Department is engaging with potential interested parties with a view to seeing whether a permanent exhibition in a public institution might provide an appropriate way for the nation to remember the abuse that was suffered in redress institutions and to acknowledge the experience of survivors which is part of our national history.</p>  <p>  A capital provision of &euro; 500,000 is provided for the Memorial in the 2017 Revised Estimates Volume.</p></reply>

The use of school level data, i.e. standardised test results, is not used in the identification of schools for inclusion in the DEIS programme nor is it used to calculate the social context element of the school's profile in terms of the new SEN Allocation Model.</p>  <p>  DEIS is my Department's main policy initiative to tackle educational disadvantage. The DEIS Plan 2017 sets out our vision for future intervention in the critical area of social inclusion in education policy. The DEIS Review consultation process noted stakeholder concerns about the use of educational outcomes as a basis for extending DEIS supports to schools, or for reducing such supports.  In particular it was felt that outcomes achieved due directly to the input of specific additional resources and supports should not be used as a means to remove these supports from schools.  It was considered that this would give rise to a perception of penalising success and rewarding failure.</p>  <p>  In relation to the new model for allocating Special Educational Needs Teachers to schools, in 2014 the National Council for Special Education Working group Report recommended a new model based on the profiled needs of each school, rather than primarily based on the diagnosed disability of individual children. </p>  <p>  It recommended that the allocation of additional teaching supports to schools should be based on a Baseline component provided to every mainstream school to support inclusion, and a school&rsquo;s educational profile, based on:  </p>  <p>  - Students with complex special educational needs. </p>  <p>  - Percentages of students performing below a certain threshold on standardised test results</p>  <p>  - Social context of school which includes gender and educational disadvantage. </p>  <p>  However, it should be noted that these are separate elements of the school profile and that standardised test scores have therefore not been used to calculate the social context component of the school profile under the special education teaching allocation model.</p>  <p>  Full details of how the special education teaching profiles have been calculated for schools are set out in my Departments Circulars on the 0013/2017 and 0014/2017. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-05-03a.441.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017050300071#WRO02000"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 170 and 171 together.</p>  <p>  I wish to advise the Deputy that DES Circular 0013/2017 for primary schools and 0014/2017 for post primary schools were published on 7th March 2017.</p>  <p>  These Circulars set out the details of the new model for allocating special education teachers to schools.</p>  <p>  The revised allocation process replaces the generalised allocation process at primary and post primary school level for learning support and high incidence special educational needs, and the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) allocation process which provided additional resource teaching supports to schools, to support pupils assessed as having Low Incidence disabilities.</p>  <p>  The new Special Education Teaching allocation provides a single unified allocation for special educational support teaching needs to each school, based on each school&rsquo;s educational profile.</p>  <p>  Allocations based on the school profiles were issued to all schools on 7th March.  Details of the special education teaching allocations have also been published on the NCSE website.</p>  <p>  The aim of this new model is to deliver better outcomes for children with special educational needs. Substantial research, analysis, consultation with service users and stakeholders, and piloting have gone in to the development of this model and all of the evidence points to the fact that this new system will deliver better outcomes for children. </p>  <p>  No school will lose supports as a result of the implementation of the new model. In addition, no school will receive an allocation, for the support of pupils with complex needs, less than the allocation they received to support such pupils during the 2016/17 school year. No allocation made for such pupils by the NCSE will be removed from schools as long as that pupil remains in the school. </p>  <p>  An additional 900 teaching posts have been provided to support the introduction of this new allocation model. The provision of an additional 900 teaching posts is a very significant investment in the provision of additional teaching support for pupils with special educational needs in our schools. This is additional to an increase of 41% in the number of resource teachers allocated to schools annually by the NCSE since 2011. </p>  <p>  The additional funding will provide additional supports to over 1200 schools who are identified as needing additional supports as a result of the new model. Supports for children with special educational needs is a key priority for this Government. The new funding will ensure that all schools receive a sufficient allocation of special education needs resources to provide additional teaching support to all pupils, including pupils who have yet to enrol in their school, who require such support. </p>  <p>  Under the new allocation model, schools will be provided with a total allocation which includes a baseline allocation for the school and an allocation based on the school&rsquo;s profile. </p>  <p>  The provision of a profiled allocation will give a fairer allocation for each school which recognises that all schools need an allocation for special needs support, but which provides a graduated allocation which takes into account the actual level of need in each school. </p>  <p>  Schools will be frontloaded with resources, based on each school&rsquo;s profile, to provide supports immediately to those pupils who need it without delay. This will reduce the administrative burden on schools as schools will no longer have to complete an application process annually and apply for newly enrolled pupils who require resource hours. Children who need support can have that support provided immediately rather than having to wait for a diagnosis.</p>  <p>  Schools will therefore no longer have to make applications, for newly enrolled pupils for whom resource teaching hours may have been provided under the old model, or for pupils who have received a new diagnosis, as schools will now receive a single allocation for all of their special education teaching needs, based on their school size and profile.   </p>  <p>  The new allocations to schools will include provision to support all pupils in the schools, including where a child receives a diagnosis after the allocation is received by a school, or where there are newly enrolling pupils to the school. </p>  <p>  All allocations to schools include a supplementary provision, which has been referred to as the &lsquo;baseline allocation&rsquo; which is allocated over and above the profiled allocation. </p>  <p>  For students who start school from September 2017, with a specific diagnosis, either in junior infants or transferring from another school, the resources they need will already be in the school under the new model.  </p>  <p>  It should be noted that this is a brand new model of allocation and is not comparable to the existing model. By using a broad range of attainment and socio-economic criteria, it is expected that generally, a school&rsquo;s profile will remain relatively constant from year to year.  Each year, some students with additional teaching needs will leave and others will enrol, broadly balancing the school profile. Resources allocated under this model will not normally be adjusted between allocations. </p>  <p>  The NCSE has published details of the appeals process on the NCSE website: www.ncse.ie. </p>  <p>  Schools were asked to submit appeals by March 31st 2017. The appeal process will consider whether the data used to calculate their school profile was correct and complete and whether it was correctly applied in the calculation of their 2017/18 allocation.</p>  <p>  DES Circulars 0013/2017 and 0014/2017 outline the basis on which the Education Research Centre determined the allocations for all schools.  </p>  <p>  The model will allow for some additional provision for exceptional circumstances or where a school&rsquo;s enrolment levels increase very substantially prior to the next review of the model. The National Council for Special Education will support schools in managing their special education teaching allocations in the first instance. Only in very exceptional circumstances, where it can be demonstrated that the schools profile has changed very significantly since the allocation was made to the school, may an additional allocation of hours be made to the school. </p>  <p>  Guidelines for schools on the organisation, deployment and use of their special education teachers to address the need of pupils with special educational needs are now published and available on the Departments website.</p>  <p>  The Guidelines will support schools to reflect on how they can review and manage their timetabling practices to ensure the timetable is sufficiently flexible to meet the needs of all pupils in their school who have special needs. The Guidelines encourage schools to ensure they deploy their resources appropriately to meet the needs of all of the children in their school who require additional teaching support, including pupils with emerging needs, or new entrants. </p></reply>

A previous Government reduced the salaries and allowances payable to all new entrants to public service recruitment grades by 10% with effect from 1 January 2011. This decision also required that such new entrants would start on the first point of the applicable salary scale, which in the case of teachers had the effect of reducing their starting pay by a further 4-5%. Later in 2011, the Government placed a cap on the overall level of qualification allowances that could be earned by teachers. </p>  <p>  Subsequently in 2012, following the public service-wide review of allowances, the Government withdrew qualification allowances for new teachers altogether. However, the Government partially compensated for this by deciding that new entrant teachers would henceforth commence on a new salary scale which had a starting point higher than the starting point of the old scale.</p>  <p>  The public service agreements have allowed a programme of pay restoration to start. I have used this to negotiate substantial improvements in pay for new teachers. The agreement reached with TUI and INTO in September 2016 will see pay rises of between 15-22% (between &euro;4,600 and &euro;6,700) for new entrant teachers.  The agreements also provide for earlier permanency for younger teachers, new promotion opportunities and new flexibilities in working hours.  The pay increases for new teachers were also available to ASTI members under the proposals which members recently balloted on.  </p>  <p>  The agreements have restored an estimated 75% of the difference in pay for more recently recruited teachers and deliver full equality at later points in the scale.  This is substantial progress and strikes an equitable balance with other claims for funding on my Department, particularly needs such as enhanced service for children with special educational needs, for disadvantaged schools, for growing schools, for Higher Education and for apprenticeships.  </p>  <p>  It must be borne in mind that the pay reduction for post-2011 entrants to the public service applied to all public servants and not just teachers, and that any restoration of these measures in respect of teachers would be expected to be applied elsewhere across the public service. While I am not in a position to provide an estimate of the total cost of restoring all post-1 January 2011 entrants in all areas of the public service to the pre-2011 pay scale arrangements, I can say that in the case of education and training sector employees, including teachers, the estimated cost would be between &euro;65 and &euro;70 million per annum.  Clearly, the cost across the entire public service would be substantially higher.</p>  <p>  Further negotiation on new entrant pay cannot focus on just one sector. A broader assessment of pay and new entrant pay across the public service will be informed by the analysis of the Public Service Pay Commission. </p>  <p>  The Government established the Commission to examine pay levels across the public service, including entry levels of pay. The Government also supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants.</p>  <p>  I accept that the teacher unions have outstanding pay demands and that the new entrant deal does not travel the full distance that they set out to achieve. However, it does represent significant progress, and the door is not closed to the trade union movement seeking to advance the issue further in the context of future public service pay talks. Indeed, negotiations on a successor agreement to Lansdowne Road will shortly get under way. </p></reply>

Pillar 3, entitled Build More Homes, has a key objective of increasing the output of private housing to meet demand at affordable prices. </p><p>The opening up of state owned lands for the development of for mixed-tenure housing, particularly in the major urban areas, where demand is greatest, is an important policy initiative.  On 27 April 2017, I published details of some 2,000 hectares of land in public ownership, which has the potential to deliver up to 50,000 homes nationally. Full details of these sites can be accessed on the Rebuilding Ireland Housing Land Map at the following link: .</p><p>I have asked all local authorities to be innovative and proactive in developing these sites. The final model for each site will be the subject of careful consideration by the local authority concerned, the elected members included, who are best placed to know and provide for the housing need in their area. Indeed, the Dublin local authorities are well advanced in bringing large-scale sites forward for mixed tenure housing, with projects advertised that can deliver circa 3,000 mixed-tenure homes in the Dublin City Council and South Dublin County Council areas alone.  </p><p>Other measures being taken to increase the supply of housing include:</p><p>- &euro;200 million Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund;</p><p>- National Treasury Management Agency financing of large-scale &ldquo;on-site&rdquo; infrastructure;</p><p>- Planning Reforms;</p><p>- Putting in place a National Planning Framework and land management actions;</p><p>- Efficient design and delivery methods to lower housing delivery costs;</p><p>- Measures to support construction innovation and skills;</p><p>- The enhanced supply of more affordable starter homes in key locations through a targeted rebate of development contributions in Dublin and Cork for housing supplied under certain price levels;</p><p>- New National Apartment Planning Guidelines, reducing the cost of apartment building;</p><p>- Changes to aspects of the operation of Strategic Development Zones to enable swifter adjustments to meet market requirements;</p><p>- A vacant sites levy.</p><p>Pillar 4 of the Rebuilding Ireland Plan, entitled Improve the Rental Sector, provided for the introduction of an affordable rental scheme to enhance the capacity of the private rented sector to provide quality and affordable accommodation for households currently paying a disproportionate amount of disposable income on rent. Lands held by local authorities in rent pressure zones are to be brought to market on a competitive tendering basis, with a view to leveraging the value of the land to deliver the optimum number of units for rent, targeting middle income households, in mixed tenure developments.</p></reply>

As set out in the Strategy for the Rental Sector published in December 2016, the commitment on affordable rental is to be progressed through kick-starting supply in rent pressure zones.  Lands held by local authorities in rent pressure zones are to be brought to market on a competitive tendering basis, with a view to leveraging the value of the land to deliver the optimum number of units for rent, targeting middle income households, in mixed tenure developments.  The cost of providing rental units is to be permanently reduced by lowering the initial investment and development costs for providers - AHB or private - allowing the rental units to be made available at below market prices without the need for ongoing rental subsidies.</p><p>In this regard, an important policy intervention in the delivery of new housing supply under Pillar 3 of Rebuilding Ireland is the development of State-owned lands for mixed-tenure housing, particularly in the major urban areas, where demand is greatest.  On 27 April 2017, I published details of some 2,000 hectares of land in public ownership, which has the potential to deliver up to 50,000 homes nationally.  Full details of these sites can be accessed on the Rebuilding Ireland Housing Land Map at the following link: .</p><p>I have asked all local authorities to be innovative and proactive in developing these sites.  The final model for each site will be the subject of careful consideration by the local authority concerned, the elected members included, who are best placed to know and provide for the housing need in their area.  Indeed, the Dublin local authorities are well advanced in bringing large-scale sites forward for mixed tenure housing, with projects advertised that can deliver circa 3,000 mixed-tenure homes in the Dublin City Council and South Dublin County Council areas alone.</p></reply>

The payment continues to be paid in respect of children up to their 18th birthday who are in full-time education, or who have a disability.  Child Benefit is currently paid to around 623,000 families in respect of some 1.2 million children, with an estimated expenditure of over &euro;2 billion in 2017. </p><p>Budget 2009 reduced the age for eligibility for Child Benefit from 19 years to less than 18 years.  A value for money review of child income supports, published by the Department of Social Protection in 2010, found that the participation pattern of children in education supports the current age limit for Child Benefit. </p><p>Extending the cut off for entitlement to allow Child Benefit to be paid in respect of those children who turn 18 year old and are still in secondary education would not be a targeted approach given the universality of Child Benefit.  The adoption of such a proposal would have significant cost implications and would have to be considered in an overall budgetary context. </p><p>Families on low incomes can avail of a number of social welfare schemes that support children in full-time education until the age of 22, including:</p><p>- qualified child increases (IQCs) with primary social welfare payments;</p><p>- family income supplement (FIS) for low-paid employees with children;</p><p>- the back to school clothing and footwear allowance for low income families (paid at the full-time second level education rate).</p><p>I am satisfied these schemes provide targeted assistance that is directly linked with household income and thereby supports low-income families with older children participating in full-time education. </p></reply>

This compared to 14.4% the year before.  The at-risk-of-poverty rate increased from 25.2% to 34.8% and basic deprivation rose from 51.3% to 53.2% for this group in 2015. </p>  <p>  These figures (like other statistics for very small groups in the survey) have been volatile in recent years.  This is due to smaller sample sizes.  It is not possible to say with certainty whether the changes over the year are statistically significant and indicative of a sustained trend.  My Department has not therefore conducted any further analysis of the reason for the specific developments described for 2015. </p>  <p>  Given the continuing economic recovery throughout 2016 and measures introduced in Budgets 2016 and 2017, it is reasonable to expect future figures to show improvements.  I will continue to work with my Government colleagues to ensure that the economic recovery is experienced in all regions and by all families, households and individuals. </p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s strategy for addressing poverty and social exclusion is set out in the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion.  The Plan identifies a wide range of targeted actions and interventions to achieve the overall objective of reducing consistent poverty.  The Department will review the Plan this year, as it reaches the end of its current term, with a view to developing an updated plan for future periods.  The Department will also review the national social target for poverty reduction.  This review will be undertaken in consultation with relevant stakeholders.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to increasing the employment opportunities for people with a disability.  The Comprehensive Employment Strategy for people with disabilities adopts a cross-government approach that brings together various measures, to be taken by different Departments and State agencies, in a concerted effort to ad dress the barriers and challenges that impact on the employment of people with disabilities. The six strategic priorities are to: build skills, capacity and independence; provide bridges and supports into work; make work pay; promote job retention and re-entry into work; provide co-ordinated and seamless support; and engage employers.  These priorities are incorporated into the Pathways to Work Strategy and this ensures that there is an integrated focus on supports that enable people with disabilities to participate in employment where they have the capacity to do so.</p>  <p>  My Department provides a range of specific income, activation and employment supports for people with a disability.  For instance, the partial capacity benefit scheme enables recipients of invalidity pension and illness benefit to take-up employment, on a voluntary basis, while continuing to receive income support. The Department manages a supported employment service (EmployAbility) which provides a dedicated job-coaching service for people with disabilities. </p>  <p>  Intreo services are also available to provide employment support services for people with disabilities who wish to engage with the service on a voluntary basis. There is also a focus on supports available to employers who employ people with disabilities such as the Wage Subsidy Scheme and the Workplace Equipment Adaption Grant Scheme.</p>  <p>  The report of the Make Work Pay Interdepartmental Group was recently published. My Department is currently considering its recommendations and has already introduced a number of changes on foot of it.  For example, people on a long-term disability payment, including disability allowance, can keep their Free Travel Pass for five years after taking-up work.  My Department is also launching a protocol to allow people to return to Disability Allowance seamlessly if work doesn&rsquo;t work out within a year. </p></reply>

In 2016, some 1.7 million applications for benefit, assistance and access to schemes were received and processed and over 82 million individual payments were made to people across all age groups and to employers.  The scale of its operations and expenditure demand that a robust and integrated range of control and anti-fraud measures are in place.  Measures to prevent and detect fraud and enhance controls across the Department&rsquo;s various schemes are set out in the Compliance and Anti-Fraud Strategy which covers the period 2014 &ndash; 2018. </p><p>The &ldquo;Welfare cheats cheat us all&rdquo; publicity campaign is designed to:</p><p>- Promote discussion on the topic of social welfare fraud and challenge the perceptions of those who see it as a victimless crime;</p><p>- Encourage reporting of suspected/known social welfare fraud.  The &ldquo;direct marketing&rdquo; element of the campaign appeals to the public to report fraud and makes is easier for them to do so.  It also affords an opportunity to increase awareness of the Department&rsquo;s fraud reporting contact numbers and online reporting options;</p><p>- Demonstrate that the Government and Department takes the issue of social welfare fraud very seriously and that it will investigate and prosecute, where this is found to be warranted; and</p><p>- Demonstrate that the Department is very conscious of its obligations, as one of the largest spending Departments in the State, and the importance of protecting the integrity of the social welfare system.</p><p>The delivery of the campaign will achieve a balance of coverage across all demographics and regions and incorporate print, national and regional radio stations, digital and outdoor advertising.  The national and regional radio, print and outdoor advertising will run for a period of two weeks, with a longer timeframe of 4 to 6 weeks for digital/online advertising.</p><p>The cost of the advertising campaign is &euro;165,988 excluding VAT.  It includes all design and advertising costs associated with the campaign (print advertising, national and regional radio advertising, outdoor and online/digital advertising).  No additional costs arise in staff resources, website development or the provision of the telephone reporting facility.</p><p>Nearly 950,000 entitlement reviews and investigations were conducted across the Department&rsquo;s schemes in 2016.  These reviews yielded &euro;506 million in control savings for the year.  Reviews and investigations of entitlements are conducted by social welfare staff, social welfare inspectors and inspectors assigned to the Special Investigations Unit and a combination of desk-based assessment of entitlements, direct enquiries with recipients of social welfare payments, and face to face interviews with customers are used to check and determine on-going entitlement.  Details of savings recorded by DSP scheme are set out in table 1.</p><p><b>TABLE:  Savings recorded by social welfare scheme 2016</b><table><tr><th>Scheme</th><th>Savings Recorded</th><th>Scheme</th><th>Savings Recorded </th></tr><tr><td>Jobseekers Allowance &amp;amp; Benefit</td><td>&euro;172m</td><td>Disability, Invalidity and Illness</td><td>&euro;45m</td></tr><tr><td>Pensions and household benefits</td><td>&euro;60m</td><td>One parent family payments</td><td>&euro;77m</td></tr><tr><td>Carer&rsquo;s Allowance &amp;amp; Benefit</td><td>&euro;9m</td><td>Child Benefit</td><td>&euro;69m</td></tr><tr><td>Family Income Supplement</td><td>&euro;42m</td><td>Supplementary Welfare Allowance</td><td>&euro;26m</td></tr><tr><td>Employer inspections/reviews</td><td>&euro;6m</td><td>TOTAL</td><td>&euro;506m</td></tr></table></p><p>Savings are calculated when a social welfare claim is reduced in value or terminated following a review or investigation initiated by my Department.  Control savings do not include any element where the customer voluntarily told the Department of changes in their means or circumstances which resulted in a reduction in the rate of payment or termination of the claim.  Departmental error cases are also excluded from the savings figure.</p><p>The basis of the savings calculated is scheme specific.  The nature of the scheme is taken into account - in particular whether it is short-term (e.g. jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit or supplementary welfare allowance) or more long-term (e.g. State Pension Contributory/Non-Contributory).  Also taken into account is the length of time a person who has a claim reduced or terminated is expected to remain off a particular scheme or at the reduced rate of payment. </p><p>The Department raised &euro;110m in overpayments in 2016 of which &euro;41m related to customer fraud &ndash; further information on this is set out in table 2.  Total expenditure on the Department&rsquo;s programmes and schemes in 2016 was &euro;19.2 billion.  Overpayments as a percentage of total programmes expenditure was of the order of 0.5%.  </p><p>The Deputies should also note that in 2016, approx. &euro;82m in overpayments were recovered by my Department.  This relates to overpayments that were raised in 2016 and in previous years.  </p><p><b>TABLE:  Value and number of suspected fraud overpayments recorded: 2011 to 2016</b><table><tr><th></th><th>2016</th><th>2015</th><th>2014</th><th>2013</th><th>2012</th><th>2011</th></tr><tr><td></td><td>&euro;m</td><td>&euro;m</td><td>&euro;m</td><td>&euro;m</td><td>&euro;m</td><td>&euro;m</td></tr><tr><td>Value of fraud overpayments raised</td><td>&euro;41.0</td><td>&euro;49.0</td><td>&euro;52.5</td><td>&euro;61.9</td><td>&euro;41.0</td><td>&euro;34.9</td></tr><tr><td>Number of overpayments raised</td><td>16,225</td><td>21,407</td><td>27,437</td><td>27,489</td><td>20,700</td><td>20,585</td></tr></table></p><p>Data is not compiled in a manner that will allow for the number of suspected fraud cases to be reported by county without significant administrative effort.</p><p>As of 2 May, the number of reports received since the fraud campaign was launched is 1,434.

These include:</p><p>i. a proportion of any mortgage interest paid by the claimant on the part of the property rented,</p><p>ii. a 15% deduction for voids (i.e. periods when the accommodation is vacant between lettings), and,</p><p>iii. if the rooms let are furnished, a 5% deduction for wear and tear.</p><p>These arrangements are outlined on the Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: .</p><p>In addition, a special provision exists for claimants of the State Pension (Non-Contributory) and Widow&rsquo;s, Widower&rsquo;s or Surviving Civil Partner&rsquo;s (Non-Contributory) Pension, whereby no assessment is made of any money received in respect of rent from a person who lives with the pensioner where, but for that person, the pensioner would be living alone. </p><p>Fully disregarding all rental income would run contrary to the policy of ensuring that social welfare expenditure is targeted to those who need it the most.  It could also potentially negatively impact on the incentive to work for working age recipients.  Any change to my Department&rsquo;s means policies would have to be considered in the overall policy and budgetary context.</p></reply>

My Department has also recently been made aware of his health issues, which have reportedly deteriorated seriously during his most recent incarceration.</p>  <p>  Ireland attaches a high priority to safeguarding human rights defenders, and has continually advocated for freedom for civil society actors to operate in a safe and enabling environment, without repression.  In August 2014, officials from my Department met with the individual who is the subject of this Question, and discussed the situation of human rights in Bahrain with him.  In October 2015, the Bahrain National Institution for Human Rights (BNIHR) came to Ireland on a training visit, which included meetings with Irish human rights and civil society organisations.  Officials from my Department also met with this group, and set out Ireland&rsquo;s support for human rights promotion across the Middle East region.  We also engage with a number of Irish and international NGOs on human rights issues in Bahrain.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s concerns about human rights issues in Bahrain, in particular around civil liberties, are also regularly conveyed to the Bahraini authorities.  In March, officials from my Department met with an official from the Bahraini Embassy in London to discuss the human rights situation in Bahrain, and this specific case was discussed.  My officials also raised ongoing human rights issues with Bahrain in the context of Bahrain&rsquo;s Universal Periodic Review, which took place in Geneva earlier this week.  In advance of this review, the Irish Mission to the UN in Geneva supported an event by the Bahrain Centre for Human Rights in early February.  </p>  <p>  Further, Ireland&rsquo;s (non-resident) Ambassador to Bahrain met with the Bahraini Deputy Minister for International Affairs, Abdullah Bin Ahmed Al Khalifa, at the beginning of this year and they discussed human rights.  As such, my Department utilises all possible opportunities to express Ireland&rsquo;s concerns about the human rights situation in Bahrain to the Bahraini authorities, and the case of this individual in particular has been raised where appropriate.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy puts this question to me at a time where we have witnessed some deterioration in the human rights situation in Bahrain, in particular in the targeting those who express dissent or criticism of the Bahraini Government.  My Department will continue to monitor the situation in Bahrain, and will also continue to call on the Bahraini Government to make good on their stated commitment to make progress in the area of human rights.</p></reply>

Possible criteria include: economics benefits; positive impact on equality and social inclusion; consistency with the achievement of Climate and Energy Goals; alignment with the new National Planning Framework; and addressing current bottlenecks. Views were also sought as to whether any other criteria should be considered.</p><p>Taking these submissions into account and drawing on analysis carried out by my Department, the proposals received from Departments will be assessed with a view to making recommendations to Government in Q3 2017, to inform final decisions by Government on revised capital allocations, to be announced in the context of Budget 2018.</p><p>It should also be noted that, as specified in the Capital Plan itself, each Government Department must ensure that individual projects and investment proposals are subject to all of the relevant appraisal processes and value for money tests in accordance with the Public Spending Code (PSC) before Exchequer resources are committed under the Capital Plan.  The Capital Plan itself sets out the framework and broad direction for investment priorities and provides Exchequer allocations to Departments.</p></reply>

There are currently 1,600 organisations and individuals who have registered on the lobbying register, and just over 11,000 returns have been submitted and are available for viewing on lobbying.ie. It is clear that the work undertaken by my Department and the Standards Commission in leading awareness and understanding of the Act has been effective and I am confident that this momentum will be maintained as the work continues.</p><p>Section 2 of the Act required that the first review of the operation of the Act be commenced by 1 September 2016, that a consultation process be undertaken in the context of that review and that the report of the review be submitted to both Houses of the Oireachtas. The Act also requires further reviews to be carried out every three years. </p><p>I am pleased to advise that there was a good outcome from the public consultation process with some 31 submissions received from different sectors of society including academia, representatives of business and other interest groups, Government Departments and public affairs organisations. The submissions are broadly supportive of the legislation and consider that it provides an instrument for the public to gain insights into the decisions and actions of public servants and the communications that lead to these outcomes. The submissions are available on my Departments website and can be viewed on .</p><p>As regards the report of the review, it sets out the purpose of the Act, the approach taken in the review, the international perspective, the findings in terms of an overview of the issues raised in the submissions and our responses, and recommends a number of administrative actions to be taken.  This report has been sent to the Ceann Comhairle of the D&aacute;il, the Cathaoirleach of the Sean&aacute;d and the Chairman of the Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach on 2 May 2017 and laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is available to view at .</p><p>Extension of the categories of officials comprehended by the Act was considered by my officials in the context of the review.  In this regard, consideration was given to a number of factors including:</p><p>- it was a matter raised by a number of stakeholders but stakeholders disagreed on who should be included with some seeking that the list of Designated Public Officials (DPOs) should include senior officials in influential public bodies, and some seeking that the Principal level be included on a case by case basis only.  The majority of submissions however considered that inclusion of the Principal in the civil service or any other categories of public officials as DPOs would place a great burden on lobbyists in terms of reporting relevant communications.</p><p>- The categories of DPOs comprehended by the Act already covers the major categories of positions who are the decision makers in respect of both the civil service and the local authorities. </p><p>- The Act itself is in force for a relatively short period and the enforcement provisions only commenced in January this year. </p><p>Taking the above into account, I consider that the Act needs further time to bed down before any extension of the cohort of DPOs takes place.  This will provide the opportunity for further evidence of the groups of persons to be considered for inclusion as DPOs to be gathered and the matter can be considered in the 2019 review of the Act or before that if I deem it necessary.  </p><p>I am not recommending that any amendments be made to the Act at this stage for a number of reasons.  I believe that it would be prudent to allow further time for the system to establish itself, and for additional evidence regarding how the operation of the Act is proceeding to be gathered and assessed.  In addition, Ireland is in a small leading group of countries with effective lobbying regulation.  Introducing the prospect of potential legislative change at this early stage clearly has the potential to give rise to significant uncertainty regarding the future shape of the legislation which runs the risk of adversely affecting the operation of the lobbying regime.  </p><p>Furthermore I am advised that the majority of issues raised have either already been dealt with by the Standards Commission through its work and use of the website or, in my view, can be handled administratively without any requirement for legislative change. I have set out a number of administrative actions to be taken such as development of further guidance, FAQs etc.  My strong view is that legislative change is not something that should be embarked upon unless there is a compelling business case for change, such as in circumstances where the legislation is not functioning effectively in a significant way, in terms of the policy objectives for the legislation. This is clearly not the situation we find ourselves in with this Act as reflected in the positive results to date and in international commentary.</p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their income and assets while the State pays the balance of the cost.  The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings. </p>  <p>  When the NHSS commenced in 2009, a commitment was made that it would be reviewed after three years.  The Report of the Review was published in July 2015.  Arising out of the Review, a number of key issues have been identified for more detailed consideration across Departments and Agencies.</p>  <p>  An Interdepartmental/Agency Working Group has been established to progress the recommendations contained in the Review.  This Group is chaired by the Department of Health and includes representatives from the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the HSE, the Revenue Commissioners, and when required, the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF).  These recommendations include examining the treatment of business and farm assets for the purposes of the financial assessment element of the Scheme.  This work is currently underway.  An initial report on progress was submitted to the Cabinet Committee on Health in September 2016.</p>  <p>  Once all of the relevant Review recommendations have been considered, any amendments required to the Scheme will be identified.  Changes which require legislative implementation will be addressed collectively; in that regard it is important to remember that the NHSS is largely underpinned by primary legislation.</p>  <p>  The Programme for a Partnership Government has also committed to reviewing the NHSS to remove any discrimination against small businesses and family farms.  This review is currently underway.  I am committed to this review of the position with regard to family farms and small business for the purposes of the financial assessment element of the Scheme.</p></reply>

It offers free bowel screening to men and women aged 60-69.  The BowelScreen Round One Programme Report, 2012-2015, which was launched on 25th April 2017, shows that 521 cancers were detected through bowel screening, 3 out of 4 of which were detected at an early stage.  Bowel cancer is the second most common cancer in both men and women and bowel screening is recommended as an effective programme  to reduce cancer mortality.</p>  <p>  The BowelScreen programme is adequately funded and strenuous efforts are being made to improve the uptake, particularly among men who have lower rates of participation but significantly higher rates of cancer detection compared to women.  These efforts include digital and social media initiatives, as well as targeted radio and press advertisements.  The BowelScreen website (www.bowelscreen.ie) was developed to provide information to the public and allow them to ensure they are on the register, as well as providing a suite of information leaflets, posters and flyers for healthcare professionals.  BowelScreen continues to promote the screening programme by engaging with stakeholder groups in promoting and encouraging the screening population to avail of this free test.</p></reply>

The World Health Organisation estimates that up to 3 million lives are saved each year as a result of vaccination and the scientific evidence is clear that benefits of vaccines outweigh the known side effects.</p>  <p>  The immunisation programme in Ireland is based on the advice of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC).  NIAC is a committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland comprising of experts in a number of specialties including infectious diseases, paediatrics and public health.  The committee's recommendations are informed by public health advice and international best practice.  All relevant and appropriate information is taken into account when deciding to make changes to the State's immunisation programmes. </p>  <p>  The Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) is responsible for monitoring the safety and quality of all medicines that are licensed in Ireland.  While no medicine is entirely without risk, the safety of vaccines, as with all medicines, is carefully monitored and any new evidence concerning side-effects is taken into account.  The HPRA and the European Medicines Agency continually monitor adverse events to vaccination.</p>  <p>  Unfounded, false claims have been made of an association between HPV vaccination and a number of conditions experienced by a group of young women.  It appears that they first suffered symptoms around the time they received the HPV vaccine and a false connection is being made between the HPV vaccine and the onset of these symptoms.  It is important to reassure people that anyone who is suffering ill health is eligible to seek medical attention, and to access appropriate health and social care services, irrespective of the cause of their symptoms.  The diverse nature of these symptoms, which can have both physical and psychological causes, are shared by many conditions which has implications for both diagnostic and treatment services.  The individual nature of the needs of some children may require access to specialist services and the HSE is working to put in place clinical care pathways appropriate to their differing medical needs.</p>  <p>  As there is no scientific evidence that the vaccine causes long term illnesses, the HPV vaccine cannot be held responsible for these illnesses.  However, this misinformation has led to a significant drop in uptake rates of the HPV vaccine.  This means that a large cohort of girls is now at risk of developing cervical cancer later in their lives.</p>  <p>  Misinformation is causing real harm to those unvaccinated children and adults who develop vaccine preventable diseases, and to people who seek inappropriate treatments for real conditions that are not caused by vaccines.  Any parent who has doubts or questions about vaccination should talk to their family doctor, or alternatively to visit the National Immunisation office website.  These sources of information are clear and accurate and will answer any queries you may have about the benefits or risks of vaccination.  Vaccination is the best way for parents to make sure their children are healthy and protected from preventable diseases.</p></reply>

Work has been progressing on the Review process, including putting in place the Review structures, finalising the Terms of Reference, assessing external expertise requirements, and considering options for stakeholder consultation.</p><p>The review is being led by my Department and overseen by a Steering Group which is now in place.  Also, an independent peer group of international health experts has been established to review and validate the review methodology and findings.  My Department has recently gone to tender for technical, analytical and engagement expertise to assist in the Review process.</p><p>Assessing capacity requirements, including those mentioned by the Deputy, is a complex task and cannot be divorced from considerations on the underlying model of care we want to develop for the Irish health service.  It is widely acknowledged that primary care can provide more appropriate and effective management and treatment of some illnesses and conditions, especially chronic diseases.  Similarly, the availability of non-acute beds and services in the community can mitigate the need for acute hospital admission, or facilitate earlier discharge.  These factors directly contribute to the demands on the acute hospital system.</p><p>For this reason, I have confirmed already that the review will have a wider scope than previous exercises and will examine key elements of primary and community care infrastructure in addition to hospital facilities.</p><p>The Terms of Reference for the review are as follows:</p><blockquote>a) to determine and review current capacity, both public and private, in the health system and benchmark with international comparators;<br /><br />b) to determine drivers of future demand and estimate impact on capacity requirements to 2030; <br /><br />c) to consider and analyse how key reforms to the model of care will impact on future capacity requirements across the system; and<br /><br />d) to provide an overall assessment, including prioritisation and sequencing, of future capacity requirements on a phased basis for the period 2017 &ndash; 2030 at a national and regional level, cognisant of resource availability.</blockquote><p>It is essential that this review is progressed sufficiently to enable it to feed into the mid-term review of the capital programme, which will take place later in the year.  While the review will consider capacity requirements over the next decade or so, I am anxious that it also provides a short-term focus and determines how capital and other investment over the coming years can be best targeted, given the current pressures within our hospital services.</p><p>I look forward to the emerging findings later in the year.</p></reply>

Our hospitals are now carrying out four-times more procedures in patients aged 65 years and over, and twice as many in the under 65 age group since 2000. Last year alone there was a 4% increase in inpatient and day-case activity over 2015, and in 2016 almost 1.69 million patients received inpatient or daycase treatment in our hospitals, an increase of almost 40,000 on the previous year.  </p>  <p>  Reducing waiting times for the longest waiting patients is one of this Government's key priorities.  Consequently, Budget 2017 allocated &euro;20 million to the NTPF, rising to &euro;55 million in 2018. In order to reduce the numbers of long-waiting patients, I asked the HSE to develop Waiting List Action Plans for 2017 in the areas of Inpatient/Daycase, Scoliosis and Outpatient Services.  These plans have now been finalised and will be communicated shortly.</p>  <p>  The NTPF publishes waiting list data by speciality, hospital and hospital group each month including data for orthopaedics and cardiology. This data can be viewed on its website at NTPF.ie.</p></reply>

It is worth highlighting that the net budget for long-term residential care in 2017 is &euro;940m and the Nursing Homes Support Scheme will support 23,603 clients by the end of the year.</p>  <p>  The Health Information and Quality Authority is the independent authority established under the Health Act 2007 to drive continuous improvement and to monitor safety and quality in Ireland&rsquo;s health and personal social care services. Since 2009 all nursing homes - public, voluntary and private have been registered and inspected by HIQA.  At the end of 2016 there were 30,396 beds registered with HIQA. </p>  <p>  Public Nursing Units are an essential part of our national nursing home infrastructure.  They provide 5,000 long stay residential care beds.  They also provide about 2,000 short stay community public beds nationally providing combination of &lsquo;step up/step down&rsquo; care, intermediate care, rehabilitation and respite care. To allow flexibility, these are interchangeable in their use depending on demand.  </p>  <p>  Many public units are housed in buildings that are less than ideal in the modern context, but notwithstanding this, the standard of care delivered to residents is generally of a very high standard.  It is important therefore that we consolidate our existing stock and this is the aim of the 5 year Capital programme for Community Nursing Units which was announced last year.  This provides the framework to allow for an enhanced programme to replace, upgrade and refurbish these care facilities which will consolidate our existing public stock and is expected to provide about 250 additional beds.  </p>  <p>  With regard to private facilities, in Budget 2016 the Minister for Finance announced changes to the Employment and Investment Incentive Scheme to allow for investment in the expansion, management and operation of nursing homes. The inclusion of nursing home expansion works in the Scheme was influenced by an analysis submitted by the Department of Health on measures, including tax measures, to support targeted development in nursing homes and primary care centres.</p>  <p>  I would like to reiterate that it is Government policy that long-term nursing home care should be a last resort and we want to develop home and community care services to provide a more viable alternative to nursing home care for a greater number of people. In that context,  I am prioritising the development of a regulatory and funding model for home care services. I have committed to launching a public consultation at the end of May which will allow all those with an interest to express their views and ideas, including older people themselves, their families, and healthcare workers.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government commits to a decisive shift within the health service towards primary care in order to deliver better care close to home in communities across the country. The development of a new, modernised contract for the provision of general practitioner services will be a key element in facilitating this process. </p>  <p>  Previous engagements have resulted in a number of service developments including the introduction of a Diabetes Cycle of Care for adult GMS patients with Type 2 Diabetes, an enhanced support framework for rural GPs, and a revised list of special items of service under the contract to encourage the provision of more services in the primary care setting. These measures, combined with the under-6s and over-70s universal GP care initiatives, have increased the financial support for general practice. </p>  <p>  The next phase of discussions on a new GP contract is under way and engagement with GP representative bodies began in January.  As with any negotiation-type process, and given the range and complexity of the issues to be discussed, the engagement may take some time. While I am of course anxious to see good progress made, it is not my intention to set a deadline for completion of discussions. I look forward to positive and constructive engagements with GP representatives in the months ahead.</p></reply>

It is important that any such improvements are evidence-based and informed by national and international research.  This can be seen in our national strategy to reduce suicide, Connecting for Life, which builds on previous work and contributes key elements to moving forward. It is based on extensive consultation, a global knowledge base and defined commitments across government departments and key statutory and non-statutory agencies in Ireland.</p>  <p>  'A Vision for Change', the policy framework for our mental health services, came to the end of its 10-year term in 2016 and preparations for a review and updating of policy have been underway since early last year.  In September 2016, an external evidence and expert review was commissioned from WRC Consultants as the first step in determining the parameters of a revision of A Vision for Change.</p>  <p>  This review was completed on 17 February 2017, and will provide evidence to determine the policy direction for a revision of A Vision for Change, both in terms of international best practice and the experience of implementing A Vision for Change. The review is currently being assessed by the Department of Health. </p>  <p>  In line with a commitment given to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 6 October 2016, an Oversight Group will be established within three months of the review being finalised to oversee the development of a new policy for mental health based on the outcome of the Expert Review. Terms of Reference for this Group are being finalised. The policy review process will also involve consultation with key stakeholders.</p>  <p>  Improvements continue to be made across key areas of mental health service provision. A central commitment in the Programme for Partnership Government relates to the provision of 24/7 mental health services. I am presently considering HSE proposals for an implementation plan for the provision of a 7-day service response across all HSE mental health service areas, which should be produced in the coming weeks. Substantial funding has also been provided in 2017 for Mental Health capital projects, most notably to commence the construction of the new forensic hospital at Portrane this year to replace the Central Mental Hospital, Dundrum.</p></reply>

This Initiative was developed to manage the expected winter surge in demand for hospital care in an integrated way across Primary, Acute and Social Care. This Initiative concluded in March.</p><p>A range of practical measures to address ED overcrowding were implemented, including 90 additional beds, aids and appliances for over 4,450 patients, around 1,000 extra homecare packages and 615 additional transitional care bed approvals.</p><p>During the Winter Initiative, delayed discharges reduced from 638 in September 2016 to a low of 434 at the end of December and were maintained below 500 from mid-December through to end February.  This had a positive impact on ED overcrowding and trolley numbers, in freeing up beds for use by patients awaiting admission to hospital.</p><p>I can assure the Deputy that there continues to be a very strong focus on reducing ED overcrowding.  My Department and the HSE are currently engaged in a process to commence winter planning for next year and to achieve an improvement trajectory in ED performance.</p><p>The HSE's Special Delivery Unit continues to work closely with hospitals to identify improvements that can be made to support patient flow, reduce trolley numbers and improve patients' ED experience</p></reply>

Having carefully considered the matter, I decided that, without prejudice, there is a case for a review of the policy on allocations between the RSW Pelagic segment and the polyvalent segment of the fleet, taking account of request by the IS&amp;WFO. In that regard, I decided that I am restricting consideration to the increased quota for Ireland in 2017 over that in 2016.  </p>  <p>  It is important to note that I have not made any decision at this time to change the allocations between the segments in respect of this part of the quota.  All relevant issues will be carefully evaluated and subject to a full consultation with stakeholders before I decide if any amendment to the policy is justified for the proper and effective management of the mackerel fishery.</p>  <p>  The public consultation process concluded on 28 February 2017 and 353 submissions were received.  All submissions are currently being evaluated.  </p>  <p>  To support transparency in this process, it is intended that all views received on the Consultation Document and/or any clarification provided will be publicly made available on my Department&rsquo;s website.

Good agronomic advice is to apply as much slurry as possible in the springtime to maximise the fertiliser nitrogen value of slurry.  Spring applied slurry is worth approximately 3 units of nitrogen per 1,000 gallons extra compared with summer application.  Since the introduction of the Nitrates Regulations in 2006 there has been a significant increase in the volume of slurry applied in springtime rather than at other times of the year.  The regulations require farmers achieve high levels of nitrogen use efficiency from slurry and this can only be achieved by applying slurry in the right weather conditions (cool, overcast, misty conditions).</p>  <p>  The Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment recently launched a public consultation to inform the development of a National Clean Air Strategy.  The consultation document identified the main issues in relation to air quality and emission sources.  It recognised that the spreading of slurry can, depending on the timing of the application and the weather conditions, result in nitrogen loss from slurry to the atmosphere through ammonia volatilisation.  That Department will conduct a thorough examination of all submissions received as part of its consultation phase.</p>  <p>  On foot of farmer demand to improve the utilisation of slurry as a fertiliser, my Department is assisting farmers under TAMS in the purchase of Low Emission Slurry Spreading equipment such as the trailing shoe.  In addition a significant cohort of farmers have applied under the GLAS scheme to apply slurry using low emission equipment. </p></reply>

The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.  This is being achieved through private investment by commercial telecommunications companies and through a State intervention in areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.  </p><p>A key principle of the NBP is to support and stimulate commercial investment through policy and regulatory measures. Commercial investment since the publication of the NBP has considerably exceeded expectations. To date, the commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2.5bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.  It is important to note that the significant investment required to make high speed telecommunication services publicly available, occurs within a fully liberalised market. It is a matter for the competing network providers to decide those areas which can be served on a commercial basis, in the first instance.</p><p>In November 2016 my Department initiated a review of an eir proposal to rollout fibre to over 300,000 premises in rural areas on a commercial basis. These premises were in areas that had formed part of the procurement process for the NBP State Intervention area. This analysis is now complete and on 4 April, I signed a Commitment Agreement with eir in relation to its plans to provide high speed broadband to an additional 300,000 premises in rural areas on a commercial basis.  Eir has committed to doing this work over a 90 week period, with an average of 500 premises passed per day. The rollout plan has been agreed with my Department and will be monitored closely by my Department to ensure that eir meets its obligations under the Agreement.  A copy of the Commitment Agreement is available on my website .</p><p>It is important to note the eir network is a wholesale network.  This means that existing retail internet service providers can contract with eir to access the network and use it to meet the future needs of their customers.</p></reply>

Based on the findings in that report it is envisaged that maintenance and renewal of the road network will continue to be the main priority over the next period and the bulk of the roads capital budget, approximately &euro;4.4 billion, is earmarked for such essential work.  A further &euro;600 million has been allocated for implementation of the PPP road programme which is already underway and the balance for the limited number of road improvement projects included in the Plan.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has indicated that there is a total of &euro;2.6bn in additional funding available between 2018 and 2021 for allocation under the Review of the Capital Plan.  While I am  conscious of the many competing demands for extra resources, my Department has submitted a very strong case for additional funding consistent with the principles identified in SFILT and a number of the proposed measures, if approved for funding, will be of benefit to the border counties. </p>  <p>  The main emphasis of funding for the rail network in the Government's Capital Plan is on the maintenance of the existing network to ensure it remains safe and fit for purpose.  The Northern rail line plays an important role in linking communities North and South of the Border.  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and Translink have established a joint Enterprise Board chaired by the CEO's of both companies aimed at implementing improvements to the Enterprise cross-border Dublin/Belfast service. </p>  <p>  The full implications for Ireland of the UK leaving the EU will only become clear once formal Brexit negotiations progress.  The Government will continue to plan for and mitigate the associated risks of Brexit throughout the EU/UK withdrawal process.</p></reply>

Works on those roads are funded from the local authority's own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.</p>  <p>  It is matter for the local authority to select, prioritise, agree and progress its roads programme for the year and the purpose of Exchequer funding is to supplement the own resources of local authorities, not to meet the full costs of schemes.  I do emphasise to local authorities the importance of prioritising expenditure on roads when setting budgets and allocating own resources, including Local Property Tax receipts.</p>  <p>  In relation to new road schemes, the Capital Plan 2016-2021 sets out transport investment priorities from 2016 to 2022.  The transport elements of the Plan were framed by the conclusions reached in my Department&rsquo;s Strategic Investment Framework for Land Transport.  Based on the findings in that report it is envisaged that maintenance and renewal of the road network will continue to be the main priority over the next period and the bulk of the roads capital budget, approximately &euro;4.4 billion, is earmarked for such essential work with a further &euro;600 million allocated for implementation of the PPP road programme which is already underway.</p>  <p>  I announced the 2017 regional and local road allocations to local authorities on 24 January 2017 and all grant funding for 2017 has now been allocated.  Details of allocations are available in the 2017 regional and local road allocation booklet in the D&aacute;il library.</p>  <p>  With regard to national roads, details of the 2017 TII start of year allocations to each local authority are also available in the D&aacute;il library.</p>  <p>  As regards your other queries in relation to national roads, I have referred your Questions to TII for direct reply.

The Taxi Regulation Review Group included representatives of the taxi industry and its recommendations were widely publicised to the industry, including through the National Transport Authority's website and industry updates.  The underlying principle for the recommendation was that a licence should determine a person's suitability to carry out a function and it should have no monetary value or be traded on the open market.  The measure was provided for in Section 14(1) of the Taxi Regulation Act 2013 which was commenced with effect from 06 April 2014.  Special provisions, contained in Section 15 of the 2013 Act, as amended, apply in the case of the death of a licence holder, whereby a person nominated by the licence holder before his/her death may apply to the National Transport Authority (NTA) for the grant of a licence of the same category.</p>  <p>  The regulation of the SPSV industry is a matter for the NTA under the provisions of the Taxi Regulation Acts 2013 and 2016, including administration of the nomination process under section 15.  The NTA has also made Regulations relating to rental of a small public service vehicle to another person.</p>  <p>  In light of the NTA's responsibilities in these matters, I have referred your question to the NTA for direct reply to you.

Client companies of Enterprise Ireland, IDA, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and Shannon Development across all sectors within manufacturing and internationally traded services were eligible to apply.  The fund was administered by Enterprise Ireland.</p>  <p>  Funding was in the form of preference shares, supporting a range of activities including market development, productivity improvements, cost reduction and product development.</p>  <p>  Analysis of the scheme indicated that, as of March 2017, EI approved &euro;80.4m under the ESF and paid out &euro;80.018m.  As of March 2017, &euro;22.5m has been redeemed to date from companies that were legally in a position to do so.  (A company must have distributable reserves to be in a position, legally, to repay the State.)  Redemption of the shares will continue to be sought over the coming period as companies are in a position to do so.</p>  <p>  However, &euro;15.72m invested in ESF companies cannot be redeemed as the companies have been dissolved, liquidated or gone into receivership.</p>  <p>  The objective of the ESF was to retain jobs and ensure the continued survival and growth of these Enterprise Ireland client companies.  In total, 9,500 jobs were supported under the ESF.</p>  <p>  The ESF was targeted at viable but vulnerable exporting companies.  The ESF was a non-Competitive Fund and the average level of support was &euro;374,000.</p></reply>

In addition to their day to day role, the PSS supports contingents pre and post deployment and its trained personnel are also deployed in response to any significant operational incidents at home and overseas.  In addition, a cohort of personnel designated and promoted as Designated Contact Persons, (DCPs) provide a local advisory and referral service at barrack level to their colleagues with a particular focus on recruits and new entrants.</p>  <p>  Separately, a confidential counselling service provided by an independent service provider and funded by the Department is available to all members of the Defence Forces.

Defence Forces members using the Personal Support Service office are also afforded the same confidentiality.</p>  <p>  The Defence Forces has a duty of care to both personnel who may be suffering some form of anxiety and personnel working with such individuals.  A medical questionnaire completed at Annual/Occupational Medical requires Defence Forces personnel to declare whether or not they are, or have been, in receipt of counselling services either internally within the Defence Forces, or externally.  An examining Medical Officer will review the questionnaire and explore, as relevant, the content.   If the Medical Officer feels there is a 'medical issue' such as depression, generalised anxiety state, PTSD, etc. he/she may decide to change the individual's Medical Classification Code (MCC) so that the individual is not exposed to an occupational environment which could aggravate his/her current medical situation.   Depending on the exact circumstances, this could be a temporary or permanent change to the Medical Classification Code and may have implications with regard to deployments overseas for example.   This outcome is only where there is a medical condition underlying the process for which the patient was in receipt of counselling.</p>  <p>  An individual&rsquo;s Medical Classification Code is deemed &ldquo;Medical in Confidence&rdquo;.  Therefore, a Commanding Officer will not be informed as to the reason for the Medical Classification Code change.  Thus, whilst the Commanding Officer will be aware that the Medical Classification Code has changed, he/she will not be aware as to the reason for the change.</p></reply>

The relevant Regulation provides that the PDF shall comprise an establishment of 7,520 Army, 886 Air Corps and 1,094 Naval Service personnel.</p>  <p>  In examining the staffing levels required in each service, the military authorities were fully consulted having regard to operational requirements and the need to meet all roles assigned by Government.</p>  <p>  The Government are committed to maintaining the respective establishment strengths and this was affirmed in the White Paper on Defence when no changes were proposed to the staffing levels of the three services.</p></reply>

It is not possible to state how many personnel will leave the Permanent Defence Force for reasons other than age during this period.  With the support of the Chief of Staff and within the resources available, it is intended to retain the capacity of the Defence Forces to operate effectively across all roles and to undertake the tasks laid down by Government both at home and overseas.</p></reply>
