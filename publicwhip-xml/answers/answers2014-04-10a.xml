    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-04-10a.7.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/958" speakername="Brian Hayes" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014041000034#WRA00500"><p>I visited Portrane in late January of this year to see at first hand the coastal erosion issues in Portrane. An application by Fingal County Council for funding under the Office of Public Works Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme was approved in February 2013 for a Coastal Erosion Risk Management Study for Portrane/Rush. The approved funding of &euro;57,800 was fully drawn down and the Report has been completed by consultants RPS.</p><p>The Report<b></b>recommends that a dune management system including dune re-profiling, matting and planting in conjunction with sand fencing is put in place along the eroded part of the central and southern sections of the Portrane dunes where significant erosion has occurred in recent times. </p><p>Prior to the storms in late 2013 and early 2014, no follow-up application for funding had been received by the OPW from Fingal County Council in respect of the works recommended in the report.</p><p>Following the severe storms that impacted on many coastal areas during the past Winter, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government requested the relevant local authorities to submit estimates of the cost of repairing public infrastructure that had been damaged, focussing initially on the period from 13th December 2013 to 6th January 2014. Fingal County Council submitted estimates to the Department in respect of proposed works at a number of locations in its area including Portrane.  The estimate submitted by Fingal County Council  in relation to Portrane was for funding of &euro;200,000 to enable the Council to undertake the works recommended in the RPS Report.</p><p>The Government decided on 11 February 2014 to make available up to &euro;69.5 million for a programme of repair and remediation works to roads, coastal protection and flood defence and other public infrastructure damaged in the storms from 13th December 2013 to 6th January 2014 based on estimates provided by the local authorities concerned. Of the total amount being made available, up to &euro;19.6 million is available via the Office of Public Works for the repair of damaged coastal protection and flood defence infrastructure. </p><p>The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government wrote to Fingal County Council, indicating, based on the estimate submitted by the Council to that Department, that up to &euro;200,000 is being made available to the Council via the OPW to undertake the necessary repair works to damaged coastal protection and flood defence infrastructure.</p><p>Fingal County Council must submit an overall programme of works to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government detailing how it proposes to spend the total allocation that is being made available to it. It must also submit the relevant elements of the programme to each Department from whom funding will be made available for consideration of technical aspects of the proposed works. When the Council's programme of coastal protection and flood defence projects is received by the OPW it will be reviewed having regard to related guidance issued by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to the local authorities. </p><p>The OPW has written to the local authorities indicating that in order to assist them in a practical way and to avoid any potential cash-flow issues, it will consider requests for advance funding of up to 80% of the estimated cost of approved projects where a contract for works has been made.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-04-10a.15.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1097" speakername="Brendan Howlin" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014041000034#WRA01100"><p>Section 9 of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2013 provides that persons retiring before 31 August 2014, or a later date made by Order under the Act, will be entitled to have their pensions calculated as if the pay reduction and any increment pause or freeze had not applied to them. As the Deputy is aware, I have decided to extend the grace period from 31 August 2014 to 30 June 2015. </p><p>  It is only when public servants declare their intentions to retire in line with the normal notice periods provided for retirements that an indication of the numbers retiring can be determined.  However, I note that the pay reductions provided for under the 2013 Act applied to only 13% of public servants, those on salary rates of greater than &euro;65,000. Those public servants who choose to retire will have applied to their pension the public service pension reduction which was brought in under the 2010 Financial Emergency legislation and amended in 2013.  For that reason, it can be anticipated that only those within that cohort who are above or near minimum retirement age and have significant service accrued  will likely avail of the provision, and therefore the potential additional impact from the grace period on retirements  in 2015 will be relatively limited in terms of total numbers.</p><p>In order to ensure that the impact would be effectively managed across all sectors, the approach I have taken in extending the grace period will assist sectoral management in the implementation of workforce planning measures, in order to maintain service delivery standards and minimise any potential adverse affect on services that may arise.   In line with the on going  management of all retirements within the public service, those public servants electing to retire and avail of the grace period will be required to give appropriate notice.     </p><p>   </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-04-10a.18.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/958" speakername="Brian Hayes" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014041000034#WRA01300"><p>As outlined to the Deputy in reply to Parliamentary Question number 14 on the 26th of February 2014, there are many organisations, national and local, with an involvement in some aspect of the management of the River Shannon catchment.  For example, Waterways Ireland has responsibility for navigation and, as such, will exercise some limited control over water levels in lakes and river stretches. The Electricity Supply Board, has statutory responsibility for the control of lake levels arising from water requirements for hydroelectric generation of electricity at Ardnacrusha.  Environmental concerns, fisheries matters and tourism/recreational issues are dealt with by the relevant agencies with responsibilities in these matters.  Local authorities &ndash; ten county councils &ndash; in the catchment monitor water quality with the assistance of a number of laboratories and have responsibility for its control.  The Office of Public Works has no oversight role or authority in relation to the Shannon. Its main area of responsibility is for maintenance on those tributaries where capital works have been carried out under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945.  The Office of Public Works hydrometric service also gathers water level and discharge information at a number of sites on the river.</p><p>  Operational control of water flows and levels on the Shannon is primarily the responsibility of both the ESB and Waterways Ireland.  The ESB has overall statutory responsibility for the management and control of water flows and levels on the Shannon.   Waterways Ireland (WWI) also has a direct role and function in managing levels on the river.   A system of management and control is in place involving co-operation by those two bodies under a detailed set of operational protocols and arrangements for the regulation of water levels on the river.  I am advised that it is the bodies' view that this system has worked and is working satisfactorily.  </p><p>  The question of creating a single authority for the River Shannon is a major policy issue because of the very diverse range of powers, activities and responsibilities that would be affected.  These include electricity generation, tourism, infrastructure, water quality, water extraction, waste water disposal, flood risk management and a range of environmental responsibilities. </p><p>  The question of the optimum structure or structures to manage the Shannon and its tributaries was the subject of a report in 2002 by a sub-committee of the Joint Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport .   It is worth noting that that Report indicated that, among the numerous groups and bodies involved in the management of the Shannon, a consensus existed among these groups that, while improvements in the management of the Shannon basin were needed, there was no agreement on the establishment a new organisation as the best means to achieve this end.</p><p>  The 2002 report identified the main merits of the present arrangements for the management of the Shannon catchment as:</p><p>  -	functional responsibility is clearly fixed in law and each organisation has a precise remit, 	knows exactly what it is required to do and has clearly established priorities; and</p><p>  -	communication and collaboration between the various agencies take place using well established mechanisms, such as committees, working groups and partnerships. </p><p>  The main weakness identified was a lack of co-ordination, among the organisations involved.  The sub-committee took the view however that it would be undesirable to establish any additional institution unless it could be clearly demonstrated that tangible benefits would flow, which could not otherwise be achieved.  It noted the danger that an extra organisation might usurp or duplicate existing institutions or else be just a talking shop.  The report concluded that the establishment of a new organisation would be something that could be recommended only as a last resort.</p><p>  One of the main problems with the Shannon is, of course, that of its frequent flooding.  The management of flood risk on the Shannon is being actively and comprehensively addressed through the OPW's Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme.</p><p>  The CFRAM programme is the core strategy for addressing flood risk in the Shannon Basin.  The CFRAM Study is being conducted by Jacobs Engineering on behalf of the OPW and I am advised that good progress is being made on the project.  The output of this important project will be an integrated plan of specific measures to address, in a comprehensive and sustainable way, the significant flood risk factors in the Shannon basin. The consultants will look at all existing arrangements for the management of water levels and the roles and responsibilities of the main bodies involved including the levels of co-ordination between them and will make recommendations on the best way forward for the co-ordination of the management arrangements for the Shannon. In the meantime the main bodies involved will continue to maintain constructive dialogue with all the main stakeholders to ensure to the greatest extent possible that a balanced and fair approach is taken to the management of water levels in the Shannon and its lakes to meet the needs of navigation, power generation and the welfare of those living directly adjacent to the main river channel.</p></reply>

The actual roll-out of particular capital projects and programmes is, of course, managed by the individual line Departments and their agencies who are responsible for project and programme delivery.</p><p>  All Departments are required to report to my Department on a monthly basis in relation to their actual expenditure compared with their published profiles and to explain variances where they arise. My officials liaise with Departments to ensure that any issues are addressed promptly in order that there are no expenditure overruns and, in relation to capital expenditure, that projects and programmes are progressed in a timely manner.</p><p>  It is notable that of the &euro;7.3 billion allocated to capital budgets over the last two years, &euro;7.2 billion has been spent. This level of spend, when compared with the allocation, indicates that Departments' capital spending plans are generally progressing on time.</p><p>  We recently looked at the 20 largest capital projects being delivered at the moment by Departments - about half of these are Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) and the remainder are traditional Exchequer-funded or part-Exchequer funded projects.  I am happy to report that, for most of these large scale projects, Departments did not identify major issues relating to the timeliness of delivery.  As would be expected with any large scale infrastructure development, some issues had been experienced in certain cases and these either have already been or are currently being managed by the relevant Departments and Agencies to mitigate risk to delivery while continuing to help ensure value for money.  These issues include time taken to reach planning decisions, time taken to reach financial close with project funders (in relation to PPPs) and capacity constraints within the construction industry. </p><p>  Government is very conscious of the fact that we need to focus on the Construction sector. With this in mind, we had a special Government meeting recently on construction and will shortly publish a Government response to address the challenges in the sector in a targeted and meaningful way. </p><p>  As I announced on Budget day, a review of the public capital programme will be undertaken by my Department this year. This exercise commenced recently and will culminate in the setting of the Government's capital investment framework for the next five years.</p></reply>

Priorities for Ireland are the Tourism, Culture, Agriculture, Education, Financial Services and Science &amp;amp; Technology sectors. Thus, my programme included events designed to encourage business opportunities in these areas.</p><p>  In Shanghai, I attended and spoke at a number of engagements aimed at promoting Ireland, from a Bord Bia-organised showcase of Irish seafood to a networking dinner to increase the profile of Ireland's capacity in the technology sector, as well as visiting Fudan University School of Computer Science, presenting the &quot;i-Shamrock&quot; Software Award to students.</p><p>  The main focus of the visit to Hong Kong was on connecting with the estimated 3,000 strong Irish community in the city, in light of the Government's recent decision to open a career Consulate General in 2014. While there, I met the Irish Chamber of Commerce, the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, spoke at the GAA Ladies All-Stars Exhibition Game, which took place under lights at Hong Kong Football club and spoke at the St Patrick's Society Ball which drew an attendance of some 450.</p><p>  In Beijing, I met with both the outgoing and incoming Ambassadors of China to Ireland, Luo Linquan and Xu Jianguo, I spoke at the Embassy's St Patrick's Day reception and several other events including the China Ireland Research event. </p><p>  In order to build on the relationship between China Investment Corporation (CIC)   the fifth largest investment fund in the world   and the NTMA/ NPRF, I met with their most senior management discussing potential for investment in Ireland.</p><p>  Of course, one of Ireland's unique selling points is our rich cultural heritage. According to F&aacute;ilte Ireland every 1,000 additional tourists support 15 jobs in that sector. Culture is an asset and so I participated in a series of cultural events, including attending a sell-out concert by Altan in the large Forbidden City Concert Hall (supported by Culture Ireland and the State Agencies in China). I opened an exhibition of works by Irish artists Fion Gunn, Niamh Cunningham and Sean Campbell at the China Central Mall (also funded by Culture Ireland) and visited a continuing exhibition by Chinese and Irish artists at the 798 Art City in Beijing. In an unprecedented and unique gesture of friendship, Chinese officials agreed to the &quot;Greening&quot; of the Great Wall of China. I presided at that historic event at midnight on 16 March.</p><p>  Throughout the visit, I undertook media opportunities aimed at actively promoting the story of Ireland's recovery, giving an extensive interview to Caixin, China's foremost business and finance weekly magazine, as well as to the flagship interview platform with Hong Kong based Phoenix TV channel, which reaches some 200 million Chinese viewers.</p><p>  The South China Morning Post, the largest circulation independent English-language, carried an opinion piece I wrote on 14 March 2014 and my interview with the same paper ran on 15 March. I attach copies of both. A selection of photos may be found on my Department's website, per.gov.ie, where you will also find my recent blog post on the visit.</p></reply>

It is at the discretion of  management and would be one of a range of options for managers, to replace for example back-office processes or replace outdated skills.</p></reply>

When we took that decision, a number of commentators suggested that we had perhaps overvalued the business. However, I can confirm that throughout the process, both BGE and the Government received extensive and detailed valuation advice from financial advisers and our decision was based on this advice.  </p><p>  The strong stance taken by the Government and our clear statement that we were not prepared to sell below acceptable value resulted in revised bids, which were materially better than those previously received. As a result, BGE was in a position to announce on 25th March that it had signed a definitive agreement to sell Bord G&aacute;is Energy to a consortium comprising Brookfield, Centrica and iCon Infrastructure for an enterprise value of &euro;1.1 billion.  </p><p>  This  was the outcome of a competitive auction process, conducted in an open and transparent manner in which numerous international strategic and financial sponsor parties were invited to participate. In giving my consent to the transaction, I took account of the fact that the consortium made the highest bid and also of professional advice that this represented fair value for the Bord G&aacute;is Energy business. Under EU rules on the sale of State assets, the core principle is that the assets to be sold must be sold to the highest bidder.</p><p>  In relation to reinvestment of proceeds from the sale of State assets, &euro;110m of the asset sale proceeds has already been factored into the budgetary figures for 2014. This is being used to meet upfront Exchequer costs associated with the new PPP programme and to fund the 2013 element of the &euro;150m Exchequer stimulus package which I announced last year.  I have already indicated that additional capital investment has been authorised to deal with the flooding crisis and the determination of the amount of money available for further stimulus investment will be considered in this context. </p><p>   In addition, a review of the public capital programme, led by my Department, has recently commenced. This review will culminate in the setting of the Government s capital investment framework for the next five years. It is my intention that the use of further proceeds arising from the sale of assets over the course of the next few years will be considered as part of the review.   </p><p>  The jobs impact of this investment is dependent on how the proceeds are reinvested. A 2009 survey, carried out by the Department of Finance, found that the labour intensity of capital projects generally falls within the range of 8 to 12 jobs for every &euro;1 million invested. While this estimate for labour intensity is used as a general rule of thumb, the exact employment impact varies from project to project as different types of public construction project have different levels of labour intensity. For example, smaller scale projects tend to be more labour intensive than major national infrastructural projects. In order to get the maximum jobs impact from the reinvestment of proceeds the main focus will be on such small scale and labour intensive works.</p></reply>

The CFRAM Programme is being delivered through six comprehensive, catchment-based studies and is a strategic and fully co-ordinated approach that recognises the need, in line with international best practice, to move to a more sustainable, planned and risk-based approach to dealing with flooding problems.  As well as delivering on national policy for flood risk management, the Programme will also meet the requirements of the EU &lsquo;Floods&rsquo; Directive that came into force in November 2007.<b></b></p><p>The Programme, which is focused on 300 communities in areas of potentially significant risk including 90 coastal areas, lies at the core of the assessment of flood risk and the long-term planning of flood risk management measures throughout the country. The core outputs of the Programme will be a comprehensive suite of flood risk maps and a flood risk management plan for each area of potentially significant risk.  The management plans will include a prioritised list of measures, both structural and non-structural, to address flood risk in an environmentally sustainable and cost effective manner.  Structural measures in the plan will be taken to outline design stage.</p><p>The CFRAM Programme will be used to determine national priorities for State investment in flood defences, on a systematic and objective basis using Multi-Criteria Analysis that takes into account social and environmental factors as well as economic criteria. An OPW website, , provides information on each area of the Programme and provides updates on the progress of the various studies being undertaken.  <b></b></p><p>The CFRAM Programme is progressing through three phases. Stage one, the Preliminary Flood Risk Assessment, was completed in 2011. The current stage is the CFRAM Studies, including related topographic surveys and hydraulic river modelling. This core element of the Programme will run to 2015/16. The final stage is the Implementation and Review stage which is scheduled for 2016 and beyond and will be cyclical thereafter. Each stage of the CFRAM Programme includes a consultative process which facilitates both stakeholder and public participation.</p><p>The CFRAM Studies, commissioned in 2011 and early 2012, are progressing well, with all of the major survey contracts completed, with over 30 public consultation events held and all of the local authorities briefed on the Programme, and the detailed flood maps for the 300 communities now being produced. The CFRAM Programme involves the capture and generation of significant data sets that will be of use to other public bodies, such as in planning, infrastructure design, development of flood forecasting systems, etc. This in turn will create wider benefits to the State. </p></reply>

A Local Authority must assess any problems or high risk areas in the county and, if it is considered that specific measures and works are required, it is open to them to apply for funding to deal with coastal protection under the Office of Public Works' (OPW) Minor Flood Mitigation Works &amp;amp; Coastal Protection Scheme.  All applications received under this scheme are assessed under the eligibility criteria, which include a requirement that any measures are cost beneficial, and having regard to the overall availability of funding.  The OPW Minor Works Scheme has been of benefit to many Local Authorities in dealing with coastal protection problems since it was introduced in 2009.  It is also open to Local Authorities to carry out flood mitigation and coastal protection works using their own resources. </p><p>  Coastal erosion is a natural and ongoing process and needs to be considered in a holistic way as its impact can vary greatly in different locations and over time.  It only becomes a problem when it threatens human life, infrastructure and properties.  The primary objective of Government policy on coastal protection is to ensure that in areas identified as being at greatest risk of damage or loss to economic assets through coastal erosion or flooding,  appropriate and sustainable measures are identified by Local Authorities to protect those assets and, where such measures are economically justified on cost benefit grounds and compatible with all required environmental and other statutory requirements, they are implemented subject to the availability of resources.</p><p>  The Irish Coastal Protection Strategy Study (ICPSS) has surveyed and assessed the coastal erosion risk along the entire national coastline and this information is available to all Local Authorities to enable them to develop appropriate plans and strategies for the sustainable management of the coastline in their counties including the identification, prioritisation and, subject to the availability of resources, the implementation of coastal protection works both of a structural and non-structural nature.</p></reply>

A speaker from Insurance Ireland will be giving a presentation at the conference.  There will be a Question and Answer period after each session of the conference and this time will afford delegates the opportunity to make a point or to ask a question regarding insurance or any other relevant flood-related topic directly to the Insurance Ireland representatives and other speakers.</p><p>  The aims of the Conference are to allow the public and interested stakeholders the opportunity to participate in a public policy debate on flood risk management in Ireland; to examine the background to and impacts of the recent severe weather and flooding; to set out the role of OPW and other organisations in the management of flood risk; to outline work undertaken to date and future plans; and to discuss national priorities and public funding in relation to this issue.</p><p>  I understand that there are several community and action groups, representing areas that have been affected by flooding, already registered to attend the conference and I look forward to a constructive and productive debate on all flood risk management issues.</p><p>  On the 24 March 2014 details of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the Office of Public Works and Insurance Ireland on the exchange of information on flood defence works were announced by the Minister of State, at the OPW, Mr Brian Hayes, TD and the Chief Executive of Insurance Ireland, Mt Kevin Thompson.  This Memorandum of Understanding outlines the principles of agreement between the OPW and Insurance Ireland on the information being provided and how it will be used by the insurance industry.  The Office of Public Works will provide Insurance Ireland with data on all completed OPW flood defence schemes which will show the design, extent and nature of the protections offered by these works.  Insurance Ireland members will then take into account all information provided by the OPW when assessing exposure to flood risk within these areas from 1 June 2014.</p><p>  I feel that this is an important step forward for people in areas where flood defences have been provided by OPW, as OPW and Insurance Ireland are now working together to ensure that the flood defence works undertaken in recent years are being taken into account by the insurance industry.  There has been a substantial investment of &euro;320 million by the State in all parts of the country on flood relief works since 1995, with over 10,500 properties protected and benefits estimated at more than &euro;1 billion in damage and losses avoided.  It is important that the benefits of that investment are felt by all members of those communities.  </p><p>  The OPW has to date provided information on 12 completed flood relief schemes in an agreed format to Insurance Ireland and I now expect to see that, in these protected areas, the insurance industry recognises this significant capital investment on behalf of the taxpayer, and insures properties benefiting from that investment. My Office will continue to work with Insurance Ireland on the ongoing exchange of information on these schemes as they are completed and I am confident that this will lead to a greater availability of insurance to those who currently find it difficult to get.</p></reply>

The proposals also put in place a system for regulating lobbying where former public officials might seek to lobby the public body or the people they previously worked with for a one-year period after they have left public employment (i.e. 'cooling-off' period).</p><p>The General Scheme of the Bill was submitted for pre-legislative scrutiny by the Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform Committee and their report has been received.  Drafting of the Bill by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel is advancing and it is anticipated that the Bill will be published in quarter 2 of 2014.   It is expected that the passage of the Bill through the Houses will be substantially progressed by the summer recess.  </p><p>Following publication it is intended to establish an Advisory Group composed of relevant experts and key stakeholders who will be in a position to provide information and guidance that will assist in the smooth implementation of the legislation.  A period of time will be required prior to commencement of the legislation to enable development of the IT and information systems which will support the registration process. The timeframe for the regulatory provisions of the Bill to come into operation will depend, in the first instance, on the timeframe for the enactment of the Bill by the Oireachtas following Government approval for its publication.    </p><p>By regulating lobbying activity through registration and reporting requirements public confidence in politics and in the business of government can be strengthened and greater transparency can be achieved regarding the process of public policy making.</p></reply>

This is a key component of the new Public Service Reform Plan 2014   2016, published in January 2014. There has already been considerable progress made in this area, as outlined in the Second Progress Report on the Public Service Reform Plan, also published in January. </p><p>     In July 2012, the Government agreed on a number of actions concerning External Service Delivery (ESD). These aim to develop a focused and integrated approach to the external delivery of non-core processes, with the objective of reducing costs and focusing staff resources on priority areas. </p><p>     The Reform agenda is focused on delivering better outcomes for citizens using public services. Hence, the Government is considering alternative delivery models that can improve the quality and efficiency of these services, while ensuring that they remain affordable and sustainable. Some services are more suited to external delivery than others and any decision to change how a service is delivered will take into account a number of factors, including the overall cost, quality of service, effectiveness and public interest. </p><p>  The implementation of ESD has already proved very beneficial, in terms of increased efficiency, reduced costs and overall improvements in customer service. There are many other potential benefits to ESD, including gaining competitive advantage and the introduction of new technologies. Successful examples of ESD include the administration of the new Driver Licence by the Road Safety Authority, and the administration of personal injuries assessments by the Injuries Board. </p><p>     My Department is also committed to the upskilling of Public Servants in this area. A number of training programmes, workshops and seminars have been held, and a range of materials to provide guidance and support have been published. </p></reply>

However, the One-Parent Family Tax Credit has been restructured and replaced with a new Single Person Child Carer Credit from 1 January 2014. The new credit is more targeted, in that it is in the first instance, only available to the principal carer of the child.</p><p>    Given the difficult fiscal environment, it is essential to review all tax reliefs, credits and incentives in order to ensure that they are properly targeted and if necessary re-focused in order that they can achieve the socio-economic objectives that are set for them.  A system that allows multiple claims in respect of the same child or children is unsustainable.</p><p>    There is no specific tax credit for children in the tax code. Therefore, married or cohabiting couples are unable to avail of any additional credit to assist them in the financial maintenance of their children.  In certain cases, such couples also need to maintain two households due to the location of employment, for example. </p><p>    It is the responsibility of the parents to look after a child, including financially.  The new credit is targeted to assist principal child carers to take up, or remain in employment.</p><p>    Notwithstanding the above, as a result of an amendment which I brought forward at Committee Stage of the Finance Bill, a primary carer who is entitled to the credit and who does not wish to avail of it can choose to surrender it.  A secondary carer may then make a claim for the credit, provided that the qualifying child resides with him or her for not less than 100 days in the tax year.</p><p>    It should be noted that where a primary carer is married, in a civil partnership or cohabiting they would not be entitled to the new credit (or indeed the former one). In such circumstances the primary carer cannot relinquish the credit to a secondary carer. In addition, a secondary carer who is married, in a civil partnership or cohabiting, would not be entitled to the new credit (or indeed the former one) regardless of the marital status of the primary carer.</p><p>    The maximum potential loss to an individual who is not entitled to the restructured credit, and who has income greatly in excess of the average industrial wage, is &euro;48 per week. For someone on the average industrial wage, estimated at &euro;32,450, the loss would be approximately &euro;31 per week.</p><p>    Given that this measure was only approved by the Oireachtas and enacted in Finance (No. 2) Act 2013 in late December, I have no immediate plans to review the legislation.    </p></reply>

The early repayment of IMF funds would trigger automatic mandatory proportional early repayments to the EFSF, EFSM, United Kingdom, Kingdom of Sweden and Kingdom of Denmark. This would also apply in respect of the early repayment of the loans from any of the other programme funding partners.</p><p>  The impact of early repayment of our IMF loans on our bond yields would need to be carefully considered were such a possibility to arise. Should that possibility arise, I would take the advice of the NTMA on this matter. If such a proposal were to be pursued, the agreement of the other lenders would of course be required. </p><p>   The provisions in question are included in the loan agreements with the EFSF, EFSM and the UK, Sweden and Denmark, as was set out in my reply to PQ 6839/14 of 11 February 2014, </p><p>  As I have outlined previously, the matter of early repayment of our IMF loans, and thus requesting agreement to repay Ireland's IMF loans prior to the maturity dates, does not arise at the moment but we will keep it under review. In view of this, the issue of discussions with the EFSF, EFSM and the bilateral lenders regarding such early repayment also does not arise. </p><p>  I should also point out that, as the IMF loans have a shorter average maturity, they will be repaid considerably in advance of the EFSF and EFSM loans for which we negotiated maturity extensions. </p></reply>

The first phase of the budget measure took effect from September 2012. The final phase of the budget measure takes effect from September 2014. An appeals process is available to small schools which have had their staff number reduced as a result of the budget measure. A school with four classroom teachers or less which is losing a teacher or failed to gain an additional teacher as a result of the Budget 2012 measure can submit an appeal to the Primary Staffing Appeals Board. Circular 0007/2014 provides the criteria under which schools can make an appeal. The Appeal Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.</p><p>  The time period referred to by the Deputy in relation to savings from this budget measure straddles two school years, 2012/13 and 2013/14. The savings achieved in the 2012/13 school year (September, 2012 - August, 2013) was circa &euro;3.7m and in the 2013/14 school year (September, 2013 - September, 2014) was circa &euro;7m.</p><p>  Funding saved by this measure has been used to cover the costs of additional teachers required for demographics and pupils with special needs.</p><p>  Our current configuration of small primary schools has been examined by the Department in a value for money (VFM) review. This review took account of the ethos of schools and the locations of small schools relative to other schools of a similar type. I am currently considering this review in consultation with my Government colleagues and I intend to publish the report on completion of this consideration process.</p></reply>

The OPW liaises closely as required with other Departments and public bodies that have a role or involvement in coastal matters.   Coastal protection is addressed through a policy which has as a primary objective that in areas identified as being at greatest risk of damage or loss to economic assets through coastal erosion or flooding,  appropriate and sustainable measures are identified by Local Authorities to protect those assets and, where such measures are economically justified on cost benefit grounds and compatible with all required environmental and other statutory requirements, they are implemented subject to the availability of resources.  The Irish Coastal Protection Strategy Study (ICPSS) has surveyed and assessed the coastal erosion risk along the entire national coastline and this information  is available to all Local Authorities to enable them to develop appropriate plans and strategies for the sustainable management of the coastline in their counties including the identification, prioritisation and, subject to the availability of resources, the implementation of coastal protection works both of a structural and non-structural nature.</p><p>  The funding provision referred to by the Deputy was contained in the Government Decision of 11th February 2014 which allocated total funding of up to &euro;69.5m for repair of public infrastructure and facilities damaged by the severe weather events in the period 13th December 2013 to 6th January 2014 based on estimates of costs provided by Local Authorities to the Department of the Environment Community and Local Government (DoECLG). The allocation included up to &euro;19.6m for repairs of existing coastal protection and flood defences to be channelled through the Office of Public Works (OPW). The Government Decision stated that works to strengthen coastal protection and coastal defences, which are separate from the repair and restoration works on which the &euro;19.6m figure was based, would require more detailed examination in the context of the OPW Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management studies which are due for completion by 2015. </p><p>  Of the figure of up to &euro;69.5m allocated by Government, a total of up to &euro;2,980,320 was included in respect of infrastructure in County Kerry that was damaged in the period covered by the Decision. Of that total amount of almost &euro;3m up to &euro;1,226,920 is available via the OPW for repair of built coastal protection and flood defences.  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government wrote to Kerry County Council notifying it of its allocations in respect of each category of infrastructure covered by the Decision and requesting that the Council submit a programme of works within these allocations.</p><p>  With regard to the provision of additional funding, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government will shortly be reporting to Government in relation to repair costs arising from severe weather events in the period 27th January to 17th February, 2014 which will contain estimates from local authorities of the cost of repairing infrastructure damaged in that period.   The Government will consider the matter of additional funding in that context.</p></reply>

The site is in State ownership and is maintained by the National Monuments Service of the Office of Public Works.  The wall to the rear of the Church/Visitor Centre, which is also the boundary wall of the graveyard, has been bulging in places for some time.  Following a heavy period of rainfall in 2010 a section of the wall, which retained some 1.5 meters of soil, collapsed into the neighbouring field. Other long sections of the wall remained intact. There has been some additional damage caused by trees.</p><p>  The project to rectify the damage at the site is a significant undertaking, involving complex preparation in terms of arboricultural, archaeological and architectural issues.  In addition, repair proposals must involve sensitive engagement with the local community.  In accordance with National Monuments legislation, the Office of Public Works has recently lodged a Consent application for the necessary remedial works with the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and this is being considered at present. It is not possible just yet to state when remedial works will commence and be completed.</p></reply>

This Government has pursued a determined deficit reduction strategy in order to reduce the General Government Deficit below 3% of GDP by the target date of end-2015.  This is a challenging target and one that is set against a difficult economic background which has required fiscal corrections in the form of significant consolidation on the expenditure and revenue fronts.  The measures introduced by this Government have ensured Ireland's successful exit from the EU-IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland.  To fully appreciate the scale of the expenditure consolidation it must be noted that it has been achieved in the context of increasing demands on public services in particular in the areas of Social Protection, Health and Education.</p><p>  The 2014 Departmental expenditure allocations were set out in the Revised Estimates Volume 2014 (REV 2014), published on 18 December 2013. It is a matter for each Minister to ensure the prudent management of their respective 2014 expenditure allocations for their Department and all bodies and Offices that fall under the aegis of their Department. With regard to Departmental savings achieved to date, voted expenditure was well within budget for 2013.  This effective management and delivery of savings is continuing in 2014 with the latest data on expenditure to end-March 2014 indicating that overall net voted expenditure was &euro;261 million or 2.5% under profile, a year-on-year decrease of &euro;631 million or 5.8%.  In gross terms voted expenditure was &euro;164 million or 1.2% under profile and was &euro;452 million or 5.7% lower than the same period last year. The reduction in expenditure compared with the first quarter in 2013 illustrates that Departments are working to deliver the savings measures outlined in Budget 2014 and that the Government is firmly committed to meeting our deficit targets.</p><p>  My Department has a number of measures in place to ensure that the budgetary targets are met.  Departmental expenditure will continue to be monitored against the monthly expenditure profiles for each Department throughout the year.  My officials are in regular communication with all Departments and Offices to ensure that expenditure is being managed and controlled effectively.  Where necessary, my Department meets regularly with line Departments to review financial management.  This type of strict expenditure management contributed to Ireland's successful exit from the EU-IMF programme of financial assistance on 15 December 2013.  Following our exit from the programme, this same discipline regarding expenditure management is required to ensure the ongoing sustainability of the public finances and to ensure that all public expenditure targets continue to be met.</p><p>  As I announced on Budget day last year, my Department is leading a Comprehensive Review of Expenditure.  This review process which has recently commenced will enable consideration of expenditure options by Government and will help frame the Ministerial expenditure ceilings for 2015, 2016 and 2017 and Government decisions in that regard. </p><p>  Good progress has been made to date with regard to the implementation of the Government's Public Service Reform Plan in Departments and Offices.  The updated Public Service Reform Plan 2014-2016 was published in January this year.  This plan aims to ensure that efficiencies and reformed work practices play a full part in contributing to the overall budgetary consolidation effort which is essential to achieving our annual deficit target.</p></reply>

In bringing public expenditure back onto a sustainable path, meaningful reform of the Public Service was essential to ensure that we can maintain and improve services.  In November 2011, we published our first Public Service Reform Plan.  In January this year, I published a report setting out the progress made under the first Reform Plan.  At the same time, I also published the Government's second Public Service Reform Plan, setting out our ambition for the next three years.  These documents are available on my Department's website.</p><p>  As well as enabling services to be maintained and improved in the context of reduced resources, a number of reforms have delivered, and will deliver, significant cost savings.</p><p>  - The Croke Park Agreement delivered &euro;1.8 billion in pay and non-pay savings.  The Haddington Road Agreement sets out a number of measures to deliver a further reduction of &euro;1 billion in the Public Service pay and pensions bill by 2016.  It also provides for a total of 15 million additional working hours annually across all sectors of the Public Service, which will help to deliver long term and sustainable increases in productivity.</p><p>  - We have undertaken a major review of public procurement and are now implementing a radical overhaul of our approach, with the new Office of Public Procurement targeting &euro;500 million in savings over the next three years (&euro;127 million this year).</p><p>  - We are introducing shared services for a range of back-office functions to increase efficiency and integration across organisations.  For example, Peoplepoint, the Civil Service HR and Pensions Shared Service Centre, will deliver savings estimated at &euro;12.5 million annually when fully operational.</p><p>  - The use of innovative models of service delivery, greater use of technology and more efficient management of the State's property portfolio will also yield increased efficiencies.</p><p>  Some of the savings made will be re-invested into public services as a &quot;reform dividend&quot;, utilised to support service improvements and to sustain the reform agenda beyond the current fiscal crisis.</p><p>  Of course, as well as reducing costs we are implementing other reforms, with the objective of building a more sustainable and effective Public Service.  We have put in place new working arrangements, including longer working hours, new rosters, and standardised arrangements for annual leave and sick leave.  The budgetary process has been reformed to make it more transparent and to improve how we spend public money.  We are implementing a programme of political reform to increase openness and to rebuild public trust in the State.  We are renewing the Civil Service to enable it to meet current and future challenges.</p><p>  These are just a few of the initiatives underway to build a more customer-centred, open and transparent, responsive, efficient and effective Public Service.  Public Service Reform will continue to be an important element of the Government's strategy for economic recovery, with our ambition for reform for the next three years set out in the new Public Service Reform Plan.</p></reply>

This began in January 2014 with the abolition of the State pension (transition) available at 65, thereby standardising State pension age for all at 66 years.  State pension age will increase further to 67 in 2021 and 68 in 2028.   I have no plans to reinstate the State pension transition.  </p><p>  The State pension (transition) was introduced in 1970 when it was known as the retirement pension.  It was designed to bridge the gap between the standard social welfare pension age, which at that time was 70 years of age, and retirement age.  Overtime, the age for State pension (contributory) pension was reduced to 66 years. </p><p>  All short term social welfare schemes are payable to age 66.  The main social welfare payment available to those who leave employment before pension age is jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit. Persons who qualify for a jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit who are aged between 65 and 66 years are generally entitled to receive payment up to the date on which they reach pensionable age (66 years).  In the case of a job seeker&rsquo;s benefit recipient aged under 65 whose claim spans from one benefit year into another, a new relevant tax year requirement is not applied in the case of the job seekers entitlement relating to the second benefit year. A further provision states that 3 waiting days do not have to be served for jobseeker's assistance in the case of certain people aged between 65 and 66 years who have been in receipt of jobseeker's benefit within the past year.</p><p>  In addition, I was happy to be able to introduce new arrangements for older job seekers, i.e. those aged 62 and over who have left work before reaching the State pension age of 66 and who wish to claim a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment.    With effect from 1 January 2014, fully unemployed job seekers aged 62 or over will be placed on yearly signing and will be given the option of transferring to EFT payments. Furthermore, they will not be subject to mandatory activation measures but may avail of employment supports which will continue to be available to them and they will not be subject to activation-related sanctions. </p><p>  Finally, social welfare supports will continue to be available to those who need it most and where a person fails to meet the qualifying conditions of an insurance based scheme, a means tested assistance payment may be available provided they satisfy the qualifying conditions.</p></reply>

There are currently approximately 78,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;344 million for 2014.   Following an extensive review of the private rental market revised maximum rent limits were introduced from Monday 17 June 2013 until 31 December 2014. Despite the overall pressures on the social protection budget, there have been increases in the rent limits in Dublin, Galway, North Kildare and Bray areas including some increases in Cork.  The fact that approximately 78,000 people are currently in receipt of rent supplement shows that a significant number of landlords are accommodating applicants on the scheme. </p><p>  The latest Daft.ie rental report indicates that the number of advertised rental units in Dublin has declined from 6,700 in 2009 to under 1,500 at the end of 2013. This report also states that rent levels are static in areas outside Dublin, including Cork, Galway and Limerick cities. Analysis shows that properties are available in County Cork within the current maximum rent limits. In the Dublin area in particular, prospective tenants, including those seeking to access rent supplement, are now finding it increasingly difficult to secure appropriate accommodation due to the reduced availability of rental properties. Increasing the maximum rent limits for rent supplement will not resolve this difficulty, due to the reduced level of supply, and would result in further increases in rental costs for all persons renting including those on reduced incomes and students. I have no plans to revise the existing rent limits at this time.</p><p>  Department officials administering rent supplement have considerable experience in dealing with customers of the scheme and will continue to make every effort to ensure that their accommodation needs are met and that the residence is reasonably suited to their residential and other needs. The Department continues to monitor trends in the private rental market to determine the impact on rent supplement recipients and is working closely with Dublin City Council and Threshold to ensure that the necessary arrangements can be put in place in respect of vulnerable families in receipt of rent supplement. </p><p>  The Department&rsquo;s strategic policy direction is to return rent supplement to its original purpose of a short term income support. In July 2013 the Government approved the introduction of the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP). Under HAP, responsibility for recipients of rent supplement with a long-term housing need will transfer from the Department of Social Protection to local authorities. Officials in the Department are working closely with those in the lead Department of Environment, Community and Local Government, in piloting HAP in Limerick City and County Council with further roll out to selected local authorities during the year. </p></reply>

Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives and the reform measures introduced to date go somewhat toward that goal. </p><p>  Currently a person&rsquo;s date of entry into insurance is taken as the date used for averaging purposes.  To qualify for a state pension a person must:</p><p>- have entered insurance before the age of 66;</p><p>- have at least 520 paid contributions and </p><p>- satisfy a yearly average (a yearly average of 48 contributions paid and/or credited is required for a full rate pension). </p><p>  The State pension (contributory) is based on contributions paid and credited over the course of the pensioners working life, and those who had less attachment to the workforce qualify for lower pensions, accordingly, under that scheme.  As provided for in Budget 2012, from September 2012, new rate bands for State pension were introduced.  These additional payment rate bands more accurately reflect the social insurance history of a person and ensure that those who contribute more during a working life benefit more from this scheme in retirement than those with lesser contributions.</p><p>  This does not mean that those less attached to the workforce will not have an income need in old-age, and for this reason the social protection system provides alternative methods of supporting such pensioners, based either on the contributions made by their spouse, or on their own needs. </p><p>  An increase for a qualified adult, which is means tested, may be made in respect of an adult dependant who does not qualify for a pension in their own right, or who qualifies for a lower rate of pension due to gaps in his/her insurance.  The means tested non-contributory pension may be available to an individual who meets the qualifying criteria. </p><p>  The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme makes qualification for State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme which was introduced in and took effect from 1994 allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age, or incapacitated people, to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes.  In relation to women (who are usually the main beneficiary of the Homemakers scheme) and social insurance payments, it is worth noting that the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund 2012 confirms that the Fund provides better value to female rather than male contributors, due to the distributive nature of the Fund.</p><p>  The combination of measures under the Social Protection code have resulted in very similar outcomes for male and female pensioners in Ireland, with poverty rates for women over 65 being slightly lower than those for men.  The success of these measures in ensuring equality of outcomes for men and women over 65 is evidenced by the poverty statistics.  The &lsquo;at risk of poverty&rsquo; rate in 2011 was 10.1% for men, compared to 9.4% for women.  The consistent poverty rates were 2.1% for men and 1.8% for women.  </p><p>  Budget 2006 saw the personal rate for the State Pension (contributory) set at &euro;193.30.  The current full rate of payment is 19% higher, despite the very significant budgetary adjustments required for most of the period since then.  As regards those with a yearly average of less than 40 contributions, even for those with an average of only 20, such reduced rate State pensioners are paid a higher rate now than the full rate was at that time.  </p><p>  The yearly average test has been in existence since 1961 when contributory pensions were first introduced.  The system was designed to ensure that people could qualify for contributory pensions immediately rather than waiting for contributions to build up and to suit a system where social insurance coverage was less comprehensive and people could move in and out of coverage as a result of the nature of their employment and/or earnings.  Social insurance is now long established and is comprehensive in terms of the workforce covered. </p><p>  It is planned that a total contributions approach to pension qualification will replace the current average contributions test for State pension (contributory).  The proposed date for the introduction of this change is 2020, but this may be subject to change.</p></reply>

It does this by disregarding years spent outside the workforce on such duties when calculating the average contributions per year on the pensioner&rsquo;s record.</p><p>  To be eligible for the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme, a person must:</p><p>- Permanently live in the State (exception may be made where EU regulations apply),</p><p> - Be aged under 66,</p><p> - Have started insurable employment or self-employment before the age of 56,</p><p>- Not work full-time, although for the purposes of this scheme, a person can work and earn less than &euro;38 gross per week,</p><p>- Care for a child (under 12) or an incapacitated person on a full-time basis.</p><p>  The scheme allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age, and/or an incapacitated person, to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes.  </p><p>  However, it is important to note that the scheme will not, of itself, qualify a person for a pension.  The standard qualifying conditions, which require a person to enter insurance ten years before pension age, pay a minimum of 520 contributions at the correct rate and achieve a yearly average of at least 10 contributions on their record from the time they enter insurance until they reach pension age, must also be satisfied.  For those who do not satisfy these conditions, and have an income need, a means-tested State pension may be available. </p><p>  The introduction of homemaker credits would be an alternative approach.  Instead of disregarding years outside the labour market, reducing the duration of the insurance record, and thereby increasing the average number of contributions paid per year, a homemakers credits scheme would involve the award of credits for the period(s) spent outside the labour market in a caring capacity.  A homemaker credit would improve the likelihood of qualifying and of receiving a higher rate of pension for those affected. </p><p>  However, the introduction of homemaker credits raises a number of issues, most notably cost.  If they were awarded from a current date, the cost initially would likely be low, at less than &euro;100,000 per annum, based on 2010 estimates.  Costs in relation to current homemaker&rsquo;s disregard scheme are expected to increase in the coming years due to the 20% increase in female employment rates between 1994 and 2008.  </p><p>  A further factor impacting on possible costs would be the date from when such credits were effective.  The 2007 Green Paper on Pensions indicated that to back-date the current homemaker&rsquo;s disregard scheme to 1953, the year when the unified system of social insurance was introduced, would cost the Exchequer some &euro;160 million per annum.  </p><p>  Consideration would also need to be given to the number of possible eligible people previously employed in Ireland, who are now resident in other countries such as the UK and for which no estimates are available but which could add significantly to costs, given the general increase in female employment.</p><p>  It is planned that a total contributions approach to pension qualification will replace the current average contributions test for State pension (contributory).  The proposed date for the introduction of this change is 2020, but this may be subject to change. </p><p>  The total contributions approach (whereby the pension payment will be based on the number of contributions paid and credited) will remove the current anomaly whereby people can achieve a higher average contribution rate, and thus a higher level of pension, even where they have a lower total number of contributions paid.  This move will bring transparency and fairness to the eligibility for pension.

Arramara Teo. is currently a wholly owned subsidiary company of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  The sale of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta's shares in Arramara Teo. to Acadian Seaplants was approved by the board of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s on 1 March 2013, subject to Ministerial approval being obtained and legal details being agreed.  Ministerial approval for the sale was granted on 29 July 2013.

It is envisaged that the sale of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta's shares will benefit the State through a cash consideration to &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, through a significant investment in Arramara Teo., and through the development of the seaweed sector into the future with benefit accruing to the State as a result of increased economic activity.</p></reply>

Specifically, the Act requires RT&Eacute; to provide digital coverage to the same extent as provided over the previous analogue network, i.e. 98% population coverage, and I am advised by RT&Eacute; that this level of coverage is being provided by the SAORVIEW TV network.  For the remaining 2% of the population, RT&Eacute; launched SAORSAT in March 2012.  The development and provision of SAORSAT, which is a &ldquo;free to air&rdquo; satellite system providing access to the RT&Eacute; channels and TG4, was undertaken by RT&Eacute; on its own initiative and, as in the case of the SAORVIEW DTT network, is not a matter in which I have a function.  Ireland is not the only country to have introduced a national TV network on both a terrestrial and satellite platform.  Many countries, including the UK, have developed their digital networks on both the traditional terrestrial platform and also over satellite.  The reason for this is simple. It is technically and financially impossible to provide 100% coverage using a terrestrial TV platform.  However, through SAORVIEW and SAORSAT, Ireland now has 100% &ldquo;free to air&rdquo; coverage of the RT&Eacute; channels and TG4 for the first time in the history of the State.  I would advise the Deputy that any signal reception issues should be directed to 2rn in the first place.  2rn can be contacted at or at the following contact number (01) 2082175.  Any decision to enter into a contractual arrangement with a private commercial company is a matter of consideration for the individual concerned.  The Deputy will note that there is no provision for a waiver of the television licence fee in the Broadcasting Act 2009.</p></reply>

The uptake of the Combined Heat and Power (CHP) capacity under REFIT 3, launched in early 2012, will make a contribution to achieving this, along with migration to renewable heat in response to market forces. The requirements of Part L of the Building regulations are also expected to make a contribution to increasing the uptake of renewable heat. These measures and developments will build on the increases in renewable heat which were achieved by schemes such as the Greener Homes Scheme, the Renewable Heat Deployment Programme (ReHeat) and the CHP Deployment Programme. My Department is also currently finalising a Bioenergy Strategy which will set out the actions required to optimise the contribution that energy from biomass can make to achieving Ireland's 2020 renewable energy targets. Analysis underpinning the strategy suggests that additional, targeted bioenergy measures can have a significant impact in the heat sector and recommendations will shortly be brought forward in this regard.

The report provides the framework and context for the scheme and the eligibility criteria are reflective of the conclusions and recommendations of the report.   It is a scheme of &ldquo;last resort&rdquo; where homeowners can demonstrate to the Pyrite Resolution Board that they have no other practicable option s to seek redress; it is a remediation scheme not a compensation scheme. The scheme was introduced having regard to the exceptional nature of the pyrite problems in subfloor hardcore of the affected dwellings and the circumstances in which it occurred.   </p><p>In general, building defects are matters for resolution between contracting parties, the homeowner, the builder, the supplier and/or their respective insurers and in the event that the parties cannot reach a settlement by negotiation the option of seeking redress in the Courts can be considered.    In the case of those dwellings that fall within the remit of the pyrite remediation scheme, there were particular circumstances attaching to the pyrite problems in hardcore which made a legal recourse particularly difficult for affected homeowners to pursue. Most of the houses affected by pyritic heave in the subfloor hardcore are located in housing estates in which a number of different builders may have been involved and the hardcore material came from multiple sources.   </p><p>The exemption from the charge to Local Property Tax ( LPT ) is confined to those dwellings affected by significant pyritic damage as a consequence of pyrite in the subfloor hardcore material . Section 10A of the <i>Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012</i>(as amended) provides that an exemption from the charge to LPT will apply for a temporary period for residential properties that have been certified under t he <i>Finance (Local Property Tax) (Pyrite Exemption) Regulations 2013</i>as having &ldquo;significant pyritic damage&rdquo;.    To claim an exemption a residential property owner must demonstrate significant damage due to pyritic heave in accordance with the Irish Standard, <i>I.S. 398</i><i>-1:2013</i><i>&ndash; Reactive Pyrite in sub-floor hardcore material</i>. The standard provides guidance on the methodology to establish the presencee of significant pyritic damage .   </p><p>Significant pyritic damage is established on the basis of:     </p><p>- A Building Condition Assessment with a damage rating of 2 or a damage rating of 1 (with progression) carried out by a competent person, and </p><p>- results of testing of the hardcore material confirming that the damage is attributable to pyritic heave.   </p><p>While I fully understand and acknowledge the extremely difficult and distressing situations that the householders in Mayo face I believe that the responsible parties should take appropriate actions to provide remedies for affected homeowners.</p></reply>

Full details are available on the web site of the Department of Justice and Equality and can be accessed via the link below:</p><p>.  Closing date for receipt of expressions of interest is 29 April and I expect to make appointments to the Tribunal as soon as possible after consideration of the expressions of interest received.</p><p>The Tribunal administers both the Scheme of Compensation for Personal Injuries Criminally Inflicted and the Scheme of Compensation for Personal Injuries Criminally Inflicted on Prison Officers and considers applications from people who suffer a personal injury or death as a result of a crime of violence.  The Tribunal consists of a Chairperson and six ordinary Members.  The Chairperson and each Member must be either a practising barrister or a practising solicitor. As the Deputy may be aware I recently appointed a Tribunal Chairperson, Mr. John Cheatle, B.L who can, under the terms of the Scheme, determine applications and is entirely independent in that regard.

This commitment will be delivered in the form of a new Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill which I intend to publish later this year.  Of particular note, the Bill will provide for the introduction of a single application procedure for the investigation of all grounds for protection and any other grounds presented by applicants seeking to remain in the State.  This will provide protection applicants with a final decision on their application in a more &lsquo;straight forward&rsquo; and timely fashion. </p><p>As I have outlined previously to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence, several hundred amendments to the Bill are anticipated, the majority of a technical nature. In light of this and other considerations, I have decided that, instead of engaging in an extremely cumbersome process of tabling hundreds of amendments to the text of the Bill published by the last Government in 2010, it would be much more efficient to publish a new and enhanced text.  This proposition has been broadly welcomed by the Joint Committee. Such an approach can take account of current Government policy and intervening developments while incorporating the many technical and other amendments anticipated. It also provides an opportunity to address the key policy issues, including those which remain of concern to Members and other stake-holders in the Bill.</p><p>Work on the Bill continues, therefore, on that basis, including in cooperation with the Offices of Parliamentary Counsel and of the Attorney General while also taking account of any relevant rulings by the Courts and any further submissions received. I can confirm that there are ongoing and very detailed consultations with Advisory Counsel on a number of specific aspects of the Bill which need to be addressed in preparation for its publication later this year. At the same time, the main components of the Bill will continue to reflect those of the 2010 version.</p><p>The Deputy may be aware that I made new Regulations last year governing the investigation and determination of applications for subsidiary protection in the State. The  European Union (Subsidiary Protection) Regulations 2013, which came into effect on 14 November 2013, were made to address certain matters which arose from the judgment of the High Court in January 2013 in the MM case.  Under the new Regulations, responsibility for the processing of applications for subsidiary protection now rests with the Refugee Applications Commissioner with appeals to be dealt with by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  Both of these bodies are independent in the exercise of their statutory functions and they have substantial experience in the area of asylum investigations and appeals, respectively.  Once the new arrangements have bedded down, my aim is for subsidiary protection applications currently on hand to be processed to finality by the statutory bodies concerned in the shortest possible time-frame consistent with quality and fair assessment of all cases and of course, subject to the cooperation of applicants and no further legal impediments arising.  In those circumstances I would anticipate very significant inroads to be made on the caseload by the end of 2014. </p></reply>

Each  Visiting Committee now comprises no more than six members, and only suitable people with a genuine interest in prison issues are appointed. </p><p>As previously stated, the current legislation relating to Visiting Committees dates from 1925 and as part of my plans to streamline the current inspections regime, I intend replacing this old law with a number of new provisions to be included in the proposed Inspections of Places of Detention Bill. These provisions will make Visiting Committees more effective, while they continue their role of visiting prisons, meeting with prisoners and liaising on their behalf with prison authorities. A link will be established between the Visiting Committees and the Inspector of Prisons. Under the proposed new arrangements, it is my intention that Visiting Committees will report regularly to the Inspector and will be able to report any urgent or major matter to the Inspector at any time. I believe this will make them more effective and improve the independent oversight of our prisons. Subject to competing legislative priorities, I expect that work on the General Scheme will be completed later this year. </p><p>In terms of enhanced rehabilitation and training in prisons, the Prison Service provides a wide range of rehabilitative programmes which include education, vocational training, healthcare, psychiatric, psychological, counselling, welfare and spiritual services. All prisoners are eligible to use these programmes which are available in all prisons. On committal, all prisoners are interviewed by the Governor and informed of the services available in the prison. At this point prisoners may be referred to services or they can self refer at a later date. Where a Governor considers, on the information available, that a prisoner needs a particular intervention he/she will initiate a referral. </p><p>The number of accredited vocational courses and opportunities available in Work Training has also been expanded in recent years. Enhanced partnership arrangements with accrediting bodies and the centralising of coordination and quality assurance arrangements have enabled the Prison Service to extend the number of available courses and activities with certification. An Integrated Sentence Management (ISM) system has been introduced which involves a new orientation in the delivery of services and an emphasis on prisoners taking greater personal responsibility for their own development through active engagement with both specialist and non-specialist services in the prisons. The end result is a prisoner centred multidisciplinary approach to working with prisoners with provision for initial assessment, goal setting and periodic review to measure progress.</p><p>The development of prisoner programmes forms a central part of the Prison Service Three Year Strategic Plan 2012 - 2015. There is a clear commitment in the Strategy to enhance sentence planning including ISM and the delivery of prison based rehabilitative programmes such as education, work training and resettlement programmes.  <b><font color="#000080"> </font></b></p></reply>

This application ultimately was refused, and he was so informed on 6 March, 2009.  Subsequently, this person made an application for Subsidiary Protection under the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 (Statutory Instrument No. 518 of 2006) on 30 March, 2009.

A Deportation Order was signed in respect of this person on 9 March, 2012.  The applicant instituted Judicial Review proceedings on 28 March, 2012, challenging the refusal of his asylum claim, the refusal of his Subsidiary Protection application and the Deportation Order signed in respect of him, and accordingly, as the matter is <i>sub judice,</i>I do not propose to comment further.</p><p>I should remind the Deputy that queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by Email using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

Since that time I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that, following extensive correspondence and a review of the file of the person concerned, further permission to remain in the State was granted for a twelve month period and this is due to expire on 21st July, 2014.  The person concerned should make a written application one month prior to this expiry date, including supporting documentation, for further renewal of her residency to the INIS, PO BOX 10003, Dublin 1.<blockquote><i>Parliamentary Question number 221 of 16th May, 2013</i><br /><br /><i>I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) that the person referred to by the Deputy was granted temporary permission to remain in the State under stamp 4 conditions for an initial one year period on 10th June, 2002, on the basis that she was part of a family unit where the parents had been granted residency on the basis of parentage of an Irish citizen child. This permission appears to have been renewed on a regular basis by her local Immigration Officer until March 2010.  I am informed that when she attended the registration office of the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) in May 2010, she was advised to contact my officials in the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) regarding same.  However it appears that the next contact from the person concerned was in March 2012 when she presented to her local Immigration Officer.  She was refused registration on this occasion as she has been out of permission since March 2010.  The local Immigration Officer advised her to write to INIS outlining her situation prior to renewal of registration. I am informed that she was given this direction by him on 26th August 2012.</i><br /><br /><i>I understand that some documentation has since been received from the person concerned by INIS. However, in order to assist in regularising her status in the State, further documentation was requested from her in writing on 13th March 2013.  To date no response has been received.  On receipt of the documents requested, her case will then be examined by the relevant officials in INIS. Once a decision has been made on her status, this decision and the consequences involved will be conveyed in writing to the person concerned.</i><br /><br /><i>I am also informed that the person concerned submitted an application for a Certificate of Naturalisation in August 2005. This application was refused by my predecessor at his absolute discretion. The person's legal representative was notified of the decision and the reason for same by letter dated 31th March 2009. She may re-apply at any time when in a position to satisfy the statutory requirements.</i></blockquote>Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

Since actions undertaken by the BFCP participants continued throughout 2013, it was not possible to carry out the required eligibility inspections, which must be carried out prior to payment, until 2014.  The EU Regulations also provide that all of the eligibility inspections must be completed before payments can commence, which is now the case.  These payments for 2013 totalling &euro;986,000 support high environmental value farming in the Burren, which<i></i>is one of Ireland&rsquo;s outstanding<i></i>landscapes and is known worldwide.

The Net National Ceiling for the 2013 SPS scheme-year was &euro;1,255.5 million.  The level of deduction applied, which is equivalent to modulation, was 10% on all amounts in excess &euro;5,000 and 14% on amount paid in excess of &euro;300,000.  In addition, a deduction under Financial Discipline of 2.453658% was applied to ensure compliance with the new EU Budget, as agreed during the negotiations on the MFF and to provide for a Crises Reserve.  The financial discipline deduction was applied, in accordance with the EU Regulations, on payments in excess of &euro;2,000.  Approximately 1% of the Financial Discipline deduction related to the establishment of the Crises Reserve and this will be refunded to farmers if it is not utilised during the 2014 EAGF financial year.</p><p>  The modulation deduction no longer applies under the 2014 Single Payment Scheme.  However, in order to ensure compliance with the new 2014 National Ceiling of &euro;1,216.547 million a linear reduction was applied to payment entitlements under the provisions of EU Regulation 1310/2013.  Under the provisions of this Regulation, Member States has a discretionary power to exclude the activated entitlements held by farmers, who claimed &euro;5,000 or less under the 2013 Single Payment Scheme.  I decided to implement this provision in order to protect smaller-scale producers in Ireland.  The level of the linear reduction applied to those entitlements held by farmers, who claimed more than &euro;5,000 was 10.49%.  It will also be necessary to apply a Financial Discipline deduction under the 2014 Scheme to provide for a Crises Reserve in respect of the 2015 EAGF financial year.  In that regard, the European Commission published a proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council providing for a Financial Discipline deduction of 1.301951% on all amounts in excess of &euro;2,000 under the 2014 Schemes.  It is open to the Commission to alter this rate following the preparation of the Amending Letter to the 2015 Draft Budget in October 2014 by way of an implementing act.  There was and will be no deductions in respect of the National Reserve or for Young Farmers under the 2013 and 2014 Schemes.  The deductions in respect of these measures will apply from 2015.</p></reply>

In 2013 a capital allocation of &euro; 1.5 million was made available to my Department for the Youth Caf&eacute; Scheme and some 30 new youth caf&eacute; projects were approved and will move into development stage over the coming months.</p><p>My Department estimates that between 75 and 100 youth caf&eacute; facilities now operate across the State and more are coming on stream. These facilities are proving hugely beneficial to local communities  <font color="#2F2F2F"> offering support to young people, and opportunities to participate in activities that are of interest to them and that are on offer at times that suit their normal activities.</font></p><p>The Youth Caf&eacute; Scheme is intended to enable fit-out, refurbishment or building enhancement projects for the start-up of new youth caf&eacute;s through the provision of &lsquo;once off&rsquo; capital funding. The scheme does not provide for grant aid or on-going funding to meet   current costs such as staff, management or other on-going costs. To support youth cafes in development and maintaining their services for young people, my Department has published two guides <i>Youth Caf&eacute;s in Ireland, A Best Practice Guide</i><b></b>(2010) and <i>Youth Caf&eacute; Toolkit, How to set up and run a youth caf&eacute; in Ireland</i>(2010). </p><p>The criteria for the capital funding scheme places a high priority on the need to plan for youth caf&eacute; projects to be sustainable in the long term; for example new applications must demonstrate how day to day running costs (not eligible for funding) would be met, for example, through partnering with existing services for young people. This is an important aspect of the programme as there is no funding available in my Department to support running costs associated with youth cafes. </p><p>I am aware of the project in question and the valuable services it provides to young people in the local community. I have arranged that Pobal, which assists my Department with the administration of the youth capital scheme, make contact with the project to discuss their situation and to provide information on the practice and experience of youth cafes in running of their services, which may assist the project in question in devising its plans for sustainability into the future. </p></reply>

In November 2012 I announced the Government decision that the new hospital would be co-located with St James's Hospital on its campus. Co-location with St James's and, ultimately, tri-location with a maternity hospital on the St James's campus will provide the excellence in clinical care that our children deserve. In making its decision, the Government carefully considered the report of the Dolphin Group, along with detailed supplementary information on cost, time and planning which was subsequently sought from members of the Dolphin Group with the relevant technical expertise.</p><p>  The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board  is responsible for this priority capital project, and is focused on delivering the new hospital on schedule, to optimal design and value for money. On 2 August last, I announced the appointment to the Development Board of a Chair and Board members with the necessary construction, architectural, engineering, planning and procurement expertise to deliver this complex and large-scale project. I am confident that the Board, working with the HSE, with my Department and with the Children's Hospital Group Board, will ensure the successful completion of the hospital on the St James's campus and this Government has no alternative plans for any other location.</p><p>  The Board is strongly focused on mitigating risks associated with the planning process. It is currently in the process of design team procurement with the aim being to appoint the full design team in June and to submit a planning application in February 2015 following design development.

The Group included cross-departmental and cross-sectoral representation in order to effectively reflect a whole-population approach.  The Steering Group comprised representatives from relevant Departments and agencies, medical professional bodies, the community and voluntary sectors and the alcohol industry.  The Group published its report in 2012 and the two representatives of the alcohol industry, the Alcohol Beverage Federation of Ireland (ABFI) and Mature Enjoyment of Alcohol in Society Ltd (MEAS), published separate minority reports at the same time.</p><p>Last year Government has approved an extensive package of measures to deal with alcohol misuse to be incorporated in a Public Health (Alcohol) Bill.  These measures are based on the recommendations contained in the <i>Steering Group Report on a National Substance Misuse Strategy</i>, 2012.  The package of measures to be implemented will include provision for minimum unit pricing, regulation of the marketing and advertising of alcohol, regulation of sports sponsorship, structural separation of alcohol from other products in mixed trading outlets and labelling of alcohol products.  Work on developing a framework for the necessary Department of Health legislation is continuing.  It is hoped to publish a General Scheme of a Bill in the coming months.</p><p>As I mentioned earlier, this work is based on the recommendations of the<i>Steering Group Report, </i>in which the alcohol industry was represented<i>.</i>However, its is for my Department, with the assistance of the Office of the Attorney General and in conjunction with other relevant Departments, to draft legislation to implement the Government decision.  In this regard, the alcohol industry seeks a role for itself in public health policy areas that extends far beyond their role as producers and retailers of alcohol.  They, like all other relevant stakeholders, will have an opportunity to put forward their views during the pre-legislative scrutiny of the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill.  <i></i>The Government decision also endorsed the other recommendations in the <i>Report of the Steering Group on a Substance Misuse Strategy.  </i>My Department has written to the lead Departments and Agencies requesting them to commence work on the implementation of these recommendations.  The Health Service Executive has responsibility for implementing a number of these recommendations and this is reflected in their service plan for 2014.</p></reply>

The requirement to undertake formal lessons forms part of an overall Graduated Driver Licence System proposed by the Road Safety Authority for learner drivers.  They are once-off events and apply to all drivers as part of the process of being obtaining a full licence.  They do not add any greater burden on people working in or operating small businesses than on any other citizen.  Periods of grant of licence are the same for these citizens as all others.    </p><p>  Professional drivers are required to have a Certificate of Professional Competence (CPC), and there is periodic retraining under the CPC regime.  However, the entire CPC regime, including the requirement for periodic retraining, is an EU-wide system and it not open to Ireland to unilaterally vary this.</p></reply>

I made this request as a result of  a  recent High Court Judgement on the DART Underground Railway Order which ruled that the period for serving Notices to Treat for the purpose of compulsory purchase of property under the Order should be 18 months rather than the 7 years set out in the Railway Order.  This  means that a decision on whether  to proceed with DART Underground under the current Railway Order must be made by September 2015.</p><p>  The 2010 business case is out of date. The NTA will ensure that the new business case is based on the latest data as regards population, transport demand, construction costs etc and meets all the requirements of the revised public sector code for capital projects which was published last year.   I have also asked the NTA to review funding options. As is the case with any major expenditure, the opportunity cost must also be considered. This is the cost of not using the money to do something else such as other transport investments in the Greater Dublin Area and around the country, school building, investment in health care facilities and loss of potential employment, revenue, social welfare savings, etc. </p><p>  It should be noted that a loan, be it from European bodies such as the European Investment Bank or from domestic or international financial institutions must be repaid by the Exchequer with interest and it is added to government debt . Similarly private funding options in the form of a traditional Public Private Partnership impose significant long-term liabilities on the Exchequer or on users. The Deputy will appreciate this from her interest in other PPP projects such as the Limerick Port Tunnel and the M3 motorway.</p><p>  I expect to have a detailed report from the NTA later this year and will then consider the options for the project  having regard to the outcome of the business case review, cost and  affordability, possible external funding sources and the outcome of the Governments review of the medium term capital envelope to 2020 which is commencing. </p><p>  The 2010 business case is available on the NTA website.</p></reply>
