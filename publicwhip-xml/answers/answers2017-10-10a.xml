I continue to use every opportunity to ensure that other Member States and the EU institutions fully understand our particular concerns arising from Brexit, to enable the best possible outcome for this country.  Of course, other Ministers - particularly Minister Coveney, who has special responsibility for Brexit - are also meeting with their EU counterparts on a regular basis.</p>  <p>  As part of my own engagements, I met bilaterally with the Dutch Prime Minister, Mark Rutte, while we were both in Tallinn for the Digital Summit on 29 September.  We discussed progress in relation to the Brexit negotiations, and I thanked the Prime Minister for his understanding of Ireland's particular concerns.  We also exchanged views about the Bratislava Process and the future direction of Europe. </p>  <p>  I invited PM Rutte to visit Dublin later this year when I hope we will have a further opportunity to discuss these issues in detail.  Dates for his visit are currently being explored.</p></reply>

The farming sector is a sector of particular focus of attention by the HSA due to the large number of accidents and fatalities on Irish farms. In order to address this situation the HSA, in addition to traditional inspections, is adopting a parallel approach of targeted engagement and awareness-raising directly with the farming community.</p><p>The Agriculture Sector is unique in several respects. It is predominately made up of individual self-employed, self-supervised sole traders whose work is generally intrinsically linked to the family home and family life.  Pressures and difficulties in agricultural work are generally exacerbated by seasonality, periods of peak activity, time pressures and the constant influence of various weather conditions.  The aim of the HSA is to prevent loss of life, serious injury and ill health arising out of agricultural work activity to farmers, farm families and all who interact with farmers. </p><p>In 2017 the HSA aims to improve health and safety in agriculture by &ndash; </p><p>- carrying out 2,000 inspections </p><p>- continuing the emphasis on engagement with farmers e.g. through knowledge sharing groups, combined with a series of agriculture inspection campaigns both nationally and regionally;</p><p>- conducting two agriculture inspection campaigns, each of three weeks&rsquo; duration.  The first began on 1<sup>st</sup>March and was concerned with livestock safety and the second commenced on 2<sup>nd</sup>May and focussed on tractors and machinery.  The campaigns had both a national and regional focus and were also supported by media campaigns;</p><p>- continuing to deliver coordinated awareness raising/safety promotion/training initiatives with major stake holders (e.g. the National Farm Safety Conference which will take place on the 17<sup>th</sup>November in Ennis);</p><p>- assisting in the implementation of the second year of the Farm Safety Action Plan 2016-2018, developed in conjunction with the Farm Safety Partnership Advisory Committee.  This plan lays out a series of specific actions and priorities for tackling the high rates of illness, injury and death on Irish farms including active participation by the HSA in Farm Safety Week which took place in July and the Ploughing Championship in September.</p><p>My Department has sanctioned the recruitment of 11 inspector posts for the HSA. On foot of these sanctions the Authority is currently completing its recruitment process for these inspector posts. Of these posts 6 relate to inspectors who will have an involvement in future farm inspection programs. </p><p>Comments made by the CEO of the HSA in a recent radio interview to the HSA having identified a need for an additional 48 new posts are in reference to a draft two-year Workforce Plan produced by the HSA and submitted very recently to my Department. I have not seen that draft Workforce Plan which is being considered by my officials in conjunction with the HSA. I should point out that the 48 new posts being requested cover a range of sectors and grades including clerical and administrative posts. None of the additional posts referred to in the draft Plan include dedicated farm inspection resources</p></reply>

One of the Agency's key priorities is ensuring that such investment is spread as evenly as possible around the country and that every region of Ireland benefits from overseas FDI.</p>  <p>  While the general global trend is for FDI to be located in or around major urban areas, the IDA has placed a special emphasis on attracting overseas companies to regional Ireland. This is evidenced by the Agency's current five-year strategy, which sets ambitious targets of increasing investment by between 30-40% in every region of the country by 2019.</p>  <p>  Progress continues to be made towards reaching that goal. For example, the Agency's mid-year results for 2017 show that 54% of all job approvals so far this year are for investments located outside of Dublin. This is up from 37% at the same time last year. Moreover, over half of all IDA Ireland supported jobs created last year were based outside of Dublin.</p>  <p>  The investments that have been secured for rural and regional areas span many different sectors and industries. They also differ significantly in their individual size and scale. Their key unifying feature is that the companies behind the investments have all decided to locate or expand outside of Ireland's main urban centres. I am confident that the confidence that these businesses have rightfully placed in the regions will help lead in turn to further FDI across the country. </p></reply>

As Minister for Finance I have responsibility for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation, and neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products or have the power to direct insurance companies to provide flood cover to specific individuals or businesses. This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.</p>  <p>  Government policy in relation to flooding is focused on the development of a sustainable, planned and risk-based approach to dealing with flooding problems. This in turn should lead to the increased availability of flood insurance. To achieve this aim, there is a focus on:</p>  <p>- prioritising spending on flood relief measures by the Office of Public Works (OPW) and relevant local authorities,  </p>  <p>- development of plans by the OPW to implement flood relief schemes, and </p>  <p>- improving channels of communication between the OPW and the insurance industry in order to reach a better understanding about the provision of flood cover in marginal areas.   </p>  <p>  Insurance Ireland has informed me that its members, since 1 June 2014, have factored data on all completed flood defence schemes, provided by the OPW, into its assessment of flood risk within these areas. This information has been provided as part of an information sharing arrangement entered into between OPW and Insurance Ireland (Memorandum of Understanding). The nature of this arrangement is such that it should lead to a greater availability of flood cover in previously higher risk areas, and at better prices. </p>  <p>  While it is not possible for me to comment on individual cases without the full facts, I am advised by the OPW that Bath Avenue Gardens, Dublin 4 is within the benefiting area of the River Dodder Tidal Scheme, the details of which have been shared with Insurance Ireland under the Memorandum of Understanding.</p>  <p>  I note however, that the River Dodder Tidal Scheme contains 3 demountable defences. The most recent Insurance Ireland survey (December 2016) of approximately 85% of the property insurance market in Ireland indicates that of 16 completed defence schemes, there has been an increase from 66% to 77% of policies in areas benefiting from demountable defences including flood cover. Increasing the provision of flood insurance to households in areas protected by schemes containing demountable defences is a topic which is subject to ongoing discussions between Insurance Ireland, the Department of Finance, and the OPW.</p>  <p>  Finally, you should be aware that a consumer can make a complaint to the Financial Services Ombudsman in relation to any dealings with a Financial Services or Insurance provider during which they feel they have been unfairly treated. In addition, individuals who are experiencing difficulty in obtaining flood insurance or believe that they are being treated unfairly may contact Insurance Ireland which operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to insurance. </p></reply>

The report favoured the use of market value of residential properties as the basis of assessment and this recommendation was accepted by the Government. The Group considered that under a market value approach applied to housing, the market value of a residential property would be related to the characteristics of the building itself, the site on which it was located and the characteristics and amenities of the neighbourhood. There would be a relationship between the market value of a house and benefits to the owners in terms of enjoyment of the amenity value of the properties. </p>  <p>  At the request of the Minister for Finance, the operation of the LPT was reviewed in 2015 by Dr. Thornhill. A number of submissions to the review favoured changing the basis of determination of LPT liabilities to site value, floor area or variations thereof. Dr. Thornhill considered these but remained of the view that market value is the most appropriate and equitable basis on which to determine LPT liabilities.</p>  <p>  The Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012, as amended provides for a system of deferral and partial deferral arrangements in certain circumstances to assist individuals who may have difficulty paying the tax. Deferral/partial deferral is not an exemption and attaches as a charge on the property until the liability is paid. The deferral/partial deferral option also attracts an annual interest charge of 4%.</p>  <p>  Where a liable person does not qualify for, or does not wish to avail of, a deferral, phased payment of LPT can be used to assist with budgeting. The Government is aware of the difficulties facing many individuals and families, and for this reason a wide variety of methods for payment of the LPT are available from which liable persons can choose the method most suited to their individual circumstances. The LPT can be paid by way of phased payments rather than in a single payment; it can also be paid by direct debit; or through payment service providers such as An Post TaxPay, Payzone and Omnivend.</p>  <p>  Property owners who wish to avail of the deferral option or require clarification in regard to their particular circumstances should contact the LPT Helpline at 1890 200 255 to make the necessary arrangements.  </p></reply>

It also manages third-party costs arising from certain Tribunals of Inquiry and claims for legal costs by parties who have successfully sued the State in respect of personal injury and non-personal injury related litigation.</p>  <p>  The SCA&rsquo;s claims management objective is, while acting in the best interests of tax payers in matters of personal injury and property damage litigation, to act fairly and ethically in its dealings with people who have suffered injuries and/or damage and who take legal actions against the State or State bodies, and the families of these people. In cases where the SCA investigation concludes that the relevant State Authority bears some or all liability, it seeks to settle claims expeditiously and on fair and reasonable terms.  If it considers that the State is not liable the SCA&rsquo;s policy is to apply all necessary resources to defend the claims. </p>  <p>  Where the State Claims Agency successfully defends a claim following a Court Trial, it is open to the unsuccessful plaintiff to Appeal that Court&rsquo;s decision to a higher Court and, in appropriate cases, the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court.</p></reply>

Among the conditions were that the SPVs were of temporary duration and were established for the sole purpose of addressing the financial crisis. </p><p>In order to avail of this accounting treatment, NAMA established an investment holding company &ndash; National Asset Management Agency Investment D.A.C. &ndash; which is majority-owned by private investors. 51% of its shares are collectively owned by private companies and the remaining 49% are owned by NAMA. Under the shareholders&rsquo; agreement between NAMA and the Private Investors, NAMA exercises a veto over decisions taken by the company. Eurostat gave its approval to this structure in October 2009.</p><p>The total issued share capital of National Asset Management Agency Investment D.A.C is &euro;100m of which &euro;51m (51m B Ordinary shares of &euro;0.10 each and Share Premium of &euro;45.9m) was invested by the Private Investors, each receiving an equal share of the 51 million B ordinary shares. </p><p>The breakdown of share capital invested by the original Private Investors in 2010 was as follows:<table><tr><th>Shareholder</th><th>Share Capital Invested<br /><br />  &euro;</th></tr><tr><td>Irish Life Assurance PLC</td><td>17,000,000</td></tr><tr><td>New Ireland Assurance Company PLC</td><td>17,000,000</td></tr><tr><td>Percy Nominees Limited</td><td>17,000,000</td></tr></table></p><p>The current shareholders are as follows: <table><tr><th>Shareholder</th><th>Share   Count</th><th>% Share   Count</th></tr><tr><td>BNY Custodial Nominees (Ireland) Limited </td><td>17,000,000</td><td>17%</td></tr><tr><td>New Ireland Assurance Company PLC</td><td>17,000,000</td><td>17%</td></tr><tr><td>Arthur Michael Joseph Keeley</td><td>8,687,500</td><td>8.69%</td></tr><tr><td>The Church of Ireland Clergy Pensions Fund</td><td>3,250,000</td><td>3.25%</td></tr><tr><td>The Representative Church Body</td><td>2,500,000</td><td>2.50%</td></tr><tr><td>Geoffrey Ian Broomhead</td><td>1,312,500</td><td>1.30%</td></tr><tr><td>Simon  Stuart Haworth</td><td>1,250,000</td><td>1.25%</td></tr></table></p><p>Under the shareholders&rsquo; agreement, the maximum return which will be paid to the private investors by way of dividend is restricted to the 10 year Irish Government Bond Yield applying at the date of the declaration of the dividend.

However, I am advised by Revenue that as an administrative measure, they provide what is known as &ldquo;outline approval&rdquo; to companies in advance of the shares issuing. This is where Revenue are prepared to express the opinion that, based on the information provided, relief under EII is likely to be available for an investment in a company. There is no requirement for a company to obtain outline approval prior to issuing shares. Therefore, the absence of outline approval does not prevent a company raising capital.</p>  <p>The company referred to by the deputy applied for outline approval on 18th   August. That application is awaiting attention and will be dealt with in due course. Revenue has informed me that all correspondence in relation to EII is dealt with in date order. </p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that they are experiencing some backlog in processing requests for approval under this scheme and that there has been an increase in the volume of correspondence on the scheme. This backlog is due to an increase in the number of companies applying for certification and to the increased complexity brought to the scheme by certain necessary changes to ensure consistency with European law made in Finance Act, 2015. </p>  <p>  Revenue has put in place procedures to reduce the backlog and it is anticipated that the application by the company referred to will be processed within the next 6 weeks. In addition, a review of the frequently raised issues has led to a re-design of the application forms to reduce correspondence relating to each application. Furthermore, a tax manual is being drafted to more clearly explain the aspects of the scheme that are the subject of multiple queries. The updated application form will be issued shortly, and the draft explanatory manual is currently being reviewed both internally and externally to ensure that it addresses the issues identified.</p></reply>

I am of the opinion that it is extremely disappointing that the Commission has taken action at this time against Ireland.  My officials have been in constant contact with the European Commission on all aspects of this process for over a year.</p>  <p>  While the Government has never accepted the Commission&rsquo;s analysis in the Apple State Aid decision, we have always been clear that we are fully committed to ensuring that recovery of the alleged Apple State Aid takes place without delay and has committed significant resources to ensuring that this is achieved as quickly as possible whilst ensuring that the interests of the Irish taxpayer are adequately protected. </p>  <p>  Officials and experts from across the State have been engaged in intensive work to ensure that Ireland complies with all its recovery obligations as soon as possible. Significant progress has been made on this complex issue and the establishment of an escrow fund, in compliance with all relevant Irish constitutional and European Union law requirements, is close to completion. </p>  <p>  With regard to the cost of advice in relation to the recovery process, over &euro;1 million (including VAT) has been spent by the State (including the Department of Finance, the Revenue Commissioners, the Central Bank of Ireland, the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office and the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office). This case has involved a significant degree of legal and technical complexity, and additional expertise has been engaged where required. As it is an important issue for the State, the recovery process will continue to be appropriately resourced.</p></reply>

The room or rooms must be used for the purposes of residential accommodation, i.e. the occupants are effectively using the room on a long-term basis, either on its own or in conjunction with other parts of the residence, as a home. The relief does not apply to rooms that are used for business purposes.</p>  <p>  Under the scheme, sums arising to an individual in respect of the letting, for residential purposes, of a room or rooms in his or her home, including, for example, sums arising from lettings to students for an academic year, and the provision of meals or other services supplied in connection with the letting, may be exempt from income tax where they meet the conditions of the scheme and where the individual's total gross income from such letting(s) is below the annual limit for the tax year in question. This limit was increased to &euro;14,000 with effect from the 2017 tax year.</p>  <p>  Income from the provision of accommodation to occasional visitors for short periods, including, for example, where the accommodation is provided through online accommodation booking sites, does not qualify for relief as the visitors use the accommodation as guest accommodation rather than for residential purposes. The tax treatment of such income is dependent on the nature of the accommodation irrespective of whether or not this is arranged through an internet letting platform or other form of intermediary.</p>  <p>  I am not favourably disposed to the extension of rent-a-room relief to income earned from the provision of accommodation through platforms such as the company in question, I am mindful such an extension could lead to unfair competition in the guest accommodation sector generally, by placing B&amp;B and guest house operators who provide accommodation in the course of a trade at an unfair disadvantage.</p></reply>

Any private individual or any business, club, charity, partnership or trust with a turnover of less than &euro;3 million per year may make a complaint to the Financial Services Ombudsman. A legal personal representative may submit a complaint to the Financial Service Ombudsman on behalf of a deceased&rsquo;s estate. The Financial Service Ombudsman has confirmed that once it has been established that the person bringing the complaint is the legal personal representative, these complaints are handled in the normal manner and in accordance with the usual procedures.  </p>  <p>  On the issue more generally, the Central Bank has informed me that  Chapter 10 of the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code 2012 (&lsquo;the Code&rsquo;) sets out how regulated firms must handle complaints received from consumers.  While provision 3.7 of the Code sets out how a regulated entity must deal with a person acting under a power of attorney, the Code does not include any specific requirements on dealing with persons with legal authority to act on behalf of a deceased consumer.</p></reply>

The amount of the merchant service charge varies, often depending on the volume of card transactions the retailer accepts. </p>  <p>  Budget 2016 introduced measures to support retailers by reducing costs and incentivising electronic payments. Changes were made to the interchange fees faced by retailers accepting cards, including halving the interchange fees for domestic consumer debit cards to 10 basis points - one of the lowest rates in the EU. Those changes came into effect on 9 December 2015 and reduced the costs of accepting card payments, as interchange fees make up part of the merchant service charge collected by acquirers from retailers. </p>  <p>  The Central Bank does provide other credit and debit card statistics, including the number of debit and credit cards currently in issue to Irish residents, and these are available on the website of the Central Bank. In addition, the Banking and Payments Federation of Ireland produces a payments monitor which is available on its website.</p>  <p>  Both of these sources of information evidence strong growth in the use electronic payments, particularly debit cards. The number of debit cards stood at 4,779,448 and the number of credit cards at 1,882,938 in August 2017. The latest Central Bank credit and debit card statistical release shows that debit card point-of-sale transactions, at &euro;2.9 billion in June 2017, were 16 per cent higher than the same month in 2016 while credit card point of sale transactions were 5 per cent higher than in the same period in 2016.</p></reply>

The set-off was limited to 50% of the profit in any given year. It did not disallow any tax losses from being utilised but instead lengthened the period over which they could be used. Section 396C was introduced as a form of claw-back for the taxpayer. </p><p>However, with the introduction of the new capital rules on 1 January 2014 under CRD IV and the State having acquired ownership positions in the banks, it no longer served its original purpose and accordingly, in the Finance Act 2014, the Minister for Finance deemed it appropriate to remove the provision. The removal of Section 396C put the covered banks in the same position as other corporates including other banks operating in Ireland. Indeed I would highlight for the Deputy that the provision which allows the carry-forward of tax losses for set-off against future trading profits is available not only for banks but for all Irish corporates. This is a standard tax policy internationally.</p><p>In relation to the impact on the banks of changing the treatment losses that can be brought forward, I can confirm that an analysis was carried out in late 2013 as part of the preparations for the Finance Bill 2014 when S396c of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 was repealed. </p><p>To recognise the part that the banks played in the financial crisis, in 2013, the Government also decided that the banking sector should make an annual contribution of approximately &euro;150 million to the Exchequer for the period from 2014 to 2016. In Budget 2016, the payment of this levy was extended until 2021. The bank levy is expected to raise &euro;750 million over the five years.</p><p>My Department requested that each of the banks to respond to the Deputy's query and received the following information.</p><p><b>Bank of Ireland:</b></p><p>&quot;In 2016, the Group paid taxes of &euro;263m to the Irish State and collected taxes of &euro;858m on behalf of the Irish State. In the first six months of 2017, the Group paid taxes of &euro;96m to the Irish State and collected taxes of &euro;455m on behalf of the Irish State. Note 19 on page 81 of the published Interim Report for the six months ended 30 June 2017 contains the Group&rsquo;s disclosures on the deferred tax asset that has been recognised in respect of historical trading losses. At 30 June 2017, deferred tax assets include an amount of &euro;1,251 million in respect of tax losses which are available to relieve future profits from tax. Of these losses, approximately &euro;1.1 billion relates to Irish tax losses and &euro;0.1 billion relates to UK tax losses. It is currently projected that the deferred tax asset in respect of tax losses will be recovered in full by the end of 2038.</p><p>&quot;The deferred tax assets have been recognised on the basis that it is probable the tax losses will be recovered as the Directors are satisfied that it is probable that the Group will have sufficient future taxable profits against which the deferred tax assets can be utilised. Under current Irish and UK tax legislation there is no time restriction on the utilisation of trading losses.&quot;</p><p><b>AIB: </b></p><p>&quot;Information in relation to AIB&rsquo;s Deferred Tax Asset are contained on Pages 257-259 and Pages 296&ndash;298 of the 2016 Annual Financial Report and Page 115 of the 2017 Half-Yearly Financial Report. At 31 December 2016, AIB Group recognised deferred tax assets of &euro;2,928 million arising from unused Irish tax losses. No deferred tax assets were recognised in respect of other unused Irish tax losses of &euro;122 million.</p><p>&quot;Under Irish tax legislation, there is no limit on the period of time for which any company can carry forward losses incurred in its trade for offset against future profits for the same trade. </p><p>&quot;Notwithstanding that AIB is carrying forward large amounts of trade tax losses, it also pays significant amounts of tax in Ireland such as the bank levy, corporation tax on capital gains and on non-trading income, irrecoverable VAT on purchases, and employer&rsquo;s PRSI. In addition, it remits to the Revenue taxes collected from others including PAYE, USC and PRSI relating to its c. 10,000 employees.&quot;</p><p><b>PTSB:</b></p><p>&quot;As noted in PTSB&rsquo;s 2016 Annual Report, the PTSB Group recognised a deferred tax asset on tax losses carried forward of &euro;373m at 31 December 2016. This equates to tax losses of c. &euro;2.98bn. The Group has estimated that it will take c. 22 years for the tax losses to be utilised.&quot;</p></reply>

These informed the development of the tax.  </p>  <p>  To further assist with the development of the tax, an implementation team composed of officials from Revenue and my Department was established together with a steering committee with representatives from Revenue, Department of Health and my Department.  </p>  <p>  Extensive stakeholder engagement took place throughout the process to take into account industry views on the design of the tax. This included site visits to manufacturing plants, face to face meetings at a variety of levels, and a number of technical consultations concerning specifics of the tax. A channel of communication with industry remains open in relation to technical implementation matters.</p>  <p>  Engagement with the European Commission was established to ensure compatibility of the tax, when implemented, with EU State aid law. Similarly, discussions have taken place on a variety of policy and implementation issues with the UK public authorities, the Treasury and HMRC, as the UK will also introduce a similar tax commencing in April 2018. Again, this channel remains open.</p>  <p>  As well as being engaged with the above, Revenue has carried out the following preparatory steps for the introduction of a Sugar Sweetened Drink (SSD) tax:</p>  <p>  - Engagement with the State Laboratory and Food Safety Authority of Ireland on product classification and labelling issues relating to the identification of products liable to the proposed tax;</p>  <p>  - Development of draft legislative provisions that would be required to support the proposed tax; </p>  <p>  - Development of proposals on Revenue IT infrastructure, payments processing and other tax administration, accounting and collection issues relating to the proposed tax. </p></reply>

That being said, it is recognised that maintenance can assist in mitigating against the effects of less severe flood events and summer flooding. </p>  <p>  The Office of Public Works (OPW) carries out a programme of Arterial Drainage Maintenance to a total of 11,500 km of river channel and approximately 730 km of embankments nationally.  These maintenance works relate to arterial drainage schemes completed by the OPW under the Arterial Drainage Acts 1945 and 1995.  The OPW has a statutory duty to maintain the completed schemes in proper repair and effective condition.  The annual maintenance programme typically involves some clearance of vegetation and removal of silt build-up on an average five-yearly cycle.  Each year, work is carried out to approximately 2,000 km of channel and about 200 structures around the country.  Maintenance of all drainage schemes carried out under earlier Acts, known as Drainage Districts, is the responsibility of the relevant Local Authority. </p>  <p>  In order to explore how state agencies can come together to address maintenance issues, the Shannon Flood Risk State Agency Co-ordination Working Group agreed to carry out some targeted maintenance activity.  During September, works were carried out at the first of a series of locations on the River Shannon to remove silt and vegetation to enhance the conveyance capacity and navigation.</p>  <p>  The current priorities of the OPW are to publish and implement Flood Risk Management Plans to address significant flood risk for 300 communities throughout Ireland and to deliver the capital investment programme of major flood defences that will protect thousands of properties during severe flood events.  The OPW will continue to provide important funding to Local Authorities to deal with localised flooding issues through the Minor Flood Mitigation Works &amp;amp; Coastal Protection Scheme.</p></reply>

The management of Kilkenny Castle engages in a timely and proactive manner with staff in relation to all concerns including Health and Safety issues.  In the last twelve months, management at the Castle has received two formal communications from a Shop Steward and a Safety Representative.  The issues raised ranged from day-to-day operational matters to application of annual leave entitlements for seasonal staff.  Management has responded comprehensively to all of the issues raised to date. </p>  <p>  There is a detailed maintenance plan for both the Castle and the Parkland which ensures the site is presented for our visitors to OPW's high standards.  Toilet facilities for both staff and visitors are considered adequate with reference to staffing and visitor numbers and this is reviewed annually. </p>  <p>  The apartment at the Castle was provided as part of Phase 3 of the Castle restoration project which was completed in May 2000.  No further investment has been made in this area of the Castle since.  The apartment is deemed unsuitable for use on Health and Safety grounds due to its location (on the top floor of the West Tower, accessed via a Medieval spiral staircase with the only emergency evacuation route being over the roof battlements.)</p>  <p>  The safety and security of Kilkenny Castle, its contents and the surrounding parkland is an absolute priority for the OPW and security arrangements are reviewed on an ongoing basis.  Security expenditure to date in 2017 is &euro;65.661.95.</p>  <p>  Staffing requirements at all OPW heritage sites are regularly reviewed with reference to operations and visitor figures as part of our Work Force Planning.  The management and staff structure at Kilkenny Castle is in line with all other OPW National Historic Properties.</p></reply>

Men and women serving prior to the relevant dates were given options to join the scheme.  The original scheme provides pensions for the spouse and/or dependent children of a member or eligible dependent children of a member who dies in service, or after qualifying for pension (or preserved pension).  It does not provide pensions for spouses of marriages occurring after retirement or children resulting from such marriages.  Following discussions with staff interests, a further option was given to all officers in 1984 to join the revised spouses' and children&rsquo;s scheme.  This covers the spouses of post-retirement marriages and all of the member&rsquo;s children.</p>  <p>  The Commission on Public Service Pensions, which examined a range of public service pension issues in its 2000 report, concluded that:</p>  <p>   &lsquo;The spouses&rsquo; and children&rsquo;s contributory pension schemes are key components in the public service pension system. We consider that the former, in particular, have proved to be one of the more important developments in public service pensions policy over the last 30 years.  Through public service spouses&rsquo; and children&rsquo;s schemes, it has been possible to provide for the surviving family members of public servants when they die after retirement or while in public service employment.  As well as meeting an important social need, the schemes have helped ensure a degree of financial security and peace of mind for individual public servants and for their dependants.&rsquo;</p>  <p>  The Pensions Commission stated that it accepted the view that public service spouses&rsquo; and children&rsquo;s schemes are structured on a group insurance basis and that member contribution rates take account of the fact that payment of benefits will not arise in respect of all members. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the Civil Service Spouses' and Children's Contributory Pension Scheme meets the requirements of the Employment Equality Acts, 1998 &ndash; 2015 in relation to all of the grounds of discrimination set out in the legislation, including on grounds of disability.</p>  <p>   </p></reply>

This is a national scheme of humanitarian assistance, targeting aid at those worst affected properties, for which there are no alternative feasible measures. </p>  <p>  The Government decision confirmed that a homeowner had to meet a number of conditions to be eligible for assistance under this scheme, including:</p>  <p>  - That floodwater entered and damaged the building during the relevant dates such as to render it uninhabitable.</p>  <p>  - That the property was the homeowners primary residence at the time of the floods.</p>  <p>  - That the affected property must have a significant probability of the recurrence of the flood depth, duration or frequency on a scale that could cause further serious and similar damage to the home.</p>  <p>  - That the property is not due to or may not benefit from a planned or possible future major, minor or individual flood defence scheme.</p>  <p>  - That the property may not be protected adequately from being flooded in the future at an economically feasible cost through other flood mitigation works including minor works, individual property protection or other possible measures that can be considered at this time.</p>  <p>  - That the homeowner is unable to obtain flood risk insurance.</p>  <p>  The OPW are working with each of the Local Authorities, using their extensive and detailed local knowledge, to identify the homes that flooded during the event, and of those identified which properties may not benefit from a known or possible engineering solution.  These homeowners will be invited to meet with the OPW to discuss the details of the scheme and may be invited to formally apply for the scheme.  It is expected that contact will begin with the identified homeowners in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  In addition to the identification process underway with the local authorities, homeowners also had the opportunity to express an interest directly with the OPW, before 28 July 2017, to be considered under the Scheme.  Some 67 expressions of interest were received from homeowners in 19 different local authority areas.  The details of these properties has been shared with the local authorities for their consideration in the stage 1 desktop assessment.</p>  <p>  The homeowner referred to by the Deputy did not express an interest in the Scheme directly with the OPW.  The local authority have identified a property in the area that flooded during the relevant dates but they are currently unable to confirm if it is the same property referred to by the Deputy. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-10-10a.294.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017101000068#WRE03200"><p>As a consequence of the financial crisis, there was a need to enact a number of measures to reduce public expenditure so as to stabilise the country&rsquo;s public finances. A previous Government reduced the salaries and allowances payable to all new entrants to public service recruitment grades by 10% with effect from 1 January 2011. This decision also required that such new entrants would start on the first point of the applicable salary scale, which in the case of teachers had the effect of reducing their starting pay by a further 4-5%. Later in 2011, the government placed a cap on the overall level of qualification allowances that could be earned by teachers.  </p>  <p>  Subsequently in 2012, following the public service-wide review of allowances, the Government withdrew qualification allowances for new teachers altogether. However, the Government partially compensated for this by deciding that new entrant teachers would henceforth commence on a new salary scale which had a starting point higher than the starting point of the old scale. </p>  <p>  The public service agreements have allowed a programme of pay restoration for public servants to start. I have used this to negotiate substantial improvements in pay for new teachers. The agreements have, to date, restored an estimated 75% of the difference in pay for more recently recruited teachers and deliver full equality at later points in the sale. This is substantial progress and strikes an equitable balance with other claims for funding on my Department, particularly needs such as enhanced service for children with special educational needs, for disadvantaged schools, for growing schools, for Higher Education and apprenticeships. </p>  <p>  As a result of these changes and taking into account the proposed pay measures under the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020, the starting salary of a new teacher from 1 January 2018 will be &euro;35,958 and from 1 October 2020 onwards will be &euro;37,692. If full equalisation was achieved the starting salary for a post-primary teacher from 1 October 2020 would be &euro;43,879 and for a primary teacher would be &euro;41,511.</p>  <p>  Further to this, newly recruited teachers benefit from the terms of the Ward Circular which reduced the qualifying period from a CID and the removal of the career break and secondment categories of objective grounds which had previously prevented some teachers from gaining CIDs. In addition to earlier permanency, other measures of benefit to newly recruited teachers included a revised sequence for the filling of posts to enable fixed-term and part time teachers to gain permanent, full-time jobs more quickly and easier than before. </p>  <p>  It must be borne in mind that the pay reduction for post-2011 entrants to the public service applied to all public servants and not just teachers, and that any restoration of these measures in respect of teachers would be expected to be applied elsewhere across the public service. While I am not in a position to provide an estimate of the total cost of restoring all post-1 January 2011 entrants in all of the public service to the pre-2011 pay scale arrangements, I can say that in the case of education and training sector employees, including teachers, the estimated current full year cost (including new entrants recruited this September) would be in the order of &euro;130 million. Clearly, the cost across the entire public service would be substantially higher. </p>  <p>  However there are other types of equality that we must also bear in mind, for example equality between public servant and people who work elsewhere or don&rsquo;t work at all. It would not be equal or fair for us to do unaffordable deals with particular groups of public servants that mean we do not have the money left in the public purse to provide increases in social welfare payments for vulnerable groups, tax reductions for people at work, or investments in improvements in public services that people rely on. </p>  <p>  Any further negotiation on new entrant pay is a cross sectoral issue, not just an issue for the education sector. The Government also supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants. </p>  <p>  Accordingly, the recently concluded draft Public Service Agreement 2018-2020 includes a provision in relation to new entrants which states that an examination of the remaining salary scale issues in respect of post January 2011 recruits at entry grades covered by parties to the Agreement will be undertaken within 12 months of the commencement of the Agreement. </p></reply>

This is a substantial allocation of hours for a school of this size. </p>  <p>  Whereas the profiled allocation had indicated a need of 67.50 hours for this school, based on its school profile and size, and relative to the profiled needs of all other schools, the school was allocated 68.90 hours, which was equivalent to the allocation the school received in 2016/17. </p>  <p>  There has therefore been no reduction to the allocation of special educational needs teaching support for this school.</p>  <p>  It is acknowledged and accepted that schools will have some additional pupils with special educational needs enrolling to their school subsequent to the profiles having been developed. </p>  <p>  However, for the most part these will be balanced by the fact that some students who had additional teaching needs in the previous year will have left the school. The baseline is also designed to ensure that schools have some capacity to provide additional support to pupils. This school also has some additional capacity in the retained element of its allocation which is above that indicated by the school profile.  </p>  <p>  Under the new allocation model schools are frontloaded with resources, based on each school&rsquo;s profile, to provide supports immediately to those pupils who need it without delay. This will reduce the administrative burden on schools as schools will no longer have to complete an application process annually and apply for newly enrolled pupils who require resource hours. Children who need support can have that support provided immediately rather than having to wait for a diagnosis.</p>  <p>  Schools will therefore no longer have to make applications, for newly enrolled pupils for whom resource teaching hours may have been provided under the old model, or for pupils who have received a new diagnosis, as schools will now receive a single allocation for all of their special education teaching needs, based on their school size and profile.   </p>  <p>  The new allocations to schools include provision to support all pupils in the schools, including where a child receives a diagnosis after the allocation is received by a school, or where there are newly enrolling pupils to the school. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that this is a brand new model of allocation and is not comparable to the previous model which had been in place. </p>  <p>  By using a broad range of attainment and socio-economic criteria, it is expected that generally, a school&rsquo;s profile will remain relatively constant from year to year.  Each year, some students with additional teaching needs will leave and others will enrol, broadly balancing the school profile. Resources allocated under this model will not normally be adjusted between allocations. </p>  <p>  A process has also been put in place to address circumstances where the school profile significantly changed following the allocation process due to the fact that the school had rapidly developing status where the net enrolment numbers significantly increased.</p>  <p>  The criteria for qualification for mainstream school developing school posts are set out in DES Circular 17/2017 (Primary School Staffing Schedule) and DES 10,11,12/2017 (Post Primary School Staffing Schedule).</p>  <p>  Schools who have qualified of additional mainstream developing school posts on the basis of developing growth in accordance with these criteria will also qualify for additional Special Education Teaching Allocations to take account of this developing status.</p>  <p>  My Department has issued guidelines for schools to support them in the management of their resources. These guidelines are available on my Departments website.</p>  <p>  Schools are encouraged to take guidelines on board in the planning process for the 2017/18 school year. In order to determine the levels of need within each school, it will be important for schools to have properly identified students with additional learning needs and have developed plans for each student indicating how the supports available will be used. </p>  <p>  In this context, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) will be available to support schools where these plans have been developed and implemented but the school considers that further support may be required. This support may involve Continuing Professional Development or further training for school staff, advice in relation to the support plan that is in place, and possibly a review process once schools can clearly demonstrate that exceptional circumstances have arisen in the school.</p>  <p>  The NCSE will shortly be advising how schools can seek a review of the utilisation of their allocations in circumstances where a school considers that very exceptional circumstances have arisen subsequent to the development of the profile.</p></reply>

Having teachers with relevant and recent teaching experience and expertise is a key requirement for the role. It is a condition therefore that the maximum length of time that a teacher may be on secondment is five years, following which they return to their teaching roles in their schools. In this way, their expertise and knowledge is not lost to the system. Each ESC has a management committee and staff which ensures continuity at a local level. </p>  <p>  Section 37 of the Education Act 1998 provides the legislative basis for the establishment and regulation of Education Centres.  Section 37(6) of the Act makes provision to make regulations relating to a number of matters in ESC's such as the appointment of management committees, funding, staffing, provision of information to the DES &amp;amp; other operational matters. </p>  <p>  Regulations for the appointment of Directors to Education Centres have now been introduced under Section 37 (6).

A reply will issue shortly to the group in relation to this correspondence.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, in order to plan for school provision and analyse the relevant demographic data, my Department divides the country into 314 school planning areas. My Department uses a Geographical Information System (GIS) to identify where the pressure for school places across the country will arise. The GIS uses data from a range of sources, including the Central Statistics Office, Ordnance Survey Ireland, the Department of Social Protection and my Department's own databases. With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises at primary and post primary level to determine where additional school accommodation is needed.</p>  <p>  Where demographic data indicates that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may, depending on the circumstances, be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following:</p>  <p>  - Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools,</p>  <p>  - Extending the capacity of a school or schools,</p>  <p>  - Provision of a new school or schools.</p>  <p>  With regard to demand for particular models of school provision, it should be noted that the patronage process for new schools is a separate process which has been in place since 2011.  This process is run after it has been decided that a new school is required.  Parental preferences are central to this process and prospective patrons are required to provide evidence of demand for their particular school model and medium of instruction. Therefore, where, based on demographics, it might be indicated that a new school is required, it cannot be guaranteed that this would be a school under a particular type of patronage as this will be dependent to a large degree on parental preferences in the area at the time of a patronage process. </p>  <p>  As with other school planning areas nationwide, the demographic data for these school planning areas is being kept under ongoing review by my Department to take account of updated child benefit data and updated enrolment data.  It is anticipated that decisions based on these exercises will be announced later in 2017.</p></reply>

It can help to consolidate work already covered during class time and help pupils to prepare for forthcoming class work.  It can also promote independent learning. In addition, it plays an important role in promoting home school links.  The national and international research literature indicates that informal at-home involvement such as parents helping with homework and discussing school with their children can contribute to children's achievement. </p>  <p>  My Department does not issue any guidelines relating to homework being given in schools.  It is a matter for each school, at local level, to arrive at its own homework policy.

This involves direct support in the event of a critical incident, access to national and regional support and development work to build school capacity to support students, access to a NEPS psychologist for responses to queries arising, and access to individual pupil casework via a NEPS psychologist or through the Scheme for the Commissioning of Psychological Assessments (SCPA).  Every child therefore has access to educational psychological assessment services either through the NEPS or SCPA psychologist.</p>  <p>  NEPS does not maintain waiting lists but, in common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service.  The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring.  Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximize positive outcomes for these pupils.  NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties.  Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process.  Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. </p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.  It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention. </p>  <p>  I would advise if there are concerns in relation to the educational development of any student that these should be raised, in the first instance, with the Principal of the school he/she is attending, with a view to the Principal discussing the situation with the assigned NEPS psychologist or local NEPS office. </p></reply>

All post-primary schools and some special schools are now included in the 100Mbps programme.</p>  <p>  Under the current programme the Department continually reviews the availability of services and upgrades schools where the opportunity arises, in line with contractual and budgetary requirements.  A recent drawdown from the Framework of Providers of Broadband Services saw some 1,100 primary schools awarded download speeds of 30Mbps or greater (the baseline download speed required under the National Broadband Plan). Some 900 of those schools have now been connected with the balance to be in place by the end of 2017.</p>  <p>  Significant improvement has been made in recent years with the number of primary schools on broadband speeds of greater than 30mbs having increased from less than 100 in 2012 to over 1000 by the end of 2017.  In Wicklow in 2012, no primary school had access to broadband speeds of 30mbs or greater, now some 30 primary schools in Wicklow have access to broadband speeds of 30mbs or greater.</p>  <p>  The policy of this Department is to offer the best quality connectivity to all schools in line with the technical solutions available in the market and financial constraints.  Broadband capacity can vary due to geographical location and local infrastructure, and thus impact on the service that can be provided. </p>  <p>  The need to improve broadband connectivity to primary schools is recognised in the Digital Strategy for Schools 2015-2020, and as noted access to high speed broadband is one of the indicators identified in the Digital Strategy Action Plan.  An interdepartmental working group has been established to determine how best to address broadband connectivity to primary schools in collaboration with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, in the context of the National Broadband Plan and the Intervention Strategy, and proposed industry provision.</p>  <p>  In the case of the school referred to be the Deputy, the Schools Broadband Service Desk and the current Service Provider have reviewed the service provided, and they advise that the school is on the best broadband solution available at present.  The school is included in the National Broadband Plan Intervention area (NBP).  As you will be aware, the National Broadband Plan is a government sponsored programme to deliver high speed broadband to homes and businesses across Ireland.</p></reply>

My Department invests over &euro;300m annually in providing additional resources specifically to support students with autism in schools enabling:</p>  <p>  - 61% of students to attend mainstream schools</p>  <p>  - 26% to attend special classes in mainstream primary and post-primary schools, and</p>  <p>  - 13% to attend special schools.</p>  <p>  Some students, although academically able to access the curriculum in mainstream, may find it too difficult to manage full-time placement there.  This can be due to significant difficulties in areas such as behaviour or sensory needs which have not been ameliorated, even with appropriate intervention, in mainstream.  Enrolment in an ASD special class can be considered for these students where it has been demonstrated that he/she is unable to learn effectively in a mainstream class for most or all of the school day even with appropriate supports. </p>  <p>  Others students with ASD may have such complex needs that they are best placed in a special school.</p>  <p>  There are 37 Special Schools in Dublin city and county. Special Schools funded by my Department are intended to cater for children and young persons with special educational needs from 4 years until the end of the school year in which they reach their 18th year. </p>  <p>  Special Schools are staffed in accordance with arrangements set out in my Department's Circular 0042/2011, which provides for enhanced pupil teacher ratios for pupils attending Special Schools ranging from 6-1, to 12-1, on the basis of disability categorisation of pupils attending the school.</p>  <p>  Many special schools now enrol students from disability categories other than from those provided for by their school designations.</p>  <p>  Since 2012 the NCSE has increased the number of special classes by over 100% from 628 in 2012 to 1,300 across the country now, of which 1,042 are Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) special classes. Of these there are 177 classes in Dublin City and County, including 18 Early Intervention Classes for children who are not yet school going age, 123 primary school classes and 36 at post primary level in mainstream schools.  17 primary and 3 post-primary ASD classes are in the area referred to by the Deputy.</p>  <p>  The NCSE, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), in consultation with the relevant education partners, is responsible for the establishment of special school and class placements in various geographical areas where there is an identified need.</p>  <p>  The NCSE, in looking to open special classes, must take into account the present and future potential need for such classes, taking particular account of the educational needs of the children concerned.  The NCSE will also take account of location and sustainability in looking to establish special classes in certain areas.  </p>  <p>  Parents/guardians of children with special needs who may need advice or are experiencing difficulties in locating a school placement should contact their local Special Educational Needs Organiser (SENO) as soon as possible for information on available places.  The local SENO contact details are available on www.ncse.ie.</p>  <p>  In the case of all new schools, it is general practice to include a Special Needs Unit (SNU) in the accommodation brief for new school buildings, unless local circumstances indicate that it will not be required.  Typically, a two classroom SNU is provided in new primary schools and a two or four classroom unit is provided in new post primary schools.</p>  <p>  In the case of existing schools, where a school is not in a position to accommodate a special class within its existing accommodation, it is open to the school to submit an application to the Department for capital funding to (i) re-configure existing spaces within the school building to accommodate the class or (ii) to construct additional accommodation.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to work with the NCSE to ensure that any required additional special school placements will be available for the forthcoming school years. </p></reply>

Admittance to CAMHS is a short term intervention for a number of weeks or months.  CAMHS units also treat day patients, who may attend CAMHS units on a daily basis for a period of time. </p>  <p>  The aim of admission of a child/young adult to a CAMHS adolescent inpatient unit is to provide accurate assessment of those with the most severe disorders, implement specific and audited treatment programmes, and to achieve the earliest possible discharge of the young person back to their family and ongoing care of the Community team. </p>  <p>  Educational support is provided by my Department to young people while in-patient in a number of CAMHS units, who then return to the school in which they are already enrolled following discharge from CAMHS. </p>  <p>  Educational provision at a hospital or medical facility, including CAMHS Units, is a short term intervention designed to provide for some continuity of education during the young person's stay. CAMHs units do not have fulltime enrolments, but have a transient student population who avail of education, subject to their medical fitness to participate in education, during their stay and for periods of time during the day. </p>  <p>  Not all young people attending CAMHS are medically fit to avail of education during all of their stay. For a significant period of their day, or for a time of their stay, will also be spent receiving medical and therapeutic treatments. The situation is therefore not anomalous to that of a special school which has full time enrolments for educational purposes for the entire school day. </p>  <p>  Educational provision in CAMHS units was reviewed in 2014 and my Department's policy is to provide teaching provision on the basis of a pupil teacher ratio of 6:1, which is currently provided in special schools and special classes for severe emotional disturbance. In medical facilities which do not have educational provision or where young people attend CAMHS Units as day patients, my Department's Home Tuition Scheme provides for compensatory teaching support to account for time missed from school. </p>  <p>  My Department has no plans to further review the education provision provided to CAMHS Units at this time.</p></reply>

Responsibility for the management of behaviour in schools is a matter for individual schools.</p><p>The Board of Management of each school is responsible for the care and safety of all of the pupils in their school and is required to prepare a code of behaviour in accordance with Section 23 of the Education (Welfare) Act 2000. </p><p>This code of behaviour shall specify the procedure to be followed before a student may be suspended or expelled from the school.  This code of behaviour should be available to all parents of students registered in the school.</p><p>Any proposal to exclude a student, through permanent exclusion, or suspension, is a serious measure and warranted only by very serious misbehaviour by any student.  The Educational Welfare Officer (EWO) must be notified in writing of the Board of Management's intention to expel any student and must also provide their reasons for such action.  In accordance with the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000 no student shall be expelled from a school before the passing of 20 school days following the receipt of a written notification by an EWO.  The EWO shall make reasonable efforts to meet with the principal , the student and his/her parents  during this 20 day period.</p><p>Following from any permanent exclusion, it is open to a parent/guardian, or in the case of a student who has reached the age of 18 years, the student to take an appeal under section 29 of the Education Act, 1998.  Section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 provides for an appeal by a parent or guardian to the Secretary General of my Department or, in the case of an Education and Training Board (ETB) school, to the ETB in the first instance, where a Board of Management of a school, or a person acting on behalf of the Board, refuses to enrol a student in a school, expels a student, or suspends a student for 20 or more days in any school year. </p><p>My Department has no authority to compel a school to admit a student, except in the case of an appeal under section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 being upheld. </p><p>Application forms for taking a section 29 appeal are available on my Department's website at the following link :</p><p><i></i>,</p><p>or by contacting Section 29 Administration Unit, Friars Mill Road, Mullingar, Co. Westmeath, phone 0761 108588.</p><p>The policy of my Department is to ensure that all children with special educational needs can be provided with an education appropriate to their needs.</p><p>Where possible, provision is made for the inclusive education of children with special educational needs. My Department's policy is that students with special educational needs should be included where possible and appropriate in mainstream placements with additional supports provided. </p><p>In circumstances where children with special educational need require more specialised interventions, special school or special class places are provided for.</p><p>Funding for special education provision in 2017 will amount to some &euro;1.68 billion, which is equivalent to approximately 19% of the gross overall current allocation for education and training and represents an increase in spending in this area of 12% over the last two years.</p><p>This year, 13,990 Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) are available for allocation to primary and post primary schools to the end of December, which is an increase of 32% in the number of posts available since 2011. </p><p>SNA Circular 0030/2014 details the circumstances in which SNA support will be provided for behaviour related care needs. SNA support will only be provided for behaviour related care needs where there is a clear diagnosis of Emotional Behavioural Disturbance/Severe Emotional Behavioural Disturbance, or a behavioural disorder in conjunction with another disability, and also where it is clear that behavioural management strategies have not been successful to date, and where it is demonstrated how access to SNA support can assist the student. </p><p>There are currently over 13,000 special educational needs teacher posts in mainstream primary and post primary schools which includes an additional 900 teaching posts provided to support the introduction of the new model for allocating Special Education Teaching Resources to mainstream primary and post primary schools from September 2017.  </p><p>In addition, 169 new Special Classes have been opened for the 2016/17 school year, which means there are now over 1,300 special classes in place, compared to 548 special classes in 2011. 1,042 special classes cater for students diagnosed with ASD (including 103 Early Intervention ASD special classes) and 11 cater specifically for students diagnosed with severe emotional behavioural disorders.</p><p>125 special schools also provide specialist education for those students with complex special educational needs, including students diagnosed with severe behavioural disorders.</p><p>Schools may seek advice from their local National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) psychologist, from the NCSE&rsquo;s Support Service through the Special Educational Needs Organiser (SENO), or the National Behavioural Support Service, as to how children with behavioural needs can best be supported in school.</p><p>The Special Education Support Service (SESS) now also part of NCSE&rsquo;s Support Service, provides continuing professional development (CPD) for teachers working with students with special educational needs, including training for teachers in the area of challenging behaviour and Autism. </p><p>Many schools withdraw students occasionally from the main classroom for short periods of time in order to provide support to them, or to manage student behaviour, if a student is exhibiting behaviours which may be a danger to themselves or others.</p><p>In some circumstances, a student who is exhibiting extreme behaviours may be brought to another room to ensure the safety of other students and until they are calm again.  Schools should supervise and support students who leave the classroom until they have recovered and are able to re-engage in the classroom.</p><p>Where used, it will normally form part of a school&rsquo;s response to behaviour and part of student support structures, procedures and practices. </p><p>The withdrawal of a student from the classroom in order to deal individually with the student does not require the authorisation of my Department.  It is a matter for the school authorities, the student and the parents or guardians of the student concerned. </p><p>Some schools also have multi-sensory rooms that provide a variety of sensory stimuli and which are designed to provide sensory stimulation for students with special educational needs, in spaces which are designed to encourage positive actions and responses for students with sensory impairment.  They can also be used for students to use interactive equipment towards specific educational aims.</p><p>Published guidelines which are available to schools include:</p><p>- Supporting Students with Behavioural, Emotional, and Social difficulties, which is available on the Department's website <i>www.education.ie</i>,</p><p>- the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) guidelines for schools on Developing a Code of Behaviour and the National Educational Psychological Services document Behavioural Emotional and Social Difficulties - a Continuum of Support: Guidelines for Teachers.</p><p>The NCSE has published updated policy advice on the Educational Provision for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders. In developing this policy advice, the NCSE consulted widely with parents, professionals and other stakeholders and interested parties while also conducting research. </p><p>The report includes 11 key Recommendations which focus on improvements which might be considered to the range of provisions which are currently available for children with Autism in schools. The report includes recommendations in relation to Crisis Situations. The report is available on the NCSE website <i>www.ncse.ie</i>.</p><p>My Department has convened an Implementation Group with representatives of the NCSE, NEPS, the Inspectorate and external representatives to ensure that the Report&rsquo;s recommendations are fully and appropriately considered and that a timetable for implementation is prepared. The work of the Implementation Group is ongoing.</p><p>The NCSE are currently undertaking a Comprehensive Assessment of the SNA Scheme, which will examine the circumstances in which SNA support will be provided for behaviour related care needs. </p><p>In response to a progress report from the NCSE on the comprehensive assessment, I requested the NCSE to establish a working group, comprising relevant stakeholders, to assist in proposing a better model for providing care supports so as to provide better outcomes for students with special educational needs who have additional care needs. This Working Group has commenced its work and it will run in tandem with the completion of the overall Comprehensive Review of the SNA Scheme. It is intended that the reports of the Working Group and of the Review will be completed in Spring 2018. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-10-10a.410.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017101000070#WRG01100"><p>DES Circular 0013/2017 for primary schools and 0014/2017 for post primary schools which were published on 7th March 2017, set out the details of the new model for allocating special education teachers to schools, introduced in all mainstream primary and post primary school in September 2017.</p>  <p>  The revised allocation model replaces the generalised allocation process at primary and post primary school level for learning support and high incidence special educational needs, and the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) allocation process which provided additional resource teaching supports to schools, to support pupils assessed as having Low Incidence disabilities.</p>  <p>  The new model provides a single allocation to schools based on the profile. Schools are frontloaded with resources to provide additional teaching support to all pupils who need such support. </p>  <p>  The Circulars note that for the introduction of the new allocation model, from September 2017, the NCSE &lsquo;Low Incidence&rsquo; allocations which had been made for each school during the preceding 2016/17 school year, have been used to establish the complex needs component of the new model for each school.</p>  <p>  This means that on the introduction of the new allocation model and until allocations are reviewed, no school will receive an allocation, for the support of pupils with complex needs, which is less than the allocation they had received to support pupils with Low Incidence special educational needs during the 2016/17 school year.</p>  <p>  This also means that no allocation for pupils made by the NCSE will be removed from schools as long as that pupil remains in the school. </p>  <p>  Whereas schools will have greater discretion as to how they can distribute resources under the new model, based on the individual needs of pupils, no reduction in allocations have been made to schools in respect of any pupils who were previously in receipt of a Low Incidence special needs allocation in that school.</p>  <p>  A model for the identification of pupils with complex needs in future is being finalised by the NCSE, in consultation with the Health Service Executive and National Educational Psychological Services (NEPS) </p>  <p>  This model will take account of the decision making process and qualification criteria for the selection of children for access to HSE Children Disability Network Teams. </p>  <p>  For the next re profiling of the model, the Complex Needs category will be the existing low incidence allocations for schools, less any leavers included in this category, plus additional allocations for any new complex needs category pupils, over the period of time since the first school profiles were developed, to the point of the next re-profiling of the model. </p>  <p>  Under the new allocation model schools are frontloaded with resources, based on each school&rsquo;s profile, to provide supports immediately to those pupils who need it without delay.  This will reduce the administrative burden on schools as schools will no longer have to complete an application process annually and apply for newly enrolled pupils who require resource hours. Children who need support can have that support provided immediately rather than having to wait for a diagnosis.</p>  <p>  My Department has issued guidelines for schools to support them in the management of their SEN teaching resources.  These guidelines are available on my Departments website.</p>  <p>  Schools are encouraged to take guidelines on board in the planning process for the 2017/18 school year. In order to determine the levels of need within each school, it will be important for schools to have properly identified students with additional learning needs and have developed plans for each student indicating how the supports available will be used.</p>  <p>  Responsibility for the management of behaviour in schools is a matter for individual schools.  The Board of Management of each school is responsible for the care and safety of all of the pupils in their school and is required to prepare a code of behaviour in accordance with Section 23 of the Education (Welfare) Act 2000. </p>  <p>  This code of behaviour shall specify the procedure to be followed before a student may be suspended or expelled from the school.  This code of behaviour should be available to all parents of pupils registered in the school.</p>  <p>  The policy of my Department is to ensure that all children with special educational needs can be provided with an education appropriate to their needs.</p>  <p>  Where possible, provision is made for the inclusive education of children with special educational needs. Department policy is that students with special educational needs should be included where possible and appropriate in mainstream placements with additional supports provided. </p>  <p>  In circumstances where children with special educational need require more specialised interventions, special school or special class places are provided for.</p>  <p>  Funding for special education provision in 2017 will amount to some &euro;1.68 billion, which is equivalent to approximately 19% of the gross overall current allocation for education and training and represents an increase in spending in this area of 12% over the last two years.</p>  <p>  There are currently over 13,000 special educational Needs teacher posts in mainstream primary and post primary schools with an additional 900 teaching posts provided to support the introduction of the new model for allocating Special Education Teaching Resources to mainstream primary and post primary schools from September 2017.  </p>  <p>  This year, 13,990 Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) are available for allocation to primary and post primary schools to the end of the 2016/17 school year, which is an increase of 32% in the number of posts available since 2011.  SNA Circular 0030/2014 details the circumstances in which SNA support will be provided for behaviour related care needs.

The necessary actions will include engagement with the HEA in order to ensure that the supply of teachers meets demand and there is the correct balance of teachers in each of the various subject areas at post primary level, as well as measures to address data requirements, particularly at post primary level.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that, in conjunction with the publication of the report, I announced a number of measures to increase the pool of teachers available to schools, in particular to fill short term vacancies. With regard to these measures, my Department informed all teachers retiring in 2017 that in order to remain eligible for employment in a state funded teaching post for a period of more than five consecutive days or to supervise the State examinations, a teacher must maintain his/her registration with the Teaching Council. In that regard, the Teaching Council also reminds teachers, through the renewal of registration process and where a teacher indicates that he or she is considering leaving the register, that if they wish to continue to work as a teacher following retirement in substitute and other positions they should maintain registration. </p>  <p>  The Deputy should note also that my Department has increased the limits for employment while on career break at post primary level to a maximum of 300 hours in a school year and at primary level to a maximum of 90 days in a school year. The matter of the employment of B Ed and PME students in limited circumstances on a short term basis is still under consideration in my Department.</p>  <p>  It should also be noted that one of the main aims of the Policy on Gaeltacht Education 2017-2022 is to improve the quality of teaching through Irish. The identified actions in the Policy to achieve this aim includes increasing the number of places available on the existing Irish medium post primary Initial Teacher Education programme and the granting of two additional post to the Post-graduate Masters in Education in NUI Galway to increase teacher supply at post-primary level and strengthen Irish-language proficiency of newly qualified teachers across a range of subjects. It is anticipated that these action should also increase the supply of Irish language teachers.</p></reply>

Accordingly, whereas SNA support will be provided to post primary schools when required, only pupils with chronic and serious care needs will normally be allocated SNA support in post primary schools. </p><p>In considering applications for SNA support from post primary schools, the NCSE will take into account the importance of the requirement to allocate necessary care supports with the right of a child to acquire personal independence skills.</p><p>The level of SNA support allocated to all schools can change from year to year, as students with care needs leave the school, as new students with care needs enrol, or as students develop more independent living skills as they get older and their care needs diminish over time. </p><p>All schools have been advised of their allocations for SNA support for the 2017/18 school year.

Schools may also appeal a decision, where the school considers that the NCSE, in applying DES policy, has not allocated the appropriate level of SNA supports to the school to meet the special educational and/or care needs of the children concerned</p><p>All schools have the contact details of their local SENO and parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on <i>www.ncse.ie</i>.</p></reply>

A previous Government reduced the salaries and allowances payable to all new entrants to public service recruitment grades by 10% with effect from 1 January 2011. This decision also required that such new entrants would start on the first point of the applicable salary scale, which in the case of teachers had the effect of reducing their starting pay by a further 4-5%. Later in 2011, the government placed a cap on the overall level of qualification allowances that could be earned by teachers.  </p>  <p>  Subsequently in 2012, following the public service-wide review of allowances, the Government withdrew qualification allowances for new teachers altogether. However, the Government partially compensated for this by deciding that new entrant teachers would henceforth commence on a new salary scale which had a starting point higher than the starting point of the old scale. </p>  <p>  The public service agreements have allowed a programme of pay restoration for public servants to start. I have used this to negotiate substantial improvements in pay for new teachers. The agreements have, to date, restored an estimated 75% of the difference in pay for more recently recruited teachers and deliver full equality at later points in the sale. This is substantial progress and strikes an equitable balance with other claims for funding on my Department, particularly needs such as enhanced service for children with special educational needs, for disadvantaged schools, for growing schools, for Higher Education and apprenticeships. </p>  <p>  As a result of these changes and taking into account the proposed pay measures under the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020, the starting salary of a new teacher from 1 January 2018 will be &euro;35,958 and from 1 October 2020 onwards will be &euro;37,692. If full equalisation was achieved the starting salary for a post-primary teacher from 1 October 2020 would be &euro;43,879 and for a primary teacher would be &euro;41,511.</p>  <p>  Further to this, newly recruited teachers benefit from the terms of the Ward Circular which reduced the qualifying period from a CID and the removal of the career break and secondment categories of objective grounds which had previously prevented some teachers from gaining CIDs. In addition to earlier permanency, other measures of benefit to newly recruited teachers included a revised sequence for the filling of posts to enable fixed-term and part time teachers to gain permanent, full-time jobs more quickly and easier than before. </p>  <p>  It must be borne in mind that the pay reduction for post-2011 entrants to the public service applied to all public servants and not just teachers, and that any restoration of these measures in respect of teachers would be expected to be applied elsewhere across the public service. While I am not in a position to provide an estimate of the total cost of restoring all post-1 January 2011 entrants in all of the public service to the pre-2011 pay scale arrangements, I can say that in the case of education and training sector employees, including teachers, the estimated current full year cost (including new entrants recruited this September) would be in the order of &euro;130 million. Clearly, the cost across the entire public service would be substantially higher. </p>  <p>  However there are other types of equality that we must also bear in mind, for example equality between public servant and people who work elsewhere or don&rsquo;t work at all. It would not be equal or fair for us to do unaffordable deals with particular groups of public servants that mean we do not have the money left in the public purse to provide increases in social welfare payments for vulnerable groups, tax reductions for people at work, or investments in improvements in public services that people rely on. </p>  <p>  Any further negotiation on new entrant pay is a cross sectoral issue, not just an issue for the education sector. The Government also supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants. </p>  <p>  Accordingly, the recently concluded draft Public Service Agreement 2018-2020 includes a provision in relation to new entrants which states that an examination of the remaining salary scale issues in respect of post January 2011 recruits at entry grades covered by parties to the Agreement will be undertaken within 12 months of the commencement of the Agreement. </p></reply>

NEPS assists schools to identify needs, and appropriate interventions, to review the efficacy of these interventions and to adjust approaches used for these children, through the use of a student support planning process.  </p>  <p>  The provision of direct treatment or therapies to children does not lie within the remit of my Department, to teachers or NEPS psychologist, per se, but in fact to the range of therapeutic services provided by the H.S.E..  It is to my colleague, the Minister for Health, therefore that I would advise that the Deputy&rsquo;s question be directed in this regard.</p></reply>

It is administered by Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI).  ACELS has been closed for new applications since January 2014 and it continues to operate on a voluntary, contractual basis for existing members.  </p><p>The Deputy may be aware that a series of reforms to the student immigration system for international education have been implemented by the Department of Justice and Equality in association with my Department, in line with the Government decision of 19<sup>th</sup>May 2015.  The key reforms include the restriction of the list of education programmes considered to justify the granting of permission to students to live and work in Ireland (known as the Interim List of Eligible Programmes &ndash; the ILEP).</p><p>As part of this process all providers of English language training wishing to recruit non-EEA students are now required to apply to the Department of Justice and Equality for inclusion on the ILEP.  Further details on the ILEP criteria and application process are available on the website of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) at: .</p><p>It is important to note that the holding of ACELS recognition is not a pre-requisite for inclusion on the ILEP.  English language schools without ACELS recognition are eligible to apply for inclusion on the ILEP.  The first full iteration of the ILEP was published by the Department of Justice and Equality on 20th January 2016 and the ILEP is updated at regular intervals by that Department.  </p><p>The ILEP is an interim measure until the introduction of the International Education Mark (IEM) for the provision of education to international learners, which is a core component of Government policy for the international education sector.  The legislative amendments necessary to facilitate the introduction of the IEM are being progressed by my Department.  </p></reply>

The baseline is also designed to ensure that schools have some capacity to provide additional support to pupils. This school also has some additional capacity in the retained element of its allocation to absorb additional pupil movement.</p>  <p>  Schools will therefore no longer have to make applications, for newly enrolled pupils for whom resource teaching hours may have been provided under the old model, or for pupils who have received a new diagnosis, as schools will now receive a single allocation for all of their special education teaching needs, based on their school size and profile.   </p>  <p>  It should be noted that this is a brand new model of allocation and is not comparable to the previous model which had been in place. </p>  <p>  By using a broad range of attainment and socio-economic criteria, it is expected that generally, a school&rsquo;s profile will remain relatively constant from year to year.  Each year, some students with additional teaching needs will leave and others will enrol, broadly balancing the school profile. Resources allocated under this model will not normally be adjusted between allocations. </p>  <p>  A process has also been put in place to address circumstances where the school profile significantly changed following the allocation process due to the fact that the school had rapidly developing status where the net enrolment numbers significantly increased.</p>  <p>  This process also takes into account the position for new schools who may be rapidly expanding.</p>  <p>  The criteria for qualification for mainstream school developing school posts are set out in DES Circular 17/2017 (Primary School Staffing Schedule) and DES 10,11,12/2017 (Post Primary School Staffing Schedule).</p>  <p>  Schools who have qualified for additional mainstream developing school posts on the basis of developing growth in accordance with these criteria will also qualify for additional Special Education Teaching Allocations to take account of this developing status.</p>  <p>  My Department has also issued guidelines for schools to support them in the management of their resources. These guidelines are available on my Departments website.</p>  <p>  Schools are encouraged to take guidelines on board in the planning process for the 2017/18 school year. In order to determine the levels of need within each school, it will be important for schools to have properly identified students with additional learning needs and have developed plans for each student indicating how the supports available will be used. </p>  <p>  In this context, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) will be available to support schools where these plans have been developed and implemented but the school considers that further support may be required. This support may involve Continuing Professional Development or further training for school staff, advice in relation to the support plan that is in place, and possibly a review process once schools can clearly demonstrate that exceptional circumstances have arisen in the school.</p>  <p>  The NCSE will shortly be advising how schools can seek a review of the utilisation of their allocations in circumstances where a school considers that very exceptional circumstances have arisen subsequent to the development of the profile.  </p>  <p>  The exceptional circumstances cited by this school can be considered as part of this review process.</p>  <p>  Finally, in relation to the provision of a special class in the school, I wish to advise that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), in consultation with the relevant education partners, is responsible for the establishment of special classes in various geographical areas where there is an identified need.</p>  <p>  The NCSE continues to establish additional special classes to support children with Special Educational Needs, including Autism as required.  </p>  <p>  The NCSE, in looking to open special classes, must take into account the present and future potential need for such classes, taking particular account of the educational needs of the children concerned. The NCSE will also take account of location and sustainability in looking to establish special classes in certain areas.  </p>  <p>  The NCSE will liaise with the school referred to by the Deputy to establish whether there is a need to open a special class for pupils with Autism in this school, prior to the moving of the school to its new temporary location, and taking account of current special class placement availability in the local area.</p></reply>

The criteria for enrolment in a Special Class for pupils with Specific Speech and Language Disorder (SSLD) is set out in my Department's Circular 0038/2007.</p><p>Students with SSLD have access to speech and language therapy services either through the speech and language therapy services provided by the Health Service Executive (HSE), in a special SSLD class setting or through the HSE primary care service.  The provision of health supports, including Speech and Language Therapy services, is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive.</p><p>A full-time teacher is assigned to each class, and classes operate with a reduced pupil-teacher ratio of 7:1.  A minimum number of five eligible pupils is required for a school to retain a SSLD class.  Eligible pupils may spend up to two years in such classes. </p><p>The NCSE continues to monitor and review the requirement for special class places in particular areas and has capacity to establish such new special classes where necessary, subject to the willingness of schools to open classes.  The NCSE welcomes expressions of interest from schools in opening special classes to meet the demand for special class provision.  In deciding on the location of a special class SENOs take into account both the present and the future potential need for special class provision and they must be satisfied that the special class is sustainable and appropriately located.  SENOs liaise with relevant professionals in their area to arrive at an informed decision.  The opening of a Speech and Language class is, however, contingent on the HSE being in a position to provide Speech and Language therapy to the students in the class. </p><p>The enrolment of pupils in an SSLD special class is managed locally by an Admissions &amp;amp; Discharges Committee, comprising the Speech and Language Therapy Manager, Speech and Language Therapist, Class Teacher and Principal.</p><p>It should be noted that pupils who are not enrolled in a special class for SSLD and who meet the criteria for Specific Speech and Language Disorder, as outlined in Circular 0038/2007, may qualify for additional teaching support under the School's Special Education Teaching Support provision, where he/she is enrolled in a mainstream school.  </p><p>A new model for allocating support to pupils with special educational needs has been implemented from September 2017.  Circular 0013/2017 for primary schools which was published on 7th March 2017 sets out the details of the new model for allocating special education teachers to schools.The revised allocation model replaces the generalised allocation process at primary and post primary school level for learning support and high incidence special educational needs, and the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) allocation process which provided additional resource teaching supports to schools, to support pupils assessed as having Low Incidence disabilities.  Guidelines for schools on the organisation, deployment and use of their special education teachers have also been published; </p><p><i></i>.</p><p>One of the benefits of this new approach is that schools will have greater flexibility as to how they will deploy their resources.</p><p>Pupils with Specific Speech and Language Disorder (SSLD) may, therefore, attend a special class for pupils with SSLD with speech and language therapy services provided in class by the HSE or attend a mainstream school with additional teaching supports and speech &amp;amp; language therapy through the primary care service.  </p><p>The Programme for a Partnership Government contains a commitment to establish a new model of In-School Speech and Language Therapy and to examine the adequacy of the present policies and provision, and their scope for improvement, particularly in relation to speech and language difficulties and early intervention.</p><p>A joint working group, made up of the Department of Health, the Department of Education and Skills, the Health Service Executive and the National Council for Special Education, has been established to develop the proposed model.When finalised, the proposed model will represent a significant change in the way in which services are delivered.</p><p>The information requested by the Deputy is not available, as the NCSE retains data on the number of special classes and the number of students attending only.</p></reply>

It was chaired by then Senator Martin McAleese and it is commonly referred to as the McAleese report.  The material in the Report relates to 10 different institutions which were run by 4 different Orders of nuns over a period of 70 years.  Although there was no finding in the McAleese Report which indicated that the State had any liability in the matter, following the report&rsquo;s publication the Taoiseach issued a State apology to the women. </p><p>Mr. Justice Quirke was subsequently asked by the Government to make recommendations on an appropriate redress scheme for those who were in the 10 Magdalen laundries that were the subject of the McAleese Report.  The Government also included in the scheme the laundry that was attached to Stanhope Street Training School and later also decided to include a 12th institution, the Training School in Summerhill. </p><p>The Scheme provides for lump sum payments varying from &euro;11,500 to &euro;100,000 depending on the length of stay in the institution concerned.  Further, each woman is entitled to a top-up payment to bring her weekly income from the Irish State up to the equivalent of the Irish Contributory Pension.  The Scheme is administered by the Department of Justice and Equality.</p><p>Caranua was established under the 2012 Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Act to manage &euro;110 million pledged by religious congregations to enhance the lives of survivors who had suffered abuse as children in Institutions listed in schedules to the 2002 Residential Institutions Redress Act where the State was acting <i>in loco parentis</i>.

This is a substantial allocation of hours for a school of this size. </p>  <p>  Whereas the profiled allocation had indicated a need of 45 hours for this school, based on its school profile and size, and relative to the profiled needs of all other schools, the school was allocated 46.03 hours, which was equivalent to the allocation the school received in 2016/17.  There has therefore been no reduction to the allocation for this school.</p>  <p>  It is acknowledged and accepted that schools will have some additional pupils with special educational needs enrolling to their school subsequent to the profiles having been developed. </p>  <p>  However, for the most part these will be balanced by the fact that some students who had additional teaching needs in the previous year will have left the school.  The baseline is also designed to ensure that schools have some capacity to provide additional support to pupils.  This school also has some additional capacity in the retained element of its allocation which is above that indicated by the school profile.  </p>  <p>  Under the new allocation model schools are frontloaded with resources, based on each school&rsquo;s profile, to provide supports immediately to those pupils who need it without delay.  This will reduce the administrative burden on schools as schools will no longer have to complete an application process annually and apply for newly enrolled pupils who require resource hours.  Children who need support can have that support provided immediately rather than having to wait for a diagnosis.</p>  <p>  Schools will therefore no longer have to make applications, for newly enrolled pupils for whom resource teaching hours may have been provided under the old model, or for pupils who have received a new diagnosis, as schools will now receive a single allocation for all of their special education teaching needs, based on their school size and profile. </p>  <p>  The new allocations to schools include provision to support all pupils in the schools, including where a child receives a diagnosis after the allocation is received by a school, or where there are newly enrolling pupils to the school. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that this is a brand new model of allocation and is not comparable to the previous model which had been in place. </p>  <p>  By using a broad range of attainment and socio-economic criteria, it is expected that generally, a school&rsquo;s profile will remain relatively constant from year to year.  Each year, some students with additional teaching needs will leave and others will enrol, broadly balancing the school profile.  Resources allocated under this model will not normally be adjusted between allocations. </p>  <p>  A process has also been put in place to address circumstances where the school profile significantly changed following the allocation process due to the fact that the school had rapidly developing status where the net enrolment numbers significantly increased.</p>  <p>  The criteria for qualification for mainstream school developing school posts are set out in DES Circular 17/2017 (Primary School Staffing Schedule) and DES 10,11,12/2017 (Post Primary School Staffing Schedule).</p>  <p>  Schools who have qualified of additional mainstream developing school posts on the basis of developing growth in accordance with these criteria will also qualify for additional Special Education Teaching Allocations to take account of this developing status.</p>  <p>  My Department has issued guidelines for schools to support them in the management of their resources.  These guidelines are available on my Departments website.</p>  <p>  Schools are encouraged to take guidelines on board in the planning process for the 2017/18 school year.  In order to determine the levels of need within each school, it will be important for schools to have properly identified students with additional learning needs and have developed plans for each student indicating how the supports available will be used. </p>  <p>  In this context, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) will be available to support schools where these plans have been developed and implemented but the school considers that further support may be required.  This support may involve Continuing Professional Development or further training for school staff, advice in relation to the support plan that is in place, and possibly a review process once schools can clearly demonstrate that exceptional circumstances have arisen in the school.</p>  <p>  The NCSE will shortly be advising how schools can seek a review of the utilisation of their allocations in circumstances where a school considers that very exceptional circumstances have arisen subsequent to the development of the profile.  </p></reply>

Early Intervention classes are supported with a pupil&ndash;teacher ratio of 6:1 and also have Special Needs Assistant support normally amounting to 2 SNAs for a class of 6 children.</p><p>From the age of three children with autism (who will not reach the age of 6 during the current school year) can enrol in these early intervention settings.  Where such a placement is not available home tuition can be provided.</p><p>The enrolment of a child to a school is a matter, in the first instance, for the parents/guardians of the child and the Board of Management of a school.</p><p>However, parents/guardians who may need advice or are experiencing difficulties in locating a school placement should contact their local Special Educational Needs Organiser (SENO) who can assist in identifying an appropriate educational placement for their child.  Contact details are available on <i>www.ncse.ie.</i></p><p>The SENO can also advise parents in relation to supports which may be available to support children with special educational needs, including special transport arrangements which may be made available.  Details of all special classes for children with special educational needs are also available on <i>www.ncse.ie.</i></p><p>The Deputy may be aware that the Department of Children and Youth Affairs provides supports for childcare, including pre-school education.</p><p>The principal vehicle for the delivery of pre-school education is the free Pre-School Year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme which was introduced in January 2010 and provides for early learning in a formal setting to children in the year before they commence primary school.  </p><p>Children with disabilities have access to pre-school services under a new Access and Inclusion Model (AIM) programme of supports, which was announced in June 2016, by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs. </p><p>AIM is a child-centred model, involving seven levels of progressive support, moving from the universal to the targeted, depending on the needs of the child and the pre-school. </p><p>Details of the supports which are available under AIM can be found at <i>www.preschoolaccess.ie</i>which contains comprehensive information on the access and inclusion model and on how to apply for the new schemes and supports.  For children attending a private pre-school through the ECCE programme, questions relating to the AIM supports should be addressed to the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.</p></reply>

This event focused on the impact of Brexit on enterprise and society on the island and the steps taken by organisations to become 'Brexit-ready'.  There was also a discussion on the future of Europe.  This session followed two successful plenary sessions held last November and February.  There have also been 19 sectoral dialogues in locations across the country to discuss the impact of Brexit on specific areas including Agri-Food, Transport, Energy, Tourism and Hospitality, and Education.  The most recent sectoral dialogue on cross-border health co-operation took place in Dundalk on September 8.  The All-Island Civic Dialogue is ongoing and forms a key part of our stakeholder engagement on Brexit and will continue through the negotiation process.  The outcomes of the recent plenary session will again feed into the Government&rsquo;s approach.  </p>  <p>  As with previous dialogues, a full report of the third plenary session will be published online.

At a cost of &euro;80, which breaks down to &euro;8 per year, the Irish passport fee compares with approximately &euro;8.30 per year for a British passport, &euro;8.60 per year for a French passport, &euro;9.40 per year for an American passport and &euro;18.50 per year for an Australian passport.

The PSRA is mandated to control, supervise and regulate Property Service Providers (PSPs), i.e. auctioneers/estate agents, letting agents and management agents.  The PSRA, which is independent in the performance of its statutory functions, operates a comprehensive licensing system in respect of all PSPs, administers a system of investigation and adjudication of complaints against PSPs, and maintains a sector funded compensation fund where licensed PSPs have acted dishonestly.</p>  <p>  The provision of property services by a licensed PSP or a relevant person (as provided for under Section 82 of the 2011 Act, i.e. property service providers from other EU countries), includes the auction of property other than land, the purchase or sale, by whatever means of land (including property), the letting of land and/or property management services in respect of property both within and outside the State.  The purchase or sale of overseas properties by licensed PSPs is a property service for the purposes of the Act if the service is provided in the State.</p>  <p>  Section 65 of the 2011 Act provides for the PSRA to investigate complaints made against licensed PSPs.  Following an investigation where a licensed PSP is found to be negligent in retaining a booking deposit, a sanction may be imposed and or a claim against the PSP's professional indemnity insurance may be made.  However, where an act of dishonesty is established against a licensed PSP, the client may make a claim on the Property Services Compensation Fund.</p>  <p>  I am advised by the Authority that this is not an issue which has been brought to its attention to date.  Accordingly, there are no specific plans at this time for legislative change to the property services regulatory regime to address this specific matter.  However, it may be the case that other Irish regulatory bodies may have a more direct responsibility in this regard, for example, the Central Bank, as the regulator of investment companies.</p></reply>

I am assured by the Commissioner that the allocation of Garda&iacute; is continually monitored and reviewed taking into account all relevant factors including crime trends, demographics, and security assessments relating to the area in question so as to ensure optimal use is made of Garda human resources. </p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that in regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Garda Division.  It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his/her Division.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware Clondalkin, Lucan, Ronanstown and Rathcoole Garda Stations form part of the Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR) West Garda Division.  I am informed that on the 31 August 2017 the total strength of the DMR West Garda Division was 664.  There are also 27 Garda Reserves and 47 civilians attached to the Division.  When appropriate, the work of the Division is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. </p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. </p><p>This plan is progressing well.  This year, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves. </p><p>I am pleased to announce today that I have secured sufficient funding to provide for the recruitment of another 800 new Garda recruits in 2018, which will ensure that the planned Garda strength of 15,000 by 2021 remains on course to be achieved. Budget 2018 will also facilitate the recruitment of a further 500 civilians and the strengthening of the Reserve.</p><p>I am advised by the Commissioner, that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, that close to  1,400 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, of which 119 were assigned to the DMR West Division, 17 of which were assigned following last September's attestation.  I understand that another 200 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - an increase of 500 since the end of 2016.</p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to allow to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division, including the DMR West Division, in the coming years.</p><p>This investment in personnel is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.  In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan.  This investment will facilitate the provision of more effective policing services and I have no doubt that these new resources now coming on stream will see an increase in Garda visibility in our communities.  <b></b></p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that as of the 31 August 2017, the latest date for which figures are available, the Garda strength of Clondalkin, Lucan, Ronanstown and Rathcoole Garda Stations from 2012 up to 2017 are as set out in the tables below. </p><p>Garda Strength by Station 2012 - 2017 <table><tr><th>Station</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th><th>2016</th><th>2017*</th></tr><tr><td>Clondalkin</td><td>95</td><td>91</td><td>89</td><td>87</td><td>94</td><td>99</td></tr><tr><td>Lucan</td><td>73</td><td>72</td><td>74</td><td>73</td><td>74</td><td>69</td></tr><tr><td>Ronanstown</td><td>93</td><td>91</td><td>91</td><td>94</td><td>91</td><td>93</td></tr><tr><td>Rathcoole</td><td>26</td><td>23</td><td>23</td><td>21</td><td>19</td><td>15</td></tr></table><b>*Up to 31 August 2017</b></p></reply>

This very substantial investment in personnel is driven by our commitment to ensure all citizens have the reassurance of a visible, responsive and effective policing service.  The projected number of 4,000 civilians will effectively double the current figure and represents a medium-term target of a Garda organisation 20% comprised of civilians.

These will be based on a number of  objectives specified in section 173(2) of the 2015 Act including that the legal practitioner concerned will, in his or her practice, have displayed a degree of competence and a degree of probity appropriate to and consistent with the granting of a Patent of Precedence along with professional independence.  These objectives also include a proven capacity for excellence in the practice of advocacy; in the practice of specialist litigation; or in specialist knowledge of an area of law.  The Advisory Committee framework will, therefore, replace the current procedures in this area while also placing them on a more formal and transparent footing.</p>  <p>  The Advisory Committee, which can also recommend the revocation of a Patent of Precedence, will be chaired by the Chief Justice and will also comprise the President of the High Court; the Attorney General; the Chairperson of the Bar Council; the President of the Law Society and a lay member of the Legal Services Regulatory Authority who will be nominated by the Minister for Justice and Equality.  I will also be bringing forward an amendment to the 2015 Act to include, as a member, the President of the Court of Appeal whose coming into office had not been anticipated at the time of publication of the Legal Services Regulation Bill in 2011. </p>  <p>  The establishment of the Advisory Committee on the Grant of Patents of Precedence is both a key reform and a key component of the managed and phased roll-out of its legislative functions by the Legal Services Regulatory Authority including in the matching development of its organisational capacities and office and staffing resources.  This will, in addition to the amendment to which I have referred, involve the detailed preparation by the Regulatory Authority of the procedures and application criteria for the consideration and recommendation of candidates for the title of Senior Counsel and the inauguration of the Advisory Committee.  In respecting the Authority's independence in the roll-out and exercise of its statutory functions, I and my Department continue to work closely with the Authority to enable it to come into substantive regulatory mode at the earliest opportunity.  The phased start-up of its various functions, including those which arise under Part 12, will continue to need careful project management.  It will also require the ongoing identification, in conjunction with the Authority, of the more specific delivery dates for the respective independent functions involved during the remainder of this year and into 2018.  These are matters in support of which I will make the relevant Commencement Orders at the appropriate time.   </p></reply>

Furthermore, the scheduling of court cases and the allocation of court business is a matter the President of the District Court and the presiding judge who are, under the constitution, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions. </p><p>However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has informed me that the President of the District Court monitors waiting times and workload across all court lists and seeks to ensure the optimum use of court time and judicial resources.  Wherever possible, the President targets additional judicial resources at the areas of greatest need. </p><p>I am also informed that delays in the hearing of cases and the size of court lists can be impacted by a number of factors, many of which are outside the control of the courts and the Courts Service, for example, the unavailability of a witness or vital evidence, delays in the furnishing of reports or because the parties and/or legal practitioners are not ready to proceed on allocated dates.  This gives rise to adjournments, which can have a major impact on the time taken to complete the hearing of a case and on the number of cases which are listed in a court sitting. </p><p>Domestic violence applications are prioritised in all District Courts throughout the country.  Applications such as Protection Orders are prioritised in the District Court and they are usually granted where the Court so decides on the date the application is made to the Court.  Typically interim barring orders, which are also an emergency application, are also made ex parte and granted on the date of application.  There are, therefore, no delays in dealing with such applications.</p><p>In provincial locations Barring Order applications are generally listed for the next dedicated family law day (most Districts have at least 1 day per month dedicated to family law only).  This means that such cases are generally listed for hearing between 2 - 6 weeks from the issue date.  There are exceptions, however, and in some instances the first listing for the hearing of a barring order summons may be up to 14 weeks.  Applications for Barring Orders are prioritised within court lists and a decision is generally made on such applications on the first listing date.  Where adjournments occur they are generally granted at the request of one or both parties.</p><p>The President of the District Court as well as the Courts Service will continue to monitor the position in regard to waiting times and the length of court lists and where possible appropriate consideration will be given to allocating additional judicial resources to address any issues that may arise.</p><p>The 2011-2016 Programme for Government contained a commitment to establish a &ldquo;<i>distinct and separate system of family courts to streamline family law court processes and make them more efficient and less costly</i>&rdquo; and draft legislation is in preparation to give effect to this commitment. </p><p>A working group comprised of the Department, the Courts Service and the Legal Aid Board is currently in place to examine, among other things, how the new Family Court would operate on the ground and what are the implications for family law cases.</p></reply>

It is standard procedure for funds of the ward to be brought under the custody of the court for investment by the Accountant of the Courts of Justice in accordance with the directions of the President of the High Court and the Registrar of the Office of Wards of Court.  Investment of court funds is carried out in line with the strategies devised and reviewed on a regular basis by the Investment Committee, chaired by the President of the High Court.</p>  <p>  The Investment Committee reviews the investment strategies with the assistance of its investment advisors to ensure the protection and suitable investment of funds of wards, minors and others lodged in court for the benefit of those persons.  Investment policies and orders made thereunder must be in accordance with the Trustee (Authorised Investments) Act 1958.  This procedure was examined and approved by the court in the case entitled "In the Matter of M. H., a Ward of Court" [2011] IEHC 129. </p>  <p>  The Courts Service has also informed me that the committee of the ward is involved with the Office of Wards of Court on an ongoing basis in establishing the expenditure needs of a ward.  A case officer is appointed to manage the affairs of each ward who is available to meet with the committee initially to discuss the needs and financial arrangements for the ward and is available thereafter as required.  Significant purchases or sales such as the sale of a house or lands will not take place without the involvement of the committee. </p>  <p>  The Courts Service has advised that detailed statements providing comprehensive financial information are issued to committees on request and a process of issuing high level financial statements to all committees has now commenced and that such statements will issue automatically on an annual basis. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, the legislation governing persons who are wards of court dates back to 1871.  It has been recognised for some time that reforms were needed to update the law in this area and so the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 has been introduced to provide a modern statutory framework to support decision-making by adults with capacity difficulties. </p>  <p>  New administrative processes and support measures, including the setting up of the Decision Support Service within the Mental Health Commission (a body under the Department of Health), must be put in place before the substantive provisions of the Act are brought into operation.  A high-level Steering Group comprised of senior officials from the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Health, the Mental Health Commission and the Courts Service, together with the Director of the Decision Support Service, is overseeing the establishment and commissioning of the Decision Support Service and this work is ongoing.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.</p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime. To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. </p><p>This plan is progressing apace. This year, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves. </p><p>The areas mentioned by the Deputy are located in the Ballyshannon Garda District which forms part of the Donegal Division. I am informed by the Commissioner that the Garda strength of the Donegal Division, on 31 August 2017, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 392, of whom 91 members are assigned to the  Ballyshannon District. There are also 19 Garda Reserves and 32 civilians attached to the Division. When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.</p><p>I am further informed by the Commissioner, that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, close to 1,400 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, 24 of whom have been assigned to the Donegal Division. I am also informed that another 200 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - an increase of 500 since the end of 2016. </p><p>I am pleased to announce today that I have secured sufficient funding to provide for the recruitment of another 800 new Garda recruits in 2018, which will ensure that the planned Garda strength of 15,000 by 2021 remains on course.</p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division, including the Donegal Division in the coming years. </p><p>This investment in personnel is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.  In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan. This investment will facilitate the provision of more effective policing services and I have no doubt that these new resources now coming on stream will see an increase in Garda visibility in our communities.  <b></b></p></reply>

Upon approval of the grant, the applicant will receive an up-front payment of 50% of the grant with the balance to be paid when the system is fully operational.

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends, demographics and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. </p>  <p>  I have been informed that the number of Garda&iacute; assigned to the Cavan / Monaghan Division on the 31 August 2017, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 323 with 12 Garda Reserves and 37 Civilians. When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.</p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. </p>  <p>  This plan is progressing apace. This year, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves. </p>  <p>  I am further informed by the Commissioner, that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, close to 1,400 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, 33 of whom have been assigned to the Cavan / Monaghan Division. I am also informed that another 200 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - an increase of 500 since the end of 2016. </p>  <p>  This focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division, including the Cavan / Monaghan Division in the coming years. </p>  <p>  In so far as the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute; is concerned, this is a matter for the Garda Commissioner.  I am assured by the Commissioner that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of resources. However, it is important to keep in mind that newly attested Garda&iacute; have a further 16 months of practical and class-room based training to complete in order to receive their BA in Applied Policing.  To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required training and development structures and resources in place, including trained Garda tutors and access to a permanently appointed supervisory Sergeant who is thoroughly familiar with their responsibilities under the training programme.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.  </p>  <p>  The Garda Reserve was established in accordance with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 to enhance the links between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and local communities and consists of voluntary unpaid members, drawn from the community, to support the work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The Reserve perform policing duties as determined by the Commissioner, while accompanied by full time Garda&iacute;. Their role is to provide local patrols and participate in crime prevention initiatives targeted at specific local problem areas. Reserve members are also involved in policing major incidents and events, and in providing other operational support to full time Garda&iacute;. In recent years, the Commissioner has conferred further powers on reserve members under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 and the Road Traffic Act 1961 and has also decided that they should carry out more duties including the serving of summonses, and the issuing of Fixed Charge Penalty Notices where offences are detected.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Commissioner that in regard to the deployment of Garda personnel including Reserves, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Garda Division.</p>  <p>  I am further informed that the information requested by the Deputy regarding Reserves assisting policing in a District and being allocated a duty in the duty register is not readily available in the format requested by the Deputy.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, service in the Garda Reserve is voluntary and unpaid. However, an allowance is payable to Reserve members who complete a minimum of 208 hours duty annually as a contribution towards expenses incurred in performing their duties. The allowance is currently set at &euro;1,000 per annum. Reserves are also reimbursed for expenses incurred while attending court in respect of their service as a Reserve.  </p>  <p>  I am advised that during 2016, 303 Garda Reserves claimed the allowance  which is equivalent to 44% of the Reserve strength of 695 as of 31 December 2016. The cost of the Reserve in 2016 was &euro;341,125.</p>  <p>  The "Programme for a Partnership Government" includes a commitment to double the Garda Reserve to act in a supportive role undertaking local patrols and crime reduction measures. In line with this the Government has in place a plan to achieve a Reserve strength of 2,000 by 2021. This year, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves and that process is well underway.</p>  <p>  In conjunction with the major expansion of the Reserve over the next number of years we must ensure that it is used to optimum effect to support effective policing. To inform future decisions around the use of the Reserve An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is conducting a strategic review as a matter of priority with a view to completion before the end of this year. As a first step the Garda Executive has taken a decision to transfer the management of the Reserve from the Human Resource and People Development Directorate to the Assistant Commissioner with responsibility for Community Engagement. This is intended to ensure that its development and deployment is viewed more broadly through a community policing lens. This is a very welcome step as it is my strong view that the greatest dividend to be gained from the Reserve is in terms of a visible presence on the ground engaging with local communities.</p></reply>

This is an essential feature of the strong community policing ethos which has long been central to policing in this jurisdiction.  The Deputy will also be aware that as part of the overall strategy to oppose criminality, the Garda authorities pursue a range of partnerships with community stakeholders; for example, the well established Community Alert Programme and the highly successful Garda Text Alert Scheme to name but a few.  </p>  <p>  Community policing is at the heart of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. It provides a means of recognising that every community &ndash; both urban and rural &ndash; has its own concerns and expectations. In this regard I welcome the strong emphasis placed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021, on further developing and supporting the community policing ethos of the organisation so that Garda&iacute; spend more time in the community, gaining public confidence and trust and providing a greater sense of security. Proposed initiatives include the establishment of local Community Policing Teams (CPTs) headed by an Inspector and made up of Garda&iacute; from across a range of areas to proactively work with the community to prevent and detect crime; and the establishment of Community Safety Fora in every District comprising local Garda&iacute;, local communities and key stakeholders. </p>  <p>  Since the Community Text Alert scheme was launched in September 2013, it has developed as an important crime prevention mechanism with over 700 local groups involving in excess of 130,000 subscribers and with an estimated 200,000 text messages sent each month under the scheme. Every Garda Division, rural and urban, now offers the text alert service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has published guidelines to assist in the establishment and operation of local groups. </p>  <p>  The Deputy might wish to note that funding from my Department is not used to provide direct assistance to Neighbourhood Watch Groups or any local Community Alert (or Text Alert) Groups.</p>  <p>  In relation to Community Alert, funding is allocated by my Department for the employment and associated costs of the national Community Alert programme, including the employment of regional Development Officers. These Development Officers, operating in Muintir Na T&iacute;re, provide support to Community and Text Alert schemes and offer advice on how to establish new schemes. The long-standing view has been that this is the best use of the resources available to the Department to support effective community crime prevention actions. </p>  <p>  At the National Ploughing Championships this year, I was pleased to announce that an additional &euro;100,000 was being made available to Text Alert Groups, registered with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to provide modest financial assistance with the running costs they incur each year.  This Text Alert Rebate Scheme will be administered by Muintir na T&iacute;re and Groups wishing to participate at the Scheme can find more details at www.muintiir.ie. </p>  <p>  Finally, I am pleased to announce that I have also secured an additional &euro;100,000 in the budget announced today for local crime prevention initiatives, including the text alert scheme. </p></reply>

To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. </p><p>This plan is progressing apace. This year, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves. </p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division in the coming years. </p><p>This investment in personnel is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.  In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan. This investment will facilitate the provision of more effective policing services and I have no doubt that these new resources now coming on stream will see an increase in Garda visibility in our communities.</p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that the number of Garda&iacute; over each of the past ten years by Rank and Division is as set out in the following tables.</p><p><b>Garda Strength by Division and Rank 2008</b><table><tr><th>DIVISION</th><th>GD</th><th>SG</th><th>IN</th><th>SU</th><th>CS</th><th>AC</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>Cavan / Monaghan</td><td>332</td><td>72</td><td>7</td><td>6</td><td>1</td><td></td><td>418</td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>283</td><td>44</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>1</td><td></td><td>337</td></tr><tr><td>Cork City</td><td>550</td><td>106</td><td>14</td><td>6</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>678</td></tr><tr><td>Cork North</td><td>242</td><td>49</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>1</td><td></td><td>300</td></tr><tr><td>Cork West</td><td>258</td><td>43</td><td>6</td><td>5</td><td>1</td><td></td><td>313</td></tr><tr><td>D.M.R.

The Minister for Justice and Equality found, on 30 May last, that in an international protection system with no temporal limits as to when the application process will be concluded, an absolute prohibition on the right to work for international protection applicants is contrary to the right to seek employment under the Constitution.

Chapter 6 of the Report is dedicated to the specific needs of female offenders.   Work is underway to progress these recommendations. The Penal Policy Implementation Oversight Group has published three Progress Reports which are available to view on my Department&rsquo;s website. I expect to publish the fourth report in the near future. The recommendations in respect of females are also included in actions 2.12 &amp;amp; 2.13 of the National Strategy for Women and Girls 2017-2020. </p>  <p>  Further, the Probation Service and Irish Prison Service Joint Strategic Women's Plan puts in place a structure for these two agencies to work more effectively with this vulnerable group in society.  The Probation Service works very closely with a wide variety of statutory, voluntary and community services and resources.  Prompt referral and effective communication with a variety of agencies is beneficial and a key aspect of the model used by the Probation Service in working with women. Focussed interventions help reduce offending, improve opportunities for reintegration and to improve outcomes more generally.</p>  <p>  The Abigail Women's Centre run by DePaul Ireland (Tus Nua) was opened in a north Dublin suburb, in December 2014.  This is a Probation Service funded project working with women leaving prison or on probation supervision and provides these women with a safe and positive supported environment.  It is a dedicated women's initiative involving a range of agencies working together including the Dublin Regional Housing Executive, Dublin City Council, Probation Service, Irish Prison Service, Health Service Executive and the Dublin City Education and Training Board. </p>  <p>  In the afore-mentioned Joint Strategic Women's Plan, the Irish Prison Service gave a commitment to explore the development of an open centre for women assessed as low risk of re-offending.  This option was explored by a joint Irish Prison Service/Probation Service working group. Having considered the matter, it decided that rather than developing an open centre, a step down facility for women was a more practical and cost effective approach. The Irish Prison Service and Probation Service are in the process of tendering for the development of a step down unit for women in Dublin. </p></reply>

The Working Group recommended that, rather than developing an open centre, the preferred option would be to pursue step down facilities for women.</p>  <p>  In this regard, approval was given to the Heads of the Irish Prison Service and Probation Service to proceed to scope the possibilities for the development of a step down unit in Dublin. This project is on-going. </p>  <p>  A new development for females in Limerick, which work will commence on in early 2018, will when completed, provide 42 rooms with 8 independent living areas.

This follows on from a recommendation of the Penal Policy Review Group that a programme similar to the existing Youth Diversion Programme be introduced for young people above the age of eighteen years, with an initial focus on eighteen to twenty-one year olds. </p>  <p>  The Review Group recognised that implementing the recommendation would require significant consultation with relevant agencies, including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as well as consideration of the resource implications, including the personnel requirements within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Irish Youth Justice Service. A fundamental consideration is the extent to which the existing model for the Garda Diversion Programme for those under 18 might be readily applied or adapted for an older age cohort.</p>  <p>  I am advised that there is ongoing engagement between the Irish Youth Justice Service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, with a view to scoping out the detailed implications of introducing an extended Diversion Programme, initially for offenders aged eighteen to twenty one years. Part of this work involves an analysis of the nature and scale of offending by persons in that age cohort. </p>  <p>  In addition, I can advise the Deputy that a Group, established by the former Garda Commissioner, is undertaking a comprehensive review of the existing Youth Diversion Programme.

The court is required to impose a sentence which is proportionate, not only to the crime but to the individual offender, in that process identifying where on the sentencing range the particular case should lie and then applying any mitigating factors which may be present. </p>  <p>  The decision reached in any court case is a matter entirely for the presiding judge and if a person is not satisfied with the decision the judge makes, it is possible to appeal any decision of that judge to the appropriate appeal court.</p></reply>

The identification and development of an alternative site in the proximity of the lake would thus be extremely challenging and would be subject to screening for appropriate assessment, a full environment assessment and also planning applications to the relevant County Council. Given the over-riding conservation and ecology concerns in this sensitive area it is unlikely my Department could be supportive of such a proposal at this heritage site.</p><p>In the event that the club managed to identify a suitable site where planning permission could be secured, a significant budget would be required to develop same.  In this context, it should be noted that the club in question has benefited considerably, and still does, from their current premises being made available to them by my Department without charge. Given the limited resources available for capital investment within the National Parks and Nature Reserves, my Department recognises the need to focus on the core responsibilities relating to the management and conservation of our existing National Parks and Nature Reserves portfolio. Accordingly, we would not be in a position at present to provide any financial assistance for such a development. </p><p>The club could consider applying under the <i>Sports Capital Programme</i>run by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport or alternatively it could apply under the <i>Rural Recreation Scheme </i>operated by the Department of Rural and Community Development. </p></reply>

In addition, my Department takes on about 70 seasonal staff during the year to assist the NPWS. Frontline conservation Rangers are deployed through a regional structure and assignments are determined in light of Departmental business needs and priorities.  </p><p>Staffing levels across my Department are kept under regular review in line with emerging business needs and Government policy on public sector pay and staffing as advised by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. As well as managerial regionally based officers of the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) of my Department, there are 68 NPWS conservation rangers stationed around the country.  </p><p>My Department, in conjunction with the Public Appointments Service (PAS), recently created a Conservation Ranger Panel. 10 Rangers have been appointed to date from this panel with a further two expected before the end of the year. Any further appointments will be made across the country, taking account of financial resources to meet pay costs in the context of Government policy on public sector pay and staffing.</p><p>Within those staffing contexts, officials of my Department monitor compliance with the Wildlife Acts across the country on an on-going basis and carry out patrols and site visits to enforce the various provisions of these Acts, as required. Many of these officers carry out work in more than one county and are engaged in an extensive array of work under the <i>Wildlife Acts</i>, in relation to out National Parks and Reserves and in regard to our obligations under the<i>Birds and Habitats Directives</i>. They also investigate reports of breaches of the Acts including illegal snaring of badgers, habitat protection issues, as well as monitoring compliance at coursing events etc. Members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are also empowered under the Acts to investigate alleged offences and to prosecute if they see fit. </p><p>Where resources allow, local National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) conservation rangers and staff attend coursing meetings, on a spot-check basis, to monitor compliance with licences issued to the Irish Coursing Club and its affiliated clubs.During the 2016/17 coursing season, conservation rangers attended seventeen coursing meetings and the same number of meetings was monitored during the 2015/16 season.  During the 2014/15 season, six meetings were monitored.  While my Department does not have resources to provide 100% attendance at coursing meetings it endeavours to attend as many meetings as possible having regard to the various calls on its staffing complement.  Since the 2017/18 coursing season began in the last two weeks, staff of NPWS have monitored 6 coursing events. </p></reply>

It has produced an online Irish language text-to-speech synthesiser which is freely available at www.abair.ie and which can be used in a learning setting. </p><p><b>VIFAX don Ghaeilge</b></p><p>VIFAX is an Irish language audiovisual learning resource based on TG4 news bulletins and produced weekly throughout the academic year by the Language Centre, Maynooth University.  These exercises are based on sport, politics, language, community, technology, business and environment, among other topics.  While these exercises are suitable for the classroom at secondary and higher levels, self-directed learners will also find VIFAX useful.</p><p><b>On-line Course in the Irish Language and Irish Traditional Culture</b></p><p>Under development by Dublin City University, this Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) is an online degree programme that will focus on the learning of the Irish language <i>ab initio </i>and on Irish traditional culture.  It is expected to launch this programme early in 2018.</p><p>In addition, Foras na Gaeilge, an agency of the North South Language Body, which is co-funded by my Department and the Department for Communities in Northern Ireland, promotes the Irish language on an all-island basis.  In carrying out its legislative mandate, Foras na Gaeilge provides support, advice and financial assistance to many groups who promote the language, including for the provision of courses and activities to help people improve or learn the language.  For example, Foras na Gaeilge funds Sc&eacute;im Pobal Gaeilge 2016-2020 which comprises a network of community-based Irish language development officers who engage directly with communities in order to develop the language at local level.  Further information about the work of Foras na Gaeilge is available on its website <i>www.forasnagaeilge.ie</i>.</p></reply>

In order to underpin the successful implementation of the process which began in 2014, on-going financial and technical support is being provided by my Department, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and Foras na Gaeilge where applicable, to assist communities to develop and implement agreed plans at community level within the process.</p><p>In order to further support the process and advance the overall implementation of the <i>20-Year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010-2030,</i>my Department, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and Foras na Gaeilge also administer a wide range of supports, schemes, initiatives and measures which seek to further support the development of the language at community level and advance the overall objectives of the strategy.</p><p>My Department's Irish Language Support Schemes have as their objective the provision of financial assistance to a range of organisations and activities that support the promotion of the Irish language outside the Gaeltacht.  Organisations that receive annual funding include Taibhdhearc na Gaillimhe, Gaillimh le Gaeilge, Gn&oacute; Mhaigh Eo and Gael Taca, Cork.  These schemes also provide funding for small scale capital projects, associated with the promotion of the Irish language outside the Gaeltacht.  Most recently, funding was provided to Gaelphobal Thamhlachta for the development of an Irish Language and Cultural Centre in Tallaght, Co Dublin.</p><p>Under its legislative mandate to promote the Irish language on an all-island basis, Foras na Gaeilge also funds the Irish Language Community Scheme, Sc&eacute;im Pobal Gaeilge 2016-2020.  This four-year scheme, with a total budget of c.&euro;4m, comprises a network of community-based Irish language development officers with facilitation and networking duties in order to empower communities and lead to sustainable language development within the communities themselves.</p><p>Support for the Irish language and the Gaeltacht will remain as key priorities in 2018.  In that regard, additional funding of &euro;2.5 million which was announced in Budget 2018, will focus on further assisting the delivery of the 20-Year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010-2030.</p></reply>

Employees of Section 39 organisations are not public servants and are therefore not encompassed by the Public Service Stability Agreements.  This means that they were not subject to the FEMPI legislation which imposed pay reductions. Section 39 organisations are not obliged to pass on any pay reductions to their staff members or to provide for any pay restoration that may be negotiated as part of these public service agreements.  </p>  <p>  Any individuals employed by these section 39 organisations are not HSE employees and therefore, the HSE has no role in determining the salaries or other terms and conditions applying to these staff.

While the HSE records data for home help workers, they are not currently included in the general staffing numbers for historical reasons. </p>  <p>  Home help workers were not always classified as employees.  Following a Labour Court ruling in 1997, home help workers established employment status.  This led to 4,000 WTE (12,000 headcount) home help numbers being collected as part of health service personnel statistics.  It was decided to report them separately to avoid a sudden 4,000 increase in overall WTE numbers.  In addition, in some counties, home help services are provided exclusively by Section 39 agencies and consequently, home help workers are not employed by the HSE in those locations.  As a result, for these counties, the WTE value would be zero, leading to a potential impression of staffing shortages in these counties. </p>  <p>  Accepting the desirability for consistent reporting of both pay and numbers, and acknowledging the need to allow for comparison across years, my Department, the HSE and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform are engaging on this issue in relation to future reporting.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that home help workers have, for some time, acquired all the same terms and conditions of employment, including pension entitlements, as any other cohort of staff and are not differentiated on that basis.</p></reply>

Securing access to existing and new and innovative medicines is a key objective of the  health service.  However, the challenge is to deliver this objective in an affordable and sustainable manner.  The medicines bill for the community drugs schemes &ndash; primarily the GMS, Long Term Illness and Drugs Payment, as well as the High Tech Arrangement, is forecast at just over &euro;1.7 billion in 2017.</p><p>To ensure patients receive the highest quality care, it is essential that the resources invested in medicines are used efficiently and effectively.  This requires an integrated approach to secure best value for money for all treatments, greater efficiencies across the supply chain and also the use of the most cost-effective treatments.</p><p>In 2013, the HSE established the Medicines Management Programme (MMP).  It is headed by the (NMIC) and the (NCPE), in collaboration with the (HSE-PCRS), and provides sustained national leadership on issues such as medicines management, access to medicines and the cost effective provision of medicines in Ireland.  The MMP has undertaken a number of initiatives to improve evidence-based and cost-effective prescribing nationally and the review of Versatis is an example of this.</p><p>Versatis 5% medicated plaster is licensed for the symptomatic relief of neuropathic pain associated with previous herpes zoster (shingles) infection, known as post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN), in adults.  Following an MMP review of the evidence available for the use of Versatis, the HSE introduced a new system for reimbursement of Versatis from 1 September 2017.  This process will support the appropriate use of Versatis, ensuring that PHN patients continue to have receive this treatment.  The HSE estimates that this protocol will reduce expenditure on this product by approximately 90%.</p><p>Versatis has been reimbursed in the community drugs schemes since 2010.  Initially, the projected budget impact was low due to the specific licensed indication.  However, total expenditure has increased significantly, from &euro;9.4 million in 2012 to over &euro;30 million in 2016, due to off-license use as a general treatment for pain not associated with shingles.  Currently, over 25,000 patients are in receipt of this item.  The MMP report highlighted that the clinical evidence for Versatis in PHN is limited due to lack of comparative data and its value is uncertain for all other types of pain.  The NCPE estimates that, in Ireland, between 5-10% of the prescribing of this product is for the licensed indication of PHN.</p><p>All patients who currently receive antivirals for shingles, or patients who are prescribed antivirals for shingles in the future, will automatically be approved for Versatis for three months.  No action is required by GPs and the patient&rsquo;s pharmacy will be notified of his or her approval status.</p><p>All patients who currently use Versatis have been identified and automatically registered on the HSE-PCRS system for three months and will continue to receive the treatment from their pharmacy until 30 November 2017.  However, from 1 December 2017, non-shingles patients will no longer be dispensed Versatis under the community drugs schemes.  The HSE has produced patient information leaflets and advised GPs on treatment alternatives.</p><p>In exceptional circumstances, the product may be dispensed for unlicensed indications.  GPs will make an application for reimbursement for unlicensed indications for new and existing patients through the online system.  Applications will be reviewed by the MMP before a decision is made and communicated to the GP.</p><p>Full details of the review of Versatis are available on the HSE website at </p><p><i></i>.</p><p>As this is a matter for the HSE, I have no role in this decision in relation to individual treatments.  However, I fully support the objectives of the HSE Medicines Management Programme.</p></reply>

There is no provision under the GMS GP contract for persons who hold a medical card or GP visit card to be charged for routine phlebotomy services provided by their GP, or the Practice Nurse on behalf of the GP, which are required to either assist in the diagnosis of illness or the treatment of a condition.  The HSE has advised GPs that where a blood test forms part of the investigation or necessary treatment of a patient&rsquo;s symptoms or conditions, this should be free of charge for patients who hold a medical card or GP visit card.  Notwithstanding this, I am aware that in recent times some GPs have begun to charge GMS patients for phlebotomy services in some circumstances.</p>  <p>  This is a matter of concern for me as it has long been the position of the Government and the Oireachtas that no user charges should apply to GP services provided to GMS and GP visit card patients.  If a patient who holds a medical card or GP visit card believes he or she has been incorrectly charged for routine phlebotomy services by his or her GP, then that patient may make a complaint to the HSE Local Health Office, who will deal with the matter in accordance with the HSE's Complaints Policy.  In order to achieve clarity on this issue, I have asked that any difference of perspective in relation to the provision of phlebotomy services be addressed in the GP contractual review process, which is currently underway.  The aim is to develop a contract which has a population health focus, providing in particular for health promotion and disease prevention and for the structured ongoing care of chronic conditions.  I look forward to constructive and positive engagements with a view to achieving a satisfactory outcome.</p>  <p>  The GMS contract stipulates that fees are not paid to GPs by the HSE in respect of certain medical certificates which may be required, for example, "under the Social Welfare Acts or for the purposes of insurance or assurance policies or for the issue of driving licences".  Consultation fees charged by GPs outside the terms of the GMS or GP Visit Card contracts are a matter of private contract between the clinicians and their patients.</p></reply>

To date this group has met seven times.</p><p>The Expert Group is tasked with the development of clinical guidance for healthcare professionals treating patients through the Access Programme.  A critical requirement for the successful establishment of the Access Programme is meaningful engagement with representative bodies, clinicians, patients, and pharmacists so that these groups are integral to the drafting of operational clinical guidance.  This has involved continuous ongoing dialogue between the Experts and third parties throughout this initiative.  The Group conducted a targeted consultation on the draft guidance, which will be finalised shortly.  The Expert Group are also considering other operational aspects for the implementation of the Access Programme.</p><p>Officials in my Department are working on secondary legislation to underpin the programme and on the logistics of sourcing suitable cannabis-based product supplies for the Irish market place.  This work will take a number of months to complete.</p><p>As I have previously advised, pending implementation of the Cannabis Access Programme, and for medical conditions that are not included in the Access Programme, under existing legislation it is open to me as Minister to consider granting a licence to an Irish registered medical practitioner, under the Misuse of Drugs Acts, for access to medical cannabis for named patients.  The Chief Medical Officer has advised that the granting of such a licence must be premised on an appropriate application being submitted to the Department of Health, which is endorsed by a consultant who is responsible for the management of the patient and who is prepared to monitor the effects of the treatment over time.  The decision to prescribe cannabis for medical use rests with the clinician, in consultation with their patient.  As Minister for Health I have no role in this clinical decision-making process.</p><p>Where a consultant requires information or clarification in relation to the licence application process, he or she should contact my Department directly.</p><p>The Cannabis Reference Group has met on the following dates:</p><p>- 30 March 2017;</p><p>- 11 April 2017;</p><p>- 9 May 2017;</p><p>- 23 May 2017;</p><p>- 16 June 2017;</p><p>- 27 June 2017; and</p><p>- 10 October 2017.</p><p>The membership of the group is as follows:<table><tr><th>CRG Member</th><th>Representing</th></tr><tr><td>Dr Mair&iacute;n Ryan</td><td>HIQA and Chairperson</td></tr><tr><td>Dr Seamus O&rsquo;Reilly</td><td>RCPI - Medical Oncologist</td></tr><tr><td>Prof Tony O&rsquo;Brien</td><td>RCPI &ndash; Consultant physician in palliative medicine</td></tr><tr><td>Dr Peter Widdess-Walsh</td><td>RCPI &ndash; Consultant Neurologist</td></tr><tr><td>Dr Chris McGuigan</td><td>RCPI - Consultant Neurologist</td></tr><tr><td>Dr Bryan Lynch</td><td>RCPI &ndash; Paediatric Neurologist</td></tr><tr><td>Dr Mike Scully</td><td>Consultant Psychiatrist &ndash; College of Psychiatrists</td></tr><tr><td>Dr Brendan Conroy</td><td>Pain Specialist &amp;amp; Anaesthetist - The College of Anaesthetists of Ireland</td></tr><tr><td>Dr Des Crowley</td><td>General Practitioner - Irish College of General Practitioners</td></tr><tr><td>Dr Cora Nestor</td><td>Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland</td></tr><tr><td>Keith O'Hourihane</td><td>Pharmacist - Community Pharmacy representative</td></tr><tr><td>Professor David Smith</td><td>Ethicist - Royal College of Surgeons Ireland</td></tr><tr><td>Joan Jordan</td><td>Patient representative - European Patients Academy on Therapeutic Innovation</td></tr><tr><td>Aileen Tierney</td><td>Patient representative</td></tr><tr><td>Elaine Breslin</td><td>Health Products Regulatory Authority</td></tr><tr><td>Dr Patricia Harrington</td><td>HIQA</td></tr><tr><td>Eugene Lennon</td><td>Principal Officer, Department of Health</td></tr><tr><td>Maria Egan</td><td>Pharmacist - Department of Health</td></tr><tr><td>Vanessa Lyons</td><td>Health Products Regulatory Authority</td></tr><tr><td>Niamh O&rsquo;Rourke</td><td>National Clinical Effectiveness Committee, Department of Health</td></tr><tr><td>Eamonn Quinn</td><td>Pharmacist - Department of Health</td></tr><tr><td>Claudine Hughes</td><td>Chief Pharmacist - National Medicines Information Service</td></tr></table></p></reply>

It is transmitted to humans by bites from ticks infected with the bacteria.  The Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) of the HSE has published extensive information concerning Lyme disease on its website.  This contains information for the public on protection measures as well as information for healthcare professionals on diagnostics measures and clinical management.  The website address is:</p><p><i>www.hpsc.ie/a-z/vectorborne/lymedisease/</i>. </p><p>Lyme borelliosis was made statutorily notifiable in Ireland by the Infectious Diseases (Amendment Regulations) Regulations 2011 (S.I. no 452 of 2011).  The number of annual neuroborreliosis notifications over the last few years is as follows: 2012 - 8 cases, 2013 - 13 cases, 2014 - 18 cases, 2015 - 12 cases, and 2016 - 21 cases (provisional).  However, recent estimates suggest that, due to underreporting of mild cases, there may be up to 50-100 cases in Ireland per year.  The Weekly Infectious Disease Report, published by the HPSC on 4 October 2017, indicated that for week 39-2017 (24/9/17-30/9/17) there have been 10 cases notified so far in 2017 &ndash; a decrease of 4 on the same period last year.</p><p>Lyme borreliosis can be asymptomatic or have a range of clinical presentations.  Current best advice is that diagnosis should be made only after careful consideration of the patient's clinical history, physical findings, laboratory evidence and exposure risk.  The diverse nature of these symptoms, which can have both physical and psychological causes, are shared by many conditions which has implications for both diagnostic and treatment services.  Exposure to ticks prior to disease manifestations is necessary for the diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis.  Since an awareness or recollection of a tick-bite is not always present, however, this should not exclude the diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis.  Later stages require the use of antibody detection tests (or advanced DNA detection techniques).  Testing for Lyme Disease is provided routinely by all major, regional hospitals in Ireland.  In undertaking Lyme testing, it is essential that the results are interpreted in the light of the clinical condition of the patient.  If the result of this initial screen is equivocal, the patient's samples are referred to the U.K.'s Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory Service of Public Health England in the Porton Down facility which uses a two-tier system recommended by American and European authorities.  This involves a screening serological test followed by a confirmatory serological test.  All laboratories must undergo continuous quality assurance to ensure that the quality of the diagnostics they provide is maintained at the highest international level for human diagnostics. </p><p>Testing and treatment for Lyme borreliosis is widely available in Ireland in all major hospitals.  Lyme disease can be very successfully treated using common antibiotics.  These antibiotics are effective at clearing the rash and helping to prevent the development of complications.  Antibiotics are generally given for up to three weeks.  If complications develop, then management of patients can be undertaken by Infectious Disease consultants in regional hospitals when intravenous antibiotics may be considered as a method of treatment.</p></reply>

Two of these theatres are located on the University Hospital Galway campus and provide trauma surgical services.  The remaining two theatres are located on the Merlin Park campus and provide elective orthopaedic surgical services.</p>  <p>  My Department was advised by Saolta that a leak developed in the roof of a building in the Merlin Park hospital campus that houses the Hospital's two orthopaedic theatres on the 4 September.  At this time hospital management temporarily suspended operations for a week to facilitate the Galway University Hospital Buildings and Maintenance Unit to effect repairs. </p>  <p>  A second leak was noted on the 13 of September and Saolta advise that a multi-disciplinary team, consisting of members of the hospital's management and infection control teams and the HSE's West Estates division, took the immediate decision, in the interest of patient safety, to suspend operations in the two theatres to allow a full assessment of the infrastrucutural damage and the development of a plan to effect a complete repair of the damage. </p>  <p>  As a result, elective orthopaedic surgeries are now being deferred at Merlin Park and affected patients are being contacted by the Hospital.

It is important to note that these regulations do not in any way change the existing &lsquo;good Samaritan&rsquo; rule, which allows any member of the public to assist a person in distress to administer a medicine which has been prescribed to them.  Equally, these regulations in no way diminish the responsibility or the importance of people continuing to carry the medicines that they need to manage their own health needs.</p><p>In order for an organisation to avail of an emergency medicine without the need for a prescription, they must first register with the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) and undergo a training course accredited by the Pre Hospital Emergency Care Council (PHECC).  This register is publically available through the Emergency Medicines Portal on the HPRA website and can be found at</p><p><i>www.hpra.ie/homepage/medicines/emergency-medicines/emergency-medicines-search/results</i>.</p><p>There is currently a total of 14 organisations, and 21 accountable persons, listed on the register for Emergency Medicines.  Each organisation may register more than one site and more than one accountable person.  </p><p>Prescription-only medicines (POMs), such as adrenaline auto-injectors, are so designated because there are safety concerns about these medications.  The administration of a POM should not be done lightly and should only occur following appropriate training.  Any decision to undergo training on the use and administration of an emergency medicine rests with individual organisations.</p></reply>

However, all efforts are made to limit cancellations, particularly for clinically-urgent procedures. </p><p>Cancellation of elective procedures can occur for a variety of reasons including because a bed or the clinical team are not available, cancellations by the patient or because the patient may not be fit for surgery at the time. </p><p>Based on data provided by the NTPF on average around 3,400 elective procedures are cancelled per month.

Under this Protocol, and in line with best practice, patients should not be scheduled for treatment more than six weeks in advance.  On this basis, the HSE has advised that patients will not have been scheduled, as yet, for treatment in November and December.  Also, data on cancellations are reported to the NTPF after cancellation and therefore are not available in advance. </p><p>The HSE continues to work with hospitals to improve the management of emergency care demand and planning of elective procedures to minimise the impact on patients, as well as the number of sessions lost through cancellations or &ldquo;Do-Not Attends&rdquo;. </p><p>As the Deputy is aware, the Department of Health has commenced a Health Service Capacity Review, the findings of which are due to be published before the end of the year and will inform future capacity developments.</p></reply>

However, it should be noted that typically the HSE does not operate a 'vacancy rate', but rather records a staff turnover rate. The HSE estimates that for 2016, the adjusted turnover rate was 5.7%.  This means that, each year, at any one time, people will be moving in and out of about 1 in 20 posts across the HSE.  This can be for a range of reasons such as simply moving to a new location but still within the HSE, retirements, resignations or other types of leave such as maternity leave. When a position is vacated, work may be covered through a variety of measures such as redeployment, restructuring or reallocation of the work.  Also, it may be necessary for the duties to be covered by agency or overtime.  </p>  <p>  The need to increase the numbers of consultants, doctors, nurses and midwives in the public health service is a priority for me, my Department and the HSE against a backdrop of global shortages. </p>  <p>  At the end of August 2017 there were 2,913 whole time equivalent consultants in the public health services.  This is 103 more than the end August 2016 figure and an increase of over 700 in the past decade. At the end of August there were 6,209 whole time equivalent NCHDs, an increase of 278 on the August 2016 figure and an increase of over 1,300 in the past decade. The HSE has been focused on addressing issues associated with the creation and approval of consultant posts and successful recruitment. It is now giving effect to the report 'Towards Successful Consultant Recruitment, Appointment and Retention', completed in December 2016. It is also focused on implementing the recommendations of the 'MacCraith Group' to support the recruitment and retention of NCHDs.</p>  <p>  The Nursing Recruitment and Retention Agreement concluded with the INMO and SIPTU Nursing earlier this year committed to increasing the number of nurses and midwives by 1,224 additional permanent posts in 2017. The recent quarterly progress report (30th Sept 2017) from the HSE states that the HSE has filled 20% of the target posts.  However, the report shows that there is an increase of 739 whole time equivalents between August 2016 and August 2017.  In addition, the HSE is currently concluding the process of offering all graduating nurses and midwives permanent contracts and is focused on the conversion of agency employees into HSE direct employees. This is expected to deliver a significant increase in staff nurse numbers between now and year-end.</p>  <p>  The Public Service Pay Commission will also be examining the reasons behind the recruitment and retention issues faced by some public service grades in the next phase of its work.  This will include certain health sector grades, including doctors, nurses and radiographers.  I look forward to reading their findings in 2018.</p></reply>

Among the key responsibilities of the Commission is the establishment and maintenance of a Register of Approved Centres.  The Act also provides that the Inspector of Mental Health Services visit, inspect and report on every approved centre at least once every year. Details of these inspection reports, including compliance issues, are available on the Commission website. While the Commission has the authority to visit and inspect any other premises where mental health services are being provided, the enforcement powers of the Commission only apply in the case of approved centres.</p>  <p>  As regards the regulation of community based services by the Commission, the Deputy may be aware that the Expert Group Review of the Mental Health Act 2001 examined this issue in detail in its 2015 Report.  The Expert Group recommended that a proportionate and risk based system of inspection should be developed by the Commission. This would include a phased introduction of registration and inspection of all community mental health teams. In addition, all High, Medium and Low Support Hostels, Crisis/Respite Houses, other Residential Services, Day Hospitals and Day Centres would also be subject to inspection and enforcement by the Commission.</p>  <p>  The Expert Group also suggested that in order to enhance the standard of care that is being provided in approved centres, the revised legislation should provide for the Mental Health Commission to make standards in respect of all mental health services and to inspect against those standards. The standards would be made by way of regulations and the regulations would be underpinned by way of primary legislation.</p>  <p>  Amendments to the Mental Health Act 2001 based on the recommendations of the Expert Group Review of the Act are currently being progressed.  Government approved plans to proceed with the general scheme of a bill and officials are working on the heads of the amending bill which will legislate for the recommendations of the Review, including those relating to the proposed registration and inspection of community mental health services.  </p>  <p>  My Department and I accept the importance of advancing this work as quickly as possible and we acknowledge that it is taking longer than stakeholders in this area would like. That said, it is a comprehensive legislative undertaking which must also now take account of the provisions of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 which was enacted after completion of the Expert Group Report.  I expect the text of the General Scheme of a Bill to be progressed by the end of the year.</p></reply>

I had a constructive meeting with representatives of the Alzheimer Society on 29 August where these matters were discussed. </p>  <p>  In response to the rising number of people with dementia, currently estimated at 55,000, the Irish National Dementia Strategy was launched in December 2014 with the objective of increasing awareness, ensuring early diagnosis and intervention and developing enhanced community based services.  The Strategy emphasises that most people with dementia live in their own communities and can continue to live well and to participate in those communities for far longer than many people appreciate.</p>  <p>  In parallel with the Strategy, the Department of Health and the HSE agreed a joint initiative with the Atlantic Philanthropies to implement significant elements of the Strategy over the period 2014-2017.  This Implementation Programme represents a combined investment of &euro;27.5m, with the Atlantic Philanthropies contributing &euro;12m and the HSE &euro;15.5m. The Programme includes the provision of intensive home care packages for people with dementia, the upskilling of GPs and primary care teams in dementia diagnosis and management, and a public awareness and inclusion campaign. A National Dementia Office has been established to drive implementation of the Strategy in the HSE. </p>  <p>  I am happy to be able to confirm that my Department has recently secured funding of &euro;1.23 million under the 2017 Dormant Accounts Action Plan to support a number of dementia projects. These include post-diagnostic supports, dementia friendly communities, assistive technology libraries and further exploratory work on the development of a national dementia registry. These measures will help ensure that people with dementia can live well in their communities for as long as possible.</p>  <p>  An evaluation of the Dementia Advisers employed by the Alzheimer Society of Ireland has been commenced by the HSE. It would be appropriate to await the outcome of this evaluation before considering the appointment of additional advisers.</p>  <p>  The National Dementia Office has undertaken a project to examine the role of Key Worker for people with dementia, a commitment outlined in the National Dementia Strategy. There are a number of potential models and approaches and the NDO is currently identifying these with a view to determining a suitable approach to this action under the Strategy.</p>  <p>  The Department and the HSE are working on a mid-term review of the implementation of the National Dementia Strategy which will identify the achievements so far and set out the further work that is required to implement the Strategy over the next 12 months and beyond. The resources required for the ongoing implementation of the Strategy, including in relation to the role of key worker, can only be considered in the context of the Estimates and Budget process. The mid-term review will assist in identifying further actions required and will be helpful in the context of budgetary considerations.  </p></reply>

Significant progress has been made over recent years, underpinned by additional funding given since 2012 to develop mental health services overall.  </p><p>HSE CAMHS has standardised operation procedures which supports timely access to services, based on professional clinical assessment and prioritisation, to address the mental health needs of all children presenting to this specialist service.  Despite increasing demands overall on CAMHS, irrespective of the source of referrals, individual cases assessed as urgent receive priority.  Children in care, therefore, access CAMHS in the same way as other young people assessed as requiring this specialist clinical service.  </p><p>The development of CAMHS is a priority under the HSE Service Plan 2017.  In addition, TUSLA and the HSE published in March last a joint working protocol to support good collaboration and working relationships between both agencies.  The protocol governs how children in care access HSE related services, including transition of young people in care to adult services.  Minister Zappone and I have recently commenced a joint assessment to see how our respective Departments, in conjunction with the HSE and TUSLA, can further improve inter-agency co-operation in relation to CAMHS.  </p><p>I will continue to closely monitor progress this initiative, in the context of the agreed priorities for CAMHS set out in the HSE Service Plan for this year, including improved Access and reducing Waiting Lists.  </p></reply>

This Government remains committed to ratification of the Convention.  Before the State can ratify the Convention however, enactment of new legislation and amendment of existing legislation is required to ensure obligations will be met upon entry into force for Ireland.  The previous Government published a Roadmap in October 2015, which sets out the legislative measures needed to meet those requirements, along with declarations and reservations to be entered by Ireland on ratification.  </p><p>  Considerable progress has already been made to overcome the remaining legislative barriers to Ireland's ratification of the Convention.  The major issue at this stage is in relation to deprivation of liberty &ndash; in the case of persons in nursing homes for example, whose capacity to consent may be in doubt.  This is a sensitive and important issue and we must get it right.  Unfortunately, it is taking longer than expected to develop a proposal that is constitutionally sound and operationally effective and reasonable.  This work is being led by the Department of Justice and Equality with the assistance of the Department of Health.  </p></reply>

The construction contract for the building of the main children&rsquo;s hospital and the Paediatric Outpatients and Urgent Care Centres contract were signed in August.  The new children&rsquo;s hospital will be completed by the middle of 2022.  The Paediatric Outpatients and Urgent Care Centre at Connolly will open in 2019 followed by the second one at Tallaght in 2020 in advance of the opening of the main hospital in 2022.  Site preparatory work has continued throughout the year and the construction phase of the project has now commenced with excavation work on the main site underway.  The capital cost of the design, build and equipment programme for which the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board (NPHDB) is responsible, is &euro;983m, of which &euro;916m is Exchequer capital and &euro;67m is to be funded through commercial and philanthropy sources.  </p><p>The capital project to build the new children&rsquo;s hospital and satellite centres will only provide buildings.  The overall programme to deliver the new Children&rsquo;s Hospital entails both a complex merger of three different voluntary hospitals and a new build.  A major programme of work is underway focused on transformative service change to merge three separate hospitals while maintaining existing services, patient safety and quality at three existing sites until transition is complete.  On 29 August, the General Scheme for the Children&rsquo;s Health Bill was published on the Department of Health&rsquo;s website.  The General Scheme has been referred to the Chair of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health for pre legislative scrutiny.  <font color="#2F2F2F">This legislation will create a single statutory entity to run the new children&rsquo;s hospital.  The new body will take over the services of the existing three Dublin children&rsquo;s hospitals and run the new children&rsquo;s hospital.  The Bill provides for the establishment of a single body to govern and manage paediatric services, as well as to facilitate planning for the transition of staff and services to the outpatient and urgent care centres which will open several years ahead of the new children&rsquo;s hospital opening.  It will also support the organisation of the clinical and non-clinical services in an integrated manner across the existing sites before the move to the new facilities.  </font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">This new hospital is an extraordinary opportunity to transform paediatric services in Ireland by bringing together patients and staff from across the three existing children&rsquo;s hospitals into a single organisation as the national tertiary paediatric service with the facilities and necessary status to take on a leadership role nationally in relation to paediatric healthcare and as an international player in paediatric research and innovation.</font></p></reply>

Securing access to new and innovative medicines, in a timely manner, is a key objective of the Irish health service. However, the challenge is to deliver this objective in an affordable and sustainable way.</p>  <p>  To this end the IPHA Agreement included a specific provision in regards to biosimilar medicines whereby biological medicines receive an automatic reduction of 30% when a biosimilar equivalent comes to the market.  The HSE included a savings target of &euro;148m in the National Service Plan 2017 for  drug related savings arising from the agreement and the launch of a biosimilar for Embrel in 2016.  </p>  <p>  The National Biosimilar Medicines Policy will aim to better position Ireland to benefit from current and future biosimilar medicines.  The primary objective of the policy will be to increase biosimilar use in Ireland, by creating a robust framework in which biologicals and biosimilars can be safely, cost-effectively and confidently used in the health service.  </p>  <p>  The public consultation for this policy was closed on 29 September and my officials are currently examining the 30 responses in depth.  </p>  <p>  Having performed research on international best practice as part of the policy development process, my Department will now begin the developing an appropriate policy framework to increase the usage of biosimilar medicines in Ireland.

The HSE's Advocacy Unit acts as liaison with service and support providers and other Government Departments to facilitate access to required services.

Regional co-ordinators have been appointed to assist individuals by providing advice, information and access to local services.</p>  <p>   The ex-gratia health supports include clinical care pathways to ensure access to rapid diagnosis and treatment, multi-disciplinary assessments led by clinical experts, counselling services for both the individuals and their families, discretionary medical cards for those who have been diagnosed have been provided to allow unlimited access to GP care and any prescribed medication, physiotherapy and occupational therapy assessments.  Diagnosis of narcolepsy involves a specialised sleep study system which is currently only available in the Mater Private.  It is intended that diagnoses will be carried out in the planned Centre of Excellence for Narcolepsy in St James Hospital which has been prioritised by my Department in the 2018 Estimates process.  This service will combine a new patient referral system with access to expert consultant and advanced nursing expertise for clinical diagnosis, access to the latest neurophysiological diagnostic techniques with overnight and daytime monitoring for both in-patients and outpatients, laboratory testing, brain imaging and genetic testing.  The HSE will continue to pay for access to the services, such as dietician and psychology services, that would have been provided in the Centre of Excellence from private providers to so that none of the affected individuals miss out on receiving these supports.</p>  <p>   The Deputy has raised a query regarding an individual case.

A critical requirement for the successful establishment of an Access Programme is meaningful engagement with representative bodies, clinicians, patients, and pharmacists so that these groups are integral to the drafting of operational clinical guidance.  The Expert Group conducted a targeted consultation on the draft guidance and is due to finalise this guide shortly.  The Expert Group are also considering other operational aspects for the implementation of the Access Programme.</p>  <p>  Officials in my Department are working on secondary legislation to underpin the programme and on the logistics of sourcing suitable cannabis-based product supplies for the Irish market place.  This work will take a number of months to complete.</p>  <p>  Pending implementation of the Cannabis Access Programme, and for medical conditions that are not included in the Cannabis Access Programme, under existing legislation it is open to me as Minister to consider granting a licence to an Irish registered medical practitioner, under the Misuse of Drugs Acts, for access to medical cannabis for named patients.  The Chief Medical Officer has advised that the granting of such a licence must be premised on an appropriate application being submitted to the Department of Health, which is endorsed by a consultant who is responsible for the management of the patient and who is prepared to monitor the effects of the treatment over time.</p>  <p>  Ultimately it is the decision of the clinician, in consultation with their patient, to prescribe or not prescribe a particular treatment for a patient under their care.  As Minister for Health I have no role in this clinical decision-making process.</p>  <p>  Where a consultant requires information or clarification in relation to the licence application process, he or she should contact my Department directly.</p></reply>

The Plan will be launched by Minister Michael Creed TD and I as the development of iNAP has been a cross-Departmental initiative, requiring a cross sectoral and whole of Government approach to addressing the world wide threat of antimicrobial resistance (AMR).</p>  <p>  Ireland's first National Action Plan on AMR 2017-2020 was developed following the WHO Global Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance 2015 which required all countries to have in place a national action plan by mid-2017 and by the European Commission which also required Member States to develop a national action plan by mid-2017.  The Plan has been prepared by both the Department of Health and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM), with the guidance of the Interdepartmental AMR Consultative Committee.  This ambitious 3-year Plan has been developed in collaboration with all relevant stakeholders and covers the use of antimicrobial medicines in animal health and agriculture, as well as human health - taking a 'One Health' approach to tackling AMR, encompassing all sectors. </p>  <p>  iNAP lists Strategic Interventions and Activities, responsible bodies and priority rankings of timelines for implementation.  An implementation plan will be developed separately which will address means of tackling AMR as appropriate to each sector.  The National Patient Safety Office (NPSO) will discuss arrangements for progressing this body of work with the HSE's HCAI National Lead and relevant others; DAFM are establishing an AMR implementation plan team to oversee its body of work in addressing the interventions and activities listed proper to the agriculture and environment sectors.</p>  <p>  iNAP aims to ensure the development and implementation of multifaceted interventions which will safeguard against inappropriate prescribing, dispensing and consumption of medicines, while simultaneously promoting rational use in patients and animals that are expected to benefit from treatment.  </p></reply>

One of the key findings of the Review was that there was no difference in breastfeeding rates in hospitals that had achieved the Baby Friendly designation,and those that hadn&rsquo;t achieved designation.  In fact, while the Initiative has been in place for 20 years, only 9 of the 19 maternity hospitals have achieved the Baby Friendly designation.  This Review highlighted the need for a revised model of the Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative. </p><p>Following completion of the Review, the HSE initiated engagement with The Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative and other stakeholders on developing a revised model.  While the HSE has made the decision to pause the existing initiative and it is not being funded for 2017.</p><p>The HSE are currently progressing the development of a revised model, working with the National Women and Infants Programme, the HSE Health and Well-being Division, the HSE Lead Midwife and other key stakeholders.  The revised model will continue to support the implementation of the WHO/UNICEF 10 Steps to Successful Breastfeeding, which is the basis of the Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative.  The revised model is expected by the end of the year and will be rolled out in 2018.</p><p>A wide range of other actions are underway in implementing the HSE National Breastfeeding Action Plan 2016-2020.  These include:</p><p>- Improved Governance and health service structures;</p><p>- Breastfeeding training and skills development;</p><p>- Health service policies and practices;</p><p>- Support at all stages of the breastfeeding continuum; and</p><p>- Research, monitoring and evaluation.</p><p>Details of specific actions can be seen in the HSE National Breastfeeding Action Plan 2016-2020 on the HSE website <i>breastfeeding.ie</i>and here is the link <i></i>.</p></reply>

The Department of Health was represented on the Strategy Committee that developed the NSWG, and is also represented on the Committee overseeing its implementation, which has met on two occasions since the NSWG launch, on 13 July and 26 September, 2017.</p><p>The Department of Health is principally involved with implementation of Objective Two of the NSWG; &quot;<i>Advance the Physical and Mental Health and Wellbeing of Women and Girls</i>&quot;. </p><p>Action 2.1 of the NSWG commits to &quot;<i>Strengthen partnership work with the National Women's Council of Ireland (NWCI) in identifying and implementing  key actions to address the particular physical and mental health needs of women and girls in order to advance the integration of their needs into existing and emerging health strategies, policies and programmes through an action plan for women's health</i>&quot;.</p><p>Under this Action, the Department and the HSE will work with the NWCI, and, potentially, additional relevant organisations, including others in receipt of funding from the HSE, such that an advanced partnership approach can be developed to support the implementation of existing actions and needs outlined in the NSWG.  Progress on this Action will be supported by the Health and Well-being Programme within the Department and by the Health and Well-being Division within the HSE.</p><p>The Healthy Ireland Framework provides the over-arching context for progressing actions with regard to the health and well-being of women and girls. Healthy Ireland takes a whole of Government and whole of society approach to improving health and well-being, with a focus on prevention, reducing health inequalities and keeping people healthier for longer.</p><p>Within the context of Healthy Ireland, there are currently a number of issues where  improvements in the health and well-being of women and girls could have significant impacts; these are set out in the NSWG.</p><p>These include improving awareness and supporting healthier choices in terms of smoking cessation, safer alcohol consumption, improving uptake of the HPV vaccine, increasing physical activity participation rates in younger women and improving rates of folic acid consumption and breastfeeding.</p><p>The Healthy Ireland approach is that many organisations have a role to play in achieving the goals of Healthy Ireland and in implementing the various strategies and plans under the Healthy Ireland aegis.  Hence, the Department of Health and the HSE will continue to work in partnership with the NWCI and other relevant organisations, to support women and girls in improving their health and well-being.  An initial meeting between the HSE and NWCI has been scheduled for early October, in order to progress implementation of these aims.</p></reply>

Other European countries assess treatments in line with the statutory or administrative approaches in place in their individual country and there is no single model in place across Europe.</p><p>The 2013 Act, provides, inter alia, for the establishment and maintenance of a publicly accessible list of all medicines which may be reimbursed by the HSE pursuant to the various community drugs schemes.</p><p>The process and procedures which apply when the HSE receives an application from a manufacturer to add a medicine to the list are also set out in the 2013 Act.  Section 18 of the 2013 Act allows a supplier of an item to apply to the HSE requesting the HSE to add the item to the Reimbursement List.  The HSE shall determine the application after consulting such experts (if any) as it thinks fit by adding the item to the Reimbursement List or refusing to add the item, the subject of the application to the Reimbursement List.</p><p>Section 19(4) of the 2013 Act prohibits the HSE from making a relevant decision under section 18 &quot;except in accordance with the criteria specified in Schedule 3&quot; that apply to the item the subject of the relevant decision.</p><p>Schedule 3 sets out the criteria applicable to items and listed items for the purposes of the HSE making a relevant decision under section 18.</p><p>Part 3 of schedule 3 requires the HSE to have regard to the following criteria:</p><p>1. the health needs of the public;</p><p>2. the cost-effectiveness of meeting health needs by supplying the item concerned rather than providing other health services;</p><p>3. the availability and suitability of items for supply or reimbursement;</p><p>4. the proposed costs, benefits and risks of the item or listed item relative to therapeutically similar items or listed items provided in other health service settings and the level of certainty in relation to the evidence of those costs, benefits and risks;</p><p>5. the potential or actual budget impact of the item or listed item;</p><p>6. the clinical need for the item or listed item;</p><p>7. the appropriate level of clinical supervision required in relation to the item to ensure patient safety;</p><p>8. the efficacy (performance in trial), effectiveness (performance in real situations) and added therapeutic benefit against existing standards of treatment (how much better it treats a condition than existing therapies); and</p><p>9. the resources available to the HSE.</p><p>Section 27 of the 2013 Act allows that a &quot;relevant person aggrieved by a relevant decision may, within 30 days from the date on which the relevant person was given the relevant notification, appeal to the High Court against the relevant decision&quot;.</p><p>In legislating for the establishment and maintenance of a Reimbursement List under the 2013 Act, the Oireachtas did not legislate for an alternative independent review mechanism and I have no plans to amend the 2013 Act to provide for the establishment of one at this time.</p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their income and assets while the State pays the balance of the cost.</p>  <p>  The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.</p>  <p>  When the NHSS commenced in 2009, a commitment was made that it would be reviewed after three years.  The Report of the Review was published in July 2015. Arising out of the Review, a number of key issues have been identified for more detailed consideration across Departments and Agencies.</p>  <p>  An Interdepartmental/Agency Working Group has been established to progress the recommendations contained in the Review.  This Group is chaired by the Department of Health and includes representatives from the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the HSE, the Revenue Commissioners, and when required, the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF).  These recommendations include examining the treatment of business and farm assets for the purposes of the financial assessment element of the Scheme.  The programme for a Partnership Government has also committed to reviewing the NHSS to remove any discrimination against small businesses and family farms.  It is important to remember that the NHSS is largely underpinned by primary legislation  and changes to the NHSS will require legislative implementation.</p>  <p>  On this basis, I have requested legal advice from the office of the Attorney General regarding potential changes to the legislation that will address this matter.  My department has also been cognisant of this matter in the context of this years estimates process.  I have recently met with representatives from the I.F.A.  to discuss various strategies that may assist with addressing their members concerns and have apprised them of the current progress.  We agreed to meet again in the near future for further discussions.  I am committed to this review of the position with regard to family farms and small businesses for the purposes of the financial assessment of the scheme and I hope to be able to clarify proposed changes before the end of this year.</p></reply>

Every hospital in that Group, large and small, has a vital role to play within the Group, with smaller hospitals managing routine, urgent or planned care locally and more complex care managed in the larger hospitals.</p>  <p>  Currently, the Hospital Group is engaged in a programme of re-design work to further integrate and enhance the role of Navan hospital within the Group and to ensure that it will provide more services safely and appropriately.  A key development has been efforts to promote better integration between the Mater and Navan hospitals, in relation to day surgical activity in Navan, with surgeons from the Mater carrying out surgery in Navan.  Recent capital investments include upgrade of general theatres and the Sterile Services Unit and refurbishment of the Emergency Department.</p>  <p>  The Hospital Redesign Working Group includes representation from local GPs, the National Ambulance Service, the Mater and Navan Hospitals and from the Ireland East Hospital Group.  It is intended that the Hospital Group will continue to engage closely with all interested parties to ensure that the needs of patients, staff, the local and wider community are addressed.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that there are no immediate plans to change Emergency Department services at Navan.  Any proposed changes to Emergency Department services will only take place after stakeholder consultation in the context of overall service reorganisation in the Hospital Group and will be undertaken in a planned and orderly manner.</p>  <p>  In relation to the specific service queries raised by the Deputy I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly.</p></reply>

The helpline streamlines and consolidates the good work in the area of animal welfare already carried out by Department Staff and associated agencies of the state as well as animal welfare organisations and the public as a whole.</p><p>For a direct comparison on the figures for 2017 to date, it may be helpful to note that my Department received 512 calls for the period Jan to September inclusive in 2016.</p><p>The line is Lo-call  0761 064408 with a dedicated email address of <i>AnimalWelfare@agriculture.gov.ie</i>. </p><p>The number of calls to the Animal Welfare Helpline for 2015 to 2016 and to date in 2017 are as follows:<table><tr><th>Year  </th><th>Number of calls</th></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>687 </td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>652</td></tr><tr><td>2017 to date</td><td>526</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Thus minor cases can be tackled before they escalate and the Act is a vehicle to encourage and educate animal keepers.  This new approach means that authorised officers are addressing problems while they are relatively minor, reducing the risk of escalation.</p><p>Enforcement is a complex issue, so a progressive aspect of the Act is that it does not just focus on prosecution, which is only appropriate in cases where there have been serious welfare issues that can be clearly demonstrated to the courts.  The new enforcement approach reflects the need to intervene as early as possible in animal welfare situations.  This approach is aided by The Early Warning/Intervention System (EWS) initiative introduced by the Farm Animal Welfare Advisory Council involving, amongst others, my Department, the Irish Farmers' Association and the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals which provides a framework within which farm animal welfare problems can be identified before they become critical or overwhelming.</p><p>The Act provides for animal health and welfare notices to be issued by authorised officers.  This means that minor situations can be addressed at an early stage and that encouragement, guidance and best practice are introduced rather than just punishment.  It also provides for fixed penalty notices to be issued in minor cases and allows authorised officers to seize and re-home animals where the owner&rsquo;s capacity to care for their animals is being overwhelmed.  Furthermore the Act contains provisions that where an individual convicted of serious animal welfare offences may be banned by the courts from keeping animals, or indeed have the numbers of animals they may keep restricted.</p><p>The provisions of the Act are enforced by authorised officers of my Department, An Garda Siochana, officers of Customs and Excise and authorised officers of ISPCA and DSPCA, along with individual officers of the Turf Club and Bord na gCon.  This approach provides a large cross section of experienced officials whom are aware of welfare issues and can flag them up as and when they arise.</p><p>The table sets out the position in respect of cases initiated and prosecuted for the years 2014-16.  Ten cases have been initiated in 2017.</p><p>An Garda Sioch&aacute;na may initiate cases independently of my Department.</p><p>By date of offence<table><tr><th>Cases Under AHWA 2013 by County</th><th>Initiated - 2014</th><th>Prosecuted - 2014</th><th>Initiated - 2015</th><th>Prosecuted - 2015</th><th>Initiated - 2016</th><th>Prosecuted</th></tr><tr><td>Carlow</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>2</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>3</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Laois</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Longford</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>7</td><td>6</td><td>4</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Offaly</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>12</td><td>7</td><td>34</td><td>18</td><td>28</td><td>10</td></tr></table></p></reply>

They play a major role in farm diversification and their off-farm employment often makes a vital contribution to farm household viability.  However, the latest available data indicates that farms with a sole female farm holder registered on my Department's client database accounted for 13% of farms; 10% of eligible land; and 8% of payments.   Only 3.8% of farms are registered in joint female/male names.</p>  <p>  A number of clarifications and amendments to the Irish tax code have been driven by my Department, in conjunction with the Department of Finance, to reduce taxation measures acting as a de facto barrier to greater female participation in agriculture, and particularly to registering farms in joint names.</p>  <p>  My Department also funds the ACORNS programme to address the skills, enterprise and capability gaps of rural start up female entrepreneurs.  ACORNS, financed by my Department&rsquo;s Rural Innovation and Development Fund, is a valuable opportunity to encourage increased farm diversification through mentoring female rural entrepreneurs in a wide range of sectors.</p>  <p>  The programme provides participants with the knowledge, support and networking opportunities to meet and even exceed their business goals.  Over a hundred women have already graduated from it and many of these past participants have reported increased sales, exports and jobs as a result of the programme.  In August I was delighted to announce the launch of year 3 of the ACORNS programme with 56 new places. </p>  <p>  I wish to commend the founders of North West Women in Farming Ireland.  I am very pleased to see the emergence of "women in agriculture" groups around the country and I hope that the sector will support them.</p></reply>

This is in keeping with the Government's approach to the matter.</p>  <p>  My Department's continued priority for the agri-food sector is to ensure that the EU-UK relationship post-Brexit remains as close to current arrangements as possible, with continued free access to the UK market, without tariffs and with minimal additional customs and administrative procedures.</p></reply>

In addition advice was provided to affected farmers in dealing with the immediate challenges that arose.</p>  <p>  The principal and most widespread impacts of the floods on farms in the Inishowen Peninsula centred on damage to land, fencing, fodder and livestock.  To address these pressing issues in the most effective manner I introduced a targeted measure of assistance.  Support under this measure applies to losses of livestock, conserved fodder (Hay or Silage) and as a contribution towards the clean-up cost of agricultural lands, including repair to fences, damaged by debris washed up by the floods.   The measure is subject to the provisions of EU de minimis state aid rules in the agriculture sector and only losses not covered by insurance are eligible for consideration. </p>  <p>  While it is not possible to address all of the problems the unprecedented rainfall caused on farms in Inishowen this measure is, in my view, a most comprehensive, timely and appropriate response to the main difficulties farmers there had to deal with.   The measure closed for applications on Friday 29 September and these will now be processed as quickly as possible.</p></reply>

The Beef Data and Genomics Programme is the main support for the suckler sector and provides farmers with some &euro;300 million of funding over Rural Development Programme period. </p>  <p>  In response to significant demand, earlier this year I reopened the BDGP programme for new entrants, reflecting the success of this programme, which targets both the environmental footprint and the profitability of the suckler herd through improving the genetic merit in participating herds.  There are currently 25,669 participants.</p>  <p>  There are a number of challenges facing the beef sector including the suckler sector in the short and medium term, particularly exchange rate volatility and Brexit.  One of my priorities now is to further increase the market opportunity for Irish food and drink internationally.  We are an exporting nation, with 90% of our food produce leaving the island. By further increasing our footprint internationally we can make a contribution to mitigating the effects of Brexit and develop our agri-food sector to realise its full potential.  </p>  <p>  Live exports also play a vital role in providing an alternative market outlet for Irish farmers, including weanlings from the suckler herd at this time of year.  It is an area that I have paid particular attention to since taking up office.  Live exports for the year to date are up by over 50,000 head, or 48% compared to 2016.</p>  <p>  I remain actively committed to ensuring that Irish beef producers have the option of exporting to as many markets as possible and my Department and state agencies such as Bord Bia continue to work to ensure that any increase from the suckler herd can deliver a viable return to the primary producer and protect the national suckler herd.   </p>  <p>  Turning to tillage, this is a very important sector , and the Deputy will be aware of a number of measures  introduced to underpin the tillage sector and promote its growth into the future. </p>  <p>  Among these was a targeted crop loss support measure to assist growers most affected by the wet weather harvest conditions of September 2016. </p>  <p>  In addition to the support measure for those worst affected, I also introduced the Agriculture Cashflow Support Loan Scheme which I specifically extended to include the Tillage and Horticulture sector.  I have been advised by the banks that all of the  &euro;150m is committed and is in the process of being drawn down.  I am pleased at the very positive reaction by farmers, including tillage farmers, to the Scheme, which has proved that significant demand exists for low cost flexible finance.</p>  <p>  As a further support to tillage farmers I also introduced the Tillage Investment Scheme under TAMS II which opened for online applications earlier this year.  The second tranche closed on 6 October 2017.  There was a significant level of interest in investments under this measure particularly in relation to precision equipment to improve profitability at farm level, with a total number of 490 applications received in the first tranche for the tillage sector alone. 450 approvals have now issued in respect of these and payments and approvals are issuing on an ongoing basis.</p>  <p>  Additionally, a range of other supports provide vital income and investment support to both sectors including BPS, ANC, GLAS and TAMS.</p></reply>

This will be a key factor in protecting the interests of our fishing industry in the months and years ahead.  I am glad to say that Michel Barnier has fully agreed with this assessment and other directly impacted Member States are expressing a similar position.   </p>  <p>  Existing access arrangements and percentage shares of fish stocks have been agreed by all EU Member States, including the UK, over many years and were most recently affirmed in 2014 when the current Common Fisheries Policy came into force.  I see no basis whatsoever for the kind of reordering of the current arrangements apparently sought by some in the UK.</p>  <p>  If and when the UK finally leaves the EU they should equally retain their current shares and entitlements.  We are not asking that they lose their rights of access to EU waters or face any reductions in their current shares and see no reason why we should lose ours.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, there has been an enormous amount of work on this issue in terms of analysing potential impacts for our fishing industries under the various possible scenarios since well before the UK referendum.  This work has been carried out by my Department, the Marine Institute and BIM  in close cooperation with the fishing industry.</p>  <p>  At EU level there have been, and will continue to be, regular contacts with the Barnier Task Force, Fisheries Commissioner Vella and like minded Member States at all levels.  In all of these contacts I have stressed the importance of a unified EU front, our determination to maintain all of our current rights and the absolute necessity to avoid and separation of fisheries issues from the wider negotiations.  </p>  <p>  In conclusion, I would like to assure the Deputy that I will continue to work to have fisheries inextricably linked to the overall negotiations.  I will also be unequivocal in opposing any dilution of our existing EU quota shares, including protecting the benefit to Ireland of the Hague Preferences, and any limitations on our existing rights of access.</p></reply>

I see lower cost finance as an effective way of doing this and we developed the &ldquo;Agriculture Cashflow Support Loan Scheme&rdquo; with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI).</p>  <p>  The Scheme made &euro;150 million available to farmers at interest rates of 2.95%.  Distributed and administered through AIB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank, the Scheme provides farmers with a low cost, flexible source of working capital, allowing them to pay down more expensive forms of short-term debt, ensuring the ongoing financial sustainability of viable farming enterprises.</p>  <p>  The SBCI have recently reported that, to the end of August 2017, there have been 3,920 loan drawdowns amounting to a total of &euro;128,199,316.  This is an average loan amount of &euro;32,704.  Some 57% of the loans are for terms of 3 years or more.  The participating banks have advised that all of the remaining &euro;150m is committed and is in the process of being drawn down.  I am pleased at the very positive reaction by farmers to the Scheme, which has proved that significant demand exists for low cost flexible finance.</p>  <p>  I have met with the Chief Executives of the participating banks to discuss this and other access to finance issues relating to the agri-food sector.  I have asked the banks to respond positively to the demand that has been demonstrated by reducing interest rates and providing more flexible terms for cash flow loans in the future.</p>  <p>  I believe that this Scheme demonstrates the importance of lower cost and more flexible finance as a response to competitive pressures, and I hope that it will be a model for possible future measures.</p></reply>

The BDGP was approved by the Commission as an agri-environment scheme under Ireland's RDP.  As with all agri-environment schemes payment is made on a per hectare basis.</p>  <p>  Under the terms of the Commission approval 2014 was specified  as the reference year for the Programme and payment is calculated on the basis of the number of cows that calved in the herd in 2014.  In certain very limited circumstances 2015 could be used where 2014 did not reflect the applicant's usual farming practice, e.g. where there had been a disease outbreak.</p>  <p>  The number of calved cows in 2014 was divided by a rate of 1.5 to determine the amount of the maximum payable area (MPA).  In order to receive payment in respect of the full MPA the applicant must have had this amount of land declared on the Single Payment Scheme (SPS) application in 2014.  While 78 cows calved in this herd in 2014 the amount of land declared on the SPS application amounted to 38 hectares and therefore the MPA for this applicant was established as being 38 hectares.  While a farm partnership was entered into in 2016 which resulted in  additional land being available under the partnership it is not possible to increase the land over and above that declared in 2014.  The reference number and MPA remain constant for the duration of the programme, subject to the land being retained.</p>  <p>  It is not possible to increase the reference number or MPA during the lifetime of the BDGP.</p></reply>

This would be very difficult in the context of an innovative scheme which has undergone an approval process relatively recently.

In tandem with opportunity, challenges such as volatility must be faced. </p>  <p>  The period between mid-2014 through to Q4 2016 was extremely challenging for the dairy sector. Factors contributing to global price volatility in 2015 and 2016 included the Russian Ban and the softening of Chinese demand on one side, coupled with increased production among key global producers including the EU on the supply side. </p>  <p>  While the outlook in 2017 has been more positive, there are a number of factors which continue to contribute to price volatility in the sector, including political factors outside our control.  Notwithstanding challenges on the horizon, amongst which Brexit is paramount, stakeholders in the Irish dairy sector are well placed to benefit from expanding global demand.</p>  <p>  In terms of market returns to primary producers, raw milk prices remain in the region of 35 to 36 cents per litre which is ahead of the EU average and over 50% ahead of where prices were this time last year.  Peak production months have passed in Ireland and by end September circa 80% plus of the average dairy farmer&rsquo;s annual production has been completed.  This combination of good prices and stronger supply means that 2017 can be expected to be a very good year for Irish dairy farmers in terms of market returns for their raw milk, which is welcome in the context of a very difficult 2016 in particular.</p>  <p>  I remain conscious of the pressure volatility in dairy markets can exert on farmers and I can assure the Deputy that I am committed to utilising measures at our disposal, including EU market measures such as intervention, aids to private storage and exceptional market measures, as necessary.  The legislative provisions underpinning these measures were finalised during the Irish Presidency of the European Union in 2013.  </p>  <p>  I have already outlined the measures taken to assist Irish  farmers, including  dairy farmers,  on a number of occasions.  These include the launch of a &euro;150 million low-cost Agriculture Cashflow Support Loan Scheme, increased funding under the Rural Development Programme, as well as the allocation of additional &euro;6.75 million to Bord Bia to provide supports to companies in terms of diversification of markets.  My Department continues to support and fund initiatives that help Irish farmers verify the high standards and quality of their production, including Origin Green and the Sustainable Dairy Assurance Scheme.</p>  <p>  In recent years dairy markets have been characterised by periods of both high and low prices and the challenge is to ensure that farmers have the tools available to manage their enterprises through the more difficult periods.  The industry itself has a critically important role to play and I welcome initiatives such as fixed price and margin contracts, which offer producers stability for a proportion of their supplies of milk going forward. In our taxation policy, we have made it possible for farmers to average their income over a period of five years. </p>  <p>  I will continue to carefully monitor market developments and engage with the EU Commission, with other member states and with industry stakeholders to ensure that measures are in place to help farmers through periods of uncertainty and volatility. </p>  <p>  I recently hosted the fifth meeting of the Dairy Forum with key stakeholders from the Irish dairy sector to discuss how best to future proof the sector by formulating a cohesive approach to dealing with ongoing challenges.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that I will continue to work closely with the dairy sector, with EU colleagues and International counterparts to ensure the development and maintenance of a sustainable dairy sector in Ireland.</p></reply>

The total allocation for the TAMS II Scheme in the 2014-2020 Rural Development Plan is &euro;395m. </p><p>The online payment claim system for TAMS II opened in July 2016. Payment claims for approved investments continue to be submitted to this system and processed for payment.  These claims were received and processed at an average rate of &euro;1m per week in the past few weeks following the busy construction period over the summer months. </p><p>To date 11,400 approvals have issued since the Schemes were launched in 2015 with an estimated commitment value  of &euro;172m.  Payments amounting to over &euro;24.2m have issued in respect of 1,762 payment claims received from the approved applicants.  The total number of payment claims received to date is over 2,300. This means that there are 9,000 approvals out there with farmers under this scheme where payment applications have not been received by my Department.  It is only when these applications are received that we can make payments.  I would strongly urge all approved participants in the Scheme who have completed their approved works to submit their payment claims to the online system so that payments can issue without delay. </p><p>My Department has contributed significantly to the support of the Horticulture sector through its grant aid Scheme of Investment Aid for the Development of the Commercial Horticulture Sector.  In 2016, &euro;3.85 million in grant aid was paid to horticultural growers.  The grant aid paid supported some &euro;9.7 million in investment by these growers.</p><p>Under the 2017 Scheme of Investment Aid for the Development of the Commercial Horticulture Sector, the budget is &euro;5 million. Payments under this scheme are being made as early as possible, so as to try to alleviate any financial pressure that growers are currently facing.</p><p>The scheme assists capital investments on farms to promote the specialisation and diversification of on-farm activities, improve the quality of products and facilitate environmentally friendly practices and improve working conditions on farms.  The scheme has made an immense contribution to the growth and development of the horticulture sector across all areas &ndash; protected crops, field vegetables, nursery crops, mushrooms, soft fruit, apples and beekeeping.</p><p>To ensure ongoing support for the sector, my Department has extended, under EU sanction, the Scheme to run until 31 December 2019.</p><p>The EU Producer Organisation Scheme is also a vital support for horticultural growers.  This scheme provides an important mechanism for growers to achieve greater bargaining power in the marketplace by becoming part of a larger supply base.  Between 2005 and 2016, a total of &euro;44.6 million was paid to producer organisations as part of the EU Producer Organisation scheme.</p></reply>

That is entirely a matter for the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht to decide upon, as is the provision of funds for any such purpose.  My Department does not fund the National Parks and Wildlife Service.   </p>  <p>  That said, many of these designations are for species or habitats whose conservation is encouraged under various schemes operated by my Department, such as GLAS, the Burren Programme or some of the newer locally-led schemes being rolled out at present like the Hen Harrier Scheme.  Farmers in these areas have an opportunity to avail of a range of support packages under these schemes which can provide an important additional income stream for those affected.</p></reply>

I see lower cost finance as an effective way of doing this and we developed the &ldquo;Agriculture Cashflow Support Loan Scheme&rdquo; with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI). </p>  <p>  The Scheme made &euro;150 million available to farmers at interest rates of 2.95%.  Distributed and administered through AIB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank, the Scheme provides farmers with a low cost, flexible source of working capital, allowing them to pay down more expensive forms of short-term debt, ensuring the ongoing financial sustainability of viable farming enterprises.</p>  <p>  The SBCI have recently reported that, to the end of August 2017, there have been 3,920 loan drawdowns amounting to a total of &euro;128,199,316.  This is an average loan amount of &euro;32,704. Some 57% of the loans are for terms of 3 years or more.  The participating banks have advised that all of the remaining &euro;150m is committed and is in the process of being drawn down.

I have asked the banks to respond positively to the demand that has been demonstrated by reducing interest rates and providing more flexible terms for cash flow loans in the future.</p>  <p>  I believe that this Scheme demonstrates the importance of lower cost and more flexible finance as a response to competitive pressures, and I hope that it will be a model for possible future measures.</p></reply>

In addition to these value increases, the dairy industry targeted a 50% increase in milk production by 2020, to be progressed following the abolition of milk quotas in April 2016.  </p>  <p>  Progress on those targets is monitored and reviewed on an ongoing basis.  The latest data available show growth of 36% for both primary production and exports (based on 2016 data), and 47% for value added (latest available data 2014), versus the baseline period, demonstrating excellent progress.</p>  <p>  Food Wise 2025, the new ten year strategy for the agrifood sector published in July 2015, is the successor to the Food Harvest strategy.  It identifies the opportunities and challenges facing the sector and provides an enabling strategy that will allow the sector to grow and prosper.  Food Wise includes more than 400 specific recommendations, spread across the cross-cutting themes of sustainability, innovation, human capital, market development and competitiveness; as well as specific sectoral recommendations.</p>  <p>  If these recommendations are implemented, the expert committee which drew up the Food Wise 2025 Strategy believes that the following growth projections are achievable by 2025: increasing the value of agrifood exports by 85% to &euro;19 billion; increasing value added in the sector by 70% to in excess of &euro;13 billion; and increasing the value of primary production by 65% to almost &euro;10 billion.  With regard to employment, Food Wise foresees the creation of 23,000 additional jobs in the agrifood sector all along the supply chain from primary production to high value added product development. Realising these growth projections will be challenging, but I am confident that they can be achieved. </p>  <p>  In July this year, I launched the second annual progress report of Food Wise 2025: Steps to Success 2017.  Food Wise Steps to Success showed that, of the 368 detailed actions which were due to commence by 2017 or are on-going actions; 46% have been achieved or substantial action has been undertaken; and a further 49% have commenced and are progressing well.  This shows good progress but I will press on in getting as many actions as possible complete within the next year.</p></reply>

These Directives also include rules on how Member States should monitor, assess and manage ambient air quality.  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is tasked with co-ordinating and managing the monitoring programme.</p><p>Under the Directives, EU Member States must designate &quot;Zones&quot; for the purpose of managing air quality.  For Ireland, four zones were defined in the Air Quality Standards Regulations, 2011.  The zones in place in Ireland in 2017 are Zone A: the Dublin conurbation, Zone B: the Cork conurbation, Zone C: comprising 23 large towns in Ireland with a population of more than 15,000, and Zone D: the remaining area of Ireland.</p><p>Ireland currently has a nationwide network of 30 monitoring stations which measure levels of air pollutants in the four zones.  This information is delivered to the public in near real-time at<i>www.airquality.epa.ie</i>.  The numbers and locations of the monitoring equipment for each pollutant are determined by the requirements of the Directives for ambient air monitoring in each zone. Currently Dublin has 14 monitoring stations. </p><p>The Agency's most recent annual air quality report was published in November 2016 and provides an assessment of air quality in Ireland for 2015.While the EPA does not disaggregate diesel emissions from other pollutant sources, emissions of NO<sub>2</sub>, a significant pollutant arising from diesel use, were monitored at 15 locations across Ireland for the 2015 report.  Values for all these sites were below the EU annual limit value.  The report cautions however that NO<sub>2</sub>values may increase in line with growth in economic activity in the State.</p><p>Following a comprehensive review of the current status of ambient air quality monitoring in Ireland, the EPA has developed a new national Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Programme (AAMP) under Section 65 of the EPA Act.  My Department will provide the required funding to the Agency for this development, which will significantly strengthen the capacity and capability of the monitoring network to provide more comprehensive, localised air quality information linked to public health advice.</p></reply>

The purpose of the Geothermal Energy Bill is to provide a legislative framework for the vesting, licensing and regulation of the development of geothermal energy.   The Geothermal Energy Bill will define geothermal energy in line with the standard European definition (&ldquo;energy stored in the form of heat beneath solid earth&rdquo;) as set out in Directive 2009/28/EC on renewable energy.  It will vest ownership of geothermal energy in the State, giving practical effect to the assertion of State ownership of natural resources in Article 10.1 of the Irish Constitution.</p>  <p>  Draft Heads of Bill were originally completed in July 2010 and approved by the Government for referral to the Attorney General and the Parliamentary Counsel for detailed drafting.  The Department has had ongoing discussions and consultation with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel since then, and significant progress has been made on the drafting of the Bill. There are currently over 150 sections in the draft Bill. </p>  <p>  Many of the provisions of the Geothermal Energy Bill were based on aspects of the Minerals Development Bill, particularly in the areas of exploration and licensing.  The Minerals Development Act 2017 was enacted on 26 July 2017. Once the secondary legislation and commencement of the Minerals Development Act 2017 is finalised, the drafting process for the Geothermal Energy Bill will recommence.  The expected time for this is 2018, with publication of the Geothermal Energy Bill envisaged for the second half of 2018.</p></reply>

If this fails to resolve matters, customers can and should refer a complaint to ComReg, which will investigate the service provider's compliance with its contractual obligations.</p>  <p>  However, notwithstanding the independence of ComReg, I recognise the frustration experienced across Ireland where telecommunications networks are not always delivering the services people expect.  In that regard, I specifically included in the Programme for Government a commitment to a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce.  In July 2016, I established the Taskforce to identify immediate solutions to broadband and mobile phone coverage deficits and investigate how better services could be provided to consumers, prior to the full build and roll-out of the network planned under the National Broadband Plan State intervention.  The December 2016 report of the Taskforce is available on my Department's website. </p>  <p>  The Taskforce worked with Departments, local authorities, ComReg, State agencies, the telecoms industry and other key stakeholders to produce the report which contains 40 actions to alleviate some of the telecommunications deficits across Ireland.  To maintain momentum, I established an Implementation Group to drive and monitor implementation of the actions, bringing together all key stakeholders responsible for delivery.  This Group will report on progress every 90 days and has met twice this year, in March and July, with another meeting due to take place in the coming weeks.  Two quarterly progress reports have been published so far, which are available on my Department's website.  These demonstrate that good progress has been made in delivering the actions.  I am also pleased at the sustained level of engagement between action owners and industry. </p>  <p>  This engagement was clearly demonstrated last Friday in Athlone where myself and Minister Kyne jointly hosted the first National Stakeholder Forum.  This Forum arose out of a recognition by the Taskforce that, given the rapid pace of technology and the emergence of new equipment and solutions to deliver telecommunications services, it was critical that an opportunity be afforded to stakeholders to raise concerns on impediments to the rollout of services.  At last week&rsquo;s Forum, the opportunity was taken not only to discuss the issues impacting on such rollout, but also to suggest new recommended actions to the Taskforce that will assist in providing improved services to consumers and in preparing for the roll-out of the new NBP network once contracts are in place.  The Forum will also inform the review to be conducted prior to completion of an annual report by the Implementation Group for end 2017.</p>  <p>  In addition, following regulations which I signed last year, ComReg&rsquo;s announcement earlier this year of the results of its auction for the 3.6GHz radio spectrum band, will mean an 86% increase in spectrum capacity to meet the growing demand for mobile and wireless broadband services across rural and urban areas.  The award of 15 year licences for the rights of use in this band will provide stability and create future investment certainty.  Spectrum was also awarded in lots covering 9 urban and rural regions across Ireland.</p>  <p>  The very significant commercial investment by mobile operators has resulted in improved services, with at least one operator now having in excess of 90% 4G population coverage.</p></reply>

However, the An Post Group lost &euro;13.7 million in 2016 with the core mails business losing over &euro;30m<font color="#1F497D">. </font>An Post has entered a period of structural change and decline in activity mainly due to the impact of e-substitution on mail volumes and post office transactions.  This has had a significant impact on the post office network and I understand that overall activity levels are down approximately 15% since 2013.  In addition annual payments have reduced by up to 20% in some offices.  There is no doubt that the environment in which the post office operates is changing and the network needs to change to thrive, particularly with the move to digital transactions.  </p><p>As Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, I am responsible for the postal sector including the governance of An Post.  Operational matters relating to the company&rsquo;s retail business, including the post office network, are matters for the Board and management of An Post.  I appreciate that there is concern regarding the potential closure of post offices and the potential number involved.  This has been exacerbated by the media coverage on this issue over the past week.  I would again reiterate that no definitive decision has been made by An Post regarding post office closures.  The post office plays an important role in serving the needs of business and domestic customers alike and this is at the forefront of An Post&rsquo;s mandate.  Government remains fully committed to a sustainable post office network which it sees as a key piece of economic and social infrastructure for both rural and urban. </p><p>The fundamental review of the company is being undertaken  to identify the strategic changes and restructuring necessary to put the company on a sound financial footing.  An Post has recognised the realities of the current postal environment and is transforming how it does business to be a better fit for the future of e-commerce where the average spend per consumer in Ireland is forecast to nearly double in the next five years.  It is imperative that the network be restructured into a viable sustainable, modern and vibrant network for the future, capable of adapting to the changing environment in which it operates.  Inevitably, the scale of the envisaged change will impact on individual postmasters and some postmasters, who have given long and dedicated service to their local communities and to An Post, may find it a challenge to adopt to a very significant renewal programme.  Any changes in this area will have to be the subject of negotiation between An Post and the postmasters.  I continue to encourage An Post to continue to work closely with all parties to find an agreed solution to the renewal of the network.</p><p>I have met the Irish Postmasters&rsquo; Union and was interested to hear their perspective on how to renew what continues to be a very valuable resource for both urban and rural communities.</p><p>Until such time as the review is finalised and assessed it is not be possible to comment further. Government will be briefed once a definitive strategy has been agreed.</p></reply>

Kildare County Council submitted an expression of interest for a pool in Maynooth but because the Council did not have chargeable title to the proposed facility, that expression of interest was invalid. </p>  <p>  There are four swimming pool projects in the current programme and the priority in 2017 is on progressing these projects. </p>  <p>  In relation to the future funding of swimming pools, my Department is currently finalising a review of national sports policy.  This includes a specific focus on how Government should fund sports facilities including swimming pools in the years ahead.  I would hope to be in a position to publish the new sports policy later this year.</p></reply>

However, the persistent decline in the numbers visiting from Great Britain continues to be a concern.  The fall in the value of sterling against the euro following the Brexit vote in the UK has been the primary factor in this.</p>  <p>  Tourism Ireland is responsible for marketing Ireland as a tourist destination in overseas markets.  I am informed that it has implemented a series of actions in the GB market to address the implications of Brexit and the fall in the value of sterling.  For example, a greater focus has been placed on "culturally curious" visitors, who are less impacted by currency fluctuations and highlighting off-season breaks and value offers.  I am aware also that Tourism Ireland has increased publicity and trade visits for the border area, where the impact of the drop in British visitors has been most keenly felt.  As well as this, it is pursuing a market diversification strategy.  This aims to attract more visitors from markets which deliver longer stays and, therefore, higher revenue returns.  This strategy is bearing fruit as evidenced by the significant increase in visitors from North America and other markets thus far in 2017. </p>  <p>  F&aacute;ilte Ireland has recently launched its Brexit Response Programme.  Its new 'Get Brexit Ready' programme offers a suite of industry supports, designed to help businesses struggling with the loss of trade created by Brexit.  The programme allows individual businesses to self-assess their exposures and risks and provides a range of interventions to match their needs.</p></reply>

However, the Council was not successful in securing funding at that time.  I understand that since then DCC have progressed a section of the route with the support of local groups and DCC would be best placed to update the Deputy on the current status of the route.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that Donegal is benefitting from a number of cross-border greenways that are being funded by my Department, the Department for Infrastructure (Northern Ireland) and the EU. Lifford, Muff and Buncrana will all benefit from these INTERREG VA projects. </p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that my Department recently undertook a public consultation process to inform the development of a new Greenways Strategy.  My officials are currently reviewing the many submissions received from both citizens and stakeholders including one received from Donegal County Council.  My Department is aiming to have the new Strategy completed by the end of the year.  Following completion, it is expected that a new round of funding for greenway infrastructure will be announced.</p></reply>

The SEAI estimates that less than 5% of transport emissions came from the public transport fleet in 2015 (buses, rail and taxis).  It is reliance on private car travel that represents the most considerable challenge, producing over 50% of overall transport emissions. </p>  <p>  Moving to a low carbon society represents a significant challenge for Ireland&rsquo;s expanding transport sector where the use of fossil fuels and individual travel patterns are firmly established.  Decarbonising transport will require a significant step-change in how we travel, how we do business and the types of fuels and technologies we employ. </p>  <p>  To date, a number of successful measures have already been introduced to reduce transport sector emissions including: sustained investment in the public and sustainable transport network to increase capacity and promote modal shift; implementation of EU regulations limiting tail pipe emissions; redesigning the Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT) and motor tax regimes to promote low carbon emitting vehicles; incentives to encourage alternative fuel and technologies; and the introduction of a Biofuel Obligation Scheme.  Furthermore, under the commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government a dedicated Low Emission Vehicle Taskforce was established to consider the range of measures and options available to Government to accelerate the uptake of alternatively powered vehicles. </p>  <p>  The transport sector must and will continue to play a strong role in contributing to our national emissions reduction effort.  Ireland's welcome return to economic growth has brought with it an increase in transport demand and, without intervention, transport emissions will unquestionably continue to rise.  The transport sector is faced with the challenge of reducing greenhouse gas emissions without hindering social improvement or financial recovery.</p>  <p>  To decarbonise transport a diverse range of measures is required, key among them being increasing public transport capacity, promoting sustainable travel and modal shift, and encouraging the uptake and deployment of cleaner alternative fuels and technologies.  This is reflected in the wide-ranging set of transport mitigation measures included in the National Mitigation Plan and it is anticipated that these measures will develop further as climate research and technological innovations progress.</p>  <p>  In suitable urban areas I am strongly committed to meeting increasing travel demand through enhanced public transport capacity and encouraging more cycling and walking journeys - knows as "active travel" - and, within the context of the Government's budgetary policy and competing expenditure needs, I am working to be able to invest more in such infrastructure and services over time. </p>  <p>  Outside urban areas - where dependence on private cars is strongest and where systems of public transport and active travel offer less realistic potential to addressing travel needs effectively and efficiently - a different solution must be sought, and here alternative fuels and technologies currently offer the most feasible and cost-effective answer. </p></reply>

As of the 31st of September there were 6,536 vehicles registered under the 'State Owned, Emergency Vehicles and Rescue Vehicles' tax classification.  The Deputy should note that this definition potentially omits some state / public vehicles that are not registered under this tax exemption category.  Based on this definition, the following table summaries the number of hybrid and fully electric &quot;State Vehicles&quot; registered from 2015.</p><p>As the Deputy is aware, to date the uptake of electric vehicles (EVs) in Ireland has been relatively low.  There are a range of factors accepted internationally as being barriers to transition to EV technology including limited vehicle choice, range anxiety and low consumer awareness.  This slower than anticipated transition to EVs is not Ireland-specific and does not indicate a lack of ambition or support.  Increasing range performances, technology advancements, greater affordability and improved consumer choice will be the greatest levers in triggering large-scale change.</p><p>The Government is, of course, very supportive of the transition to EVs.  My Department and the Department of Communications, Climate Action and the Environment, have jointly convened an interdepartmental Low-Emitting Vehicles (LEV) Task Force to consider a full suite of potential measures to expedite the deployment of low carbon technologies under a commitment outlined in the &quot;Programme for a Partnership Government&quot;. </p><p>It may interest the Deputy to note that as part of Working Group 1 of the LEV Taskforce &ndash; chaired by my Department - the role of public sector leadership in encouraging EV uptake is being examined.

However, the persistent decline in the numbers visiting from Great Britain continues to be a concern.  The fall in the value of sterling against the euro following the Brexit vote in the UK has been the primary factor in this.</p>  <p>  Tourism Ireland is responsible for marketing Ireland as a tourist destination in overseas markets.  I am informed that it has implemented a series of actions in the GB market to address the implications of Brexit and the fall in the value of sterling.  For example, a greater focus has been placed on "culturally curious" visitors, who are less impacted by currency fluctuations and highlighting off-season breaks and value offers.  I am aware also that Tourism Ireland has increased publicity and trade visits for the border area. As well as this, it is pursuing a market diversification strategy.  This aims to attract more visitors from markets which deliver longer stays and, therefore, higher revenue returns. This strategy is bearing fruit as evidenced by the significant increase in visitors from North America and other markets thus far in 2017. </p>  <p>  F&aacute;ilte Ireland has recently launched its Brexit Response Programme. It's new 'Get Brexit Ready' programme offers a suite of industry supports, designed to help businesses struggling with the loss of trade created by Brexit.  The programme allows individual businesses to self-assess their exposures and risks and provides a range of interventions to match their needs.</p>  <p>  In terms of budgets, allocations for 2018 will be made available in Budget 2018.  I have highlighted various funding priorities for my Department for 2018 in my discussions with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, including Brexit related priorities.</p></reply>

The latter would involve a route that passes through Northern Ireland. </p>  <p>  In relation to the national element as Minister for Transport, Tourism &amp;amp; Sport, I have responsibility for overall policy and funding in relation to the national roads programme.  The planning, design and implementation of individual national road projects is a matter for Transport Infrastructure Ireland under the Roads Acts 1993-2015 in conjunction with the local authorities concerned. </p>  <p>  As regards the regional road aspect of the proposal, the improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads in its area is a statutory function of local authorities in accordance with the provisions of Section 13 of the Roads Act, 1993.  Works on such roads are a matter for the relevant local authority to be funded from its own resources supplemented by State road grants.  </p>  <p>  The Capital Plan published in September 2015 provides for the gradual build up in expenditure on the maintenance and improvement of the road network over a 7 year period.  The bulk of expenditure is scheduled to be spent on maintenance of the road network with some limited investment in new projects.  My Department has provided funding to Cavan County Council (acting as lead authority with Monaghan and Louth County Councils) with over &euro;2m in the period 2007-2014 to progress the regional road element of the project to preliminary design.  At an estimated cost of &euro;150 million, unfortunately it was not possible to include the East-West Link in the Capital Plan.</p></reply>

The National Transport Authority (NTA) held a public consultation process to start a national debate on the current and future role of rail transport in Ireland. The public consultation process was launched with the publication of a Rail Review 2016 Report, which examined the funding required to support the heavy rail network now and into the future, together with a consultation document "The Role of Rail in Ireland and Funding its Delivery". </p>  <p>  Over 300 submissions were received by the NTA in response to that consultation process which have now all been examined and the NTA is preparing a report of those submissions, which I received in just the last couple of days and will now be examining.</p>  <p>  As noted within the Rail Review Report, its analysis predates the finalisation of the National Planning Framework which is being developed at present under the leadership of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government. Once agreed by Government, the approach which that Framework adopts toward land-use planning and settlement patterns for the country will have significant impacts on the potential of rail and other transport infrastructure and services into the future. No decisions have been made on future changes to the rail network, including any decisions relating to the Western Rail Corridor.</p>  <p>  Finally, as the Deputy has pointed out, the Programme for Government also commits that no measures will be taken to prevent the future reactivation of the Western Rail Corridor for rail use.  I will ensure that this commitment is fulfilled.  </p></reply>

The decisions on the transport elements of the Capital Plan were framed by the conclusions reached in my Department&rsquo;s Strategic Investment Framework for Land Transport. Based on the findings in that report it is envisaged that maintenance and renewal of the road network will continue to be the main priority over the next period and the bulk of the roads capital budget, approximately &euro;4.4 billion, is earmarked for such essential work with a further &euro;600 million allocated for implementation of the PPP road programme which is already underway. The Plan also provides for a limited number of road improvement projects to address specific issues such as bottlenecks and port connectivity. </p>  <p>  Statutory responsibility for the improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads lies with the relevant local authority, in accordance with the provisions of Section 13 of the Roads Act 1993. Works on those roads are funded from the local authority's own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is a matter for the local authority. Similarly, within the budget available to it the prioritisation of expenditure in respect of national roads is a matter for TII.</p>  <p>  Local authorities  are responsible for mapping and collating available collision data on regional and local roads. Where analysis shows that engineering measures may assist in reducing the collision risk at a particular location then any local authority which is not fully self funding in terms of roads (under the new Local Property Tax regime) may apply to my Department for funding under the Safety Improvement works programme. Each year monies are made available to local authorities for such works with priority given to works that are considered to be most effective in reducing collisions. </p>  <p>  Collision data for national roads is mapped and collated by Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII).</p>  <p>  As regards the possibility of additional funding within the Plan period, I have sought extra funding for a package of measures under the Capital Plan Review process. The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has, however, yet to decide on specific additional allocations. </p></reply>

This analysis indicates that while the country as a whole has sufficient stock of tourist accommodation, there are capacity constraints in areas of high tourist traffic at times of peak demand and additional capacity is required in certain parts of the country, particularly Dublin city. </p>  <p>  In this context, F&aacute;ilte Ireland commissions periodic assessments of hotel accommodation in Dublin.  Although the results confirm the current shortage, they also indicate that there should be sufficient stock - whether being developed currently or being planned - to meet projected demand in the future, with the bulk of new stock due to come on-stream after 2018.</p>  <p>  With specific regard to factors within my Department's and F&aacute;ilte Ireland's remit, revised hotel Regulations were introduced last year in response to consumer preferences and in order to boost the economic rationale for investment in hotel development.  The changes set out in these Regulations should make investment even more attractive by allowing hotel operators provide more rooms and operate at a lower cost base, thereby improving hotel capacity, competitiveness and profitability.  Consumers should also benefit in terms of increased room capacity, competition and range of accommodation.</p></reply>

The funding schemes support national and local youth work involving approximately 1,400 youth work staff working in youth services and communities throughout the country. </p>  <p>  In 2017, &euro;57.4 m has been allocated in current funding to support the provision of youth services, an increase of &euro;5.5m on 2016.  The additional funding is being used for programmes that target disadvantaged young people and to assist national youth organisations in their work to support local voluntary youth services.</p>  <p>  Earlier this year, I was pleased to approve funding of &euro;800,000 for the establishment of new youth projects and for the augmentation of a small number of existing youth services to meet new challenges arising from population increases.  This additional investment is being provided in regions of the country where there is a pressing need for services to meet the needs of young people. </p>  <p>  Each of the sixteen Education and Training Boards, including Laois and Offaly ETB, was invited to nominate locations within their catchment areas for the establishment of new services and to nominate a project or service to be considered for augmentation.  In total twenty-eight applications for new services were received, including an application for a new service for Laois.</p>  <p>  Based on the recommendations of a specially convened appraisal committee, and given the very limited resources available for the scheme, I approved the establishment of nine new targeted youth services across the country and the expansion of a further seven to respond to new demand from increased population and needs of young people.</p>  <p>  The application in respect of Laois was, unfortunately, not successful on this occasion.

These increases reflect the emphasis being placed on developing a quality service with appropriately supported staff. </p>  <p>  Although my Department has been successful in securing additional funding for this sector over the past two budgets, as outlined above, I do acknowledge that much more must be done if we are truly to have affordable, accessible, quality childcare and continue to improve both the affordability and quality of childcare.  To this end I am currently engaged with my Government colleagues with a view to securing additional investment for the childcare sector in Budget 2018.</p>  <p>  Although it is my intention to continue to pursue further increases in investment in the childcare sector going forward, it would be premature at this juncture to speculate as to what fiscal space might be available in the budgetary years 2019-2022 to secure this.</p></reply>

I want to ensure a balanced approach to eligibility for childcare subsidies under the Affordable Childcare Scheme.  While a family&rsquo;s income will determine the amount of subsidy the family will qualify for, the parents&rsquo; participation in work or training will determine the number of hours of subsidy available.  When parents are engaged in work (including part-time work and labour market activation programmes) or in education or training, they will be eligible for an enhanced subsidy of up to 40 hours per week.  When parents are not in work or training, childcare will be subsidised on a standard basis of up to 15 hours per week.  I believe that this is a reasonable approach that reflects a balance of the labour market and child development objectives that will underpin the new scheme.</p>  <p>  It will mean that this Scheme is open &ndash; albeit for standard hours rather than enhanced hours &ndash; to parents who are not taking part in work or training, but who choose to avail of up to 15 hours of childcare per week. In the case of school going children, the child development objectives are met through school-going hours and, as such, the 15 standard hours of childcare applies to non-term time. </p></reply>

The drafting of the National Early Years Strategy is being advanced.  An Open Policy Debate was held with key stakeholders last December and this has informed the strategy development greatly.  Bilateral meetings with key government departments have taken place.  Development of the Strategy remains a priority for me and for my Department, and I will move to publish the Strategy as soon as possible after it is completed.</p></reply>

By the end of 2017 providers will have received a total of approximately &euro;18m to assist with administration and non-contact costs associated with the schemes. </p>  <p>  The Independent Review of Costs of Quality Childcare will examine the cost of providing quality childcare, including the cost of non-contact and administrative work.  The review should therefore provide a strong evidence base which can inform future decisions in relation to funding levels for programme supports.  The proposed affordable childcare scheme (ACS) subsidies and cost model for such programme supports are in development and will be examined further in the light of the findings of the review.  As an update on Independent Review of Costs of Quality Childcare, I can report that Consultants have been appointed and the review is set to be completed in 2018.</p></reply>

These include child welfare and protection, including family support; educational welfare; pre-school inspection and domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  These services and supports are provided by Social Workers, Educational Welfare Officers, and Early Years Inspectors.

The Committee had an advisory and consultative role to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs in matters to do with youth work, including the coordination of youth work programmes and services.  In line with these provisions, a new National Youth Work Advisory Committee was appointed by the then Minister for Children and Youth Affairs with a term of office of one year with effect from 28 January 2013.  The Committee had its final meeting on 26 November 2013.  The Committee continued to work with my Department and assisted with the development of the new National Youth Strategy, in particular in identifying in what ways the youth work sector can contribute to shared policy objectives for young people. </p>  <p>  The National Youth Strategy 2015-2020 was published in, 2015.  The implementation structures established by my Department under Better Outcomes Brighter Futures (BOBF), the National Policy Framework for Children and Young People oversee the roll out of the National Youth Strategy.  There is no doubt that the youth work services have a significant contribution to make to realise the goals of the National Youth Strategy as part of a cross-sectoral, whole of society approach to supporting young people in their everyday lives.  For this reason, the key youth sector interests are represented on the structures established by my Department to support the implementation of Better Outcomes Brighter Futures.  At national level, representatives of the voluntary youth services have been appointed to the Advisory Council of BOBF.  At local level, youth sector representatives participate in the Children and Young People&rsquo;s Services Committees.  Key Government departments and agencies that have an interest in children and young people and that had served on the National Youth Work Advisory Committee are represented on the Children and Young People&rsquo;s Policy Consortium and on the Sponsors Group that have been established under Better Outcomes Brighter Futures to drive the effective implementation of the policy framework. </p>  <p>  There have been other significant policy and legislative developments that are relevant to the provision of youth services and the role of the National Youth Work Advisory Committee since the 2001 Act was passed.  These include the introduction of the Education and Training Boards Act 2013 which, inter alia, provides for a statutory function for Education and Training Boards in supporting the provision and assessment of youth work services at local level.  The National Strategy on Children and Young People&rsquo;s Participation in Decision-making 2015-2020, which was published by my Department in June, 2015 is particularly relevant.  I am deeply committed to ensuring that young people are involved in the preparation, planning and implementation of policies that impact on their lives. </p>  <p>  In addition, my Department is fully committed to the reform of the many youth funding schemes.  The Deputy will be aware that a number of targeted funding schemes supporting youth services were the subject of a Value for Money and Policy Review in 2014.  The review made a number of recommendations for the future operation of the youth schemes and their development in the years ahead.  Work on the development of a new funding scheme has been prioritised by my Department and consultations with youth services are continuing with a view to introducing the new youth funding programme in line with the review.  The Deputy will also be aware that my Department has commenced a review of the Youth Service Grant Scheme.  This review is intended to enhance its accountability, transparency and outcome measurement.  It is also seeking to determine how best to meet the ever evolving needs of young people. </p>  <p>  My Department works closely with the youth work sector, the voluntary youth services, the Education and Training Boards, other government departments and agencies and consults with young people themselves in the development and delivery of policies and services for children and young people. </p>  <p>  For the above reasons, it is not my intention to reconvene the National Youth Work Advisory Committee while the reform process is ongoing.  Given the seismic changes which have occurred over the past sixteen years, my Department will be revisiting the Youth Work Act, 2001 on the conclusion of the reform process, to ensure that it fully articulates the needs of young people in Ireland. </p></reply>

The funding schemes support national and local youth work involving approximately 1,400 youth work staff working in youth services and communities throughout the country. </p>  <p>  I am pleased to confirm that I have allocated an extra &euro;5.5m in current funding to support the provision of youth services in 2017. This will bring the total youth funding by my Department to &euro;57.4m, an increase of 10% over last year's allocation. The additional funding is being used for programmes that target disadvantaged young people and to assist national youth organisations in their work to support local voluntary youth services. </p>  <p>  Earlier this year I approved the launch of an updated and improved Local Youth Club Grant Scheme and from 2017, the scheme incorporated the National Quality Standards for volunteer led youth groups.  The scheme was designed to provide volunteer led youth activities at a local level for young people aged between 10 to 21.  Grants are made available to all youth clubs and groups through the local Education and Training Boards. The scheme is open to new entrants and is advertised locally. Applications for funding are invited by the Education and Training Boards from local groups in their respective areas.  Each year, more than 600 local youth clubs benefit from the scheme. In 2016, &euro;1.065m was allocated to this scheme. In 2017, I have provided an additional 10% in funding to the scheme, bringing the total allocation to &euro;1.1715. </p>  <p>  In recognition of the contribution which volunteer led clubs/groups have on our young people I was pleased to have been able to make &euro;6.35m in additional funding available this year in the form of the Local Youth Club Equipment Scheme.  The primary focus of this scheme will be to assist volunteer led clubs/groups that work with young people in communities throughout the country.  The scheme will allow for the purchase of equipment for sport, arts, adventure and other much needed items.</p>  <p>  The question of additional investment in the youth services will be considered in the context of the resources that are made available to my Department in the Estimates and Budgetary process and my Department's priorities for the future development of the services for young people, in line with the National Youth Strategy.</p></reply>

When this clarification has been received, my Department, in conjunction with the Child and Family Agency, will consider what further action, if any, on this matter is required.</p>  <p>  While my officials are currently awaiting the Agency&rsquo;s response, based on the information currently available it would appear that there is no legal difficulty in placing children with a private not for profit provider where that child has been received into the care of the Child and Family Agency by way of an emergency placement under section 12 (4) of the Child Care Act 1991. </p></reply>

The Programme was rolled out in April 2015, and will run until 31 December 2017. Its aim is to tackle poverty, social exclusion and long-term unemployment through local engagement and partnership between disadvantaged individuals, community organisations, public sector agencies and other stakeholders.  The SICAP funding allocation, for front-line delivery, for 2017, is &euro;37.5m, which includes an allocation of &euro;3m under the European Social Fund (ESF) Programme for Employability, Inclusion and Learning (PEIL) 2014-2020. </p>  <p>  SICAP is a key intervention for the harder to reach, with delivery in each area (or Lot) overseen and managed by the relevant Local Community Development Committee (LCDC) in each local authority area.  The programme is currently delivered in a total of 51 Lots, and it targets both rural and urban areas.  The number and configuration of the Lots was decided upon by the LCDCs, based on their considerable knowledge of their local areas.</p>  <p>  LCDCs bring a more joined-up and coherent approach to the local management of publicly funded programmes in the areas of economic, social and community development, including SICAP, through the development and implementation of the community elements of the Local Economic and Community Plan (LECP). It is for the LCDCs to target and plan their strategy in accordance with local need and the contents of their LECP.  Whilst complying with the programme&rsquo;s aims, objectives and requirements, Programme Implementers are expected to ensure that actions set out under SICAP reflect the priorities and needs identified in the community aspect of the LECP, which emerged from extensive local consultation processes.</p>  <p>  The next iteration of the programme, SICAP 2018-2022 is due to supersede the current programme with effect from 1 January 2018.  The programme has been refined to allow LCDC&rsquo;s to include their own &lsquo;emerging needs&rsquo; group to more efficiently target supports within their Lot area.  As with the current programme and in accordance with the Public Spending Code, legal advice, good practice internationally and in order to ensure the optimum delivery of services to clients, SICAP 2018-2022 is subject to a public procurement process which is currently underway.  The national procurement process is a competitive process that is open to Local Development Companies, other not-for-profit community groups, commercial firms and national organisations that can provide the services to be tendered for to deliver the new Programme.  The process is managed within each Lot area by the relevant LCDC.  The process is the same for every County.  Given the deliberative process, currently underway, I am not in a position to comment further. </p></reply>

The function of this officer is to act as a single point of contact for telecommunications operators on the roll-out of telecommunications infrastructure, as well as to increase awareness of, and stimulate demand for, broadband services.</p>  <p>  The Department of Rural and Community Development has provided funding to all 31 Local Authorities to co-fund the assignment of a Broadband Officer. </p>  <p>  The remit of the Broadband Officer is primarily to manage interactions with any company that is seeking to roll out telecommunications infrastructure in their county. The Broadband Officers will also work with the winning bidder(s) in respect of the roll-out of the National Broadband Plan in the areas to be covered by State intervention. Broadband Officers are also involved in helping to develop local digital strategies to ensure that full use is made of the new broadband infrastructure once it is in place.  </p>  <p>  The telecommunications providers have widely welcomed the assignment the Broadband Officers by the Local Authorities and are actively engaging with them. </p>  <p>  The Department of Rural and Community Development has, additionally, established two Regional Action Groups involving all Local Authorities to ensure consistency in their engagement with the telecommunications operators and to identify and address obstacles to the roll-out of telecoms infrastructure. A number of sub-groups have been established to progress individual work items associated with the roll-out of high-speed broadband.</p>  <p>  The appointment of Broadband Officers is just one of 40 actions contained in the report of the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce. An implementation group has been established to oversee the delivery of the Taskforce recommendations.  Progress Reports from the Implementation Group are published on a quarterly basis, with the third report due shortly.</p></reply>

To date BCS have been paid &euro;22.9 million (excluding VAT).    The increase in costs arises from changes to processes, enhancements/improvements to the security of the card, and from delays impacting the timetable for production of the cards.  Following the award of the contract, the then Data Protection Commissioner requested that each recipient of a PSC should contact the helpdesk as proof that the PSC had been delivered correctly.  This increased the helpdesk costs from &euro;347,000 (excluding VAT) as per the contract, to payments to date of &euro;2.597 million (excluding VAT).  Security features for cards have improved and been enhanced over the lifetime of the contract.  To ensure that the PSC met the best international security standards, a Kinegram was added at a total cost of &euro;1.140 million excluding VAT.  Extending the contract period to the end of 2017 from end 2016 resulted in an increased price per card amounting to approx. &euro;0.5 million to date excluding VAT.

The scope of the review included the long-term age-related policy changes to the scheme that were implemented since January 2012, in addition to the shorter term changes required to achieve savings across all social welfare expenditure over the same period on foot of the economic downturn. </p><p>In order to complete the review, Indecon carried out a detailed quantitative and econometric analysis of a number of relevant datasets to assess the impact of the changes on lone parents.  The review also included one of the largest surveys targeting one-parent families in Ireland, with 33,000 lone parents surveyed.Responses were received and analysed from almost 3,700 lone parents who were directly affected by the changes.  This provided an excellent opportunity to gather the views and experiences of lone parents affected by the changes. </p><p>I have received the review  and  I laid it before the Houses of the Oireachtas on Monday 9thOctober 2017, as provided for in the Social Welfare Act, 2016.  I welcome a number of positive findings in the Review: </p><p>-The policy changes introduced have been successful in increasing employment and in reducing welfare dependency &ndash; the reforms increased the probability of both employment and of higher employment income. </p><p>-Responses to the survey showed that the percentage of lone parents in full-time employment increased from 15% to 22%. </p><p>-Welfare dependency rates fell in the year after One-parent Family Payment was lost, and continued to fall in subsequent years. </p><p>I believe that these findings indicate that the broad policy intentions of the changes are having positive results and making real changes to the lives of lone parents, where they have been able to transition into employment. </p><p>I acknowledge, however, that the review has also raised a number of matters of concern: </p><p>-Many of those who lost the One-parent Family Payment remain unemployed, or are in low paid or part-time employment, </p><p>-The balance of evidence indicates that there is an increased probability of being at risk of poverty as a result of the changes, </p><p>-Further supports, aimed at assisting lone parents to obtain full-time employment or increased hours of work, need to be put in place. </p><p>The impacts on lone parents arose from the combination of the policy changes to the scheme, and from the imposition, simultaneously, of the financial cuts imposed to welfare schemes across the board, arising out of the economic downturn.  I, and my predecessors, have already taken action in recent Budgets to improve the position of lone parents, for example by progressively increasing the income disregard for those on Jobseekers Transition (JST) from a low of &euro;60 a week to &euro;110 euro a week, and by targeting improved, tailored activation measures towards this group, to assist them into training and employment. </p><p>For example lone parents who wish to participate in education can continue to receive support from the Department either through the retention of their primary payment or Family Income Supplement or they can transfer to the Back to Education Allowance. Furthermore, to support lone parents participate in education, SUSI grants (both maintenance and fee grants) are payable concurrently with One-parent Family Payment and Jobseekers Transition.  Therefore a lone parent can participate in education and receive the dual support of the One-parent Family Payment/ Jobseekers Transition and the SUSI maintenance grants. </p><p>Where the lone parent is on Jobseekers Allowance they can, should they wish to, participate in education, transfer to the Back to Education programme.  The additional childcare supports coming on-stream are also of particular benefit to lone parents. </p><p>I consider that these measures are a step in the right direction, and I am working to ensure that there is no loss in the momentum to enhance the support for lone parents.  The Review points to the need to intensify both the engagement with lone parents as they move off One-parent Family Payment, and the activation supports available, and I am requesting my officials to prioritise this. </p><p>The Department&rsquo;s employment services provide a case-managed approach to assist lone parents to avail of various opportunities within an ever-improving labour market.  This case-managed approach will be developed further, specifically to offer more tailored and holistic progression plans for lone parents, that better reflect their individual circumstances. </p><p>The move to more tailored progressions plans for lone parents will incorporate supports to access the childcare, education and training and other appropriate supports that they require to, in turn, access the labour market.  These changes should help to improve the living standards of, and reduce the risk of poverty faced by, lone parents. </p><p>I intend to continue to prioritise supports for lone parents, particularly those which incentivise work over welfare.  I intend also to provide for the further review of the scheme.  As there is a time lag before the benefits of labour market reforms appear I anticipate that this review will include data to the end of 2018.</p></reply>

The scheme, which was introduced in and took effect for periods from 1994, allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age, or caring for incapacitated people over that age, to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes, subject to the standard qualifying conditions for State pension contributory also being satisfied.  This has the effect of increasing the yearly average of the pensioner, which is used to set the rate of his or her pension.</p>  <p>  While the Deputy has requested the estimated cost of backdating the homemaker scheme to 1970 in incremental steps of five years from 1994, there are a number of factors that make it difficult to estimate that cost for specific year bands.  In the first instance, it should be noted that there are twenty methods by which someone can qualify for a contributory pension depending upon their PRSI record, and so the impact of incremental changes to the Homemakers scheme is not possible to estimate without doing an analysis of the actual contribution records of potential claimant groups.  </p>  <p>  There are further data-related issues which make it even more challenging.  For example, much of the data (e.g., child benefit records) used in the operation of the scheme at present for periods from 1994, is not readily available in computerised form for periods prior to 1984.  Any projection, therefore, has to make assumptions regarding the composition of gaps in contribution records.</p>  <p>  Costing multiple partial backdatings over a range of years would require very detailed analysis of the distribution of gaps in individual records during particular periods, an estimation of which gaps were driven by child rearing and which are a result of alternative reasons, and then re-calculation of those individual entitlements under the various qualification rules.  </p>  <p>  While no analysis of the particular proposal contained in the Deputy&rsquo;s question has been conducted, it is clear that any backdating would entail a significant and ongoing cost to the Social Insurance Fund.  It is estimated that backdating it in respect of periods before its introduction in 1994 would cost some &euro;290 million per year, and this figure would rise at a faster rate than the overall rise in the cost of State pensions.  Limiting that backdating to 1970 would moderate that cost somewhat.  However, it is unlikely to have a significant impact as the bulk of the cost would likely arise in the years immediately prior to 1994 and would decrease the further back the backdating was taken.</p>  <p>  Where someone does not qualify for a full rate contributory pension, they may qualify for an alternative payment.  If their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an increase for a qualified adult, amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State pension non-contributory, which amounts up to 95% of the maximum contributory rate.</p>  <p>  Work is under way to replace the yearly average system with a Total Contributions Approach.  Under this approach, the rate of pension paid will more closely reflect the total number of contributions made by people, not when they paid them.  The position of homemakers is being carefully considered in developing this new system of calculating the State Pension (contributory).</p>  <p>  It is hoped that this approach to pension qualification will replace the current one from 2020. Following publication of the current actuarial review of the Social Insurance Fund, a refined proposal will be developed.  My Department will conduct a period of consultation with relevant stakeholders, including interest groups, representative bodies and the Oireachtas.  Following the consultation period, I will submit a proposal to Government seeking approval for the new approach, and then proceed to introduce legislation to give effect to this reform.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This has significant implications for the future costs of State pension provision.  This demographic change alone is expected to increase spending on pensions by over &euro;220 million this year &ndash; not including the impact of rate increases.    The current rate bands applying to the SPC were introduced from September 2012, replacing previous rates introduced in 2000.  These rate bands more closely reflect the social insurance contributions history of a person than those in place between 2000 and 2012. </p>  <p>  It is estimated that to revert to the previous bands from January 2018 would result in an annual cost of over &euro;60 million in 2018, and this annual cost would increase by an estimated &euro;10 million each following year (e.g. it would be expected to cost some &euro;70 million in 2019).  This estimate reflects the numbers of those in receipt of reduced rate SPC payments, and does not include those who are claiming an alternative payment at a higher rate than their reduced SPC entitlement, and who might qualify for a higher rate of SPC if such a change were introduced.  This estimate also assumes that any such change to rate bands would generally be implemented from a current date and as a result would not generate retrospective arrears. </p>  <p>  The main beneficiaries from such a decision would be younger (post September 2012) pensioners who both:</p>  <p>  a. haven&rsquo;t sufficient paid contributions into the Social Insurance Fund to qualify for a contributory pension at the maximum rate, or for the 98% rate applying to those with a yearly average of 40-47 weekly PRSI contributions paid or credited per year, and </p>  <p>  b. do not qualify for means-tested pension payments at the maximum rate because, in addition to their state pension, they also have means above a certain level (e.g. they are in receipt of an occupational pension and/or own a second residential property). </p>  <p>  The savings created by the new rate bands were an alternative to cutting the core rate of pensions, at a time when Exchequer savings were required, and other social protection payments were being reduced across the board.  Had a similar approach been taken with pensions, affecting everyone over State pension age &ndash; regardless of their means and their contribution record &ndash; the hardest hit would have been pensioners with no additional incomes, notably those paid a State pension (non-contributory), and widows and widowers living alone on only one pension payment.  A very significantly higher proportion of such pensioners are women, and this approach would have been expected to result in more women over 65 experiencing consistent poverty, relative to men of the same age.  The most recent CSO statistics show that this negative outcome has been avoided. </p>  <p>  The alternative approach, taken by the Government at that time, made savings in respect of the State pension (contributory) by making rates of payment for new pensioners more reflective of contribution history, while maintaining the rates of payment for non-contributory and Widows/widowers pensions, as well as for contributory pensions paid to those who had contributed into the Social Insurance Fund throughout their working lives (i.e. with a yearly average of 40 or more).  This approach safeguarded those most vulnerable pensioners, whilst avoiding undermining the contributory system, which is the basis for collection of PRSI, which funds the SPC on a &lsquo;Pay-As-You-Go&rsquo; basis. </p>  <p>  Where people do not qualify for a maximum-rate contributory pension in their own right, the social protection system provides alternative methods of supporting such pensioners in old age.  Where their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension, which by default is paid directly to them, and is subject to a personal means-test.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State Pension (non-contributory), based on their household means, amounting up to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate.  There are very significant income and capital disregards in these means tests, which result in the large majority being paid at the maximum rate.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This began in January 2014 with the abolition of the State pension (transition) available from 65 for those who satisfied the qualifying conditions, thereby standardising State pension age for all at 66 years, which is the current State pension age.  This will increase to 67 in 2021 and to 68 in 2028.    In most cases, it is hoped that workers will continue to work up to the new State pension age.  Where this is not possible, and where a person is available for work, there are specific measures which apply to someone claiming Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit from a date after their 65th birthday.  Where qualified, these recipients may continue to be eligible for that payment until reaching pension age. </p>  <p>  In 2013, the cost of the State pension (transition) was &euro;137 million.  Its abolition was not expected to save that amount of expenditure in full, as some people who were affected would alternatively claim working age payments such as Jobseeker's Benefit (albeit at a lower rate than the rate of the State pension), or may claim an Increase for a Qualified Adult in respect of their spouse&rsquo;s pension. </p>  <p>  However, it is estimated that well over half of that cost has been saved each year as a result of this measure, and this would be expected to increase as (a) the number of 65 year olds increases, (b) the change results in a higher percentage of people working while aged 65, and (c) there have been two Budget increases in the rate of the State pension since then.  It is estimated that the net saving in 2018 is likely to be in the region of &euro;84 million, and this is expected to rise to &euro;87 million by 2020.  These figures do not include future rate increases.  Reversing this decision would, therefore, significantly increase the annual cost of State pensions, and would reduce the funds available to pay for any future increases in the rates of the payment. </p>  <p>  The Deputy should note that there is no statutory retirement age in the State, and the age at which employees retire is a matter for the contract of employment between them and their employers.  While such a contract may originally have been entered into with a retirement date of 65, in the context of the previous State pension arrangements, there is no legal impediment to the employer and employee agreeing to increase the duration of employment for one or more years, if both parties wish to do so. </p>  <p>  In January 2016, an Interdepartmental Group on Fuller Working Lives, chaired by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, was established specifically to examine the implications arising from prevailing retirement ages.  The final report of the Group made a number of recommendations to support working and retirement practices.  This included a request to the Workplace Relations Commission to prepare a Code of Practice under Section 42 of the Industrial Relations Act, 1990 to help manage the engagement between employers and employees regarding retirement issues and longer working.  The final report, the recommendations of which were accepted by Government in August 2016, is available on the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform&rsquo;s website. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Perhaps the most fundamental reform measure which will be contained within this plan will relate to the development of a new auto enrolment supplementary retirement savings system for employees without pensions coverage.The rate of supplementary pension coverage in Ireland is 47% of the working population and this reduces to 35% when the private sector is considered in isolation.  Whilst the State pension provides a reasonable basic level of income and guards against poverty in retirement, if measures are not taken to address this low rate of supplementary coverage, many future retirees will experience unwanted reductions in living standards when they reach retirement. </p><p>Auto enrolment will see a transition from the current and purely voluntary supplementary pension system to one which will, subject to certain parameters, automatically enrol employees into a quality assured retirement savings system.  This reform, where the saver will maintain the freedom of choice to opt-out, will encourage long term saving and asset accumulation amongst those who may otherwise suffer a reduction in living standards at retirement.  It will increase the well-being, financial security and independence of future retirees. </p><p>Preliminary work has been undertaken by officials in my Department to begin to identify the most effective, deliverable and sustainable automatic enrolment model.  Previously, an Interdepartmental &lsquo;Universal Retirement Savings Group&rsquo; (URSG) considered the issue and concluded that building reform consensus across political, business and civil society is essential for any new system.  To this end, the URSG held initial consultations with citizens, employer representatives, trade unions, the pensions industry, advocacy and interest groups, as well as Irish and international experts. </p><p>A review of international automatic enrolment retirement systems by my officials has confirmed that success is dependent on well tested design principles and securing member trust.  To this end, further detailed evidence building and consultation will be undertaken to inform fundamental choices which are required regarding the preferred operational structure and organisational governance for a new system as well as many design elements such as contribution levels, financial incentives and target membership.  Correctly positioning/designing each of these will be critical to the success of any system.  </p><p>Subject to any Government decision regarding the manner in which this project should be progressed, it is my objective that first members would be enrolled in the new system in 2021.  This project timeframe reflects the scale of such a programme and its importance as being the most fundamental reform of the Irish supplementary pension system in generations. </p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

A county breakdown of rent supplements recipients as at end September 2017 is provided in the attached tabular statement. </p><p>The full annualised costs for the existing customer base at current blended rent supplement tenancy rates of &euro;480 per month, is approximately &euro;220 million. </p><p>In recognition of the on-going rental market difficulties, my Department continues to implement a targeted case-by-case policy approach in the administration of rent supplement that allows for flexibility where landlords seek rents in excess of the rent limits.  In addition, the Protocol arrangement in place with Threshold continues to operate in the areas where supply issues are particularly acute covering Dublin, Cork, Meath, Kildare and Wicklow and Galway City.  To date in 2017, in excess of 1,450 recipients have been supported with increased rent payments.A county breakdown of these payments is provided in the attached tabular statement. </p><p>As the Deputies will be aware the strategic policy direction of the Department is to return rent supplement to its original purpose of being a short-term income support, with the introduction of the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme, available nationwide from 1 March 2017.  There are currently c. 27,600 HAP tenancies in place of which c. 8,200 (c. 30%) are transfers from rent supplement.  In addition to the ongoing transfer of long-term rent supplement recipients to HAP, the majority of new applicants seeking State support towards their rent are supported by Local Authorities through HAP rather than rent supplement. </p><p>Rent supplement is not an interim or ancillary payment while a HAP application is being processed.  However, rent supplement will continue to be paid to households who are already in the private rented sector but who, generally because of a loss of income through unemployment, require a short term income support to pay their rent. </p><p>Officials in my Department continue to work closely with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and local authorities to facilitate the ongoing implementation of the HAP scheme including the transfer of cases from Rent Supplement.  Queries in relation to the administration of the HAP scheme should be raised with my colleague, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government or the Local Authority in question.</p><p>I trust this clarifies matters for the Deputies. </p><p><b>Tabular Statement: Rent Supplement by County at end of September 2017</b><table><tr><th>County</th><th>Recipients</th></tr><tr><td>CARLOW</td><td>428</td></tr><tr><td>CAVAN</td><td>312</td></tr><tr><td>CLARE</td><td>228</td></tr><tr><td>CORK</td><td>3,810</td></tr><tr><td>DONEGAL</td><td>170</td></tr><tr><td>DUBLIN</td><td>17,593</td></tr><tr><td>GALWAY</td><td>1,862</td></tr><tr><td>KERRY</td><td>1,203</td></tr><tr><td>KILDARE</td><td>1,999</td></tr><tr><td>KILKENNY</td><td>219</td></tr><tr><td>LAOIS</td><td>653</td></tr><tr><td>LEITRIM</td><td>196</td></tr><tr><td>LIMERICK</td><td>790</td></tr><tr><td>LONGFORD</td><td>293</td></tr><tr><td>LOUTH</td><td>540</td></tr><tr><td>MAYO</td><td>701</td></tr><tr><td>MEATH</td><td>628</td></tr><tr><td>MONAGHAN</td><td>152</td></tr><tr><td>OFFALY</td><td>319</td></tr><tr><td>ROSCOMMON</td><td>423</td></tr><tr><td>SLIGO</td><td>152</td></tr><tr><td>TIPPERARY</td><td>487</td></tr><tr><td>WATERFORD</td><td>244</td></tr><tr><td>WESTMEATH</td><td>919</td></tr><tr><td>WEXFORD</td><td>1,508</td></tr><tr><td>WICKLOW</td><td>1,633</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>37,462</td></tr></table></p><p><b>Tabular Statement: Increased Rental Payments by County: January &ndash; September 2017</b><table><tr><th>County</th><th>Awards under National Tenancy Sustainment Framework</th><th>Awards under protocol with Threshold</th><th>Total no. of increased payments by County</th></tr><tr><td>CARLOW</td><td>19</td><td></td><td>19</td></tr><tr><td>CAVAN</td><td>17</td><td></td><td>17</td></tr><tr><td>CLARE</td><td>0</td><td></td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>CORK</td><td>6</td><td>2</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>DONEGAL</td><td>0</td><td></td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>DUBLIN</td><td>589</td><td>237</td><td>826</td></tr><tr><td>GALWAY</td><td>11</td><td>5</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>KERRY</td><td>87</td><td></td><td>87</td></tr><tr><td>KILDARE</td><td>115</td><td>4</td><td>119</td></tr><tr><td>KILKENNY</td><td>5</td><td></td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>LAOIS</td><td>0</td><td></td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>LEITRIM</td><td>11</td><td></td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>LIMERICK</td><td>10</td><td></td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>LONGFORD</td><td>17</td><td></td><td>17</td></tr><tr><td>LOUTH</td><td>32</td><td></td><td>32</td></tr><tr><td>MAYO</td><td>8</td><td></td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>MEATH</td><td>44</td><td>2</td><td>46</td></tr><tr><td>MONAGHAN</td><td>0</td><td></td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>OFFALY</td><td>9</td><td></td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>ROSCOMMON</td><td>29</td><td></td><td>29</td></tr><tr><td>SLIGO</td><td>0</td><td></td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>TIPPERARY</td><td>36</td><td></td><td>36</td></tr><tr><td>WATERFORD</td><td>5</td><td></td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>WESTMEATH</td><td>35</td><td></td><td>35</td></tr><tr><td>WEXFORD</td><td>2</td><td></td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>WICKLOW</td><td>116</td><td>0</td><td>116</td></tr><tr><td>Overall Total</td><td>1,203</td><td>250</td><td>1,453</td></tr></table></p></reply>

It should be noted that the State Pension Non Contributory scheme has a general means disregard of &euro;30 per week.  This means that a person can receive an army pension of up to &euro;1,664 per annum (if she or he had no other means) and still receive the maximum weekly rate of the State Pension Non Contributory.

Such property includes all monies held in financial institutions or otherwise, the market value of shares and houses and premises owned by a claimant which may or may not be put to commercial use.  However, it does not include property such as the family home or, for example, a premises used by the claimant in carrying out a business. </p><p>For assessment purposes, savings are assessed in the following way: </p><p><b>Capital &ndash; Assessment Formula</b><table><tr><th>AMOUNT OF CAPITAL </th><th>WEEKLY MEANS ASSESSED </th></tr><tr><td>Up to &euro;20,000 </td><td>Nil </td></tr><tr><td>&euro;20,000 - &euro;30,000 </td><td>&euro;1 per each &euro;1,000 </td></tr><tr><td>&euro;30,000 - &euro;40,000 </td><td>&euro;2 per each &euro;1,000 </td></tr><tr><td>Over &euro;40,000 </td><td>&euro;4 per each &euro;1,000 </td></tr></table></p><p>It should be noted that, for the purposes of the State Pension Non-Contributory (SPNC), the amounts above are doubled in the case of a couple. In addition, the SPNC has a general means disregard of &euro;30 per week. </p><p>This means that a single claimant of SPNC with no other income can have savings of &euro;40,000 (which would result in a weekly means assessment from capital of &euro;30) and this would have no impact on their SPNC payment. Similarly, a SPNC claimant who is one of a couple can have savings of &euro;80,000 (and no other means) and the claimant would still receive the maximum weekly rate of SPNC. Note that each member of the couple is assessed with half of the total property and income of the couple. </p><p>Furthermore, no account is taken of interest or dividend payments received in the means assessment. The assessment formula reflects the fact that there is an expectation that persons with reasonable amounts of capital and property are in a position to use that capital or to realise the value of property to support themselves without having to rely solely on a means-tested welfare payment. If the threshold were to be increased, the people who would benefit would be those who had higher levels of income or assets.</p><p>Any changes to the current arrangements would have to be considered in an overall policy and Budgetary context.</p></reply>

CE schemes can also actively advertise vacancies in their local communities.  At a local level, various methods of promoting CE have been arranged between my Department and local CE schemes, including targeting potentially eligible jobseekers to attend a Job-fare, where details of CE vacancies and employment opportunities are provided.Interested individuals are required to meet with a case officer at their local Intreo Office to determine eligibility.  My Department then provides a list of referrals to the CE scheme sponsor for interview. I have no plans to change this process.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

These supports include employment schemes such as Community Employment (CE) and T&uacute;s.  These schemes provide part-time temporary work in local communities, as a stepping stone back to employment. The objective of these schemes is to break the cycle of unemployment and maintain work readiness, thereby improving a person&rsquo;s opportunities in returning to the labour market. </p>  <p>  All participants and community groups are aware of the time limits for participation on these schemes.  The participation limits aim to ensure the benefit of participation on a work scheme is available to the widest possible number of jobseekers.  In addition, it is generally recognised that there is a greater likelihood of a &lsquo;lock&ndash;in&rsquo; effect where a scheme is of a longer duration. </p>  <p>  With the ongoing welcome reductions in the live register, issues such as the number of places, the criteria for participation on T&uacute;s, including age limits, will all be considered in the coming months.

These schools have continued to remain in the scheme.

Separate to these arrangements is the contract between the tenant and landlord under a tenancy agreement.  This is personal to them and is subject to the legislative framework provided under the Residential Tenancies Acts.  In the event of non-compliance with a tenancy contract, a complaint may be made to the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) by either the landlord or the tenant.

The main purpose of these changes is to broaden the availability of CE to a greater number of people on the live register, to standardise eligibility and other conditions regarding the length of time a person can participate on the programme and to promote progression outcomes.</p>  <p>  The changes, which are effective since 3 July 2017, has seen the general qualifying age for CE, for those on the live register, reduced from 25 to 21 years.  It will also now be easier for previous participants who have exhausted their CE entitlement to requalify, as participation prior to the year 2007 will be disregarded.  While participants between 21 and 55 years can avail of one year on the programme, this can be extended on approval by the Department by up to two more years, if they are working towards a major award/industry recognised equivalent to support their progression to employment.  CE participants aged 55 and over can now avail of up to three consecutive years on a scheme.  An overall lifetime limit of six years will apply to CE participants (seven years if on a disability payment).  A person may re-qualify for CE after 12 months of being in receipt of a qualifying social welfare payment, provided they have not reached their six year limit.</p>  <p>  Further changes, which will be progressed over the coming months, include the roll-out of the &lsquo;two strand approach&rsquo; of activation and social inclusion in terms of how CE places are categorised.  </p>  <p>  In addition, a review of the participation of older people on schemes is being undertaken and I expect that this will be completed in the coming weeks.  The question of publication will be considered once the review is completed.  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.  </p></reply>

People who have made significant contributions into the Fund are more likely to receive their pension under that scheme than under other pensions.   </p>  <p>  To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension (contributory), all contributions, paid or credited, over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement.   </p>  <p>  The homemaker's scheme makes qualification for a higher rate of State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme, which was introduced in and took effect for periods from 1994, allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age, or caring for incapacitated people over that age, to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes, subject to the standard qualifying conditions for State pension (contributory) also being satisfied.  This has the effect of increasing the yearly average of pensioners who qualify for that scheme, which is used to set the rate of his or her pension.   </p>  <p>  Where someone does not qualify for a full rate contributory pension, they may qualify for an alternative payment.  If their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an increase for a qualified adult, amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State pension (non-contributory), which amounts up to 95% of the maximum contributory rate.  The large majority of both of these payments are made at the maximum rate.</p>  <p>  Work is under way to replace the yearly average system with a Total Contributions Approach which it is hoped will replace the current one from 2020.  Under this approach, the rate of pension paid will more closely reflect the total number of contributions made by people, not when they paid them.  The position of homemakers is being carefully considered in developing this new system.  Following publication of the current actuarial review of the Social Insurance Fund, a refined proposal will be developed.  My Department will conduct a period of consultation with relevant stakeholders on possible approaches.  Following that process, I will submit a proposal to Government seeking approval for the selected approach, and then proceed to introduce legislation to give effect to this reform.   </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.   </p></reply>

This standard is known as the Standard Authentication Framework Environment, SAFE.  A person who successfully completes a SAFE 2 registration process (i.e. verifies their identity to a substantial level of assurance) is issued with a Public Services Card (PSC).In the case of my Department&rsquo;s own services, the legislation governing identity verification for existing claimants is set out in the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, as amended, <i>viz.</i></p><p>- Section 247C(1) of the Act provides that the Minister may require any person receiving a benefit to satisfy the Minister as to his or her identity  ; </p><p>- Section 247C(2) of the Act specifies the consequences of failure to satisfy the Minister in relation to identity as required, specifically that a person shall be disqualified from receiving a benefit; and </p><p>- Section 247C(3) of the Act specifies the manner in which the Minister may be so satisfied; in effect, this Section describes the process for registering a person&rsquo;s identity - this is the SAFE 2 Process.  </p><p>This legislation requires a person to satisfy the Minister as to their identity and allows disqualification from receipt of a benefit in the event that it is not done.  It is not possible for a person to satisfy the Minister as to his or her identity without being SAFE2 registered.</p><p>My Department does not collect data on the number of individuals who currently, or who, at any point in time, have had a payment stopped by reason of failing to complete the SAFE2 registration process.  The Deputy will appreciate that this data is fluid in nature e.g. a considerable number of customers who have a payment or entitlement suspended subsequently decide to complete the SAFE2 process and have their payment or entitlement reinstated and backdated to the date of suspension.  It should be noted that of the remainder, a considerable portion do not make any contact with the Department at all.  </p><p>The decision to stop a payment is never made lightly.  However, where a customer does not satisfy the Minister in relation to identity, in accordance with the legislative requirements, a payment can be disqualified.  In advance of any such disqualification, the Department makes every effort to engage with the customer to explain the legislative basis for the SAFE2 registration process and the consequences of potential disqualification.  Where a payment has been disqualified and the customer subsequently successfully completes the SAFE2 registration process, their payment will be reinstated by my Department (assuming they continue to meet all qualifying criteria for that payment) from the date of compliance.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

For the most part they are linked to having an underlying entitlement to a social welfare payment while temporarily detached from the labour force or having entitlement to certain statutory periods of leave.  The primary purpose of PRSI credits is to secure social welfare benefits and pensions of employees by covering gaps in insurance where they are not in a position to pay PRSI such as during periods of unemployment or illness, for example.  </p>  <p>  In the case those on maternity leave, credits may be awarded for 26 weeks during which an individual is on maternity leave and, subject to satisfying the PRSI contribution conditions, is entitled to receive maternity benefit.  Credits may also be awarded in respect of the additional 16 weeks unpaid maternity leave which may be taken immediately after the end of the 26 weeks of paid maternity benefit.  </p>  <p>Any additional leave beyond the 16 weeks unpaid leave is at the discretion of the employer and is not covered by statutory leave arrangements for which credits can be awarded.  The social welfare code does take account of period spent caring for children on a full-time basis through the homemaker scheme.  The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme is designed to help homemakers and carers qualify for state pension (contributory).  Years spent caring on a full-time basis are disregarded when calculating the state pension (contributory) rate of payment.</p></reply>

The Court did however visit seven Member States, including Ireland, to assemble material for its assessment.  </p><p>The report concludes that the &ldquo;Member States visited had made progress in implementing the Youth Guarantee and some results had been achieved&rdquo; but that &ldquo;the current situation - more than three years after the adoption of the Council Recommendation falls short of the initial expectations raised at the launch of the Youth Guarantee&rdquo;.</p><p>The European Commission, to which the Court&rsquo;s report is directed in the first instance, has explicitly rejected this opinion of the Court.  In its &ldquo;Reply of the Commission&rdquo;, published with the Court&rsquo;s report, the Commission </p><blockquote>&ldquo;considers that the current results in Youth Guarantee implementation do not fall short of initial expectations.<br /><br />Whilst recognising that additional efforts are still needed to reach out to all young people, delivering quality and timely offers, the Commission underlines that the Youth Guarantee has led to positive results.  In particular, as highlighted in the Commission Communication (COM/2016/646) &lsquo;The Youth Guarantee and the Youth Employment Initiative three years on&rsquo;, it has provided a strong impetus on structural reforms and policy innovation, areas which are outside of the scope of this report.&rdquo;</blockquote><p>For its part, Ireland made clear, in the implementation plan published in response to the Recommendation, that &ldquo;the deeply ingrained problem of youth unemployment cannot be solved with the flick of a switch&rdquo; and that achieving substantial reductions in youth unemployment represented a medium-term goal of economic and labour market policy.</p><p>At the time of the adoption of the implementation plan in December 2013, the seasonally adjusted rate of youth unemployment in Ireland was 25.6%, somewhat above the then EU average of 23.4%.  Since then youth unemployment here has been reduced to 14.8% in September 2017, significantly below the current EU figure of 18.9%.  </p><p>Both in absolute terms, and relative to the situation elsewhere in the EU, the improvement in the youth labour market has exceeded expectations in the period since 2013.

A robust external evaluation of the scheme conducted by Indecon Economic Consultants in 2016 found that it is one of the most effective labour market programmes &ndash; increasing participants&rsquo; employment outcomes by 32%.  It also found that while participants rated the scheme positively on 18 out of 20 aspects measured, most were dissatisfied with the level of payment and a sizable minority rated the scheme negatively on some aspects, for example the quality of training offered.  Based on these findings, and taking account of the improvement in labour market conditions, Indecon recommended that JobBridge be discontinued and replaced with a new scheme.  A copy of the full evaluation can be found at: <i>.  </i></p><p>The Labour Market Council welcomed the report and noted the positive employment impact of the scheme.  A majority of the Council similarly recommended that JobBridge be replaced.  </p><p>Having considered the evidence and the suggestions put forward by Indecon and the Labour Market Council, my predecessor as Minister for Social Protection announced his intention to replace JobBridge with a new work experience programme that would address criticisms of the scheme and would be better suited to the much-improved labour market.  </p><p>JobBridge was closed to new applications from 27 October 2016 to allow for a period of consultation with key stakeholders on design principles for any proposed new work experience programme and to facilitate an orderly wind down of the current scheme.</p><p>The consultation process is completed and I have considered options on how best to proceed having regard to the overall policy and Budgetary context.  </p><p>As Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, my focus is to ensure that resources are targeted at good outcomes from an employment perspective and have regard to the very considerable improvement in the labour market in recent years.  </p><p>In that respect, I want to target resources at people who face particular challenges getting into or re-entering work, such as young people without any experience and older people who have been unemployed for a long time.</p></reply>

As the Deputy is aware, in recognition of the crucial work undertaken in rural communities under the RSS and as part of the social welfare budget package for 2017, an additional 500 places were made available with effect from 1 February 2017 increasing the overall number of places on RSS from 2,600 to 3,100.  The additional places were allocated taking into account a number of factors including the number of places already allocated, the demand for new places in particular areas, work opportunities available in local areas and the numbers of farmers and fishermen/women in receipt of income support.  </p>  <p>  While the overall responsibility for the operation of the RSS rests with the Department, it is implemented at a local level by 35 Local Development Companies and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta in the Gaeltacht areas (known as the Implementing Bodies (IB)).  Accordingly, the relevant IB has responsibility for the day-to-day operation of each scheme including the recruitment of eligible participants.  </p>  <p>  At this point, all of the IBs have plans in place to fully utilise the places available to them and, therefore, there are no plans at present for the re-distribution of unfilled places.

The scope of the review included the long term age related policy changes to the scheme that were implemented since January 2012 in addition to the shorter term changes required to achieve savings across all social welfare expenditure over the same period on foot of the economic downturn.</p>  <p>  On foot of this legislative commitment, a formal tendering process was initiated by my Department and, on the conclusion of that process, Indecon International Economic Consultants (Indecon) were selected to undertake the work involved.  They commenced work on the report in April of this year.</p>  <p>  In order to complete the review, Indecon carried out a detailed quantitative and econometric analysis of a number of relevant datasets to assess the impact of the changes on lone parents.  The review also included one of the largest surveys targeting one-parent families in Ireland with 33,000 lone parents surveyed.  Responses were received and analysed from almost 3,700 lone parents who were directly affected by the changes.  This provided an excellent opportunity to gather the views and experiences of lone parents affected by the changes.</p>  <p>  The timeframe for the review was very ambitious given the scale and complexity of the issues to be covered in the review.

The Directive requires all member states to define set periods when the land application of fertiliser, including slurry, is not allowed and in Ireland the closed season will commence on 15 October.</p>  <p>  The closed periods in Ireland were decided following extensive consultation and were discussed with farming bodies and the European Commission when Ireland&rsquo;s Nitrates Action Programme was introduced.  The provisions of the Regulations are underpinned by scientific research and good agricultural practice.  The most recent scientific studies carried out on a diverse range of farm and soil types as part of Teagasc&rsquo;s on-going Agricultural Catchments Programme has provided further evidence in support of the efficacy of the current closed periods in reducing nutrient losses to waters.  A key message from the research is that there are disproportionately high nutrient losses to waters during the winter and the current closed period coincides with the time during which risks of incidental nutrient losses to water are highest.  Farmers are advised to spread slurry early in the season when growth and nutrient uptake are at their peak.</p>  <p>  My Department and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine have been closely monitoring the situation and have recognised that there may be some potential concerns for animal welfare arising from heavy rainfall in specific parts of the country (the north west in particular).  Farmers with such concerns are advised to contact the Nitrates Section of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine at (053) 9163444 or by email to nitrates@agriculture.gov.ie with details of the flooding and/or trafficability situation, their herd number and other relevant data.  Such contact should be made by Saturday 14 October at the latest.</p>  <p>  Farmers wishing to avail of such flexibility will be advised:</p>  <p>  1. To spread only that volume of slurry necessary to ensure adequate storage capacity for the remainder of the closed period</p>  <p>  2. That any spreading should occur as soon as good spreading conditions exist</p>  <p>  3. That they will be prioritised for inspection by Local Authorities in the immediate future to ensure compliance with the Nitrates Regulations</p>  <p>  4. That assessment of overall on-farm storage capacity may be part of that inspection process</p>  <p>  5. That the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine will subsequently contact the farmers to ascertain and record the date(s) on which this additional spreading takes place.</p>  <p>  Local Authority inspection reports will be returned to my Department and will be shared with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and those farms needing to avail of this flexibility will become a priority category for inspections in future years also.</p></reply>

Rebuilding Ireland &ndash; Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness sets out ambitious targets to, inter alia, double the annual level of new homes built to 25,000 by 2020 and to deliver an additional 47,000 social housing homes.  The Plan also seeks to optimise the existing housing stock and to lay the foundations for a more vibrant and responsive private rented sector.</p>  <p>  Just over one year into the plan, all of the key statistical indicators point to a significant scaling up of home building activity, with:</p>  <p>  - Planning permissions granted for 19,246 new homes in the 12 months to the end of June 2017, an increase of 49% year on year;</p>  <p>  - Commencement notices for 16,945 new homes notified to local authorities in the 12 months to the end August 2017, an increase of 47% year on year; and</p>  <p>  - ESB residential connections of 17,651 to the end of August 2017, an increase of 25% year on year.</p>  <p>  Preliminary figures from the Central Statistics Office's Quarterly Survey of Production for Q2 2017 show that the residential construction sector has grown by 20.5% in volume terms and 22.7% in value terms over the previous 12 months.</p>  <p>  Specifically in terms of first-time buyers, the volume of mortgage drawdowns in the twelve months to the end of June 2017 has increased by 17%.  The Help to Buy initiative for first-time buyers, introduced by the Minister for Finance in October 2016, continues to assist first-time buyers in obtaining the deposit required to purchase or self-build a new home.  The incentive provides for a refund of up to &euro;20,000 in Income Tax and Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) paid over the previous four tax years to first-time buyers.</p>  <p>  Housing affordability has been examined across a range of interconnected policy areas in the context of the ongoing focused review of Rebuilding Ireland.  A number of new and enhanced actions in this area have already been announced and I expect to make further announcements in the coming weeks as this work is finalised.</p></reply>

Proposals for individual solar farm developments are subject to the statutory requirements of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, in the same manner as other proposed developments.  Planning applications are made to the relevant local planning authority with a right of appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</p>  <p>  Under the Planning and Development Act, each planning authority's development plan must set out an overall strategy for the proper planning and sustainable development of the area concerned.  Section 10 of the Act requires a development plan to include, inter alia, objectives for the provision or facilitation of the provision of infrastructure, including energy facilities, and many local authorities have developed renewable energy strategies for their areas in this context.</p>  <p>  In making decisions on planning applications, planning authorities and the Board must consider the proper planning and sustainable development of the area, having regard to the provisions of the local development plan, any submissions or observations received and relevant Ministerial or Government policies, including any relevant guidelines issued by my Department.  Planning authorities must then make their own decisions based on the specific merits or otherwise of individual planning applications.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the planning code is sufficiently robust to facilitate the assessment of individual planning permission applications for solar farm developments.

The levy will be applied by planning authorities, commencing on 1 January 2019 in respect of sites which were vacant and on the vacant site register during the year 2018 and will subsequently be applied on an annual basis thereafter, as long as a site remains on the vacant site register in the preceding year.</p>  <p>  Planning authorities are presently engaging in the necessary preparatory work, prior to the application of the levy with effect from January 2019 in respect of sites identified on the register in 2018.  As required under the Act, this includes the identification of specific vacant sites for entry on the register as well as the registered owners of the sites in question along with undertaking a site valuation.  Vacant site registers were established in January 2017 by planning authorities and the registers will be populated as the preparatory work progresses during the year.</p>  <p>  At this time, Galway City and Galway County Council are undertaking the necessary preparatory work before entering sites on their register. A number of sites have been identified in Galway City as possibly falling under the levy requirements.  The Council is currently ascertaining the ownership of these sites and whether they meet the criteria to have the levy applied.  Furthermore, in the county area, the Council is presently engaged in an assessment of all potential vacant sites in the County as part of a review of Statutory Local Area Plans, in accordance with the provisions of the legislation.</p></reply>

I understand that both Galway local authorities have undertaken promotional and awareness campaigns following the introduction of the Buy &amp;amp; Renew and Repair &amp;amp; Lease initiatives.  I further understand they are pursuing some properties identified through this process, while others may not prove suitable. I recognise that achieving social housing delivery through schemes such as Buy &amp;amp; Renew is likely to be more resource-intensive for the local authorities than other delivery streams, such as acquiring good quality housing.  Sourcing the owners of vacant properties and undertaking remediation works will draw on resources, albeit it can present new sources of properties for social housing while tackling vacancy.</p>  <p>  Both the Galway authorities are actively engaged in identifying properties suitable for acquisition, including properties in reasonable condition and vacant properties under the Buy &amp;amp; Renew Scheme.  In the period since 2016, they have been successful in acquiring over 50 new social homes in various locations, 5 of which are under the Buy &amp;amp; Renew Scheme.</p>  <p>  I have requested the local authorities in the main cities to develop and adopt Vacant Homes Action Plans by the end of October, with a deadline for all other County Action Plans to be completed by end-2017.  I expect the preparation of these Plans will assist the authorities in developing a fuller understanding of the current vacancy levels in their functional areas, to ascertain where empty homes are located and who owns these vacant properties, and then to prioritise and target those areas where housing demand is most acute.</p></reply>

The TGDs are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at</p><p><i>.</i></p><p>The requirements of Part M aim to ensure that regardless of age, size or disability: </p><p>- new buildings other than dwellings are accessible and usable;</p><p>- extensions to existing buildings other than dwellings are, where practicable, accessible and useable;</p><p>- material alterations to existing buildings other than dwellings increase the accessibility and usability of existing buildings, where practicable;</p><p>- certain changes of use to existing buildings other than dwellings increase the accessibility and usability of existing buildings where practicable; and</p><p>- new dwellings are visitable.</p><p>Part M of the Building Regulations aims to foster an inclusive approach to the design and construction of the built environment.  While the Part M requirements may be regarded as a statutory minimum level of provision, the accompanying technical guidance encourages building owners and designers to have regard to the design philosophy of universal design and to consider making additional provisions, where practicable and appropriate.</p><p>While the latest iteration of Part M of the Building Regulations initially coincided with the general downturn in economic and construction activity, its positive effects on access and use in the built environment will now be seen more widely as economic recovery takes hold and construction activity continues to gather momentum and moves onto a sustainable footing. </p><p>While the provisions of the Building Regulations do not relate to management or maintenance of buildings and compliance with the Regulations is not dependent on these,  it is acknowledged that they are important functions and contribute to the ongoing accessibility of the building.  Important issues which are generally the responsibility of the management and/or maintenance teams include:</p><p>- arranging furniture appropriately;</p><p>- keeping circulation routes clear, facilities clean, equipment (lifts, communication aids, etc.) functioning;</p><p>- carrying out maintenance audits on a regular basis;</p><p>- putting a detailed emergency action plan in place to ensure safe egress for all in the event of an emergency;</p><p>- procurement of accessible goods and services (office furniture, security services, etc.);</p><p>- providing pre-visit information regarding access to the building on the organisation&rsquo;s website;</p><p>- providing information on the accessibility features of the building to occupants, in order to allow for effective management procedures to be put in place.</p><p>Guidance on how to design, build and manage buildings and spaces so that they can be readily accessed and used by everyone, regardless of age, size, ability or disability  is available in 'Building for Everyone, A Universal Design Approach' , a National Disability Authority(NDA) publication , which may be accessed at www.nda.ie.</p><p>Separate to requirements under the Building Regulations, the building control regulations require, in the case of commercial buildings and apartment blocks, that a Disability Access Certificate be obtained from the local building control authority. <b></b>A Disability Access Certificate is a certificate which specifies that the works or building to which the application relates will, if carried out in accordance with the plans and specifications submitted, comply with the requirements of Part M of the Second Schedule to the Building Regulations.  It is an offence to occupy or use a building without having a valid Disability Access Certificate in place as required.</p><p>Finally, it is open to any person to refer a discrimination complaint to the Equality Tribunal under the Equal Status Acts 2000 &ndash; 2015, which prohibits discrimination on nine specified grounds including that of disability.  It should also be noted that requirements set out under equality legislation are a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality.</p></reply>

Applications in all cases are made to the local authority.</p>  <p>  The Disabled Person Grant Scheme provides funds to local authorities to undertake adaptations and extensions to homes to meet the needs of local authority tenants with a disability, or to address serious overcrowding.  The Housing Adaptation Grant Scheme for Older People and People with a Disability is also delivered by local authorities with funding from my Department.  It assists people with a disability in private houses to have necessary adaptations, repairs or improvement works carried out in order to make their accommodation more suitable for their needs.   There are no restrictions on the type of disability covered by the schemes and the administration of the available funding is a matter for the local authorities based on their assessment of priority and need at the time.</p></reply>

This included the establishment of a new national economic model to generate the type of economic and demographic data required to inform the NPF and assess the impacts of various policy options.  A key aspect of this work was the development of demographic forecasts, based on past trends, and the generation of a range of future spatial development scenarios.  These future scenarios were then tested against the assembled forecast data to inform the future national and regional development scenarios in the NPF, with the NPF indicating approximately an additional 1 million population by 2040 in Ireland.</p>  <p>  Over the coming weeks, it is my intention to publish a number of reports underpinning the publication of the Ireland 2040: Our Plan Framework.  This will include an ESRI Demographic and Econometric modelling report, setting out full details in relation to the population and demographic projections.</p></reply>

This is in accordance with the requirements of EU Directive 2001/24/EC on the assessment of the effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment, the SEA Directive.  SEA is a process by which environmental considerations are required to be fully integrated into the preparation of plans and programmes which act as frameworks for development consent, prior to their final adoption, with public consultation as part of that process. It is envisaged that the public consultation as part of the SEA process will be undertaken in early 2018.</p><p>When finalised, the revised Guidelines will be issued under Section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.  Planning authorities, and, where applicable, An Bord Plean&aacute;la must have regard to guidelines issued under Section 28 in the performance of their functions generally under the Planning Acts.</p></reply>

No. 299 of 2017) was approved by Government on 5 July 2017 and came into effect on that date. Pursuant to the Order, statutory responsibility for a wide range of Defence matters has been delegated to me. The principal responsibilities delegated include powers to make Regulations under various provisions of the Defence Acts 1954 to 2015 and powers in respect of personnel-related issues affecting members of the Defence Forces.    The powers delegated to me under the Defence (Delegation of Ministerial Functions) Order 2017 are, essentially, the same as the powers delegated under the Defence (Delegation of Ministerial Functions) Order 2016 (S.I. No. 314 of 2016) with the exception of some minor changes. As part of the preparation of the 2017 Order, an examination took place of the statutory provisions specified in the 2016 Order. Following on from this examination, statutory powers conferred on the Minister for Defence under the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Act 2009 (sections 9, 10 and 13) and the Geneva Conventions (Amendment) Act 1998 (sections 9 and 10) were included in the 2017 Order.</p></reply>
