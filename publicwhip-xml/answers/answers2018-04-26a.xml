I am determined to ensure that fisheries remain high on the Brexit agenda in the EU and that the interests of Ireland's fishing communities are fully safeguarded.</p>  <p>  My continued objective is to ensure that the implications for fisheries are fully taken account of in the negotiations on the framework for a future EU-UK relationship.  Ireland&rsquo;s key priorities in this regard will be maintenance of current access to fishing grounds in the UK zone and protection of Ireland&rsquo;s existing quota shares.</p>  <p>  I am glad to say that Michel Barnier has concurred with our viewpoint that fisheries arrangements must be an integral part of the overall future relationship agreement.  As a result, the negotiating guidelines for the future relationship - adopted by the European Council on the 23rd of March - state that: "In the overall context of the FTA, existing reciprocal access to fishing waters and resources should be maintained".</p>  <p>  In addition, for fisheries, the transition arrangements will involve no change whatsoever to existing arrangements other than the fact that the UK will no longer be part of decision making bodies within the EU. </p>  <p>  I continue to engage closely with the Irish fishing industry representatives, in fact, just last week I held a meeting with these stakeholders alongside an Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste to discuss Brexit. I am pleased at the level of unity on these key issues both within Ireland and across the rest of the EU fishing industry.  </p>  <p>  In conclusion, I would like to assure the Deputy that, working together with the Barnier Task Force, this Government and I aim to ensure that fisheries are inextricably linked to overall future relationship negotiations and that all of our existing access rights and quota entitlements are fully protected.</p></reply>

This is a key part of our response to the challenges and uncertainty posed by Brexit, and in line with the market development theme of the Food Wise 2025 strategy. A wide range of staff across my Department are involved in market access work which is co-ordinated by an internal High-Level Market Access Committee, chaired at Assistant Secretary General level. </p>  <p>  Total Irish agri-food trade exports to China (including Hong Kong and Macao) were  &euro;974 million in 2017. China is now our third largest market overall for agri-food exports. Dairy exports reached &euro;667 million and pigmeat exports were over &euro;100 million in 2017. These were the two largest categories of food exported to China, and for both of these commodities China was Ireland's second largest destination market according to the Central Statistics Office (CSO) trade data. China is also a growing market for seafood and other food and drink exports. </p>  <p>  By gaining access to China, we have now opened a very significant beef market for Irish beef companies. However, I cannot comment on the expected growth or the precise value of exports. The role of the Government is to open up access to new markets, in line with our Foodwise 2025 strategy, and to maintain access to existing markets. It is now up to our beef companies to avail of this opportunity. I hope that they will follow the success that our exporters have already had in finding Chinese markets for dairy, pigmeat and seafood products.</p>  <p>  On average Chinese beef consumption is now 4kg per person per year. That may be considered low when compared to average Irish consumption of 19kg of beef per capita per year, and compared to average consumption in other Asian markets such as Japan (almost 7kg) and South Korea (almost 10 kg). However, that just underlines the potential for further growth in consumer demand for beef, driven by increasing urbanisation, higher disposable incomes and health awareness.  </p>  <p>  Total beef imports to China were around 600,000 tonnes in 2016. That is more than Ireland&rsquo;s total beef exports to all markets last year.  I firmly believe that our beef industry can and will compete effectively in the Chinese market and I look forward to the opportunities that this access will bring. </p></reply>

A wide range of staff across my Department are involved in market access work which is co-ordinated by an internal High-Level Market Access Committee, chaired at Assistant Secretary General level. </p>  <p>  The recent opening of the Chinese beef market to Irish beef is hugely significant for the Irish beef industry, all along the chain from farmers through to processors and exporters.  It marks the culmination of a number of years work involving my Department, the Irish Embassy in Beijing and with the close co-operation of the Chinese Ambassador in Dublin and his Embassy staff, Bord Bia, and the industry itself.  </p>  <p>  The BSE ban was lifted for Irish beef by the Chinese authorities in 2015 and a successful AQSIQ inspection visit, focused on competent authority systems, followed in 2016.  Following this, I signed a protocol on the export of frozen beef from Ireland to China with the AQSIQ Minister Zhi Shuping in Dublin in April 2017. The next step was a Certification and Accreditation Administration of the People&rsquo;s Republic of China (CNCA) inspection in August/September 2017 to assess individual processing plants. </p>  <p>  The final report of the CNCA Inspection issued in March 2018 and following intensive negotiations between Irish and Chinese officials on a number of issues, I was pleased to announce the opening of the market last week, initially for three plants.</p>  <p>  There remain a number of technicalities to be finalised now that these initial plant approvals have been granted. However, my Department has, in conjunction with industry, been working for sometime towards ensuring that trade with China can commence and run smoothly. This includes amendments to IT systems and an SI to allow access to information. These are due to be finalised in a matter of weeks. In addition the approved plants will have to deal with their own technicalities including testing requirements.  </p>  <p>  While I expect that the trade will commence this summer; it is of course a matter for industry to decide how and when to pursue the opportunities offered. The role of my Department is to open the door to allow trade to commence. Next month I will lead a Government agri-food trade mission to China and Hong Kong. The timing of this Trade Mission is particularly opportune, given the recent progress on access.</p></reply>

It marks the culmination of a number of years work involving my Department, the Irish Embassy in Beijing and with the close co-operation of the Chinese Ambassador in Dublin and his Embassy staff, Bord Bia, and the industry itself.  </p>  <p>  My Department has developed a deep understanding of Chinese requirements based on a series of inward and outward trade missions, inspection visits and bilateral contacts between the relevant officials. </p>  <p>  However, I am not going to put a figure on how much beef Ireland will export to China. The role of my Department is to open the door to allow trade to commence. I hope that Irish beef companies will follow the success we have already had in finding Chinese markets for dairy, pigmeat and seafood products.  Trade in these commodities has developed over the years from a low base. Dairy exports to China reached &euro;667 million and pigmeat exports were over &euro;100 million in 2017. For both of these commodities China was our second largest export destination after the United Kingdom </p>  <p>  Within the last 30 years Chinese demand for meat has quadrupled, and the country now consumes one quarter of the world&rsquo;s meat supply. Total beef imports to China were around 600,000 tonnes in 2016. That is more than Ireland&rsquo;s total beef exports to all markets last year (550,000 tonnes). </p>  <p>  There is an estimated middle class in China of around 300 million people and a rising demand for meat.

Given that the first approvals under the scheme run from 1 October 2015 it is a remarkable achievement to have exceeded this target within a period of 15 months.</p><p>GLAS, like previous agri-environment schemes supports participants in improving their agricultural productivity and practices in a sustainable manner.  The scheme delivers overarching benefits to the rural environment and also addressed the issues of the mitigation of the impacts of climate change, the enhancement of biodiversity and the improvement of water quality. The scheme provides valuable support to participants who deliver public goods and environmental benefits that enhance the sustainability credentials of Irish agriculture.</p><p>The scheme is co-funded by the National Exchequer and the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development. As required under EU regulation two payments issue in respect of each year &ndash; the advance payment, followed at a later stage by the balancing payment.</p><p>Payment for the grazing and cutting of Traditional Hay Meadow under GLAS has been justified, in the promotion of maintaining a traditional method of forage conservation that is beneficial to grassland flora and fauna. My priority is to ensure that farmers continue to qualify to receive payment of &euro;315 per hectare for this action.</p><p>In order to alleviate the current forage supply problem, one of the initiatives put in place is an an extension to the closing date for grazing livestock on land containing the Traditional Hay Meadow action under the scheme and grazing by livestock is now permitted up to 1st May this year.  It is not possible to bring forward the cutting date as seed dispersal is a key requirement to maintain species diversity. </p><p>It is important that that we recognise what the scheme is delivering in terms of the environment and public goods.  It is also important to recognise the buy in to the scheme by the farming community in achieving, and in some instances surpassing, the targets set out in the RDP.  It is to all our benefit that we deliver in real terms including:</p><p>- The Low Input Permanent Pasture and the Traditional Hay Meadow actions which are delivering over 350,000 hectare of diverse grassland species.</p><p>and also:</p><p>- 29,000 kilometres of river bank managed to protect rivers from pollution under the Protection of Watercourses from Bovines and Riparian Margins actions</p><p>- Over 200,000 hectares of farmland bird habitat managed to protect bird species</p><p>- Over 20,000 hectares of Wild Bird Cover planted providing winter feed for farmland birds</p><p>- Over 2m trees planted</p><p>- Almost 5,000 farmers using new technologies to spread slurry</p><p>- 10,000 hectare of arable land cultivated using Minimum Tillage techniques.</p><p>These achievements will deliver public goods across the key areas of Water Quality, Biodiversity and Climate Change and deliver real public goods for the wider society. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-04-26a.23.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018042600053#WRA02200"><p>Under the EU regulations, 2018 is the first year that all applications for the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS) are to be submitted online.  Recent years have seen significant growth in the number of farmers applying for the BPS online, and this is reflective of the range of benefits that online application brings for farmers.</p>  <p>  Among the benefits available to online applicants is the availability of preliminary checks for online applications. These preliminary checks allow online applicants to be advised of certain errors at an early stage and to correct any such issues without penalty.  </p>  <p>  These preliminary checks have proved very successful in previous years, and they represent one of the many advantages for farmers in making their BPS applications online. </p>  <p>  From 2018 all the elements of the Direct Payments Schemes (BPS, Greening, Young Farmers Scheme, National Reserve, and transferring of entitlements) are online.  This helps to ensure that the Department can process all applications under these schemes as efficiently as possible.</p>  <p>  I am aware that for some people, this is the first year that they will have engaged with the online applications process.  To help farmers to submit their application online in 2018, I ensured the early opening for the BPS application facility in 2018.  The application process in 2018 opened over a month earlier than in 2017.  This provides more time for farmers to familiarise themselves with the online application facility and to submit their applications. My Department contacted these farmers in advance of the online application facility opening advising them of the requirement to submit online in 2018.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department have also subsequently notified farmers of a range of supports available to applicants, including a series of BPS clinics in locations throughout the country. These clinics have been running since early April and enable farmers to sit with an official from my Department who guide them through the process to enable submission of the application online by the farmer.</p>  <p>  Further supports such as telephone help lines and &lsquo;How to&rsquo; guides are also in place.  As we move towards the application deadline, my Department will be in contact with these farmers again to provide further details on these supports.  These supports ensure that all farmers are able to access these important payments.</p>  <p>  I would urge all farmers to avail of the opportunity to apply for the BPS via the online system.  It is open for farmers to do this either as individuals or through an agent.  Online applications allow my Department to continue to improve on the delivery to farmers of essential payments under schemes such as BPS and the Areas of Natural Constraint Scheme.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-04-26a.26.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018042600053#WRA02500"><p>The long term vision for the agriculture and land-use sector, including forestry, is an approach to carbon neutrality which does not compromise the capacity for sustainable food production. We are taking a number of steps on this pathway, with the Department funding a range of initiatives and schemes to improve the sustainability of the sector. Examples include over 50,000 farmers participating in GLAS and 30,000 farmers in the Beef Data Genomics Programme. The Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Schemes (TAMS) supports capital investment to promote sustainability with supports for low emissions slurry spreading equipment. These initiatives improve the efficiency of production lower the carbon footprint of food production.</p>  <p>  Following the recent mid-term review of the Forestry Programme 2014-2020 we have availed of further opportunities to promote the planting of new forests and mobilisation of both timber and biomass, such as the increase in the supports for the Forestry for Fibre scheme and agroforestry.</p>  <p>  The Effort Sharing Regulation includes the potential for Ireland to use up to a maximum annual flexibility of 5.6% of 2005 emissions, or 2.7 Mt CO2 eq per annum for the period 2021-2030, from Land use, Land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) in order to meet emission reduction requirements.  Under the new LULUCF accounting rules, the sector cannot emit more carbon dioxide than it absorbs.</p>  <p>  For Ireland, afforestation is the main cost effective land based climate mitigation tool available to us.  Based on the proposed accounting rules under the LULUCF proposal, 2.2 MT of CO2 eq is forecast to be accountable against our Effort Sharing Regulation targets from afforestation since 1990, net of deforestation.  The remaining contribution will come from cropland and grassland management activities that can protect soil carbon pools by reducing emissions and further enhance soil carbon pools by enhancing removals (sequestration). Examination of measures in the current agri environment climate scheme (GLAS) funded under the RDP suggests that farmers would have a reasonable interest in measures that protect and enhance soil carbon pools provided incentives are reasonable and related to inconvenience and income foregone of actions involved.</p>  <p>  It is important that this flexibility is not seen as an offsetting proposal but rather as an effort to broaden the &ldquo;toolbox&rdquo; of abatement options available to achieve targets. This is particularly true for a country like ours with a strong agriculture sector where existing abatement measures are costly and action in the LULUCF sector, that encourages removals and limits emissions, presents a more cost effective option. </p>  <p>  Mobilising LULUCF credits is not free and will have significant financial costs and requires long term policy decisions.</p></reply>

This key market presents an excellent opportunity for the Irish beef sector, from farmers through to processors, in line with the market development theme of our Food Wise strategy. Opening and developing new markets is also a key part of our response to the uncertainties arising from Brexit.  </p>  <p>  Our agri-food exports to China have increased roughly five-fold from around &euro;200 million in 2010 to nearly &euro;1 billion last year. This has been a remarkable achievement and underlines the importance of the Chinese market for the sector. As regards beef, the door has now been opened and there is a real opportunity for the industry to build on this. </p>  <p>  China has developed into a strategically important partner for Ireland on agri-food issues. It is our third largest trading partner in this sector. I value the mutually beneficial business and trading relationships between our countries and see great opportunities for building on this as China has a growing demand for food and beverages that are safe, nutritious and produced to the highest quality standards which Ireland can supply.</p>  <p>  To further boost our agri-food exports I will lead an extensive trade mission to China and Hong Kong next month, with Irish participation in SIAL, a major food fair in Shanghai, a key focus. This will provide and opportunity not only to further build on our trade relationships, but also to continue our dialogue with the Chinese Government.   </p>  <p>  It is also important to note that beef will not be the only focus, as I also see further opportunities for Irish Agri-food exports to China, particularly in the dairy and pigmeat sectors. Dairy exports reached &euro;667 million and pigmeat exports were over &euro;100 million in 2017. These were the two largest categories of food exported to China, and for both of these commodities China was the second largest destination market. China is also a growing market for seafood and other food and drink exports. This trade mission will include  industry representatives , with the intention of enhancing and improving our existing levels of trade .   </p>  <p>  Since taking office as Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, I have had the pleasure of visiting China in September 2016 and of welcoming several high-level Chinese delegations to Ireland. My Department continues to develop its relationship with its Chinese counterparts, including through the implementation of internship programmes for relevant Chinese officials. The development of the Chinese market is a key focus for Bord Bia, which has been provided with an additional &euro;14m since Q3 2016, to support its marketing and promotional efforts. </p>  <p>  I am proud to play a part in promoting trade between our two countries. I will continue to foster close relationships with my Ministerial counterparts in China and between officials from the respective administrations in order to further areas of mutual cooperation and to advance and facilitate market access opportunities in China. </p></reply>

I am determined to ensure that fisheries remain high on the Brexit agenda in the EU and that the interests of Ireland's fishing communities are fully safeguarded.</p>  <p>  My continued objective is to ensure that the implications for fisheries are fully taken account of in the negotiations on the framework for a future EU-UK relationship.  Ireland&rsquo;s key priorities in this regard will be maintenance of current access to fishing grounds in the UK zone and protection of Ireland&rsquo;s existing quota shares. These priorities are fully reflected in the future relationship guidelines and in the transition arrangements as part of the Withdrawal Agreement.</p>  <p>  With regard to the latter, for fisheries, the transition period &ndash; which is due to begin from March 2019 - will involve no change whatsoever to existing arrangements of the Common Fisheries Policy other than the fact that the UK will no longer be part of decision making bodies within the EU.  The Common Fisheries Policy, in place since 2014, is due for review in 2022.</p>  <p>  The progress achieved to date has been welcomed by the Irish fishing industry and the importance attached to the sector by this Government was clearly demonstrated last week with a meeting between industry representatives, An Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and myself.</p></reply>

This Regulation governs  Cod Effort Management in ICES areas 6a and 7a. </p>  <p>  The EU Commission proposal for the North Sea Management Plan has been under consideration by the Council and European Parliament since 2016, including the issue of repealing Council Regulation 1342/2008.</p>  <p>  The Parliament, Council and Commission in December 2017 finalised the provisions of the Management Plan and one of the outcomes is that Regulation 1342 of 2008 will be repealed. </p>  <p>  Consequently, it is expected that later this year, possibly by May 2018, that the Cod Effort Management arrangements and its KW ceiling restrictions will no longer apply and the use of track record for vessels to access areas 6a and 7a will no longer be required.</p>  <p>  Technical Measure requirements will continue to apply as set out in EC Regulation 850/98 as amended by EU regulation 812 of 2015. </p>  <p>  In the context of the repeal of the EU  Regulation, the introduction of any replacement fishing effort scheme would be a matter for national consideration and could only be justified for the purposes of protecting, conserving or allowing the sustainable exploitation of the cod stocks in Areas 6a or 7a.  As these are shared fishing stocks at EU level, I would have concerns about the case for introducing such national measures applicable only to Irish vessels.  In the context of the cod stock in Area 6a, there is a zero quota and only by-catches of 1.5% of the total catch may be retained on board and landed.  The by-catch in the Irish fishing fleet in terms of both landings and discards, is I understand small, but the Marine Institute advise that there is a high by-catch of cod in the fleets of other Member States.  In that regard, the EU Commission has published proposals for a Multi- Annual Plan for Western Waters which include both Area 6a and 7a stocks.   This plan will be negotiated within the Council and European Parliament over the coming months and the aim of the plan is to contribute to achieving fishing at sustainable levels.  The measures introduced under this plan will apply to all Member States operating in these areas.</p></reply>

GLAS 2017 advance payments have now issued to over 47,000 applicants, representing over 99% of all participants that are eligible for payment. This payment is worth over &euro;169m to Irish farmers.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-04-26a.47.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018042600053#WRA04600"><p>Firstly I want to put on record that I am committed to supporting this very important sector which plays a key role in the development of the wider agri-food industry. The tillage sector is an important and integral component of the Agri-food industry, making a significant contribution to overall agricultural output. Crop production as a whole including Horticulture contributes in the region of &euro;700 million annually to agricultural output at farm gate prices. In particular the cereals sector is a major contributor to livestock production providing high quality grain to the animal feeding industry. Tillage is also a key source of seed production, grain for the milling and malting industry and as a consequence is a significant stakeholder in our agri-food industry from a supply/food safety and sustainability viewpoint. </p>  <p>  I acknowledge that cereal production has experienced a number of challenging years both in terms of grain price and weather conditions. Ireland accounts for only 1% or so of EU production and so grain prices here are very much affected by European and world market price shifts. The annual cereal area has reduced in recent years. For example, in 2017 the national cereals area reduced by about 10,000 ha to 270,000. However despite the decline in the area dedicated to cereals the level of output has been maintained at approximately 2.3 million tonnes. This is a tribute to the excellence of our tillage farmers in producing the highest yields of top quality food and feed materials. </p>  <p>  I would like to highlight the actions my Department is undertaking to assist this vital sector. In 2017 I introduced the &euro;150m Agriculture Cashflow Support Loan Scheme and extended it to cover the tillage and horticulture sectors. There was a very positive reaction by farmers, including tillage farmers, to the Scheme, which has proved that significant demand exists for low cost flexible finance.  The &ldquo;Agriculture Cashflow Loan Scheme&rdquo; has provided a template for access to finance schemes, including the recently announced &ldquo;Brexit Loan Scheme&rdquo; for SMEs.  </p>  <p>  In view of the difficult weather conditions this spring, I have requested a derogation from the European Commission in relation to the Crop Diversification (&ldquo;3 crop rule&rdquo;) requirement as part of Greening for 2018. I am confident of a favourable response. As a consequence of alternative crop options no longer being available to farmers, growers can make crop choices that best suit their current situation.</p>  <p>  In 2017, &euro;3m was paid out to Irish farmers under the EU Protein Aid Scheme, primarily for the production of beans. Almost 14,000 hectares was sown by 1,200 growers under the measure and this is a significant increase from the 3,500 hectares that were sown prior to the introduction of the scheme thus highlighted the success of the Scheme. I was pleased to announce earlier this year the extension to the Protein Aid Scheme for 2018 with the same level of funding as 2017 thereby providing continued financial support to the growing of protein crops also providing a valuable break crop option.</p>  <p>  On a broader front, the EU is in deficit in relation to plant protein for animal feed and currently imports 75% of its plant derived protein requirements. In this context, the Commission is committed to preparing a report on plant proteins that will build on existing knowledge and national/regional experiences. From Ireland&rsquo;s perspective I will support measures designed to increase production of protein crops in Europe and request the continuation of the Protein Aid Scheme for the growing of protein crops in Ireland. </p>  <p>  As a further support to tillage farmers the Tillage Capital Investment Scheme under TAMS II covers specific areas of investment including Minimum Disturbance Tillage Equipment, Sprayers, Fertiliser Spreaders and increasing Grain Storage and Drying capacity.  There has been a significant level of interest in investments under this measure with a total number of 1015 applications received so far and 779 approvals. Over &euro;2.63m has now issued in respect of 239 payment claims. The measure continues to be open to further applications.   </p>  <p>  In addition to TAMS, the GLAS tiered entry system prioritised tillage farmers who chose the &ldquo;minimum tillage&rdquo; or &ldquo;catch crop establishment&rdquo; environmental actions.  Furthermore in order to assist tillage farmers, and in particular specialist malting barley growers, my department decided to grant a special exemption from the Basic Payment Scheme Crop Diversification requirement under Greening to farmers that entered GLAS and committed to establish a catch crop on all of their tillage area.</p>  <p>  In response to the exceptionally challenging harvest conditions of September 2016 I introduced a Weather Related Crop Loss Support measure to assist farmers who experienced significant yield losses in spring cereal crops. This measure provided support for verified crop losses. Particularly hard hit growers who experienced verified significantly higher crop losses were eligible for an additional payment per hectare, on the same area. </p>  <p>  While the challenges facing the sector at this point in time are real, in Ireland we can grow cereals with the highest yields in the world and this is an advantage we must press home and also look to exploit other areas under our own control. My own Department also provides a high quality official crop seed certification scheme to the industry in addition to an extensive national crop variety evaluation programme. I would also encourage tillage growers to seek and implement the advice and research provided by Teagasc, supported by funding from my Department, in relation to efficient and sustainable production of crops. I remain fully committed to assisting all involved in the sector to optimise efficiency and sustainability. </p></reply>

However, I would point out that the Commission was quick to react as soon as the practices uncovered in Brazil came to light. Its actions in immediately  suspending the certification for the establishments responsible, together with the rejection of consignments en route to the EU from those establishments, were appropriate and effective. I have also welcomed the harmonised approach subsequently taken to the more intensified checks carried out on product from Brazil at EU Border Inspection Posts, and in which Ireland has played a full part. </p>  <p>  It is vitally important that meat and meat products being exported from any country to the EU fully comply with EU standards, and that there are robust and reliable systems in place to ensure that this is the case. We cannot tolerate a situation in which EU requirements are flouted, given the potential risks for food safety and consumer health.  </p>  <p>  These events demonstrate that we must remain vigilant at all times. I believe that we must therefore continue to keep this situation under ongoing review, and be ready to take additional measures if the circumstances demand it.</p>  <p>  More generally on the question of the EU-Mercosur trade negotiations, these discussions are ongoing. </p>  <p>  I believe there is a need for continued vigilance in relation to the conduct of these trade negotiations, and I will continue to insist that they are handled appropriately, and in a manner that safeguards the interests of the Irish and European beef sector. </p>  <p>  I will also continue to work very closely with Member State colleagues in this regard. In particular, I believe full account must be taken of the findings of the Commission&rsquo;s own assessment of the cumulative impact of trade deals on the agri food sector, and the potentially very damaging impact of Brexit on an already delicately balanced EU beef market. </p></reply>

Indeed, this is all the more relevant after the UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU, which presents significant new challenges for the agri-food sector in particular. </p>  <p>  Food Wise 2025 outlines the huge potential for growth in agri-food exports to new and emerging markets, including in Asia, Africa and the Gulf region. </p>  <p>  In keeping with the priorities outlined in Food Wise 2025 I led a very successful Trade Mission in February 2017 to the Gulf Region. This covered the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. This was followed by an extensive Trade Mission to the US and Mexico in June. Both markets offer many elements that are very attractive to Irish exporters. The US is the largest food and beverage market in the world and has a population of 324 million people. Around 35 million Americans also claim Irish ancestry. Mexico has a population of 127 million, making it the eleventh-largest country in the world in population terms and the fifteenth-largest economy in the world, with projections that it will move into the top five by 2050.</p>  <p>  During a trade mission to Japan and South Korea in November 2017 I was accompanied by 40 representatives of the Irish food sector, as well as by experts from my Department, the CEO of Bord Bia and senior representatives from Enterprise Ireland and Teagasc. </p>  <p>  This was a very opportune time to bring a delegation of Ireland&rsquo;s food leaders to this part of the world, given that the EU has concluded a Free Trade Agreement with South Korea as well as concluding an Economic Partnership Agreement with Japan in December 2017. Japan and South Korea are markets of high potential for beef, pigmeat and sheepmeat exports, and so it is important that we raise the profile of Irish agri-food enterprises that already have access to these markets, and make progress in negotiating access for others. </p>  <p>  Following on from the successful trade mission to the USA and Canada in February of this year I will, as part of the marketing effort, lead further trade missions in 2018 to promote Irish food and drinks in key markets.  I will also lead a trade mission to China and Hong Kong next month to develop our relationship further given that the Chinese beef market is now open to exports from Ireland.</p>  <p>  These and the other missions that my Department are planning for 2018 will serve to enhance and improve our existing levels of market access in these destinations.  They will also promote Ireland&rsquo;s reputation as a producer of high quality, safe and sustainably produced meat and dairy products. </p>  <p>  The destinations are also in keeping with the recent market prioritisation exercise that was completed by Bord Bia at my request. This exercise identified opportunities in new and more mature markets, and will provide valuable market intelligence both for industry operators and policy makers. I have also provided an additional &euro;14 million to Bord Bia since Q 3 2016 , inter alia  to strengthen its presence in overseas markets. </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to seek out and identify new markets and I am ready to respond as appropriate to other opportunities that may arise. </p></reply>

Food Wise 2025 identifies competiveness as a key theme and includes a recommendation that stakeholders work to &ldquo;improve access to finance for agriculture, forestry and seafood producers and agri-food companies&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  I launched a new &ldquo;Brexit Loan Scheme&rdquo; on 28 March in cooperation with the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation and the Minister for Finance, which will provide up to &euro;300 million of affordable, flexible working capital finance to Irish businesses that are either currently impacted by Brexit or who will be in the future. The Scheme will be available to SMEs and mid-cap businesses. Given their unique exposure to the UK market, my Department&rsquo;s funding ensures that at least 40% of the fund will be available to food businesses. The finance will be easier to access, more competitively priced (at a proposed interest rate of 4%), and at more favourable terms than current offerings. This will give Brexit-impacted businesses time and space to adapt and to grow into the future. The Scheme will remain open until 31st March 2020.</p>  <p>  I also announced in Budget 2018 that my Department is considering the development of potential Brexit response loan schemes for farmers, fishermen and for longer-term capital financing for food businesses. These schemes are developed and delivered in cooperation with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) and take time to develop and operationalise. Consideration and discussions are ongoing in this regard and I will announce further details on this as they become available.</p>  <p>  While continuing to explore additional funding mechanisms, I also liaise with the main banks on issues relating to the agri-food sector, all of whom have specialised products available and have expressed a commitment to servicing the future financing needs of the sector.  </p></reply>

These have been funded primarily by my Department.</p>  <p>  The most relevant survey in terms of the population&rsquo;s overall consumption for fruit and vegetables is the most recent National Adult Nutrition Survey which was conducted over the period 2008-2010 with its findings published in 2011.  </p>  <p>  Over the three year period this survey investigated habitual food and beverage consumption, lifestyle, health indicators and attitudes to food and health in a representative sample consisting of 1,500 adults aged 18 years and over in the Republic of Ireland. The database which was compiled from the survey is the most complete and up-to-date collection of food consumption data available for adults in Ireland. It is also one of the most comprehensive of its kind in Europe.</p>  <p>  The survey found that fruit and vegetables were consumed by the majority of the population. The average combined intake of fruit and vegetables (excluding composite dishes, fruit juice and potatoes) was 192g per day.   The World Health Organisation recommends a daily intake of 400g of fruit and vegetables. At the time of the survey this recommendation was met by only 9% of 18-64 year olds and 15% of those aged 65 years and over.</p>  <p>  More recently Healthy Ireland, a Government initiative to improve the health of the Irish people, has increased the recommended number of fruit and vegetable portions for the Irish population up to seven a day. All fresh, frozen, tinned, dried and juiced choices count towards the recommended seven a day. There is a job of work to be done in increasing fruit and vegetable consumption levels and it will take time to effect long term changes in consumer behaviour but Healthy Ireland are actively working on this.  </p>  <p>  Fruit and vegetables provide a range of vitamins and minerals and are an excellent source of fibre. They are usually low in fat and calories and that is why having seven a day can help maintain a healthy weight. As many in the House will know it is very important that we eat sufficient fruit and vegetables as they lower the risk of serious health problems such as heart disease, stroke and certain cancers.</p>  <p>  Of course, it goes without saying that it is best to choose Irish fruit and vegetables in season where possible.  </p>  <p>  Looking at other aspects of the Deputy&rsquo;s question it is not possible to give a definitive meaningful breakdown of consumption in terms of imported versus domestically produced fruit and vegetables.  The percentage breakdown differs greatly between products and across seasons.  For example, all citrus fruit consumed here is imported but the majority of strawberries consumed here during the Irish production season are grown in Ireland.  This situation also pertains in-season for most of the vegetable crops grown here.</p>  <p>  In response to the final element of the Deputy&rsquo;s question I hold a very positive outlook for the future of fresh produce and the Irish Horticulture Sector overall.  </p>  <p>  FoodWise 2025 identified the potential to grow Irish horticultural output by 25% and this should be achievable given the need to increase overall fruit and vegetable consumption in the Irish diet.  </p>  <p>  Irish horticulture growers are among the most efficient and technologically advanced in the world; however in considering potential to expand production and replace imports we must be conscious of the economic and environmental aspects which may not justify extending the season for Irish production or the growth of certain crops under current Irish climatic conditions.  </p>  <p>  The Irish horticulture industry is one of the more dynamic sectors within Irish agriculture and is constantly evolving over time.  Issues such as Brexit will potentially present challenges to those exporting horticultural produce and the mushroom sector in particular, however growers are reacting by seeking to diversify production and by seeking to source new markets.  Other growers are also taking advantage of projected changes in the Irish climate with a vineyard recently established in the South of Wexford and a grower in Wicklow initiating establishment of a hops plantation last year with the intention of supplying Irish hops for use in the growing Irish craft beer sector.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to support development within the horticulture sector primarily through two Schemes.  The nationally funded Scheme of Investment Aid for the Development of the Commercial Horticulture Sector funds capital investments in specialised horticultural buildings and equipment.  The EU funded Fruit and Vegetable Producer Organisation Scheme provides support for growers that produce in a more environmentally friendly manner and are willing to come together to collectively market their produce.  There are currently two Irish based fruit and vegetable Producer Organisations and a number of other fruit and vegetable growers are actively considering the possibility of becoming involved in a Producer Organisation.</p></reply>

In recognition of this, I have met with the CEOs of the main banks and discussed the current cash flow and liquidity position of the primary sector. I emphasised to them that they should recognise the temporary and exceptional nature of the current situation and that they should be flexible and put in place measures to support their customers. They indicated to me that there are no signs that there is a liquidity issue across the sector as a whole, while acknowledging that there may be pressures in individual cases.

This is very good news for our agri-food sector and indeed for the country. The ongoing search for new third-country markets is a priority for my Department, particularly in the context of the challenges posed for our livestock products by the upcoming UK exit from the EU.</p>  <p>  But while China will be an important future market for Irish beef, live exports will also remain an important component of Ireland&rsquo;s livestock industry, playing a vital role in stimulating price competition, and providing an alternative market outlet for Irish farmers. </p>  <p>  Indeed, live exports were among the strongest performers in terms of agri-food export growth in 2017.  Last year saw an increase by 21%, to the value of &euro;175 million.  &euro;115 million of this represents the live cattle market.  Live exports will continue to play a part in informing the destinations selected for trade missions in 2018 as it did in 2017.   </p>  <p>  In terms of animal welfare, EU Council Regulation (EC) No. 1/2005 on animal transport provides for the application of stricter rules by member states than those set down at EU level. Ireland has availed of this provision and, therefore the current Irish legislation, made possible by powers conferred under the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013, sets higher standards relating to the approval of ships for livestock transport than those which apply generally in the EU. </p>  <p>  Only ships approved by my Department, which involves assessment from independent Marine Surveyors in the process, can load cattle for export from Ireland. Livestock being exported are monitored by my Department&rsquo;s veterinary inspectors during the prescribed isolation period, with the loading of cattle also supervised by Department officials. All animals are inspected and must be certified as regards health status and fitness for travel, and cattle on board a livestock ship departing from Ireland are typically bedded and penned in conditions very similar to cattle in any feedlot or cattle shed. In addition, due regard must be taken to weather conditions in respect of long distance transport and these measures contribute to maintaining Ireland&rsquo;s reputation as an exporter of livestock of high health status.</p>  <p>  The preservation of Ireland&rsquo;s animal health status, the international reputation of veterinary certification services and the existence and application of a regulatory framework ensures that high standards and welfare considerations are taken into account during transport and are essential components to safeguarding Ireland&rsquo;s live export trade. </p>  <p>  The Deputy can be assured that my Department will continue to promote and maintain an environment in which live exports can continue in both an economic and sustainable manner, with an ongoing strong emphasis on the welfare of all animals being exported.</p></reply>

Recent years have seen significant growth in the number of farmers applying for the BPS online, and this is reflective of the range of benefits that online application brings for farmers.</p>  <p>  Among the benefits available to online applicants is the availability of preliminary checks for online applications. These preliminary checks allow online applicants to be advised of certain errors at an early stage and to correct any such issues without penalty.  </p>  <p>  These preliminary checks have proved very successful in previous years, and they represent one of the many advantages for farmers in making their BPS applications online. </p>  <p>  From 2018 all the elements of the Direct Payments Schemes (BPS, Greening, Young Farmers Scheme, National Reserve, and transferring of entitlements) are online.  This helps to ensure that the Department can process all applications under these schemes as efficiently as possible.</p>  <p>  I am aware that for some people, this is the first year that they will have engaged with the online applications process.  To help farmers to submit their application online in 2018, I ensured the early opening for the BPS application facility in 2018.  The application process in 2018 opened over a month earlier than in 2017.  This provides more time for farmers to familiarise themselves with the online application facility and to submit their applications. My Department contacted these farmers in advance of the online application facility opening advising them of the requirement to submit online in 2018.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department have also subsequently notified farmers of a range of supports available to applicants, including a series of BPS clinics in locations throughout the country. These clinics have been running since early April and enable farmers to sit with an official from my Department who guide them through the process to enable submission of the application online by the farmer.</p>  <p>  Further supports such as telephone help lines and &lsquo;How to&rsquo; guides are also in place.  As we move towards the application deadline, my Department will be in contact with these farmers again to provide further details on these supports.  These supports ensure that all farmers are able to access these important payments.</p>  <p>  I would urge all farmers to avail of the opportunity to apply for the BPS via the online system.  It is open for farmers to do this either as individuals or through an agent.  Online applications allow my Department to continue to improve on the delivery to farmers of essential payments under schemes such as BPS and the Areas of Natural Constraint Scheme.</p></reply>

The role of my Department is to open up access to new markets, in line with the market diversification theme of our Foodwise 2025 strategy, and to maintain access to existing markets. It is now up to our industry to avail of this significant opportunity. I hope that they will follow the success that our exporters have already had in finding Chinese markets for dairy, pigmeat and seafood products.</p>  <p>  The prices agreed at factory level are a matter for the primary producers and the factories to agree. My Department does not have a role in relation to this. However my Department is committed to ensuring that we open as many markets as possible for both beef and live animals, in order to maximise returns for all.</p>  <p>  In relation to the marketing and promotional strategy for Irish beef in China, the strategy is primarily a matter for Bord Bia. However, my officials, Bord Bia and industry are working closely to ensure that Irish beef will be promoted effectively and appropriately for the Chinese market. </p>  <p>  The timing of the Government Trade mission that I will lead to China and Hong Kong next month is particularly opportune in this regard. For example nine Irish meat companies will exhibit at Sial China, Asia&rsquo;s largest food innovation exhibition, under the overall Bord Bia and Origin Green stand.  Detailed planning and preparation for the Trade Mission is underway at present.</p></reply>

My department is currently in the final stages of preparing a formal paper to include possible measures. I hope to be in a position to present this paper for a full public consultation in the coming days. Let me provide some background on this matter.</p>  <p>  This Government has committed to the development of the inshore sector in the current Programme for a Partnership Government. The programme identifies a number of methods for supporting the sector, such as ensuring smaller inshore boats are given new opportunities for commercial fishing. Support is being provided under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund Operational Programme (EMFF OP) for enhanced management and conservation of inshore stocks, including v-notching of lobster, more selective fishing gear and preparation and implementation of management plans for a sustainable inshore fishery. Funding of some &euro;6 million has been earmarked under the programme for the Inshore Fisheries Conservation Scheme.   </p>  <p>  I meet regularly with the National Inshore Fisheries Forum (NIFF). The NIFF and its supporting network of six Regional Inshore Fisheries Forums (RIFFs) cover the entire coast. The Inshore Forums provide a platform for the discussion of problems facing the inshore sea-fisheries sector and have been making recommendation to me on issues of concern for their sector.</p>  <p>  The NIFF is taking the lead in setting priorities for the inshore sector, including developing for the first time a dedicated strategy. From my meetings with the NIFF, I have introduced a number of industry-led initiatives, developed through the forum structures, following extensive consultation.  These include conservation measures for inshore stocks such as velvet crab and scallop off the coast of Wexford.  Public consultations were also held earlier this year (2018) on proposed management measures recommended to me by the NIFF in respect of brown crab and razor clam in the North Irish Sea. </p>  <p>  The potential impact of limiting access to different categories of vessels in inshore waters and within 6 nautical miles has been the subject of scientific and economic reports by the Marine Institute and Bord Iascaigh Mhara. There has also been preliminary engagement with fisheries representative groups in respect of these reports. The forthcoming consultation paper will set out possible measures and their potential impacts.</p>  <p>  Let me reassure the Deputy that once the public consultation begins, adequate time will be provided to ensure that the diverse interests of all stakeholders are considered and any possible measures will be fair and balanced.</p></reply>

As part of his appearance before the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure, he spoke of acceptable cuts to CAP and Cohesion of 5 - 10%. This was in the context of some Member States looking for cuts in these programme of up to 30%. </p>  <p>  These figures must be seen in the context of the European Commission's own Reflection Paper on the Future of EU Finances which was published on the 14 February 2018. Within this paper, a range of scenarios across all major spending programmes are outlined and the impacts of maintaining the current budget, a 15% cut and a 30% cut are outlined. The Communication is very clear that these are just options and not proposals and are intended to stimulate an open debate. </p>  <p>  Recent media reports indicate that Commissioner Oettinger stated at a trade Conference in Hannover that his proposal is for approximately a 6% cut. </p>  <p>  From Ireland's perspective, the Taoiseach, in his address to the European Parliament in January of this year, indicated that Ireland is open to contributing more to the EU budget, but only if it is spent on policies that contribute to the advancement of the European ideal. </p>  <p>  The CAP is such a policy. The European Commission's Communication on the Future of Food and Farming sets out a higher environmental ambition for the next CAP, highlights the need to strengthen the resilience of the European agriculture sector, and, improving the European added value of the policy to name but a few.  In order to address these challenges I believe as strong a CAP budget as possible must be maintained post 2020 and I have repeatedly called for this at the Council of Agriculture Ministers meetings.  </p>  <p>  Discussions on the future CAP are intensifying under the Bulgarian Presidency and will continue afoot under the Austrian Presidency from 1 July. In that context, I look forward to engaging constructively with the Presidency, my European counterparts and the European Commission, to ensure the next CAP continues to provide necessary support to the Irish and European agriculture sector. My officials are also continuing to engage with their counterparts in the Presidency, the Commission, Member States and with our own Department of Finance who are the lead Department for Ireland on the MFF. We await the MFF proposals due to published on 2 May 2018.</p></reply>

My Department therefore does not have statistics on the causes of bovine deaths. The  costs associated with putting in place a system to diagnose and record the cause of death  would be prohibitive.</p><p>The National Bovine Viral Diarrhoea (BVD) Eradication Programme is an industry- led programme delivered by Animal Health Ireland (AHI). A voluntary programme was introduced in 2012 and this became compulsory in 2013.  The legislative basis for the programme is currently set out in S.I. No. 30 of 2017, the Bovine Viral Diarrhoea Order 2017.  This requires that all animals born on or after the 1 January 2013 are tested for the presence of the BVD virus.  Animals found to be persistently infected (P.I.) are disposed of.  Progress to date has been excellent with numbers of persistently infected animals reducing year on year as follows:<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Animals Tested</th><th>Number of P.I. Animals </th><th>Percentage</th></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>2,095,738</td><td>13,877</td><td>.66%</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>2,131,945</td><td>9,733</td><td>.46%</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>2,264,819</td><td>7,426</td><td>.33%</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>2,324,229</td><td>3,805</td><td>.16%</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>2,340,663</td><td>2,390</td><td>0.1%</td></tr><tr><td>2018(to date)</td><td>1,340,001</td><td>593</td><td>0.04%</td></tr></table></p><p>The vast majority of these animals were disposed of through the knackery system, thus contributing to the overall on-farm death data above, with a small number being slaughtered. It will be noted that the eradication programme has been successful in bringing about a major reduction in the incidence of PI animals being born and thereby lowers the risk of disease spread. </p><p>However, it can be deduced from the above that in the 5 years leading up to the introduction of the National BVD Eradication Programme in 2013 approximately 14,000 PI animals were born in each of these years. The animals in question are likely to have suffered ill thrift and died at a young age before being removed to a knackery.</p><p>Control of BVD &ndash; a condition which compromises the immune response capability of animals -  also brings overall health benefits to the national herd, with animals being better able to respond to other infection risks.</p></reply>

Given that the first approvals under the scheme run from 1 October 2015 it is a remarkable achievement to have exceeded this target within a period of 15 months. </p>  <p>  GLAS, like previous agri-environment schemes supports participants in improving their agricultural productivity and practices in a sustainable manner.  The scheme delivers overarching benefits to the rural environment and also addresses the issues of the mitigation of the impacts of climate change, the enhancement of biodiversity and the improvement of water quality. The scheme provides valuable support to participants who deliver public goods and environmental benefits that enhance the sustainability credentials of Irish agriculture.</p>  <p>  The scheme is co-funded by the National Exchequer and the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development.

This includes the requirement that payments cannot commence until after 15 October annually.</p>  <p>  GLAS 2017 advance payments have now issued to over 47,000 applicants, representing over 99% of all participants that are eligible for payment. Of the 25,025 applicants for GLAS 1, 24,051 have received the 2017 advance payment, with 974 remaining. 10,476 and 12,684 have been paid for GLAS 2 and GLAS 3 respectively, with the Department continuing to process applications for the remaining 674 and 502 in these tranches.</p>  <p>  In approximately 1,600 of the outstanding cases, applicants remain ineligible for payment until they complete the steps they must take before the Department can process their payment. The general issues preventing payments taking place include the non-submission of nutrient management plans (NMP's), commonage management plans, low emission slurry spreading forms, rare breeds forms and 2017 BPS application issues that remain to be resolved.</p>  <p>  Other cases are being examined separately to clarify what remedy can be put in place to resolve their particular issue. Where action is needed by the participant concerned the Department, if it has not already done so, will be in direct contact with them.</p>  <p>  I anticipate that GLAS 3 balancing payments will commence in May and I would remind scheme participants that outstanding Nutrient Management Plans and Commonage Framework Plans must be submitted before this payment can be released.</p>  <p>  In relation to the AEOS 2017 scheme year 2,101 cases have been paid in full with 145 remaining cases which continue to be processed.</p>  <p>  Updates are published weekly on my Department&rsquo;s website and clearly show that steady progress is being made in reducing outstanding cases.  While my officials are prioritising the clearing of cases and where a farmer has been contacted for additional information it is important that any such request is responded to as the information requested is essential to finalise all checks.</p></reply>

The CAP has evolved considerably and very effectively in recent years, in response to changing market, consumer and environmental demands.  It also plays a central role in delivering the smart, sustainable and inclusive growth sought under the Europe 2020 strategy. </p><p>It is important that the CAP continues to evolve in a way that supports the achievement of European priorities, particularly in the context of securing a strong CAP budget for the post 2020 period.  This can only be achieved by reinforcing the relevance and effectiveness of the policy in helping to achieve broader societal goals.  This is something that I strongly believe in and will continue to actively pursue at Council level as the debate on the future CAP and its budget intensifies over the coming months.</p><p><b>Budgetary context </b></p><p>There will be budgetary challenges, arising not only from the UK decision to exit the EU, but also from the need to address other EU policy challenges, such as those relating to migration, security and growth. In that regard, the CAP should not be seen as a policy of the past and is already addressing some of these &ldquo;new challenges&rdquo;.</p><p>The Taoiseach, in his address to the European Parliament in January 2018, has already indicated that Ireland is open to contributing more to the EU budget, but only if it is spent on policies that contribute to the advancement of the European ideal.</p><p>More clarity will be provided next Wednesday, the 2 May 2018 when the European Commission publish their MFF proposals.</p><p>I regularly meet with my European ministerial colleagues at the monthly Council of EU Agriculture Ministers. These meetings give me the opportunity to discuss future CAP policy and funding. Since July of last year, I have bilaterally met with the French Agriculture Minister Stephane Travert on three separate occasions, with the main focus of discussion being CAP post 2020.  In addition, during the first half of 2017, I held an intensive round of bilateral meetings with my counterparts in key Member States, and I am repeating this process currently.  </p><p>My officials have and will continue to engage with officials in all Member States with whom we have a deep and long lasting relationship. In particular, my officials engage on a regular basis with their counterparts in other Member States through a G6 meetings which includes the Netherlands, France, Germany, Denmark, Austria and ourselves.</p><p>The next stage of in the CAP post 2020 process will be the publication of the legislative proposals, which are due on 29 May 2018. In that context, I look forward to engaging constructively with the Presidency, my European counterparts and the European Commission, to ensure that the next CAP continues to provide necessary support to the Irish and European agriculture sector. </p></reply>

However Ireland's position on the need for a well funded CAP is well understood at institutional level and by other Member States in the European Union. In his address to the European Parliament in January 2018, the Taoiseach indicated that Ireland is open to contributing more to the EU budget, but only if it is spent on policies that contribute to the advancement of the European ideal. I consider CAP to be one such policy.</p>  <p>  It is however worth noting that not all Member States are in favour of increasing their contributions to the overall EU budget, so upcoming budget negotiations will be difficult. Further clarity will be provided shortly when the MFF proposals are published by the Commission on 2 May 2018.  </p>  <p>  However I wish to assure the Deputy that I have argued and will continue to do so at the Council of Agriculture Ministers for as strong a CAP budget as possible post 2020. </p></reply>

While the overall dairy sector is now in a much better place overall than it has been in recent years, there is a significant overhang of intervention stocks of skimmed milk powder in the EU.</p>  <p>  I remain conscious of the pressure volatility in dairy markets can exert on farmers and I can assure the Deputy that I am committed to utilising all measures at our disposal, including EU market measures such as intervention, aids to private storage and exceptional market measures, as necessary. </p>  <p>  There were approximately 376,000 tonnes of SMP (skimmed milk powder) in public intervention stocks at the end of February. In common with the vast majority of EU Member States where dairy production is of significance within the broader agri-food sector, I recognised that this situation in respect of existing stocks could not be allowed to persist indefinitely. </p>  <p>  Officials from my Department have been engaging with the Commission and with industry stakeholders, in order to facilitate the reduction of those stocks through the tender procedure, and following offers for tenders from market operators. Tenders for the purchase of approximately 4,000 tonnes and approximately 24,000 tonnes of SMP out of existing SMP intervention stocks were accepted in March and April of this year respectively. An orderly reduction in these SMP stocks is in my view the most appropriate means by which to deal with this overhang of stocks.  </p>  <p>  In parallel, my Department also engaged with the Commission on recent measures to limit further piling up of SMP in 2018 without due justification, including ensuring that the Commission's proposal to reduce the fixed price ceiling to zero be specified as for 2018 only, to avoid setting a precedent for the longer term.  There has been no change to the fundamental provisions of the intervention mechanism, nor to the necessary supports that intervention provides during periods of market volatility.</p>  <p>  Given the Commission&rsquo;s effective status as among the world&rsquo;s biggest players on the SMP market, and as such their capacity to affect market sentiment, it would be appropriate that they continue to act prudently and responsibility in the disposal of stocks.  I am satisfied to date that the Commission has managed these stocks in a prudent manner. </p>  <p>  My Department has and will continue to engage with the Commission, with other Member States, and with national stakeholders on these important issues.  </p>  <p>  Ireland is strongly positioned as a competitive producer of dairy products. It has enviable natural resources, adaptable and resilient producers, a strong international reputation, an effective dairy processing sector and a strong core of research infrastructure and expertise. My Department will continue to work with our partners in the industry to develop measures which can minimise the effects of price volatility in the future and ensure sustainable growth. </p></reply>

Indeed, this is all the more relevant after the UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU, which presents significant new challenges for the agri-food sector in particular. </p>  <p>  Food Wise 2025 outlines the huge potential for growth in agri-food exports to new and emerging markets, particularly in Asia, Africa and the Gulf region. Our efforts to develop new and emerging markets will be focused on these areas, particularly given the need to diversify our markets and to reduce our reliance on traditional destinations such as the UK.  We will also continue to develop more mature markets, such as those in North America and Europe. </p>  <p>  In keeping with the priorities outlined in Food Wise 2025 I led a very successful Trade Mission in February 2017 to the Gulf Region. This covered the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. This was followed by an extensive Trade Mission to the US and Mexico in June. Both markets offer many elements that are very attractive to Irish exporters. The US is the largest food and beverage market in the world and has a population of 324 million people. Around 35 million Americans also claim Irish ancestry. Mexico has a population of 127 million, making it the eleventh-largest country in the world in population terms and the fifteenth-largest economy in the world, with projections that it will move into the top five by 2050.</p>  <p>  During a trade mission to Japan and South Korea in November 2017 I was accompanied by 40 representatives of the Irish food sector, as well as by experts from my Department, the CEO of Bord Bia and senior representatives from Enterprise Ireland and Teagasc. </p>  <p>  This was a very opportune time to bring a delegation of Ireland&rsquo;s food leaders to this part of the world, given that the EU has concluded a Free Trade Agreement with South Korea as well as concluding an Economic Partnership Agreement with Japan in December 2017. Japan and South Korea are markets of high potential for beef, pigmeat and sheepmeat exports, and so it is important that we raise the profile of Irish agri-food enterprises that already have access to these markets, and make progress in negotiating access for others. </p>  <p>  Following on from the successful trade mission to the USA and Canada in February of this year I will, as part of the marketing effort, lead further trade missions in 2018 to promote Irish food and drinks in key markets.  I will also lead a trade mission to China and Hong Kong next month to develop our relationship further,  given that the Chinese beef market is now open to exports from Ireland. </p>  <p>  These and the other missions that my Department is planning for 2018 will serve to enhance and improve our existing levels of market access in these destinations.  They will also promote Ireland&rsquo;s reputation as a producer of high quality, safe and sustainably produced meat and dairy products. </p>  <p>  The destinations are also in keeping with the recent market prioritisation exercise that was completed by Bord Bia at my request.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-04-26a.129.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018042600054#WRB06100"><p>Ireland is a country with low levels of forest cover compared to the European average and an uneven age class distribution in our forests stemming from our afforestation efforts over the last century. Forest growth and harvesting and the related changes in carbon stocks therefore occurs on an uneven basis. Based on research conducted by Teagasc, greenhouse gas removals by our forests will fluctuate significantly up to 2050 with an overall reduction in the carbon stock between now and 2050 before it increases again. This pattern is related to the age class distribution of our forests and is observed in other countries with similar levels of forest cover and age class distributions. </p>  <p>  The use of wood for energy purposes plays an important role in substituting fossil fuels and can play an important role in decarbonising the Irish economy. In this context, forest based biomass will be central to the success of the &ldquo;Sustainable Support for Renewable Heat&rdquo; scheme which was launched recently by DCCAE and SEAI. This initiative is considered key to increasing the level of renewable energy production in Ireland. Based on the continuation of sustainable forest management, our forests have the capacity to produce over 4 million cubic metres of forest based biomass by 2035 suitable for energy production. This primarily comes from residues from timber processing and downgraded wood, and does not include the use of large diameter sawlog that feeds our sawmills and represents a higher value forest product from both an economic and climate change perspective. </p>  <p>  The current Forestry Programme 2014 -2020 provides grants and premiums to encourage landowners to plant trees. So far under this programme over 18,000ha of new forests have been established. This means that forest cover is increasing in Ireland year on year as clearfell sites must be replanted. According to the National Forest Inventory 2012, the area of forests is estimated to be 731,650 ha or 10.5% of the total land area of Ireland; forest cover is estimated to be at its highest level in over 350 years. Demand for wood biomass for energy is forecast to more than double by 2025 and maintaining afforestation rates will be key to meeting this demand in the future. </p>  <p>  A Regulation covering the Governance of the Energy Union is currently being negotiated which will likely include forecasts of greenhouse gas changes in the land use, land use change and forestry sector. Once this Regulation and timeframe has been agreed my Department will be conducting new long term forecasts of forest carbon stock changes.</p></reply>

In Paragraph 52, the EU and the UK acknowledge that the Good Friday Agreement recognises the birthright of all the people of Northern Ireland to choose to be Irish or British or both and be accepted as such. The Joint Report also confirms that the people of Northern Ireland who are Irish citizens will continue to enjoy rights as EU citizens, including where they reside in Northern Ireland. Both parties agreed that the Withdrawal Agreement should respect and be without prejudice to the rights, opportunities and identity that come with European Union citizenship for such people, and that the next phase of negotiations would examine arrangements required to give effect to the ongoing exercise of, and access to, their EU rights, opportunities and benefits. </p>  <p>  This was reflected in the draft Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland that is part of the draft Withdrawal Agreement, published by the European Commission on 18 February.</p>  <p>  Discussions on the rights of individuals are ongoing as part of the Phase 2 negotiations on issues related to Ireland and Northern Ireland. Further engagement is needed on which EU rights, opportunities or benefits can be exercised by the people of Northern Ireland who are Irish and therefore EU citizens, when they are resident in Northern Ireland, which will be outside the territory of the European Union after the UK departure.</p>  <p>  As the UK leaves the European Union, there is an onus on its Government to ensure that it provides as necessary for the recognition in the Joint Report that the people of Northern Ireland who choose to identify as Irish, and therefore as citizens of the EU, can continue to enjoy the rights, opportunities and benefits of EU citizenship, including where they reside in Northern Ireland. </p>  <p>  At the same time, there is an obligation on the UK Government under the Good Friday Agreement to uphold the birthright of all the people of Northern Ireland to identify themselves and be accepted as Irish or British, or both, as they may so choose. </p>  <p>  The means by which both of these obligations can be upheld by the UK requires further discussion between the EU and the UK. As in all other areas of the Article 50 negotiations, the operation of EU law will also need to be respected.</p>  <p>  The Government will continue to engage intensively on these issues in order to ensure the protection of the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, including the citizenship provisions.</p></reply>

The Common Travel Area is an important feature of the close relationship Ireland enjoys with the UK, with long-established bilateral benefits.</p>  <p>  It means Irish citizens can move freely North and South, East and West, and live, work, study and access social benefits in the UK on the same basis as UK citizens. Importantly, it also underpins the citizenship provisions of the Good Friday Agreement. The CTA is an arrangement that is valued on both islands and the continuation of this arrangement is a stated objective of both the Irish and UK Governments.</p>  <p>  I welcome Article 2 on the Common Travel Area outlined in the draft Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland which states that the UK and Ireland may &ldquo;continue to make arrangements between themselves relating to the movement of persons between their territories&rdquo;. This is an important outcome of the work so far in seeking to maintain the Common Travel Area. </p>  <p>  The focus of the work to maintain the Common Travel Area after the UK leaves the EU continues to be through the appropriate channels of engagement with the UK so as to ensure that the necessary provisions are in place in both jurisdictions. </p>  <p>  Domestically, interdepartmental work to maintain the Common Travel Area is ongoing. This work will ensure that associated rights and entitlements provided for under the CTA, but since overlain by EU legislation, will continue after the UK leaves the European Union. This work will continue over the coming months in order to ensure the continuation of the CTA and associated rights and entitlements post-UK exit.</p></reply>

Israel is obviously vigilant when there are mass demonstrations close to its border with Gaza. However, the number and nature of casualties in recent weeks, arising from the use of live ammunition, is difficult to understand.</p>  <p>  I issued two public statements in relation to these incidents, on 31 March and on 9 April. I called on all sides to show restraint, particularly Israeli forces, in their use of force. And I supported the calls by the EU and by the UN Secretary General for an independent and transparent investigation into these events. The Irish Ambassador in Israel has made Ireland&rsquo;s concerns known to the Israeli authorities. I have also been in contact with Israel&rsquo;s Ambassador in Ireland about the events.</p>  <p>  I have also made clear in all my contacts in the region that the situation in Gaza is untenable. If the cycle of violence and depression in the Strip is not ended, events of this nature will inevitably recur. The long-standing blockade cannot be accepted as normal. It is for this reason that, in my visits to Gaza and in my many contacts at EU and international level, I have been particularly active in trying to encourage and promote international interest and alternative approaches. I will continue to make this a priority in my work.</p></reply>

The level of information gathered should be appropriate to the nature and complexity of the product or service being sought by the consumer, but must be to a level that allows the regulated entity to provide a professional service and must include details of the consumer&rsquo;s needs and objectives, personal circumstances and financial situation.</p>  <p>  The European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016 transposed the Mortgage Credit Directive.  The Mortgage Credit Regulations impose certain obligations regarding assessment of the creditworthiness of consumers. The Regulations provide that before concluding a mortgage credit agreement, a lender must make a thorough assessment of the consumer&rsquo;s creditworthiness.  The assessment must take appropriate account of factors relevant to verifying the prospect of the consumer being able to meet his or her obligations under the credit agreement.  The lender must ensure that the procedures and information on which the assessment is based are established, documented and maintained.  The Regulations provide that a lender should only make credit available to a consumer where the result of the creditworthiness assessment indicates that the consumer&rsquo;s obligations resulting from the credit agreement are likely to be met in the manner required under that agreement.  The assessment of creditworthiness must be carried out on the basis of information on the consumer&rsquo;s income and expenses and other financial and economic circumstances which are necessary, sufficient and proportionate.  </p>  <p>  The European Communities (Consumer Credit Agreements) Regulations 2010 apply to the provision of certain credit for amounts between &euro;200 and &euro;75,000. Part 2 of the Regulations include an obligation on creditors to assess the creditworthiness of consumers, on the basis of sufficient information obtained from the consumer and where necessary, on the basis of a consultation of the relevant database. </p>  <p>  With regard to the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 (Section 48) Regulations 2015 (the SME Regulations) provide that, prior to entering into a credit facility agreement with a micro or small enterprise, a regulated entity must gather and record sufficient information from the borrower to assess whether that credit is suitable to that borrower.  The level of information gathered must be:</p>  <p>  - appropriate to the nature and complexity of the credit facility agreement being sought by the borrower, and</p>  <p>  - to a level that allows the regulated entity to assess the borrower&rsquo;s likely ability to repay the debt over the duration of the agreement. </p>  <p>  The SME Regulations provide that a regulated entity can offer a credit facility agreement to a micro or small enterprise borrower only where it has satisfied itself on reasonable grounds that: </p>  <p>  - the credit is suitable to that borrower, and </p>  <p>  - the borrower will likely be able to repay the debt over the duration of the credit facility agreement  </p>  <p>  It should also be noted that the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code 2012 (the Code) must be complied with by all regulated entities providing financial services in the State.  The Code requires assessments of affordability to be carried out when providing credit to consumers.  These requirements apply to credit agreements to consumers as defined in the Code which do not fall within the scope of the various Regulations outlined above.  </p>  <p>  A regulated entity must take account of the result of the affordability assessment when deciding whether a personal consumer is likely to be able to repay the debt for that amount and duration in the manner required under the credit agreement.</p></reply>

In addition, the Credit Union Act 1997 (Regulatory Requirements) Regulations 2016 (2016 Regulations) provides for services exempt from additional services requirements. Where a credit union wishes to provide services to its members, other than those services that are provided for under the 1997 Act or the list of services exempt from the additional services requirements set out in the 2016 Regulations, an application may be made to the Central Bank for approval to provide such additional services, in accordance with the provisions in sections 48-52 of the 1997 Act.</p><p>Debit card provision is subject to formal application and approval by the Central Bank, whether it be direct provision or distribution of third party debit cards under sections 48 and 49 of the Credit Union Act.</p><p>There is currently a fully defined current account service including debit card, Members Personal Current Account Services (MPCAS) which is available to eligible credit unions as an additional service.

A listing on the ILEP is required for a provider to enrol students requiring immigration permissions.</p>  <p>  Following the outturn of this inspection, the Department of Justice and Equality, in consultation with the Department of Education and Skills, took the decision to remove this provider&rsquo;s programmes from the ILEP in line with the established procedures for this process.</p>  <p>  The majority of English language schools in Ireland are privately run. The relationship between teachers and private providers of education is based on a private contract, and issues relating to working conditions are a matter between the two parties and do not come under the remit of my Department. There is an extensive range of legislation in Ireland which protects the employment rights of workers in relation to equality, employment contracts, payment of wages and related matters. It is the responsibility of the employer in the first instance to ensure that their employees receive their employment rights. Where an employee considers that their rights have been breached, the individual can bring a claim under the appropriate legislation to the Workplace Relations Commission. In addition, the WRC is responsible for monitoring a range of employment rights through its Inspection Service.</p>  <p>  The ILEP in its current configuration is an interim regulatory tool for student immigration until the introduction of the International Education Mark (IEM). Legislative measures to enable the introduction of the IEM are contained within the Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) (Amendment) Bill 2018. The Bill is currently at drafting stage with the Office of Parliamentary Council (OPC) and is targeted for publication in the current parliamentary session. It is the intention that regulations promulgated in respect of the IEM will include a requirement that all obligations concerning national employment legislation are complied with by education and training providers seeking to access the Mark. </p></reply>

In 2004 her last day of substitute teaching was on 13 September. Her next teaching appointment commenced on 5 September 2005.

Section 6 of the Act, as originally drafted, contains the key provision, entitling an individual to 14 weeks of unpaid Parental Leave to be taken before the relevant child reaches the age of 5 years.  </p>  <p>  The Parental Leave (Amendment) Act 2006 was enacted on 18 May 2006 and updated the 1998 Act to provide 14 weeks unpaid Parental Leave for a child up to the age of eight, or 16 years of age in the case of a child with a disability.  The Act was again amended by the European Union (Parental Leave) Regulations 2013 (S.I. No 81 of 2013) to provide for 18 weeks unpaid Parental Leave in respect of a child up to the age of 8 years.  Furthermore, section 6(2)(c) of the Act was expanded to provide for an entitlement to Parental Leave in respect of a child up to the age of 16 where that child has a disability or a serious illness.</p>  <p>  These original and extended statutory minimum entitlements were negotiated by the social partners at European Level and implemented by Government in Ireland on foot of the subsequent EU Directives. The Directives create a minimum entitlement and there is nothing to prevent negotiations at workplace level between employers and employee representatives to expand these provisions by agreement. This is the reason for the different and augmented provisions in public sector employments, and indeed in certain private sector employments. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Programme for Partnership Government includes a commitment to increase paid leave for parents during the first year of a child&rsquo;s life, as research shows that parental care is of particular importance during this time.  The Government has established an interdepartmental working group to develop proposals to give effect to this commitment and I expect it to make its report at towards the end of this month. </p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s commitment to introduce a paid parental leave entitlement is also in keeping with the policy approach put forward by the European Commission's proposal for a work-life balance directive. The key proposal in the Directive is that parental leave should be made available to parents on a paid basis, and it is currently under discussion at working group level.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that Deputies Roisin Shorthall and Catherine Murphy have proposed a Private Members Bill, entitled Parental Leave (Amendment) Bill 2017, which provides for the extension of the existing entitlement to parental leave from 18 weeks leave to 26 weeks leave. The Government decided not to oppose this Bill at Second Stage, which took place on 8 February 2018.</p>  <p>  I advised the House that I was available to discuss the proposal contained in the Bill with the sponsoring deputies. The Bill has been referred to the Select Committee on Justice and Equality and I have strongly suggested that the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality carry out a comprehensive legislative scrutiny on the Bill and on related issues in order to inform the debate and to allow interested stakeholders, groups and individuals to make submissions and to input to the legislative process. </p>  <p>  I look forward to engaging in future discussions on the Bill in the context of the work that is ongoing in relation to expanding paid support to parents.</p></reply>

Neither type of CCTV system may be established without authorisation by the Garda Commissioner under section 38 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, among other requirements.</p>  <p>  In respect of community CCTV systems, the key requirements for the establishment of such systems are statutorily based and require that the proposal must-</p>  <p>  - be approved by the local Joint Policing Committee,</p>  <p>  - have the prior support of the relevant Local Authority, which must also act as Data Controller &ndash; this is a long-standing statutory requirement, set out in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (CCTV) Order 2006 (S.I.

Full details of the scheme, including guidelines for applicants, are available to download from my Department's website - www.justice.ie and I would encourage interested groups to avail of the scheme.</p></reply>

Modernisation of the trade part will provide for duty free trade on practically all trade in goods including in the Agricultural sector.  The agreement also includes common sanitary and phytosanitary (food safety and animal and plant health) standards, good regulatory practice as well as sustainable development in labour and the environment.</p><p>The EU-Mexico trade deal together with the EU's other recent trade agreements with Canada, Japan and Singapore sends a powerful and positive message on global trade.  Ireland already exports over &euro;2 billion of goods and services to Mexico so this agreement offers the potential to grow that further through increased market access, reduced tariffs and administrative simplification for exporters.</p><p>There will be no custom duties on 98% of goods from the moment the agreement comes into force.  For the remaining goods, custom duties will be removed over time or for a limited amount defined as a quota.  The agreement will be of significant value to Ireland&rsquo;s important Agri-food sector and, in particular, it will:  </p><p>- provide preferential access for fresh and processed cheeses of a 0% tariff quota of 5,000 tonnes (currently taxed up to 45%) and for mature chesses of a 0% tariff quota of 20,000 tonnes (currently taxed up to 45%);</p><p>- secure a considerable volume for milk powder, which Ireland is a prominent exporter of, starting with a 0% tariff quota of 30,000 tonnes from entry into force, rising to 50,000 tonnes after 5 years (currently taxed up to 50%) and</p><p>- allow Ireland to increase its pork and poultry exports to Mexico, with duty-free trade for virtually all pork products (currently taxed up to 45%) and economically relevant poultry products (currently taxed up to 100%).</p><p>The agreement contains provisions in relation to customs and trade facilitation, which are aimed at reducing processing times at the border and making movement of goods cheaper, faster, more predictable and efficient. This includes streamlining customs procedures, setting common principles and providing for better cooperation and exchange of information between EU and Mexican custom authorities and substantial provisions on transparency to ensure that traders and the public have access to information on legislation, decisions or administrative policies.  </p><p>Under the agreement, Mexico will also recognise product certification on industrial products carried out in the EU.  This will make it easier for EU companies to prove they have complied with Mexican standards and regulations.  Mexican exporters will still have to comply with the EU's strict standards and regulations, just as they do now.</p><p>The agreement will speed up trade while maintaining strong health and hygiene standards for food products.  The agreement also contains an explicit reference to the precautionary principle that governs the parties' approach to the decision making. This means that, as already enshrined in the EU treaties, the EU can continue to keep products out of its market as long as there is no scientific certainty that they are safe.</p><p>While the value of Ireland&rsquo;s services exports to Mexico in 2016 amounted to less than &euro;1m, this agreement will make it easier for Ireland to access Mexico&rsquo;s fast-growing services market. Under the agreement, Mexico will open up its public procurement market to Irish and EU companies more than it has to any other trading partner.  Mexico has also committed itself to enter negotiations with Mexican States to allow EU firms to tender for contracts at State level by the time the agreement is signed.  There are many exciting opportunities in Mexico for Irish businesses including manufacturing, automotive, engineering, telecommunications, ICT, aerospace, software and service and manufacturing technology.</p><p>In relation to SMEs, the agreement contains a dedicated chapter that requires the EU and Mexico to provide a website to assist SMEs to avail of the benefits of and provide dedicated information to SME&rsquo;s on the Agreement.  Contact points in the EU and Mexico will work together to take into account the specific needs of smaller businesses and identify ways they can take advantage of new opportunities in each market.</p><p>The agreement in principle contains the most important chapters agreed with the EU and Mexico continuing to work to resolve the remaining technical issues.  The EU and Mexico hope to finalise the full legal text before the end of the year.  The final text will be reviewed by lawyers from both parties, a process called &ldquo;legal scrubbing&rdquo;.  After legal scrubbing and translation into all EU official languages, the agreement will be submitted for the approval of EU Member States and of the European Parliament before signature.</p><p>Further information and a detailed description of the agreement in principle is available on the EU Commission&rsquo;s website at .</p></reply>

Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s (EI) #PrepareforBrexit communications campaign, featuring the &lsquo;Brexit SME Scorecard&rsquo;, was launched last March.  The Scorecard is an interactive online platform which can be used by all Irish companies to self-assess their exposure to Brexit.  </p>  <p>  A Technical Working Group on State Aid comprising representatives from DG Competition, DBEI, EI and DAFM was established in November 2017.  The objective of the Group is to scope and design schemes to support enterprises impacted by Brexit in line with current applicable State Aid rules.  Should issues arise that require an approach that does not fit within the existing State Aid rules, this will be raised as part of the Working Group discussions. </p>  <p>  A notified Rescue and Restructuring (R&amp;R) scheme was approved by the Commission in late November 2017. This scheme has been put in place as it is considered prudent to have contingency measures in place so that we can respond swiftly to changing circumstances as necessary.  Under the scheme, which will run until 2020, Enterprise Ireland can provide restructuring support to SMEs in severe financial difficulties.  </p>  <p>  As part of the deliberations of the Working Group on State Aid, it was agreed that my officials should extend the R&amp;R scheme to include temporary restructuring support for those SMEs who experience acute liquidity needs.  This extension, which has been notified to the Commission, will be a welcome addition to our suite of supports for businesses impacted by Brexit.  The temporary restructuring support, together with the rescue aid and the capital support under the Brexit Loan scheme should provide support to those SMEs who require stabilisation during transition.</p></reply>

The review document and a strategy roadmap will be completed by the OECD within 18 months of commencement. </p>  <p>  The review officially began with a daylong consultation process between my Department, OECD, State Agencies and other Government Departments on 12 April 2018. </p></reply>

Also, where there were pay cuts, it is not at all clear that they were applied in a universally consistent manner, as is the case in the public sector.  </p>  <p>  Therefore, the Government has put in place a process to establish a deeper understanding of the funding position in these grant - aided organisations and the true extent of the pay reductions applied. I asked the HSE to engage with the Section 39 organisations to establish the facts around what cuts were applied and how and when they were implemented. It was agreed that a pilot group of organisations should form part of the priority assessment exercise.</p>  <p>  The data provided by the organisations will inform the scope and nature of the follow - on work that may need to be done to complete the data-validation exercise. On completion of the analysis, the HSE will present the results to the Department of Health for assessment. An interim report on this matter is expected from the HSE in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

The Act specifies the criteria for decisions on the reimbursement of medicines.</p>  <p>  In line with the 2013 Act, if a company would like a medicine to be reimbursed by the HSE pursuant to the Community Drugs Scheme, the company must first submit an application to the HSE to have the new medicine added to the Reimbursement List.</p>  <p>  As outlined in the IPHA agreement, and in line with the 2013 Act, the HSE will decide, within 180 days of receiving the application (or a longer period if further information is sought from the company), to either add the medicine to the reimbursement list or agree to reimburse it as a hospital medicine, or refuse to reimburse the medicine.</p>  <p>  HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE). </p>  <p>  The NCPE conducts health technology assessments (HTAs) for the HSE, and makes recommendations on reimbursement to assist HSE decisions. The NCPE uses a decision framework to systematically assess whether a drug is cost-effective as a health intervention.</p>  <p>  The HSE strives to reach a decision in as timely a manner as possible. However, because of the significant monies involved, it must ensure that the best price is achieved, as these commitments are often multi-million euro investments on an on-going basis. This can lead to a protracted deliberation process.</p>  <p>  I have been informed that Ocrelizumab for the treatment of adult patients with early primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) in terms of disease duration and level of disability, and with imaging features characteristic of inflammatory activity and for the treatment of adult patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS) with active disease defined by clinical or imaging features is currently undergoing a full pharmacoeconomic assessment by the NCPE.</p>  <p>  I am keen to engage with Industry and to explore ways in which new medicines might be more easily introduced in Ireland.  However, any innovative approaches that may be tabled must be compatible with the statutory provisions which are in place and must also recognise the fundamental pricing/funding issues in the context of finite Exchequer resources.</p></reply>

In this regard my Department has paid out over &euro;1.6bn to Irish farmers under Pillar I and Pillar II and will continue to make residual payments.</p>  <p>  As a further early intervention, and to ensure a co-ordinated approach to the issue of fodder availability in affected areas, I convened a fodder group chaired by Teagasc, and comprising of all the main stakeholders including feed merchants and co-ops, banking, farm bodies etc.</p>  <p>  I introduced a targeted &lsquo;Fodder Transport Support measure&rsquo; on 29 January 2018 to provide additional assistance to those livestock farmers in parts of the West and North West severely affected by on-going fodder shortages. The main purpose of the measure was to support the cost of transporting fodder between those areas where it was plentiful and those where it was scarce. It is operated primarily through the Co-operative structure.  </p>  <p>  The continuation of cold wet weather throughout March resulted in a serious delay to the onset of spring. Grass growth remained negligible, ground stayed wet and livestock had to remain housed in many cases. This resulted in the fodder problem extending countrywide with a consequent tightening of fodder availability nationally.</p>  <p>  In response I extended the fodder transport measure to all counties and also introduced a Fodder Import Support Measure, to ensure that there was adequate fodder available to feed the national herd. This measure was introduced on 5 April to reduce the cost to farmers of imported forage (hay, silage, haylage etc.) from outside the island of Ireland. Northern Ireland is excluded. The measure is operated through Co-operatives and other importers approved by the Department. It covers fodder imported up to 30th April 2018. Support under the measure substantially reduces the cost to farmers of imported fodder. This  allocation will support the importation of up to 20,000 tonnes of fodder into the country and this will be kept under review as the weather situation continues to improve. </p>  <p>  In other supports, planning continues with a view to commencement of balancing payments under certain Pillar II schemes including the Sheep Welfare Scheme followed by the GLAS scheme in the near future. </p>  <p>  The GLAS Traditional Hay Meadow grazing date has been extended to 1 May 2018, and this makes available an additional 27,000 ha of grazing for livestock which would not otherwise be available.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, I have recently met with the CEO's of the main banks to discuss any cash flow issues arising from the recent bad weather and access to finance for the sector generally. During these meetings I continued to stress that in the context of the current situation the banks should be flexible and put measures in place to support their customers.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that all of the above measures address the remaining issues around fodder availability and it is not planned to introduce meal vouchers.</p>  <p>  Now that more normal spring conditions have arrived and grass is once again plentiful, the next step will be to prevent this situation arising again, through supporting farmers to effectively plan and manage their grass and fodder supplies for the coming winters.</p></reply>

The Commission has stated that fine tuning is still going on and they are addressing some issues that will benefit Member States and industry.  </p>  <p>  From an EU perspective, significant market access improvements were agreed for our core exports of cheese and diary products to Mexico. The agreement will provide for a Tariff Rate Quota (TRQ) of 20,000 tonnes in 5 years for mature cheese and 5,000 tonnes in 5 years for fresh cheese and 50,000 tonnes phased in 5 years for skimmed milk powder. Dairy preparation will benefit from total TRQs of 13,000 tonnes. The tariff for infant formula will be reduced to 50% of the Most Favourable Nation (MFN) rate in 5 years. There will be a considerable improvement of market access conditions for EU's exports for pork (fully liberalised, except a TRQ of 10,000 tonnes of loins) and poultry (full liberalisation at entry into force for mechanically deboned chicken meat and 20,000 tonnes of leg quarters). All TRQ&rsquo;s obtained by the EU are duty free.</p>  <p>  For fruits not yet liberalised, exports of apples will reach full liberalisation in 10 years and tinned peaches will be liberalised in 7 years. </p>  <p>  Mexico obtained the following TRQs for beef (10,000 tonne carcass weight equivalent with 7.5% duty phased-in over 5 years), beef offals (10,000 tonne carcass weight equivalent with 7.5% duty phased-in over 5 years), poultry will be fully liberalised except for chicken breast (TRQ with preferential duty of 10,000 tonnes) and egg products (5,000 tonnes egg equivalent for egg yolks). Exports of Mexican bananas will be aligned to the preferential tariff as for the other preferential bananas exporter (75&euro;/tonne) at the moment of the entry into force of the agreement. Mexico also obtained a full liberalisation for pork with the exception of frozen ham (TRQ of 10,000 tonne carcass weight equivalent). On honey, Mexico will benefit from full liberalisation in 7 years. During the dismantling period, the existing TRQ for honey granted under the existing agreement will be replaced at entry into force by a TRQ of 35,000 duty free. Finally, on ethanol (25,000 tonnes phased-in over 5 years) and raw sugar for refining only (30,000 tonne at 49&euro;/t phased-in over 3 years). </p>  <p>  For food and processed agricultural products (PAPs), this agreement will achieve liberalisation of all processed agriculture products with rapid or immediate tariff dismantling for key products such as pasta, chocolates, confectionery and chocolates, biscuits, lactose and lactose syrup. This result implies improved market access to both parties and cheaper imports for consumers.</p>  <p>   Full protection of 99% of European Union Geographical Indications has also been assured.</p>  <p>  When it comes to agri-food, Ireland has a significant trade surplus with Mexico, particularly in dairy, with more than &euro;45m in value exported in 2017. This announcement consolidates and strengthens the EU/Mexico relationship, and I am confident that further opportunities for the Irish agri-food sector will follow as a result. Indeed, against the background of these discussions, I led a Trade Mission to Mexico in June 2017 to promote Irish agri-food, and Irish officials engaged in technical discussions with their Mexican counterparts during that visit. I hope this agreement will allow these efforts to bear fruit in the short-term, which is of course vitally important against the background of Brexit.</p></reply>

This was in the context of some Member States looking for cuts of up to 30% in these programmes. More recent media reports indicate that Commissioner Oettinger referred, at a trade Conference in Hannover, to a  cut of approximately 6%. </p>  <p>  In any event there will be greater clarity when the Commissioner's MFF proposals are published in the very near future.  Even then, these proposals will be the subject of a negotiation between Member States, led by Finance Ministries and will ultimately have to be approved by the European Council and European Parliament.

I do not believe that such a proposal would receive the necessary support from member states.

However, I would point out that the Commission was quick to react as soon as the practices uncovered in Brazil came to light. Its actions in seeking immediate suspension of certification for the establishments responsible, together with the rejection of consignments en route to the EU from those establishments, were appropriate and effective. I have also welcomed the harmonised approach subsequently taken to the more intensified checks carried out on product from Brazil at EU Border Inspection Posts, and in which Ireland has played a full part. </p>  <p>  It is vitally important that meat and meat products being exported from any country to the EU fully comply with EU standards, and that there are robust and reliable systems in place to ensure that this is the case. We cannot tolerate a situation in which EU requirements are flouted, given the potential risks for food safety and consumer health.  </p>  <p>  These events demonstrate that we must remain vigilant at all times. I believe that we must therefore continue to keep this situation under ongoing review, and be ready to take additional measures if the circumstances demand it.</p>  <p>  More generally on the question the EU / Mercosur trade negotions, Ireland's position has, and will continue to be articulated to the Commision and to other member states at the very highest level.</p></reply>

It involves the establishment and joint funding between my Department, the Department of Housing, Planning &amp;amp; Local Government (DHPLG) and the Dairy Industry of a resource of 30 Agricultural Sustainability Advisors. These Advisors will receive comprehensive training provided by Teagasc and the EPA to ensure a consistent and uniform approach. The Government funded Advisors will be managed by Teagasc&rsquo;s environmental section; oversight will be provided by both my Department and DHPLG.</p>  <p>  This four year programme supports the goals of the Food Wise 2025 strategy, facilitating increased productivity hand-in-hand with a more sustainable sector. The sustainability and efficiency gains will be achieved through improved nutrient management with more targeted use of fertiliser, better farmyard management practice, and the development of new approaches to reducing nutrient losses in critical source areas. </p>  <p>  The programme has the potential to strengthen delivery of Ireland&rsquo;s obligations under the Water Framework Directive. It is part of a new approach to River Basin Management Planning for the 2018 &ndash; 2021 cycle. This new approach includes the development of a much-strengthened evidence base to understand the full range of pressures affecting water quality and the development of the programmes of measures needed to deliver improvements. </p>  <p>  Under the programme, the new team will promote on-farm sustainability best practice to farmers in 190 priority catchments identified by the EPA in consultation with other Government agencies and Departments. Furthermore the Dairy Co-ops will support sustainability best practice through their structures, promoting best farmyard and nutrient management practice across all their suppliers.</p></reply>

Food Wise 2025 identifies competiveness as a key theme and includes a recommendation that stakeholders work to &ldquo;improve access to finance for agriculture, forestry and seafood producers and agri-food companies&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  Therefore I welcome last week&rsquo;s announcement by the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the EU Commission to mobilise up to &euro;1 billion in investment for the agriculture and bio-economy sectors. It is my understanding that farmers will not apply directly for this funding but that EIB is encouraging private cooperatives and companies in the agriculture sector to apply for direct lending for private sector investments (from &euro;15m to &euro;200m) with a loan amount ranging from &euro;7.5m to &euro;50m. The announcement states that &ldquo;The EIB is already active with Multi Beneficiary Intermediated Loans to support the implementation of smaller projects by farmers and small and medium-sized enterprises active in bio-economy value chains through commercial banks across Europe&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  In January 2017, I launched the Agriculture Cashflow Support Loan Scheme.  The guarantee for the Scheme is supported by SBCI and the EIB Group through COSME (the EU programme for the Competitiveness of Enterprises and SMEs). This type of innovative risk sharing product is new to Ireland but common across Europe.</p>  <p>  I recently launched with colleagues the &euro;300 million Brexit Loan Scheme, which used the Agriculture Cashflow Support Loan Scheme as a model, and is designed to provide funding support to enable eligible Irish businesses to implement necessary changes to address the challenges posed by Brexit. This is being delivered by the SBCI and supported by the EIB Group through the InnovFin SME Guarantee Facility.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to engage with the EIB in relation to funding options for the agri-food sector, including participation in the Department of Finance led &ldquo;EIB-Ireland Financing Group&rdquo; and through bilateral discussions.</p></reply>

The term &lsquo;Origin&rsquo; can also be used where the country/member state of birth is the same as the country of rearing and slaughter. A Statutory Instrument providing for this came into force on 1 April 2015.

However, my Department plays a  role in the enforcement of this legislation under service contract to the Food Safety Authority of Ireland and has worked with the Department of Health in ensuring the necessary Statutory Instrument is in place to cover the labelling of loose pigmeat, poultry meat and sheepmeat inline with the origin labelling rules for packaged meat brought in on April 1st 2015. </p>  <p>  We will continue to work with all stakeholders to ensure that traceability is clearly articulated to the consumer which will help us to capitalise on Ireland's reputation in international markets as a producer of high quality food.</p></reply>

The Act puts clear obligations on owners regarding the need to look after animals under their care. My Department employs a large team of veterinary inspectors to enforce the provisions of the Act and in a novel development under the Act, authorised officer status has been given to a small number of employees of the ISPCA, DSPCA and the Turf Club to carry out duties limited to welfare. All incidents of mistreatment of animals should be brought to my Department's attention and there is a dedicated helpline in place for the reporting of such incidents Call Save: 0761 064408. Email address - <i>animalwelfare@agriculture.gov.ie</i>. and all reports are processed in the strictest of confidence. </p><p>There are good possibilities for the re-homing of unwanted horses both at home and abroad and the animal charity sector provide a critically important role in this respect.  In recognition of their work, I provided funding of &euro;2.56m to 111 animal welfare organisations to assist their work in the course of 2018. Separately, my Department also provides funding for the development of education and training programmes for horse owners including new structures to provide shelter for the urban and traveller horse population with the aim of reducing the number of straying animals and encouraging young people in the care and welfare of horses. </p></reply>

This record allocation together with the fund raising efforts of the animal welfare charities will greatly assist their work in course of 2018. </p>  <p>  My Department also underpins animal welfare by ensuring and operating a robust legislative base for animal welfare in particular the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013.The penalties under the Act are as high as can be permitted under our legal system.  Enforcement has been enhanced by a provision in the Act that allows some investigative powers to be granted to persons outside my Department including the ISPCA and DSPCA. This arrangement is working well and has led to a significant number of successful prosecutions. </p>  <p>  Other measures undertaken by my Department to support animal welfare include the continued operations of the Farm Animal Welfare Advisory Council, a multi-stakeholder group that meets on a regional basis and includes representatives of farmers, An Garda S&iacute;ochana, the Department of Agriculture and welfare groups. This has been very successful in its regional forum in acting as an early warning system. Where natural and weather events have led to problems in certain locations my department has acted quickly and effectively to bring emergency supplies to particular premises where feed has been an issue.</p>  <p>  I should add that my Department operates a confidential animal welfare helpline through which members of the public can report incidents of animal cruelty and neglect for investigation: Call Save 0761 064408 01 6072379 All calls received are followed up as appropriate.</p></reply>

There are excellent opportunities both within Europe and outside Europe.  Market development is a key theme underpinning our Food Wise 2025 strategy. I am firmly committed to increasing market access and opportunities for Irish meat exports around the world.</p><p>While my Department is concerned about any possible negative impacts of Brexit, especially in relation to beef, a very wide range of work is on-going both in relation to opening new Third Country markets and to maintaining and broadening access to existing Third Country markets. I am also firmly committed to maintaining the UK as a destination for our exports. </p><p>At my Department&rsquo;s  request, Bord Bia has undertaken a major data based market profiling exercise for potential third-country markets for Irish exports, including meat. The initial results were launched at the Food Wise conference last December and this will help inform the Department&rsquo;s market access work. </p><p>An intensified programme of trade missions  to promote Irish food and drink on EU and third country markets is underway, and meat market access has been a major feature of these missions. Since last year, trade missions have taken  place to USA and Mexico (June 2017), Japan and South Korea (November  2017), USA and Canada (February 2018) and Turkey (March 2018). </p><p>During my  St Patrick&rsquo;s Day visit to London, I undertook a series of important meetings with the UK retail sector. The UK is a natural and valuable market for our quality assured meat exports and I will make every effort to ensure that our hard-won market share in the UK is maintained and strengthened.</p><p>The next mission to China and Hong Kong will take place in mid 2018.  The recent opening of the Chinese beef market to Irish beef is very significant for the Irish beef industry, all along the chain from farmers through to processors and exporters.</p><p>I am very pleased to note that the percentage of Irish meat exports destined for non EU Third- country markets has increased in recent years. For example between 2015 and 2017: </p><p>- Beef has increased from 5% to 8% in value terms and from 10% to 14% in volume terms</p><p>- Sheepmeat has increased from 7% to 11% in value terms and from 9% to 12% in volume terms, and,</p><p>- Pigmeat has increased from 24% to 25% in value terms and from 36% to 37% in volume terms. </p><p>This is a testament both to the success of my Department in its market access efforts in opening up new markets and also to the industry in availing of these new market access opportunities.  </p></reply>

In 1996 there were approximately 500 deer farms with 20,000 deer in Ireland, but numbers have declined sharply since that time. </p>  <p>  Today there are only a small number of farmers in Ireland actively supplying deer for meat production, which cater primarily to specialised niche markets. The sector is reliant upon producers and companies ensuring that a market exists for their product, an objective which Bord Bia assists in by identifying and developing potential market outlets.</p>  <p>  There was some recent growth in game (venison) market during 2016 for example with around 764 deer slaughtered for this market, but, this declined to 271 deer for 2017, with no deer slaughtered so far in 2018.</p>  <p>  Growth in the past was achieved as a result of improved distribution for game meats, especially in supermarkets. Game and exotic meats historically occupy a premium, niche segment of the meat market. Whilst there are opportunities to compete with the larger premium segment of the red meat/poultry categories, it is important to note that demand is seasonal, with the greatest concentration of retail shelf space dedicated to game in the Winter/Christmas period. </p>  <p>  My Department has approved one factory for the slaughter of deer in Ireland, and two game handling plants. There may also be outlets for processing of venison in Local Authority approved plants, but this would be a matter for the Local Authority concerned.</p></reply>

Primary responsibility for compliance with these regulatory requirements rests in the first instance with the food business operators. There are currently two such equine slaughtering plants in operation in Ireland and slaughter activities at both plants are supervised by my Department. </p>  <p>  The slaughter process and the handling of animals going to slaughter takes place under strictly supervised conditions. My Department has a permanent presence in each of the slaughter plants under its supervision and Department staff, with the assistance of temporary veterinary inspectors engaged on a contract basis, carry out regular checks as part of official regulatory controls. In addition, each slaughter establishment has a qualified animal welfare officer who oversees the welfare of the animals at the time of slaughter. </p>  <p>  Regulation (EC) No. 178 of 2002, which sets out the general principles and requirements of EU food law, stipulates among other things, that food business operators at all stages of production, processing and distribution within the businesses under their control must ensure that foods satisfy the requirements of food law and that these requirements are met. In regard to traceability the regulations require that the operator must have systems in place to be able to identify any person from whom they have been supplied with a food.  They must also have a system in place to identify the businesses to which their product has been supplied.   </p>  <p>  For their import from non-EU countries, food products of animal origin such as horsemeat are required to meet the relevant requirements of EU food law that are operated in third countries or regions of third countries or conditions recognised by the EU to be at least equivalent. </p>  <p>  The Regulations relating to the import of meat from third countries are set at EU level. The basic requirements for imports of meat are set out in Regulation (EC) No 853/2004. The third country of dispatch must be on an approved list for that product and the individual establishment from which the product is dispatched must also be on an approved list. These lists are published on the EU Commission&rsquo;s website. There is also a requirement that imports of meat are only allowed from countries with an approved residue monitoring plan.</p>  <p>  The EU&rsquo;s Food and Veterinary Office (FVO) carries out an assessment of third countries wishing to export these products to the EU and submits for Commission approval those where the responsible authorities can provide appropriate guarantees as regards compliance or equivalence with Community feed and food law and animal health rules. Third countries and their establishments that are approved to export are audited and inspected by the FVO with regard to these guarantees and reports of the findings of inspections are published on its website.  </p>  <p>  All products of animal origin for human consumption imported into the EU from third countries must be inspected at an approved Border Inspection Post (BIP). The range of checks to which products may be subjected include documentary, identity (traceability) and physical examinations to ensure that they comply with relevant EU and national legislation. Imports must be accompanied by health certification provided by the competent authorities of the country of origin. Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2016/1832 of 17 October 2016, relating to changes in health certification requirements came into effect from 31 March 2017, tightens up the conditions applying specifically to the import of horsemeat. It imposes inter alia a minimum six-month residency requirement for the import into the EU of meat from horses from third countries. The non-EU country must also meet specified criteria with regard to the monitoring of administered substances and residues.The FVO also approves third-country meat processing establishments wishing to export to the EU and audits Member States&rsquo; import controls for products from third countries.</p>  <p>  When all import controls have been satisfied, compliant consignments may then be imported and placed on the single market,where they are subject to the EU&rsquo;s Food Hygiene Regulations in the same way as other compliant food products.</p></reply>

The tillage sector in Ireland is a key source of seed production, grain for the milling and malting industry and feedingstuffs for the livestock sector and as a consequence is a significant stakeholder in our agri-food industry from a supply/food safety and sustainability viewpoint. Cereal production in Ireland in 2017 was estimated at 2.3 million tonnes at an estimated value to the National Exchequer of &euro;243 million. I am most conscious that the maintenance of an efficient and viable tillage sector in Ireland is of the utmost importance as it reduces our dependence on imported cereals and clearly contributes to the well being of the agri-food industry.</p>  <p>  I would also acknowledge that cereal production has experienced difficult challenges in recent times both in terms of grain price and weather conditions. As a result of a very difficult Spring weather wise, I have requested a derogation from the European Commission in relation to the Crop Diversification (&ldquo;3 crop rule&rdquo;) requirement as part of Greening for 2018. I am confident of a favourable response on the basis that the criteria on which the derogation is being sought is similar to those used by other Member States who have recently been granted similar exemptions due to difficult weather in the Autumn/Winter of 2017. As a consequence of alternative crop options no longer being available to farmers to be compliant with Crop Diversification rules, growers can make crop choices that best suit their current situation, even if this leaves them non-compliant with the Crop Diversification rules.</p>  <p>  Because Ireland only accounts for approximately 1% of EU production, grain prices here are very much affected by European and world market price shifts and tend to experience volatility. The current situation globally for the cereal sector is that it has experienced another year of high grain supplies which have again outstripped demand. This oversupply continues to exert a downward pressure on the market and this of course has had a negative effect on price to the grower. However despite the pressures on the sector the level of output has maintained at approximately 2.3 million tonnes. </p>  <p>  My Department provides a range of supports to assist this vital sector. In 2017 I introduced the &euro;150m Agriculture Cashflow Support Loan Scheme and extended it to cover the tillage and horticulture sectors. There was a very positive reaction by farmers, including tillage farmers, to the Scheme, which has proved that significant demand exists for low cost flexible finance.  The &ldquo;Agriculture Cashflow Loan Scheme&rdquo; has provided a template for access to finance schemes, including the recently announced &ldquo;Brexit Loan Scheme&rdquo; for SMEs.   </p>  <p>  I would stress also that my Department provides a high quality official crop seed certification scheme to the industry, in addition to an extensive national crop variety evaluation programme. </p>  <p>  I am also pleased to be able to say that a favourable response has been received with respect to the EU Protein Aid Scheme which has been secured for 2018 at the same level of funding as before. In 2017, &euro;3m was paid out to Irish farmers under the EU Protein Aid Scheme, primarily for beans. Almost 14,000 hectares was sown by 1,200 growers under the measure and this is a significant increase from the 3,500 hectares that were sown prior to introduction of the scheme thus highlighting its success. On a broader scale the EU is in deficit in relation to plant protein and currently imports 75% of its plant derived protein requirements. In this context, the Commission is committed to preparing a report on plant proteins that will build on existing knowledge and national/regional experiences. It is important to state that I will be supporting measures designed to increase production of protein crops in Europe.  </p>  <p>  As a further support to tillage farmers I introduced the Tillage Capital Investment Scheme under TAMS II which opened for online applications on the 8 March 2017. The specific areas of investment include Minimum Disturbance Tillage Equipment, Sprayers, Rain Water Harvesting, Grain Storage and Grain dryers.  There has been a significant level of interest in investments by the tillage sector, with a total number of 1015 applications received so far and 779 approvals. Over &euro;2.63m has now issued in respect of 239 payment claims. Payments will continue on an ongoing basis and the Scheme is currently open to applicants.</p>  <p>  Last year in response to the exceptionally challenging harvest conditions of September 2016 I introduced a Weather Related Crop Loss Support measure to assist farmers who experienced significant yield losses in spring cereal crops. This measure provides for a financial contribution towards the cost of uninsured spring cereals crop losses. Particularly hard hit growers who experienced even greater cereal crop losses benefited from an additional &euro;100 per hectare, on the same area. </p>  <p>  The agri-food sector is also exploring the development of niche and specialist markets for cereal products which have the potential to improve competitiveness and sustainability. The demand for Irish malting barley is growing in line with the sustained growth in demand for Irish whiskey. The opportunity offered by maximizing the amount of Irish grain must be developed to the benefit of all involved and I fully support the initiatives that help to attain that aim. </p>  <p>  In conclusion I would also encourage tillage growers to fully implement the advice and research provided by Teagasc in relation to efficient and sustainable production of crops. My Department remains committed to assisting all involved in the sector to optimise efficiency and sustainability. </p></reply>

In 2017 the Tillage Sector in Ireland was estimated to have contributed &euro;243 million to the Exchequer and is a vital source of raw material to many sectors including the livestock sector for feedingstuffs but also to the rapidly expanding drinks industry for malting and distilling.</p>  <p>  While growing malting barley for the drinks industry is not the answer to all of the challenges facing the tillage sector the development of niche and specialist markets have potential to improve our competitiveness and sustainability credentials. The demand for Irish malting barley is growing in line with the sustained growth in demand for Irish whiskey. Recent estimates suggest 180,000 tonnes or 12% of Irish barley production goes for malting with an additional 60,000 tonnes or 4% of the barley crop going as unmalted barley for use in brewing and distilling sector. The marketing opportunity offered by maximizing the amount of Irish grain in what are essentially Irish brands must be developed to the benefit of all involved and I fully support the initiatives that help to attain that aim. Within the malting sector, another specialist niche currently being promoted by my Department is the use of heritage Irish bred barley varieties in the development of new beers as a unique selling point for individual companies in the ever expanding craft brewery and distillery industries.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-04-26a.484.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018042600061#WRJ05000"><p>In response to the problems experienced in parts of the West and North-West in the late autumn and winter I took a number of steps to address issues around the availability of fodder. I asked Teagasc from an early stage to work locally with affected farmers in areas with fodder difficulties and support them on fodder budgeting for the winter ahead. I prioritised the payment of farm supports to assist farmers with cash flow. In this regard my Department has paid out over &euro;1.6bn to Irish farmers under Pillar I and Pillar II and will continue to make residual payments.</p>  <p>  As a further early intervention, and to ensure a co-ordinated approach to the issue of fodder availability in affected areas, I convened a fodder group chaired by Teagasc, and comprising of all the main stakeholders including feed merchants and co-ops, banking, farm bodies etc. </p>  <p>  I introduced a targeted &lsquo;Fodder Transport Support measure&rsquo; on 29 January 2018 to provide additional assistance to those livestock farmers in parts of the West and North West severely affected by on-going fodder shortages. The main purpose of the measure was to support the cost of transporting fodder between those areas where it was plentiful and those where it was scarce. It is operated primarily through the Co-operative structure.</p>  <p>  The continuation of cold wet weather throughout March resulted in a serious delay to the onset of spring. Grass growth remained negligible, ground stayed wet and livestock had to remain housed in many cases. This resulted in the fodder problem extending countrywide with a consequent tightening of fodder availability nationally.</p>  <p>  In response I extended the fodder transport measure to all counties and also introduced a Fodder Import Support Measure, to ensure that there was adequate fodder available to feed the national herd. This measure was introduced on 5 April to reduce the cost to farmers of imported forage (hay, silage, haylage etc.) from outside the island of Ireland. Northern Ireland is excluded. The measure is operated through Co-operatives and other importers approved by the Department. It covers fodder imported up to 30th April 2018. Support under the measure will substantially reduce the cost to farmers of imported fodder by approximately one third. This initial allocation will support the importation of up to 20,000 tons of fodder into the country and this will be kept under on-going review. Together these two measures address remaining issues around fodder availability. </p>  <p>  In other supports, planning continues with a view to commencement of balancing payments under certain Pillar II schemes including the Sheep Welfare Scheme followed by the GLAS scheme in the near future. </p>  <p>  The GLAS Traditional Hay Meadow grazing date has been extended to 1 May 2018, and this makes available an additional 27,000 ha of grazing for livestock which would not otherwise be available.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, I have recently met with the CEO's of the main banks to discuss any cash flow issues arising from the recent bad weather and access to finance for the sector generally. During these meetings I continued to stress that in the context of the current situation the banks should be flexible and put measures in place to support their customers.</p>  <p>  My officials are monitoring the fodder situation on a daily basis and engaging with all stakeholders in addressing the remaining challenges around fodder supply this spring. Recent improvement in grass growth is rapidly improving the situation at farm level. The next step will be to prevent this situation arising again, through supporting farmers to effectively plan and manage their grass and fodder supplies for the coming winters.</p></reply>

These include supports for artisan food businesses, a pipeline for new entrants to the Artisan Food Market at Bloom, promoting meet the buyer opportunities, delivery of small business specific consumer and market insights, and programmes to assist producers to extend business reach and festival markets.</p>  <p>  Supports for the artisan food sector are available from the development agencies. Many artisan businesses have participated in the Food Academy programme developed by Bord Bia, Local Enterprise Offices and Musgraves/Supervalu; the Food Works programme (developed by Bord Bia, Teagasc and Enterprise Ireland for start-up food entrepreneurs) and from technical assistance from Teagasc. </p>  <p>  In terms of small food businesses in general, close to 500 food companies with a turnover of &euro;100,000 to &euro;3.5m are registered with Bord Bia for supports and services. These owner managed businesses produce high-end products with a strong focus on the domestic market.</p>  <p>  The farmhouse cheese sector alone includes over 50 cheese-makers producing more than 150 types of cheese valued at over &euro;12 million per annum at farm gate level. The sector is innovative with over 17 new farmhouse cheeses developed in the past year. My Department has supported a three year Bord Bia farmhouse cheese programme under the EU Promotion regime. </p>  <p>  Farmers markets remain a valuable entry point for many potential food entrepreneurs and those building a local and visitor customer base. In the past year Bord Bia ran workshops for market managers to support the development of this important local route to market. Feedback was highly positive. </p>  <p>  My Department provides bursaries for the UCC Diploma in Speciality Food Production, a food science and business course for food producers, potential start-ups and those interested in developing businesses and /or promoting the artisan sector. Bord Bia, Teagasc and the FSAI contribute to the work of the Diploma. Over 180 students have graduated; many are successfully running small artisan and speciality food businesses. </p>  <p>  Growth prospects for the sector are positive overall, driven by increased consumer interest in the provenance of food, environmental concerns, health and a desire to support the local economy. </p>  <p>  There is also provision in the Rural Development Programme (RDP), for funding to support new and existing artisan, micro and small food producers to address emerging challenges through investment in areas such as market development, competitiveness and innovation. This funding  will be delivered using the LEADER methodology. I hope to announce further details of this in the near future with my colleague Minister Ring.</p></reply>

This followed an increase of 3.6% in 2016. The value of goods output for the sector increased by 13.6% to &euro;8,016 million. </p>  <p>  There are almost 140,000 farms in Ireland (CSO 2013), but around 50,000 of these are very small farms with off-farm sales (standard output) of less than &euro;8,000 per annum.</p>  <p>  The Teagasc National Farm Survey (NFS) provides an overview of the economic situation on Irish farms on an annual basis. The principal metric used is family farm income, which represents the return from farming for the farm family to their labour, land and capital. </p>  <p>  In 2016 Teagasc published the National Farm Survey Farm Viability Report which takes account of income earned outside the farm business and represents over 84,000 farms, whose standard output exceeds &euro;8,000 per annum. The survey found that:</p>  <p>  - 36% of farms were classified as economically viable. A farm business is deemed to be viable if the farm income can remunerate family labour at the minimum agricultural wage and provide a 5% return on the capital invested in non-land assets. </p>  <p>  - 35% of farms were classified as sustainable. A farm household is considered sustainable where the farmer or spouse has an off-farm income.</p>  <p>  - 29% of farms were considered to be economically vulnerable. A farm is considered vulnerable if the farm business is not viable and if neither the farmer nor spouse work of the farm.</p>  <p>  Teagasc's National Farm Survey for 2016 showed that average family farm income was &euro;23,848, which is made up of an average of &euro;46,561 for full-time farmers and &euro;11,086 for part-time farmers.  It should also be noted that there are significant differences in family farm income depending on the system of farming and the size of the farm. Teagasc's detailed National Farm Survey for 2017 will be published next month. Teagasc estimated last December that average farm income for 2017 could reach almost &euro;32,000, which would represent an average increase of 30% over 2016.</p>  <p>  The Food Wise 2025 strategy includes actions to support farmers in improving the competitiveness and profitability of their enterprises.  This includes actions aimed at helping farmers to manage the impact of price volatility; improving productivity; and adapting new technology; and incentivising land mobility and farm restructuring.  These supports will make Irish farm enterprises more competitive and sustainable, and maximise their contribution to regional and local rural economies.</p></reply>

In 2017, Irish seafood exports were valued at &euro;614 million, an increase of 9% from 2016. In fact, according to Bord Bia, Ireland&rsquo;s seafood exports have increased in value by 89% since 2009. Neighbouring countries, such as France, Spain, the UK, Italy and Germany, account for approximately 61% of our seafood exports. Irish seafood producers have also established successful business relationships right around the globe. In Asia for instance, China, Hong Kong, South Korea and Japan now account for 11% of our exports.</p>  <p>  The Government has committed to the development of the inshore fishing sector in the current Programme for a Partnership Government. The programme identifies a number of methods for supporting the sector, such as ensuring smaller inshore boats are given new opportunities for commercial fishing. Support is being provided under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund Operational Programme (EMFF OP) for enhanced management and conservation of inshore stocks, including v-notching of lobster, more selective fishing gear and preparation and implementation of management plans for a sustainable inshore fishery. Funding of some &euro;6 million has been earmarked under the programme for the Inshore Fisheries Conservation Scheme. The inshore sector has access to other schemes under the Programme as well.  </p>  <p>  I meet regularly with the National Inshore Fisheries Forum (NIFF). The NIFF and its supporting network of six Regional Inshore Fisheries Forums (RIFFs) cover the entire coast. The Inshore Forums provide a platform for the discussion of problems facing the inshore sea-fisheries sector and have been making recommendation to me on issues of concern for their sector.</p>  <p>  The NIFF is taking the lead in setting priorities for the inshore sector, including developing for the first time a dedicated strategy. From my meetings with the NIFF, I have introduced a number of industry-led initiatives, developed through the forum structures, following extensive consultation.  These include conservation measures for inshore stocks such as velvet crab and ongoing work on proposed measures in respect of brown crab and razor clam. These conservation measures are aimed at supporting the long-term sustainability of these stocks and thereby the sector.</p>  <p>  The issue of limiting access to different categories of vessels in inshore waters and within 6 nautical miles has been raised by a number of stakeholders. My Department is currently in the final stages of preparing a formal paper including possible options. I hope to be in a position to present this paper for a full public consultation in the coming days. </p>  <p>  The potential impact of limiting access to different categories of vessels in inshore waters and within 6 nautical miles has been the subject of scientific and economic reports by the Marine Institute and Bord Iascaigh Mhara. There has also been preliminary engagement with fisheries representative groups in respect of these reports. The forthcoming consultation paper will set out possible measures and their potential impacts.</p>  <p>  The consultation will be advertised in the National press to ensure the widest possible audience. Once the public consultation begins, adequate time will be provided to ensure that the diverse interests of all stakeholders are considered and any possible measures will be fair and balanced, having regard to the importance of the industry to fishing-dependent families. </p></reply>

IFI manages salmon stocks on an individual river basis as each of Ireland&rsquo;s 147 salmon rivers (including river sections and estuaries) has its own genetically unique stock of salmon. </p><p>IFI is supported in its management role by the independent Standing Scientific Committee (SSC), comprising scientists from a range of organisations.  Scientific and management assessments of each of the distinct stocks are carried out every year with IFI engaged in extensive stock monitoring which feeds into the SSC's annual reviews. The SSC uses catch returns to individual rivers (rod catch, catch and release and any commercial catch) over the previous five years to estimate the total salmon returns in each of the previous five years.  The use of a five year average ensures that a good or bad year does not have a disproportionate impact on the stock assessment in any single year.</p><p>Each river has an individual conservation limit which is the number of adult salmon required to maintain a healthy population.  Rivers which sufficiently exceed their conservation limit may be opened for harvest fisheries (recreational and/or commercial). Rivers which meet 50% of their conservation limit may be opened for catch and release (C&amp;amp;R) angling which permits enjoyment of angling while having a negligible impact of vulnerable fish stocks and encouraging the shared responsibility to contribute to conservation and the potential rebuilding of these stocks.  For 2018, 78 rivers in Ireland were open to harvest or catch and release fishing. </p><p>The decline in wild Atlantic Salmon is an international issue manifesting in rivers in all countries around the North Atlantic with scientific analysis from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) estimating that marine survival of migrating salmon has been at or below 5% in the North Atlantic for more than a decade. </p><p>Marine survival is considered to have the biggest influence on return, from far North Atlantic feeding grounds, of salmon to all rivers on Atlantic coasts.  Climate change in the ocean is considered to be a major factor.  There is also evidence that heavy sea-lice infestation from salmon farming has resulted in additional mortality in respect of migratory North Atlantic salmon generally.  In freshwater, water quality and a range of pressures such as afforestation, drainage, effluent discharge, siltation and agricultural enrichment can all have an impact on juvenile salmon production.</p><p>The protection and conservation of salmon internationally is managed through the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organisation (NASCO) with which Ireland is aligned through the European Union. Concerted international co-operation has ensured that restrictions in feeding ground in Greenland and Faroese waters have been in place for a number of years via NASCO agreement. In June this year, my officials and those of IFI will join delegates from the EU, USA, Canada, Norway, the Russian Federation, Greenland and the Faroes in seeking to negotiate a continuation of restrictions in these waters. </p><p>Specifically in relation to Greenlandic waters, the majority component of the stock complex migrating to these waters originates from the North American Continent.  There is no commercial harvest in Faroese waters where the migratory stock complex comprises a majority component of European river stocks including those from Ireland.</p><p>The Atlantic salmon is a protected species under the EU Habitats Directive with which Ireland&rsquo;s current salmon management regime complies. In order to align fully with the Directive and the NASCO principles, Ireland closed mixed stock fisheries at sea since 2007. It is considered that river stocks in Ireland would be in a far more perilous state if the closure of mixed stock fisheries had not been implemented.  </p><p>A summary of Irish salmon catches from 2012 to 2016 is in the following table. The figures for 2017 are currently being compiled and verified for publication by IFI. <table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Angling harvest (tonnes)</th><th>Angling catch and release(no&rsquo;s of fish)</th><th>Commercial harvest (tonnes)</th><th>Total harvest (tonnes)</th></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>60</td><td>11,891</td><td>28</td><td>88</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>49</td><td>10,682</td><td>38</td><td>87</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>31</td><td>6,537</td><td>26</td><td>57</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>42</td><td>9,383</td><td>21</td><td>63</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>39</td><td>10,280</td><td>19</td><td>58</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Exchequer funding of &euro;160 million was approved for Phase 1. </p>  <p>  The plan for Phase 2 involved the extension of the Dunboyne Line between Clonsilla and M3 Parkway Station, onwards to north Navan. This development together with a number of other transport projects was postponed in 2011 due to the economic and fiscal crisis.</p>  <p>  The National Transport Authority (NTA), which has statutory responsibility for development of Public Transport in the Greater Dublin Area (GDA), included an examination of the Navan to City Centre Rail Corridor in the preparation of its Transport Strategy for the GDA for the period 2016-2035.  At that time the NTA concluded that, based on population and employment forecasts, the level of travel demand between Navan, Dunshaughlin and various stations to the city centre was insufficient to justify the development of a high-capacity rail link.  Instead it proposed that an enhanced bus service would be provided along the corridor in conjunction with the development of a bus hub by the local authority in Navan.  </p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s recently published National Development Plan confirms a number of key investment priorities including not only protecting investments already made but also considerable investment in public transport modes including Bus, Rail, Luas, Metro, Cycling and Walking, next generation ticketing systems, customer information systems, transition to low emission fleets all to deliver a much expanded comprehensive public transport network that would match travel demand, alleviate congestion and deliver a range of benefits over the next decade. </p>  <p>  The NDP also recognises that over the period of the plan it will be very important to examine the role the interurban rail network can play in enhancing regional connectivity. In this regard the NDP notes that the NTA is required to review its Greater Dublin Area Transport Strategy before the end of 2021. This review will include a reappraisal of the extension of the Dunboyne/M3 Parkway line to Dunshauglin and Navan taking into account the scale of new and planned development along the route and will allow for its consideration during the NDP Mid Term Review.</p>  <p>  Also looking ahead, the European Commission, in reviewing the implementation of the TEN-T core network by end 2023 and in consultation with Member States, will evaluate whether the core network should be modified to take into account developments in transport flows and national investment planning.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-04-26a.531.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018042600062#WRK04300"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 209 to 211, inclusive, together.</p>  <p>  As outlined in previous responses to Parliamentary Questions, under the Programme for Partnership Government, the Government committed to applying to the European Union for the revision of the TEN-T Core Network, including in relation to the Western Arc. A submission is being prepared for the European Commission for a revision of the TEN-T Core Network, which would seek to facilitate consideration of transport-related project proposals for funding under the Connecting Europe Facility for transport. The submission will also take into account the implications of Brexit on western and north-west regions.</p>  <p>  My officials also separately met with the Directorate-General for Mobility and Transport (DG MOVE) in November of last year and briefed DG Move on the Government&rsquo;s commitment and on the pending submission. DG Move advised that the submission would be considered on receipt but indicated that it may not meet the criteria required for the Core Network. </p>  <p>  The EU TEN-T Regulations when adopted in 2013 identified by way of maps the routes included in Europe&rsquo;s comprehensive and core transport networks. Once identified, there is a requirement on Ireland to meet the technical specifications set out in the Regulations for those routes. Ireland&rsquo;s core transport network, which is a subset of our comprehensive network, is required to be completed by 2030, while the comprehensive network is required to be completed by 2050. A key objective of the regulation is to promote interoperability of transport networks across Europe. In the context of Ireland&rsquo;s then Exchequer position, it was simply not prudent to enter into commitments beyond what we could reasonably expect to deliver, particularly where there were risks of infringements and potential financial penalties for non-compliance.   </p>  <p>  Applications for the funding of proposed projects located on those routes can then be made in response to an EU-wide competitive process (&lsquo;Calls&rsquo;). These Calls have been, and continue to be, considerably over-subscribed. In submitting subsequent applications for funding, applicants must, inter alia, demonstrate the economic viability of the project by way of a cost benefit analysis and also demonstrate that funding is in place to implement the project. The majority of the costs of any capital project being funded by the Exchequer would therefore still be borne by the Exchequer, with just the potential, if applications were successful, of a minority of grant funding coming from EU sources for projects located on our TEN-T network. </p>  <p>  As I have outlined previously, the EU&rsquo;s planning methodology highlights the criteria that was used for the identification of the comprehensive network and also those parts of the comprehensive network that are identified as the core network. </p>  <p>  When the EU&rsquo;s draft regulation was being negotiated in 2011, Ireland was required to consider the specific cost implications of the proposed network for our transport infrastructure, as well as our financial capacity to complete the technical specifications of our portion of the network within the timeframes proposed. </p>  <p>  It was in this context that Ireland, as with other Member States, liaised with the European Commission regarding its views on the appropriateness of the draft Network in line with the proposed methodology and with the affordability of completion of the network at that time. This resulted in sections of the proposed network not ultimately being included in the final TEN-T maps agreed in 2013.</p>  <p>  Despite the economic challenges the country has faced, a priority has been placed on access to and within the North-West. The most notable demonstration of this is the Gort-Tuam motorway, which is the largest transport investment completed anywhere in the country since 2011.</p>  <p>  That priority is maintained in the National Development Plan, Project Ireland 2040. Project Ireland 2040 places a strong emphasis on further improving connectivity, including the development of the strategic Cork to Limerick road link and a range of potential transport projects, including key transport projects in the West and Northwest regions.</p>  <p>  There will be a review of the implementation of the core network by end 2023. The Commission will consult with Member States and will evaluate progress made in the implementation of the TEN-T Regulation, as well as the impact of evolving traffic patterns and relevant developments in infrastructure investment plans. The Regulation further sets out that the Commission, in consultation with EU Member States, will evaluate whether the core network should be modified to take into account developments in transport flows and national investment planning.</p></reply>

This weekly entitlement is greater than the highest rate of entitlement payable on state pension (non - contributory) and therefore the most financially beneficial to the person concerned. </p>  <p>  The person concerned is also in receipt of a means tested increase for qualified adult payment, payable at maximum rate, in respect of their spouse who is aged over 66.  My Department is currently reviewing the person&rsquo;s continuing entitlement to this means tested increase.  A questionnaire regarding the means of the person&rsquo;s spouse was issued on 5 March 2018.  No response was received, despite a reminder being issued on 4 April 2018.  On return of the completed questionnaire, the entitlement of the person concerned to a continuing increase for qualified adult will be reviewed and they will be notified in writing of the outcome without delay.  Failure to return the requested information will result in loss of payment, so it is important that the person concerned now gives this matter their urgent attention.   </p>  <p>  If the qualified adult has had insurable employment in Ireland, they can, at any point, submit an application for state pension (contributory) and have their entitlement to contributory pension examined. Equally if they do not have a social insurance contribution record or have insufficient contributions, they are entitled, at any point, to make a claim for a means tested state pension (non-contributory) and their entitlement will be examined. If they apply for either or both pension options, they will receive the pension option which is to their financial advantage. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

These include the Jobseeker&rsquo;s Transitional Payment (JST) payment where the youngest child is aged 7-13 years and the Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance (JA) payment which may be paid to lone parents where the youngest child is aged 14 or over.  The Family Income Supplement, recently re-designated as a Working Family Payment (WFP), is also available to lone parents who are working 19 or more hours per week.  Lone parents who move to WFP can also apply for the Back to Work Family Dividend (BTWFD).</p>  <p>  In Budget 2018, I continued to improve the situation for lone parents through an increase to the income disregard on the OFP and the JST payments from &euro;110 a week to &euro;130 a week; an increase of &euro;5 to the primary rate; and a &euro;2 increase in the Increase for a Qualified Child (IQC) rate.  These positive measures will see a lone parent on OFP or JST, who is working 15 hours a week on the National Minimum Wage, better off by nearly &euro;1,000 per year. These Budget measures took effect from 29 March 2018.  </p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s social impact assessments of Budgets 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 show a cumulative increase of &euro;36.75 in the average weekly household income of employed lone parents.

The payment continues to be paid in respect of children up to their 18th birthday who are in full-time education, or who have a disability.  Child Benefit is currently paid to almost 628,000 families in respect of over 1.2 million children, with an estimated expenditure of more than &euro;2 billion in 2018. </p>  <p>  Given the universality of Child Benefit, extending entitlement to parents to include all children in full time education up to 22 years of age in line with the increase for qualified children paid on social welfare payments would not be a targeted approach.  The adoption of such a proposal would have significant cost implications and would have to be considered in an overall budgetary context. </p>  <p>  Families on low incomes can avail of a number of social welfare schemes that support children in full-time education until the age of 22, including: </p>  <p>  - Increase for a Qualified Child (IQCs) with primary social welfare payments; </p>  <p>  - the Working Family Payment (formerly Family Income Supplement) for low-paid employees with children; </p>  <p>  - the Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance for low income families (paid at the full-time second-level education rate). </p>  <p>  As part of the measures under Budget 2018, the qualified child payment which is paid each week to families with children was increased from &euro;29.80 to &euro;31.80 for each child.  This is an increase of 6.7%, and will benefit over 400,000 children.  The Working Family Payment earnings thresholds were also increased by &euro;10 per week for families with up to three children.  This will particularly benefit low-income working families.  These schemes provide targeted assistance that is directly linked to household income and thereby support low-income families with older children participating in full-time education. </p>  <p>  For parents who have children in third level education, the student grant scheme, SUSI, is the main financial support for students.

In particular it will benefit people whose work history includes an extended period of time outside the paid workplace, while raising families or in a full-time caring role.  Crucially, unlike the proposed Homemaking Credits which was proposed in 2010 as part of the National Pensions Framework, the HomeCaring Credit will apply to periods both before and after 1994, as for most people reaching pension age between 2012 and 2019, such periods, where they had them, occurred before 1994, and provisions restricted to periods after then are of little or no benefit to them.</p>  <p>  This approach will make it easier for many post-2012 pensioners affected by the 2012 rate band changes who are currently assessed under the yearly average model, to qualify for a higher rate of the State Pension (contributory).  A person who reached pension age after 1st September 2012 and has a 40 year record of paid and credited social insurance contributions, subject to a maximum of 20 years of the new HomeCaring credits, will qualify for a maximum contributory pension where they satisfy the other qualifying conditions for the scheme.  Up to 10 years of other credits, for example, awarded when on Jobseekers or Illness Benefit, may also be used, subject to the total credits not exceeding 20 years.</p>  <p>  So, for example, a person might receive a maximum pension based on 20 years paid PRSI contributions, 5 years jobseeker credits, and 15 years HomeCaring Credits (before or after 1994), over a 50 year period and qualify for a maximum rate pension, despite additional gaps of up to 10 years.  Those with fewer contributions will have a pro-rata entitlement.  For example, someone with 18 years PRSI contributions and 18 years homecaring may qualify for a 90% contributory pension.</p>  <p>  Legislation has to be drafted and enacted to enable implementation of these interim arrangements and IT solutions must be developed.  Accordingly, it is planned that the reviews will commence in Q4 of this year, with the first payments being made in Q1 2019.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The aim of MSFD is to integrate environmental considerations into all aspects of marine activity to maintain or reach a point of good environmental status (GES) in our seas and oceans and ensure that this status is maintained through sustainable use of our seas. The Directive requires that we assess our marine environment, develop GES targets and indicators, monitor our environment in light of these, and, where necessary, introduce a programme of measures, including spatial protection measures, to address issues affecting GES being achieved. </p>  <p>  Article 13 of the MSFD requires that a coherent and representative network of spatial protection measures including marine protected areas be put in place, where appropriate, in order to achieve or maintain the good environmental status of our national and shared maritime area. </p>  <p>  The Government is committed to the development of primary legislation to provide for the creation of a network of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) in accordance with the requirements of the MSFD.  Consideration is currently being given to the appropriate legislative approach in this regard.</p>  <p>  While our network of MPAs will incorporate  existing Special Protection Areas and Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) under the Birds or Habitats Directives and any MPAs established under Article 11 of the Common Fisheries Programme (CFP) , it may also require new types of protected areas where all or some human activities may be restricted or limited all or some of the time.  MSFD provides the primary context by which the form and location of MPAs should be determined.  The purpose of any area designated should be to ensure that we are able to reach our GES targets under the Directive. However, as MSFD is concerned with sustainable use of our marine environment, social and cultural factors will also be a consideration.  </p>  <p>  It is my intention to establish in the coming months an expert advisory group to advise me in relation to the identification of candidate marine protected areas.</p></reply>

There is no provision for any other type of area to be designated as a Rent Pressure Zone.</p><p>For an area to be designated a Rent Pressure Zone, it must satisfy the following criteria set out in section 24A(4) of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 (as inserted by section 36 of the 2016 Act):</p><p>(i) The annual rate of rent inflation in the area must have been 7% or more in four of the last six quarters; and </p><p>(ii) The average rent for tenancies registered in the area with the RTB in the last quarter must be above the average national rent (the National Standardised Rent in the RTB&rsquo;s Rent Index Report) in the last quarter (&euro;1,054 per month in Q4 2017).</p><p>On 21 March 2018, the RTB published its Rent Index Report in relation to Quarter 4 2017, which includes a summary of the data used as the criteria for designating Rent Pressure Zones in relation to all Local Electoral Areas in the country. This allows all interested parties to see exactly where their area stands in relation to average rent levels and increases and possible designation.  The data from the Rent Index Report relating to Gorey are detailed in the following table. <table><tr><th>Local Electoral Area</th><th>Quarters  &amp;gt; 7%</th><th>Average 2017 Q4 (&euro;)</th></tr><tr><td>Gorey</td><td>4</td><td>&euro;793.39</td></tr></table></p><p>In Gorey, the average monthly rent is below the national standardised rent of &euro;1,054 per month and in 4 of the last 6 quarters rent inflation has been 7% or greater. Therefore, the Local Electoral Area of Gorey does not meet the criteria for designation at this time.</p><p>The Housing Agency continues to monitor the rental market and may recommend further areas for designation. Where, following the procedures set out in the Act, it is found at a future date that additional areas meet the criteria, they will be designated as Rent Pressure Zones.</p></reply>

The construction schemes progressing through the 4-stage approval process are reviewed at each stage by my Department&rsquo;s Social Housing Delivery team, including architectural and quantity surveyor advisors.

Accordingly, a review was undertaken during 2017 of the procedures for such projects, involving both my Department and the County and City Management Association. This review identified an overall target programme of 59 weeks for progressing a typical social housing construction project from initial capital appraisal submission by the local authority (Stage 1), to construction contract award. Once the construction contract is awarded, the time taken to build and tenant the homes varies depending, in particular, on the size of the development, the site conditions and other construction-related factors.</p>  <p>  My Department and local authorities also operate a single-stage approval process for projects up to &euro;2m in value, while rapid build approaches are also increasingly being used which can save time in relation to design, procurement and construction of new social housing.</p></reply>

It included a case study based on the Millfield estate at Newbridge, Co. Kildare.</p><p>This review has been completed and two reports have been received by my Department. These are a 'Framework for Enhancing Fire Safety in dwellings where concerns arise' and a 'Case Study'. Based on the legal advice received, it was not possible to publish the Case Study; however, the Framework was published on 25 August 2017. </p><p>The Framework contains the following:</p><p>- an explanation of the statutory provisions in respect of fire safety, namely the Building Control Acts 1990 to 2014 and the Fire Services Acts 1981 &amp;amp; 2003, and the respective responsibilities of owners, designers, builders, occupants, local authorities;</p><p>- a range of actions that may reduce risk and improve the level of fire safety where deficiencies arise in dwelling houses, apartments and /or the common areas of apartment buildings; and </p><p>- a fire risk assessment methodology for professional advisors to prioritise the remedial actions, if any, that may need to be carried out on a dwelling.</p><p>The Framework is intended to be used as a guide by the owners and occupants of dwellings where fire safety deficiencies have been identified, or are a cause for concern. In addition to owners and occupants, the Framework will also be of assistance to professional advisors both in developing strategies to improve fire safety and in developing strategies to enable the continued occupation in advance of undertaking the necessary works to ensure compliance with the relevant Building Regulations. </p><p>The framework is available on my Department's website at the following link: </p><p>.</p><p>It is important to note that while my Department has overall responsibility for establishing and maintaining an effective regulatory framework for building standards and building control, it has no general statutory role in resolving defects in privately owned buildings, including dwellings, nor does it have a budget for such matters. </p><p>In response to the many building failures that emerged in the last decade, my Department has been advancing a building control reform agenda in order to develop and promote a culture of competence, good practice and compliance with the building regulations in the construction sector. This agenda includes:</p><p>- the introduction of the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014, which require greater accountability in relation to compliance with Building Regulations in the form of statutory certification;</p><p>- working closely with the Local Government Management Agency on the oversight and  governance of the local authority Building Control System to improve its effectiveness; and</p><p>- progressing primary legislation, the Building Control (Construction Industry Register Ireland) Bill 2017.</p></reply>

However, pending development appropriate to its zoning, the land may currently or on an interim basis have an agricultural use. In its application of the levy provisions, it is a matter for a local authority to make an assessment of specific sites in relation to their zoning, in particular in relation to the need for housing in the general urban area and the suitability of the land in question for housing in terms of being serviced by necessary infrastructure.</p>  <p>  My Department has actively engaged with local authorities in relation to the implementation of the vacant site levy by issuing guidance and holding information seminars.  A further information seminar for local authorities is scheduled for 1 May next to discuss the implementation of the levy generally, any specific matters arising and with a view to ensuring consistency of approach in relation to its implementation.  Following this, consideration will be given as to whether further advice or clarification by way of a circular letter is required.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to monitor implementation of the levy to ensure that it is being fully harnessed, in line with its intended purpose of incentivising the development of vacant or under-utilised sites in urban areas and so that the full potential of the measure can be realised.</p></reply>

Over 650 farm plans were approved under this voluntary scheme. Farmers have been incentivised to go above and beyond their statutory requirements in designated lands for particular habitats or species. One of the primary aims of the scheme is to trial bespoke measures for enhanced management of biodiversity at farm level, with a view to informing current and future measures under the Rural Development Programme.</p>  <p>  The NPWS Farm Plan Scheme is entirely exchequer-funded. At its peak, the costs of the scheme were circa &euro;5 million per annum. The scheme was greatly scaled back in 2010 due to severe budgetary constraints arising from the financial crisis.  Some of the measures previously supported in the NPWS farm plan scheme are now provided for under GLAS.</p>  <p>  In delivering schemes, Member States are obliged by regulation to protect against double funding for delivery of the same objective. Farmers in agri-environment schemes administered by Department of Agriculture Food and the Marine (DAFM) are required to include all their lands designated under the Birds or Habitats Directives and farm it in a manner that respects the site requirements.  </p>  <p>  The objective of a GLAS farm plan is determined by site requirements and the current policy is that participation in both GLAS and the NPWS farm plan scheme simultaneously is not allowed.  Where on occasion specific additional requirements are necessary, provision can be made for an additional payment in respect of the additional requirement, on that proviso that double funding does not arise.</p></reply>
