More than 100,000 children benefit from this investment each year.  These programmes include the free pre-school year provided under the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme.  In the region of 68,000 children benefit from the programme at a cost of &euro;2,375 per child per year.  </p>  <p>  The CCS programme provides funding to community child care services to enable them to provide quality child care at reduced rates to disadvantaged and low income working parents.  Parents qualify as disadvantaged or low income on the basis of means-tested entitlements.

This figure includes &euro;175 million provided annually to support the universal free preschool year under the Early Childhood Care and Education  programme.  These programmes are, of course,  in addition to the support provided to all parents in the form of Child Benefit.<br/><br/>The funding provided through the child care support programmes has had a significant impact on child care provision and has enabled many child care providers to continue to deliver child care services at a time of economic difficulty.  The funding has also ensured that employment levels across the sector have been maintained. The retention of the current level of investment in child care is a considerable achievement, given the pressure on the public finances over the last number of years.<br/><br/>I recognise the difficulties being faced by child care providers and I am aware of the concerns of child care professionals in relation to levels of remuneration in the child care sector. <br/><br/>The remuneration for child care workers is a matter for agreement between employers and employees.  Staff remuneration does account for the great proportion of the overall cost of providing child care services and I acknowledge that increased capitation and subvention payments through the child care support programmes would assist child care services in addressing these cost issues.  I have indicated that, if resources become available to my Department, I will consider the scope for increasing the level of these payments. <br/><br/>However, I want to look at the question of appropriate supports for child care in a wider context.  It is crucial that we develop a coherent whole-of-Government approach to investment in child care services.  To ensure that all the benefits of our full range of child care investments are fully realised, investment in child care must be evidence-based and strategically co-ordinated.  I have established an Inter-departmental Group to look at the provision right across the 0 to 6 age group as well as to consider the after-school needs of older school-going children.

To underpin these reforms, it was necessary to amend the Child Care Act 1991 and these legislative changes were enacted through the Child and Family Agency Act, 2013.  </p>  <p>  To provide for the implementation of the changes, it is necessary to carry out a root and branch re-examination of the existing regulations including a restructuring of the regulations and guidance content in line with the latest drafting practices.  This has proved more time consuming than originally envisaged.  Officials in my Department are working closely with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to develop a comprehensive draft of the new regulations, which will include a requirement that early years services have a person trained in paediatric first aid available at all times.</p>  <p>  I am very anxious that all people working directly with children in the early years sector have an appropriate Paediatric First Aid qualification.  However, there is no accredited award in Paediatric First Aid at any level on the National Framework of Qualifications.  There is an accredited award in Occupational First Aid and it is a stipulation that the training can only be provided by organisations or individuals on the Register of Occupational First Aid Training Providers.  This register is maintained on behalf of the Health and Safety Authority by the Occupational First Aid Assessment Agent.</p>  <p>  The delivery of Paediatric First Aid courses could be regulated by developing a Special Purpose Award through Quality and Qualifications Ireland and my Department has already sent such an award proposal to them.  However, the same standards that apply to the delivery of the Occupational First Aid award should also apply to Paediatric First Aid courses.  At the moment, there are a lot of companies delivering 1 day courses in Paediatric First Aid and offering their own certificate of accreditation.  I would like to see an external quality assurance process in place to ensure that these companies have the skills and competences to deliver a nationally accredited course. </p>  <p>  My Department has been in touch with the relevant agencies seeking to progress the development of a Special Purpose Award in Paediatric First Aid and the external quality assurance of the delivery of such an award.  I have asked my officials to keep me informed of developments in this matter. </p></reply>

Recent figures supplied by the CSO indicates the child care fees generally across the country increased by 2.4%  in 2014.  I do not have specific figures for the level of increase in the counties referred to by the Deputy. </p>  <p>  Child care surveys carried out by Pobal indicate that the average fee for a child care place is higher in child care facilities in urban centres than in child care facilities in rural districts.  The Pobal Annual Early Years Survey of 2013 show that the average fee for a full day place for a child older than 1 year, for example, is &euro;174.48 in urban services.  This is 9.2% higher than the average cost of &euro;159.76 for similar services in rural settings.  The cost of many goods and services tend to be more costly in urban centres but it is not the practice to increase State supports to meet these additional costs.  </p>  <p>  To help address child care costs, in the region of &euro;260 million is provided annually by my Department to support a number of child care programmes.  These programmes are in addition to the support provided to all parents in the form of Child Benefit.   </p>  <p>  The objective of the investment by my Department is to assist parents in accessing quality and affordable childcare.  More than 100,000 children benefit from this investment each year.  These programmes include the free preschool year provided under the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme.  In the region of 68,000 children benefit from the programme at a cost of &euro;2,375 per child per year.  In the region of 3,750 children in County Kildare are availing of the ECCE programme this year and in the region 3,400 children are availing of the programme in County Meath. </p>  <p>  The CCS programme provides funding to community child care services to enable them to provide quality child care at reduced rates to disadvantaged and low income working parents.  Parents qualify as disadvantaged or low income on the basis of means-tested entitlements.  In the case of full day care, parents qualifying for the higher rate of subvention under the CCS programme can have up to &euro;95 per week deducted from the overall charge for child care in the participating child care facility.  In the region of 25,000 children each year benefit from this programme.  In the region of 260 children in County Kildare are registered CCS support this year and in the region 450 children are registered in County Meath. </p>  <p>  Further child care support is provided to support a number of labour activation measures which assists parents returning to the workforce or availing of education or training opportunities.  In the region of 250 children in County Kildare and 150 children in County Meath have received such support to date in the current school year. </p>  <p>  To ensure that all the benefits of child care investments are fully realised, future public investment in child care must be evidence-based and strategically co-ordinated.  I have established a Inter-departmental Group to look at the provision right across the 0 to 6 age group as well as to consider the after-school needs of older school-going children.  It is crucial that we develop a coherent whole-of-Government approach to investment in child care services.  I have asked the Group report to me by the Summer. </p></reply>

I have indicated that if resources become available, I will review the scope for increasing the level of payments.   </p>  <p>  Reference is made in the newspaper article to tax relief as a means of supporting parents to meet child care costs.  The question of tax relief or tax credits as a means of supporting working parents was looked at previously but was considered to be unsuitable for a number of reasons.  For example, the introduction of tax credits would not help to support quality improvements within the child care sector and would not help those families on low pay who may not have any tax liability.  There is also concern that the application of tax credits could lead to increased prices and therefore have limited impact in terms of savings to parents. </p>  <p>  I want to look at the question of appropriate supports for child care in a wider context.  It is crucial that we develop a coherent whole-of-Government approach to investment in child care services.

In this context, I believe the introduction of a second year would benefit children&rsquo;s educational and developmental outcomes.<br/><br/>Despite the challenging budgetary situation, the preschool year has been maintained as a universal and free programme, ensuring that a significant number of children can avail of quality preschool services who would not otherwise be in a position to do so.<br/><br/><i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures,</i>the National Policy Framework for Children and Young People 2014-2020, recognises the value of early childhood care and education in supporting children's early cognitive, social and emotional development, and the Government is committed to the introduction of a second free preschool year within the lifetime of the Framework once the required quality standards are achieved and subject to the availability of resources.  <br/><br/>However, the introduction of a second preschool year would require considerable additional funding, broadly in line with the cost of the current provision, which is &euro;175 million per annum.  This additional funding is not currently available due to the financial constraints under which the Government is operating.  In addition, all of the available evidence indicates that the quality of the preschool provision is key to good outcomes for children.  The Early Years Quality Agenda is being progressed by my Department.  This involves a range of actions in key areas aimed at improving quality within early years services and enhancing the regulatory regime.  These reforms are key building blocks for any further extension of universal child care provision.<br/><br/>I want to ensure a cohesive, whole-of-Government approach to investment in child care services.  To ensure that all the benefits of child care investments are fully realised, future public investment in child care must be evidence-based and strategically coordinated.  With this in mind, I have established an Inter-departmental Group to look at the provision right across the 0 to 6 age group as well as to consider the after-school needs of older school-going children.

The objective of the programme is to make early learning in a formal setting available to all eligible children before they commence primary school.<br/><br/>The issue of access to the free preschool year for children with special needs was taken into account when the free preschool year was launched, and measures were introduced to make the programme more accessible for these children.  These measures include an exemption from the upper age limit and permission to have the preschool year split over two years on a <i>pro rata</i>basis, where it would be in the child's best interest. <br/><br/>Most children with special needs avail of the free preschool year in mainstream child care services.  The Health Service Executive does, where possible, assist children with special needs who may require additional support to enable them to avail of preschool services in mainstream settings.  However, I am aware that this support is not consistent nationally.<br/><br/>My Department meets regularly with the Department of Education and Skills to discuss issues of common concern, including supports for children with disabilities in mainstream preschools.  In particular the two Departments and the Department of Education and Skills have been working on how best to build better supports that facilitate children who have special needs.  The aim is to develop an agreed framework for the provision of resources to support children with special needs in mainstream childcare settings.  <br/><br/>Early years settings should of course be supported to provide an inclusive environment and I would like to be in a position to provide further supports.  Some of the measures I have taken include the establishment of Better Start, a national approach to improving quality,  which provides advice and support to early years settings on quality improvement.  I also introduced a Learner Fund to support staff in the sector to up-skill.  While modules on working with children with special needs or on equality/diversity are elective modules in Early Childhood Care and Education Courses at Levels 5 and 6 on the National Framework of Qualifications, I have encouraged the take up of these modules by offering Learner subsidies where a training provider runs these elective modules as part of the Major Award. <br/><br/>I have also established a high level Inter-departmental Group to examine the issue of future investment in early childhood care and education, and child care for school-going children.  As part of its work, the Group will consider how best to make appropriate provision for children with special needs who are accessing mainstream child care services.  I have asked the Group to report to me by the Summer. </p></reply>

Bullying and peer pressure emerged in the top eight 'not good' things for both children (aged 7-12) and young people (aged 12-18).<br/><br/><b>The Action Plan on Bullying</b><br/><br/>The Action Plan On Bullying: Report of the Anti-Bullying Working Group to the Minister for Education and Skills was published in January 2013 clearly recognised the necessity to tackle this issue in a holistic way which saw schools as pivotal but placed the issue within a much wider social context. One of the recommendations was that a single national anti-bullying website is to be developed to provide information for parents, young people, youth workers, sporting and cultural associations and school staff on types and methods of bullying and how to deal with bullying behaviour.  This is now being considered as part of the implementation plan for Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures.<br/><br/><b>Cyberbullying</b><br/><br/>The Minister for Communications established an Internet Content Governance Advisory Group under the chair of Dr. Brian O&rsquo;Neil in December 2013 to ensure our national policy represents best practice in offering the same online protections to our citizens as those available in the offline world.<br/><br/>The Group&rsquo;s report was approved by Cabinet and published in May 2014 and makes several recommendations aimed at protecting children and young people without unduly limiting their opportunities and rights online.  Along with changes to institutional, administrative and legal structures, the report makes four specific recommendations on cyberbullying aimed at providing stronger supports for tackling this issue through primary and post-primary curricula, and additional training and awareness measures.<br/><br/>In Ireland Safer Internet Day is promoted by the PDST Technology in Education and Webwise.ie.

The section in question also provides that a court shall not remand a child in custody if the only reason for so doing is that the child is in need of care or protection or the court wishes Tusla to assist it in dealing with the case.  Notwithstanding this provision, I understand there may be a range of other factors affecting the decision of a court on the remand of a child in custody.  As well as a pattern of criminal behaviour, such factors may also include identified service needs in areas such as mental health supports, substance abuse or educational welfare.  <br/><br/>Having regard to the wording of the section as it stands, the fact that children are at all times represented in court and the independence of the judiciary, it is unclear what amendments to the Children Act could address this issue.  I note that the courts already have the power under section 76B of the Act to request Tusla to be represented in criminal proceedings involving a child and in addition, the courts also have the authority to require the attendance of parents or guardians to assist in dealing with any individual case.  In addition, section 96 of the Act states that a court shall have regard to the principle that criminal proceedings shall not be used solely to provide any assistance or service needed to care for or protect a child and that a period of detention should be imposed only as a last resort.<br/><br/>The<i>Youth Justice Action Plan 2014-2018 </i>commits to achieving better outcomes for children who get into trouble with the law, to reduce crime leading to safer communities and to use detention only as a last resort.  In this context it is appropriate to review further the nature and pattern of remands in custody for children, which will allow for policy and the roles of the various statutory agencies concerned to be examined.  To this end discussions involving the Irish Youth Justice Service and Tusla, the Child and Family Agency which have commenced on this issue will feed into the development of policy priorities for the Youth Justice Action Plan for 2015.  While the main priority under the plan this year is to end the practice of detaining children in adult prison facilities, this exercise will inform any future actions in this area. </p></reply>

It will be a universal strategy for all young people aged 10 to 24 years.  It will have a particular focus on those who are most disadvantaged or at risk and who have the poorest outcomes and therefore are in most need of support.<br/><br/>A consultation on the new strategy is under way at present.  It includes consultation on the priorities for the new strategy and the findings of the recently completed Value for Money and Policy Review of Youth Programmes that targets disadvantaged young people.  The review makes recommendations for the future operation of youth funding schemes and their development in the years ahead to ensure effective, evidence based value for money programmes designed to ensure the optimal outcomes for young people who are at risk of disadvantage and in need of additional support.  It is my intention that the recommendations in the review will be progressed over 2015 and 2016 in the context of the new Youth Strategy.  <br/><br/>The consultation on the new National Youth Strategy will run to the end of this month and I anticipate that the strategy will be completed promptly thereafter. </p></reply>

It is considered that the 38 week model of delivery in one school year is the optimal model in terms of ensuring a high-quality early years experience for preschool children.  The S&iacute;olta and Aistear frameworks, which are central to quality preschool provision, were developed to support this objective.  The current model of delivery also helps to ensure that children and parents become accustomed to the weekly discipline of school attendance with the number of days and hours on which the programme is delivered being approximate to the primary school requirement of 5 days over 38.6 weeks.  There are no plans to increase the current provision within the preschool year or to extend the age range for eligibility.  <br/><br/>There is an increasing body of Irish and international evidence quantifying the benefits of early years interventions in terms of improving outcomes for children and in delivering significant and societal return to the State.  In this context, I believe that the introduction of a second free preschool year would benefit children&rsquo;s educational and developmental outcomes.<br/><br/>The introduction of a second preschool year would require considerable additional funding which is not currently available.  In addition, all of the available evidence indicates that the quality of the preschool provision is key to good outcomes for children.  The actions contained in the Early Years Quality Agenda, which involves a range of measures in key areas aimed at improving quality within early years services and enhancing the regulatory regime, are currently being implemented. <br/><br/><i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures</i>, the National Policy Framework for Children and Young People 2014-2020, recognises the value of early childhood care and education in supporting children&rsquo;s early cognitive, social and emotional development, and the Government is committed to the introduction of a second free preschool year within the lifetime of the Framework once the required quality standards are achieved, and subject to the availability of resources.</p></reply>

There is a great deal of oversight and effort put into creating a homely and safe residential setting, something which has been missing in the lives of these vulnerable children.  The use of residential accommodation is a relatively small part of the overall care provision, with residential placements accounting for 5% of children in care.  Most children in care, 93% at October 2014, are in family based foster placements, with the remaining 2% being cared for in other placements.  Unfortunately some children have deep and challenging issues that make it unsuitable to place them in foster care and require the use of a residential place.  The interventions for children in residential care aim to support them in coming to terms with the impact of the hurt they have suffered through neglect or abuse.</p>  <p>  The children entering residential care are as open to the types of risks that would be encountered by any child in their age cohort.  Services around the individual child  in care will address needs identified as part of their care plan, which can include interventions on alcohol, drugs and challenging behaviour.  That being said, it is not the case that a child's negative actions would be condoned nor would the child be shielded from the consequences of their actions.  </p>  <p>  Registration, inspection and monitoring ensure that residential services are operating according to the national standards and regulations.  The Health Information and Quality Authority has responsibility for inspecting centres operated by the Agency.  Generally the reports in 2014 indicated that management and staff were found to be knowledgeable, experienced and committed to the care of the children.  However, the complex interaction of the children's needs meant that a placement that was appropriate on admission may not be suitable over time and may require the updating of plans and behaviour supports.  Separately the Agency registers, inspects and monitors the private and voluntary children residential centres.  The Agency has completed 100% of its programme of inspections and monitoring for 2014.  Inspections identify compliance with standards, inform service delivery and give an oversight of significant events that have been notified in line with standards for residential care.  </p>  <p>  The number of 16 and 17 year olds admitted into care, 14% in 2013, is not the largest age group entering care but is significant. This age cohort has different needs compared to younger age groups and need different responses. The experiences common to teenagers in any community are compounded for children in care by their complex needs, which may result from effects of abuse, neglect, substance misuse and domestic violence. Strategies and processes are in place for managing care services for older children, resulting in plans that address these age appropriate issues. It is the case that targeted interventions need time, patience and understanding for their effect to take hold and develop, and can only be effective when the child is ready and able to participate in the process.  It is useful to note that the majority of 16 and 17 year olds entering care are in foster placements, similar to other age groups, and that progress is achieved by building up relationships for the child, both with professionals and the wider community in which they live.  My Department will continue to engage with the Agency on how best to meet the needs of this older population of children in care and how the Agency can incorporate learning from inspection and monitoring that takes into account the ever changing profile of young people in society.</p></reply>

The Programme is a targeted intervention aimed at school communities identified through the Department of Education and Skills&rsquo; DEIS Action Plan for Educational Inclusion.  It provides targeted supports annually to approximately 36,000 children. <br/><br/>Since 1<sup>st</sup>January 2014, the Child and Family Agency has operational responsibility for the School Completion Programme, including the allocation of funds to local projects.  In 2014, an allocation of &euro;24.756 million has been provided for the School Completion Programme.  The Agency has approved local projects' school retention plans for the 2014/2015 academic year.  The first two instalments of 2014/15 funding have been issued to local projects, with a third instalment planned for payment in May 2015.<br/><br/>The estimate for the Child and Family Agency for 2015 is &euro;631 million, a 4.3% increase on its 2014 allocation.  My Department has recently issued a Performance Statement to the Agency under Section 45 of the Child and Family Agency Act 2013.  This includes my priorities for consideration in the development of the Agency's 2015 Business Plan.  The Business Plan will set out the Agency's proposed activities, programmes and priorities for 2015, including provision for the School Completion Programme, in the light of the moneys available.<br/><br/>  A review of the School Completion Programme has commenced.  It is being carried out by the ESRI following a procurement process managed by the Agency.  It will assist in identifying the reforms necessary to consolidate the programme on a sustainable footing for the future.  Preliminary information gathered in the review indicates that the School Completion Programme encompasses a broad and diverse range of measures and interventions that have been developed by local projects over the years.  The intention is to learn more about the most successful of these, share the learning across the programme and ensure that available funds are targeted to those services that provide the greatest contribution to good educational outcomes for children and young people at risk of educational disadvantage.  The Review is an important initiative to plan for the future development of this Programme.  It is envisaged that the review will be completed during the current academic year. </p></reply>

This funding enables some 67,000 children each year to receive free preschool education.  The Government succeeded in maintaining the preschool year on a universal and free basis despite the difficult budgetary situation that prevailed in recent years.  While considerable progress has been made in correcting the overall budgetary situation, the funding available to my Department does not allow for an increase in the capitation rate paid to child care providers.

It is crucial that we develop a coherent whole-of-Government approach to investment in child care services.

The Policy Framework<i></i>outlines five national outcomes which all of Government and indeed all of society should work towards.  Children and young people should be:<br/><br/>-  Active and healthy with physical and mental wellbeing,<br/><br/>-  Achieving full potential in all areas of learning and development,<br/><br/>-  Safe and protected from harm<br/><br/>-  Enjoying economic security and opportunity, and<br/><br/>-  Connected, respected and contributing to their world.<br/><br/>Obviously my Department alone could not achieve all of these outcomes.  Therefore primary responsibility for the outcome areas belong to the Department of Health, the Department of Education and Skills, my Department, the Department of Social Protection and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government respectively.  <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures </i>details 163 key policy commitments for children and young people.  These cover a wide variety of policy areas, and are being progressed by the relevant departments.<br/><br/>The Child and Family Agency (Tusla) under the remit of my Department, represents the most comprehensive reform of child protection, early intervention and family support services ever undertaken in Ireland.  It is an ambitious move which brings together some 4,000 staff and an operational budget of approximately &euro;600m.<br/><br/>The Agency is charged with:<br/><br/>- supporting and promoting the development, welfare and protection of children, and the effective functioning of families;<br/><br/>- offering care and protection for children in circumstances where their parents have not been able to, or are unlikely to, provide the care that a child needs;<br/><br/>- responsibility for ensuring that every child in the State attends school or otherwise receives an education, and for providing education welfare services to support and monitor children&rsquo;s attendance, participation and retention in education;<br/><br/>- ensuring that the best interests of the child guides all decisions affecting individual children;<br/><br/>- consulting children and families so that they help to shape the agency&rsquo;s policies and services;<br/><br/>- strengthening interagency co-operation to ensure seamless services responsive to needs;<br/><br/>- undertaking research relating to its functions, and providing information and advice to the Minister regarding those functions; and<br/><br/>- commissioning services relating to the provision of child and family services<br/><br/>One of the main challenges in the area of physical well-being is childhood obesity.  In the latter part of 2013, in my role then as the Minister of Health, I jointly launched with my predecessor, Minister Fitzgerald, a three year media and social media campaign aimed at giving practical tips to parents on managing their children&rsquo;s weight.<font color="#2F2F2F"> </font><br/><br/>As Minister for Children and Youth Affairs I have responsibility for Play and Recreation Policy which have been set out in the policy documents, &lsquo;<font color="#2F2F2F">READY, STEADY, PLAY! A National Play Policy&rsquo; and  the &lsquo;Teenspace, National Recreation Policy for Young People&rsquo;. </font><font color="#2F2F2F">Initiatives being developed at local community level are designed to encourage awareness of the importance of play and recreation throughout the whole of life from early childhood to adulthood and through to later life. </font><br/><br/>Additionally, my Department administers funding schemes and programmes to support national and local youth work provision to some 380,000 young people which involves approximately 1,400 youth work staff in 477 projects and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country.  I am pleased that Budget 2015 has confirmed that funding of &euro;49.78m will again be provided to my Department in 2015 to support the provision of youth services.  Many of the youth services operate with young people&rsquo;s physical and mental well-being as the central pillar of their services and programmes.  The Youth Work Sector has particular expertise in working with young people and provides non-formal and informal learning opportunities to support their well-being. <br/><br/>I can inform the Deputy that the direct provision system is under the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality.  The Department of Justice and Equality has primary responsibility in the area of asylum and immigration.<br/><br/>The Department of Justice and Equality has established a working group to review a range of issues pertaining to asylum seekers and direct provision.  The first meeting of the Working Group on the Protection Process was held on the 10th November 2014, chaired by Judge McMahon.  The Working Group consists of children's rights advocates, organisations engaged with asylum groups and representatives from a range of relevant Government Departments, including a representative from my own Department.  I look forward to learning of the findings and recommendations of the working group in the Spring of 2015.</p></reply>

Accordingly, workforce development is an important element of TUSLA&rsquo;s strategic approach to HR, which will include consideration of issues around recruitment, retention and turnover of key staff.  </p>  <p>  Tusla has already commenced a number of workforce reviews to assist with an evaluation of appropriate staff skill mix with a view to service enhancement.  This involves reviewing the roles of family support workers, social care workers in the community and administrative structures to support the delivery of more efficient and more cost-effective services.  Part of this evaluation includes looking at enhanced job roles, increasing multidisciplinary team working to help alleviate pressures and increasing collaborative approaches, redesigning tasks and promoting overall greater efficiency in working.  The workforce development plan will also take account of further developing supports through structured professional and career development.</p>  <p>  During this process, Tusla continues to actively recruit social workers as vacancies arise and 164 social workers took up positions during 2014.  A further 219 social workers are under active recruitment.  As in any employment situation, turnover of staff does occur and 112 social workers left the Agency during 2014.  While Tusla is experiencing some recruitment and retention issues, the turnover of social workers in the Agency's first year of operation was 7.3%.  This turnover rate includes those who have retired or left for other reasons.  There is limited published international research on job turnover and retention in child protection and welfare.  However, it is recognised that recruitment and retention in this area is a key issue internationally.  While not minimising the impact of the turnover rate in Tusla, a turnover rate of 10% or below is considered a low turnover rate that is achieved by very few organisations in the field of child welfare and protection.</p>  <p>  The impact of vacancies on service provision is risk-assessed on an ongoing basis to ensure that social work team members are never allowed to fall below what is considered necessary to provide a safe service.  Such risk-assessments take account of issues such as caseloads and referral numbers.  Where necessary, temporary staff are brought in immediately to cover vacancies until such vacancies are filled on a permanent basis.  This assessment takes account of all absences, including those on maternity related leave.  There were 124 such temporary staff in place across the four regions covering vacancies at the end of December 2014.</p>  <p>  I am currently considering the Tusla Business Plan for 2015 which was recently submitted to me and I will be monitoring the ongoing review, assessment and management of the cases awaiting assignment to social workers throughout 2015. </p></reply>

To help address this situation, my Department supports the provision of early childhood care and education by providing annually in the region of &euro;260 million to support three childcare  programmes that make childcare services more affordable.  This investment ensures that more than 100,000 children have access to quality childcare.  This high level of support has been maintained despite the difficult budgetary situation that prevailed in recent years. <br/><br/>I wish to point out to the Deputy that, while the annual spend on childcare related programmes has been in the region of 0.2 per cent of GDP in recent years, this does <i>not</i>include expenditure under other programmes or by other Departments.  It therefore does not represent the full extent of State expenditure. In fact, Ireland spends 0.4% of GDP relative to the OECD average of 0.7%.The funding provided by my Department has a considerable impact on the level and quality of childcare services provided.<br/><br/>It is clear that accessibility, affordability and high quality childcare can play a critical role in achieving a number of Government priorities, including improving educational outcomes for children, reducing poverty and increasing parents' participation in the labour market.  <br/><br/>I would like to be in a position to increase our investment in childcare-related programmes as resources allow. However, I am determined that all such spending, whether existing or additional, will be based on good evidence, and co-ordinated strategically, so that we achieve the best possible benefits for children. <br/><br/>To this end, I have established an Inter-departmental Group which will look at the provision right across the 0 to 6 age group as well as to consider the after-school needs of older school-going children.<br/><br/>This new Group will include representatives of the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Social Protection, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Department of Finance and the Department of the Taoiseach and will be led and supported by my Department.I have asked the Group to report to me by the Summer. </p></reply>

Sections 2-7, 17, 18 and 24 of the Act have been commenced. Sections 17 and 18 of the Act provide for the appointment of a National Youth Work Advisory Committee.  The Committee has an advisory and consultative role to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs in matters to do with youth work, including the coordination of youth work programmes and services. In line with these provisions, a new National Youth Work Advisory Committee was appointed by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs with a term of office of one year with effect from 28 January 2013. The Committee continues to work with the Department and is currently assisting with the development of the new National Youth Strategy, in particular in identifying in what ways the youth sector can contribute to shared policy objectives for young people. <br/><br/>The National Youth Work Development Plan (2003-2007) was prepared by the first National Youth Work Advisory Committee at the request of the then Minister for Education and Science and published in 2003.<br/><br/>Since the enactment of the Youth Work Act, in 2001 and the publication of the National Youth Development Plan in 2003, there have been significant policy and legislative developments that are relevant to the provision of youth services. These include, the introduction of Better Outcomes Brighter Futures, the national policy framework for children and young people, the setting up of the North South Education and Training Standards Committee for youth work and the introduction of the Education and Training Boards, Act 2013 which, <i>inter alia,</i>provides for a statutory function for Education and Training Boards in supporting the provision and assessment of youth work services at local level.  At EU level, the Council of Ministers for Youth has adopted an EU Youth Strategy and has taken a number of policy initiatives to promote quality in the provision of youth work services.<br/><br/>Following the completion of the new National Youth Strategy, I intend that the provisions of the Youth Work Act 2001 will be considered in the light of these developments and in relation the implementation arrangements to be put in place to achieve the strategy&rsquo;s objectives and to secure the best possible outcomes for young people.  <br/><br/>The consultation on the National Youth Strategy will continue until the end of this month and I anticipate that the strategy will be completed promptly thereafter. </p></reply>

Almost every pre-school service in the State is participating in the programme with approximately 67,000 children availing of free pre-school provision each year.   </p>  <p>  The standard capitation currently provided is &euro;62.50 per week for each eligible child enrolled with a capitation of &euro;73 per week provided where services have staff who hold higher qualifications.  A total of some &euro;175 million is spent on the free pre-school year annually. </p>  <p>  The Government succeeded in maintaining the pre-school year on a universal and free basis despite the difficult budgetary situation that prevailed in recent years.    While considerable progress has been made in correcting the overall budgetary situation, the funding available to my Department does not allow for any increase in the current provision within the pre-school year or to extend the age range for eligibility.  Consideration will be given to the introduction of a second free pre-school year when quality issues in the sector have been addressed and the necessary funding becomes available.</p>  <p>  In addition to the children supported under the ECCE programme, my Department also provides support to approximately 35,000 children in the 0 to 6 age group and children availing of after-school care. These supports are provided through the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme, which provides subvention payments to disadvantaged and low income families availing of childcare services in community childcare facilities, and through a number of labour activation measures that have been introduced to assist parents who are returning to the work force or engaging in training or education opportunities.   </p>  <p>  Together these childcare support programmes represent an annual investment of &euro;260 million by my Department. I would like to be in a position to increase our investment in childcare-related programmes as resources allow. However, I am determined that all such spending, whether existing or additional, will be based on good evidence, and co-ordinated strategically, so that we achieve the best possible benefits for children. </p>  <p>  To this end, I have established an Inter-departmental Group which will look at the provision right across the 0 to 6 age group as well as to consider the after-school needs of older school-going children.</p>  <p>  This new Group will include representatives of the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Social Protection, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Department of Finance and the Department of the Taoiseach and will be led and supported by my Department.

Current aftercare provision incorporates advice, guidance and practical (including accommodation and financial) support.  The Child Care Act 1991 provides that the core eligible age range for aftercare is from 18 years up to 21 years.  The Agency has advised me that a number of areas of action have been prioritised and work has commenced on the development of dedicated aftercare services, on the standardisation of a range of financial packages, on the introduction of Aftercare Steering Committees at local level, and on the further development of the provision of information on aftercare services in Ireland.  </p>  <p>  The Agency has further advised that at December, 2014, excluding staff costs, approximately &euro;14.3 million was spent on the provision of statutory aftercare services.  </p>  <p>  Between 450 and 500 young people leave care annually upon turning 18.  According to the Child and Family Agency, at the end of September, 2014 there were 1,698 young people aged 18 to 23 years (inclusive) in receipt of an aftercare service.  Of those, 946 (56%) were in full time education.  </p>  <p>  A significant number of these young people are supported financially to remain living with their foster carers, in addition to having access to an aftercare worker.  The most vulnerable group of children are those leaving residential care or short term foster care placements.  Children, who come into care late, in their mid to late teens, may not have developed the relationships with staff or aftercare workers that help them achieve good outcomes.  </p>  <p>  Young people who do not have family support from a foster carer or family base are assisted in finding accommodation in supported lodgings, sheltered housing or independent accommodation and encouraged and supported financially in furthering their training and education.</p>  <p>  A protocol developed by the Child and Family Agency and the County and City Management Association, in relation to dealing with accommodation issues of young people leaving care, has been completed.  This will see the relevant local authority housing representative attend aftercare planning meetings with social workers of the Agency in relation to those young people for whom social housing has been identified as the most appropriate form of accommodation support.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, as the Deputy is aware, it has been decided to strengthen the legislative provisions regarding aftercare.  This is in response to concerns that there was insufficient focus in this area and that such planning was not taking place on a properly structured and consistent basis.  The approach adopted is to impose a statutory duty on the Child and Family Agency to prepare an aftercare plan for an eligible child or eligible young person.  The aim is to create an explicit, as opposed to implicit, statement of the Agency&rsquo;s duty to satisfy itself as to the child&rsquo;s or young person&rsquo;s need for assistance by preparing a plan that identifies those needs for aftercare supports.</p>  <p>  It is anticipated that the Aftercare Bill will be published in the early part of 2015.</p></reply>

The programme is a targeted intervention aimed at school communities identified through the Department of Education and Skills' DEIS Action Plan for Educational Inclusion. It provides targeted supports annually to approximately 36,000 children.</p>  <p>  Since 1 January 2014, the Child and Family Agency has operational responsibility for the School Completion Programme. The review of the School Completion Programme, indicated in the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure 2012-2014, is underway. The objectives of the review are to examine the programme's structures, clarify roles and responsibilities, to analyse the interventions and supports provided and identify best practice and make recommendations for the future of the programme.</p>  <p>  The review is being carried out by the ERSI following a procurement process which was managed by the Agency. The plan for the review includes arrangements to capture the views of a range of stakeholders, including staff  and all those involved in the organisation and administration of the School Completion Programme. It includes a survey to gather the views of project coordinators and chairpersons of the 124 local school completion programme projects throughout the country, case studies of projects involving staff and participating schools and interviews with national stakeholders who have a direct interest in the programme.</p>  <p>  The review of the School Completion Programme is an important initiative in planning for the future development of the programme. It will assist in identifying the reforms necessary to consolidate the programme on a sustainable footing for the future. Preliminary information gathered in the review indicates that the School Completion Programme encompasses a broad and diverse range of measures and interventions that have been developed by local projects over the years. The intention is to learn more about the most successful of these, share the learning across the programme and ensure that available funds are targeted to those services that provide the greatest contribution to good educational outcomes for children and young people at risk of educational disadvantage. </p>  <p>  The review is being overseen by a steering group comprising officials from my Department, the Department of Education and Skills and the Agency. Work is at an advanced stage and it is anticipated that the review will be completed during the current academic year.</p></reply>

The Act outlines the procedures and the conditions under which a Court may grant a care order, including the relevant period for review by the Court.  While the Child and Family Agency has a duty to receive a child who requires care or protection into its care under the Child Care Act 1991, it does not have the power to impose a care order.  A care order, in the case of emergency, interim or full care orders, can only be issued by a member of the judiciary sitting in the District Court, which may be part of a special sitting as the Children Court, as indicated in the Act.  In the case of special care orders, an application must be made to the High Court.  Decisions on the variation or discharge of a care order are also a matter for the relevant Court and lie outside the powers of the Agency.  If a person is unhappy with a care order itself then an appeal can be lodged with the Courts, which, normally, in the case of an order from the District Court is to be lodged within 14 days of the order being made.   Under the Child Care Act 1991, as amended, it is possible for a child to be placed with the Agency in care on a voluntary basis but this is not a care order and can be rescinded by the parent or guardian at any time.</p>  <p>  If there is dissatisfaction on the outcome of a case or any other aspect of the service provided by the Agency then this may be referred to the Agency&rsquo;s complaints service, under its complaints policy &lsquo;Your Service Your Say&rsquo;.  The Agency's website outlines a number of routes by which a complaint can be made and includes comprehensive guide on feedback and complaints, including contact information for a number of advocacy groups (www.tusla.ie). </p>  <p>  There is also the option of referring the complaint to the Ombudsman for Children, who can look into how complaints with a child protection concern may have been handled.  The Ombudsman can instigate investigations on its own volition.  Complaints can be made directly by anyone under the age of 18, or by an adult on behalf of a child or young person.  If the concern is in relation to professional misconduct or poor performance of a social worker, a complaint can be made to CORU, Ireland's health and social care regulator using their complaints procedure, 'Fitness to Practice'. </p></reply>

This high level of support has been maintained despite the difficult budgetary situation that prevailed in recent years. </p>  <p>  I wish to point out to the Deputy that, while the annual spend on childcare related programmes has been in the region of 0.2 per cent of GDP in recent years, this expenditure does not include expenditure under other programmes or by other Departments and therefore does not represent the full extent of State expenditure. Ireland spends over 0.4% of GDP relative to the OECD average of 0.7%.</p>  <p>  It is clear that accessibility, affordability and high quality childcare can play a critical role in achieving a number of Government priorities, including improving educational outcomes for children, reducing poverty and increasing parents' participation in the labour market.  To ensure that all the benefits of childcare investments are fully realised, future public investment in childcare must be evidence-based and strategically coordinated. I am establishing an Inter-departmental Group to look at the provision right across the 0 to 6 age group as well as to consider the after-school needs of older school-going children. It is crucial that we develop a coherent whole-of-Government approach to investment in childcare services.</p>  <p>  This new Group will include representatives of the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Social Protection, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Department of Finance and the Department of the Taoiseach and will be led and supported by my Department.

The principles of the Children Act 2001 include that detention should be imposed as a last resort and may only be imposed if it is the only suitable way of dealing with the child, and that the various areas in the youth justice system apply a series of 'filters' or tests in each case.  In examining each case, it is important to note that it is not a simple question of choice between the Diversion Programme, community sanctions and detention.  </p>  <p>  The first main filter is the Garda Diversion Programme, which at different stages and depending on the seriousness of the offence, may involve the informal caution (without supervision) and the formal (supervised by a Garda Juvenile Liaison Officer) caution, including possible involvement with a Garda Youth Diversion Project. The second main filter is provided by the non-custodial sanctions available to the Courts, including dismissal under the Probation Act and unsupervised sanctions (e.g. fines, disqualification, peace bond, curfew etc.). The next stage involves the Probation Service's supervised sanctions (i.e. community service and other community sanctions). Finally, as a last resort, detention may be used.</p>  <p>  I have on-going policy cooperation with the Minister for Justice and Equality regarding our shared goal to minimise the rate of juvenile offending under the Youth Justice Action Plan 2014 &ndash; 2018.  The Minister for Justice and Equality has overall responsibility in the area of crime and anti-social behaviour and her Department funds a range of community based responses to youth crime, in particular the Garda Diversion Programme and the Young Person Probation Community Projects.  These programmes are specifically targeted at young offenders and those at serious risk of offending.  Funding support of approximately &euro;17m has been allocated by the Minister for Justice and Equality to this area in 2015. This budget has been maintained in recent years notwithstanding financial constraints.</p>  <p>  In the year 2012, there were a total of 12,246 children referred to the Garda Diversion Programme and a total of 134 children either remanded or sentenced to a period of detention in the children detention schools. This would seem to indicate that when all children in contact with the criminal justice system are considered, detention is being used to a much less degree than non custodial options and the Garda Diversion Programme. However, I can assure the Deputy that I will continue to work with my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality in continuing to promote the use of non custodial options where appropriate in line with the objectives of the Youth Justice Action Plan.  </p></reply>

This figure includes &euro;175 million provided annually to support the universal free pre-school provision under the Early Childhood Care and Education  programme.  These programmes are, of course,  in addition to the support provided to all parents in the form of Child Benefit.<br/><br/>The funding provided through the childcare support programmes has had a significant impact on childcare provision and has enabled many childcare providers to continue to deliver childcare services at a time of economic difficulty.  The funding has also ensured that employment levels across the sector have been maintained. The retention of the current level of investment in childcare is a considerable achievement, given the pressure on the public finances over the last number of years.<br/><br/>I recognise the difficulties being faced by childcare providers and I am aware of the concerns of childcare professionals in relation to levels of remuneration in the childcare sector.  I met recently with their representatives to discuss a range of issues relating to childcare provision and I am giving careful consideration to their views on future developments in the sector.  <br/><br/>The remuneration for childcare workers is a matter for agreement between employers and employees.  Staff remuneration does account for the great proportion of the overall cost of providing childcare services and I acknowledge that increased capitation and subvention payments through the childcare support programmes would assist childcare services in addressing these cost issues.I have indicated that, if resources become available to my Department, I will consider the scope for increasing the level of these payments. <br/><br/>However, I want to look at the question of appropriate supports for child care in a wider context. It is crucial that we develop a coherent whole-of-Government approach to investment in childcare services.  To ensure that all the benefits of our full range of childcare investments are fully realised, future public investment in childcare must be evidence-based and strategically coordinated.  I have established an Inter-departmental Group to look at the provision right across the 0 to 6 age group as well as to consider the after-school needs of older school-going children.  I have asked the Group to report to me by the Summer. </p></reply>

This includes the qualifications profile of the sector.    </p>  <p>  There is an increasing recognition of the importance of skilled and appropriate qualified staff in this sector.  Indeed, in recent years, with the introduction of the free pre-school year in 2010, early years practitioners have had to become increasingly qualified.    Prior to 2010, there was no education qualification requirement for staff working with children in the early years sector.     This changed with the introduction of the free pre-school year under the Early Childhood Care and Education programme, whereby pre-school leaders are required to have a minimum of a Major Award at Level 5 on the National Framework of Qualifications (or equivalent) to qualify for the standard capitation rate and a Level 7 Major Award (or equivalent) to qualify for the higher capitation rate.</p>  <p>The introduction of the Learner Fund in 2014 has also served to improve qualification levels within the sector and there is considerable evidence that the early years sector is becoming increasingly upskilled.     Data from Pobal's Annual Survey (2013) shows that 99.4% of early years settings that responded have at least one staff member qualified to National Framework Qualification Level 5 or higher.   86.3% had at least one staff member qualified to Level 6 or higher and 39.5% had at least one staff member qualified to Level 7 or higher.  </p>  <p>  While the qualifications profile of the sector is on an upward trajectory, we need to be sure that their education and training is equipping them to become competent professionals.   My colleagues in the Department of Education and Skills are taking the lead in carrying out a review of ECCE education and training programmes which will examine the extent to which such programmes are being delivered as efficiently as possible;  are subject to appropriate quality assurance procedures at institutional level;  meet the demands of the learning community, including the extent to which they incorporate flexible learning, modular delivery, progression routes, and opportunities for recognition of prior learning (RPL); equip graduates with the skills, knowledge and dispositions to work in the area of early years education, which is one element of the overall education continuum ; prepare graduates for social diversity; and are delivered by appropriately qualified experts in the field of early years education.</p>  <p>  While the profession is not regulated, the developments in the last few years have seen Government recognition of the importance of skilled and appropriately qualified staff as central to the achievement of quality standards.   The introduction of the higher capitation rate for early years practitioners educated to degree level is proof of this.</p></reply>

As of 1st January 2014, the Child and Family Agency is  responsible for the former Family Support Agency, the National Educational Welfare Board and also for the functions of Child and Family services previously provided by the HSE.   The Agency's functions  include maintaining and developing services in order to support and promote the development, welfare  and protection of children and to support effective functioning of families. In so doing  the Agency will promote enhanced interagency cooperation  to ensure that services  are coordinated on the principle of the best interest of all children and their families.</p>  <p>  The Educational Welfare Service (EWS) of the Child and Family Agency is in the process of refining and implementing a new strategic approach to service delivery through an integrated model of service committed to the principle of &ldquo;One Child, One Team, One Plan&rdquo;. The EWS of the Child and Family Agency is developing national guidelines as a practical support for schools in the preparation of School Attendance Strategies as outlined in Section 22 of the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000. The guidelines will assist schools to implement effective measures to support children at risk of poor attendance and participation, including those with caring responsibilities. It is anticipated that the guidelines will be completed before the beginning of the 2015/16 academic year. </p>  <p>  In order to learn more about children that undertake caring roles, my Department requested the Central Statistics Office to help to identify the extent to which children have caring responsibilities.    The Census of Population 2011 found that 6,449 children, or 5.6 per 1,000 children provided regular unpaid personal help for a friend or family member with a long-term illness, health problems or disability.  Rates ranged from 4.3 per 1,000 in Co. Louth to 8.2 per 1000 in Co. Leitrim.  Under the National Strategy for Research and Data on Children&rsquo;s Lives (2011-2016) analysis of those figures in the 2011 Census will help to inform future policy as to how best to address the support needs of children and young people who undertake caring roles. This analysis will be published in 2015.</p>  <p>  A National Youth Strategy is also being developed by my Department.  It will be a universal strategy for all young people aged 10 to 24 years. It will have a particular focus on those who are most disadvantaged or at risk and who have the poorest outcomes and therefore in most need of support. The consultation process in the development of this strategy has included a number of major stakeholder consultation events and I am pleased that representatives of the Carers Association participated in these consultations. </p></reply>

The Department of Justice and Equality has primary responsibility in the area of asylum and immigration.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that a report &lsquo;Review of the operation of the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002&rsquo;, was submitted by the former Ombudsman for Children, Ms Emily Logan to the then Minister for Children and Youth Affairs in March 2012. One of the recommendations contained in that report was that &ldquo;&hellip; section 11(1) (e) should be amended to clarify that the exclusion regarding the administration of law in the area of asylum, immigration, naturalisation or citizenship relates solely to decisions taken by the relevant authorities in accordance with statutory procedures for determining whether a person is entitled to a particular status.&rdquo;   My Department engaged with the Department of Justice and Equality on this recommendation, among others. The then Minister for Justice and Equality considered that no legislative change was required and this position has been reaffirmed by that Department. </p>  <p>In a reply to a question by Deputy Brendan Griffin  (Reference No. 31092/14 on 15th July 2014), the Minister for Justice and Equality addressed, among other issues, the question of the Ombudsman for Children being given jurisdiction in the direct provision system and for the Health Information Quality Authority (HIQA) to be allowed inspect direct provision hostels. In replying, the Minister made reference to provisions in both the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002 and Ombudsman Act 1980 which excludes either Ombudsman from investigating any action taken by or on behalf of a person in the administration of law relating to, inter alia, asylum. If I may quote from Minister Fitzgerald's response, she said "Whilst there are no plans to change those legislative provisions, the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) including RIA, has administrative arrangements in place with both Offices to assist and provide information on matters brought to its attention by them  ".</p>  <p>  The Department of Justice and Equality has established a working group to review a range of issues pertaining to asylum seekers and direct provision. The first meeting of the Working Group on the Protection Process was held on the 10th November 2014, chaired by Judge Bryan McMahon. The Working Group consists of children's rights advocates, organisations engaged with asylum groups and representatives from a range of relevant government departments, including a representative from my own Department. I look forward to learning of the findings and recommendations of the working group in the Spring of 2015. </p></reply>

As provided for in the Framework, the Department of Social Protection is the lead department on child poverty and has lead responsibility for the commitment to lift over 70,000 children out of consistent poverty by 2020, a reduction of at least two-thirds on the 2011 level.  The Department of Social Protection also has lead responsibility for the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion.  The outcomes of the recent European Commission/ Departmental of Social Protection / Department of Children and Youth Affairs national seminar will inform the development of an implementation plan for tackling child poverty.<br/><br/>My Department is working on a number of initiatives which are relevant in addressing issues related to children poverty.

As part of this process, all staff working directly with children in pre-school services must hold a major award in early childhood care and education at Level 5 on the National Framework of Qualifications, or the equivalent. This minimum qualification, which will be a requirement under the Pre-School Regulations, will apply to all pre-school services from September 2015.  Staff who wish to continue in employment in the childcare sector must satisfy the new qualification requirements. <br/><br/>In relation to the Early Childhood Care and Education programme, it will be a contractual requirement from the above dates that all pre-school leaders delivering the free pre-school year hold a major award in early childhood care and education at  Level 6 or the equivalent. <br/><br/>Specific funding of &euro;3 million has been provided in 2014/15 under the Learner Fund initiative to support childcare workers seeking to obtain the required  qualifications. The first and most important objective of this funding is to ensure that all existing staff are in a position to meet the mandatory qualification requirements for the positions that they are currently occupying, otherwise it will not be possible for them to continue in these positions after September 2015.<br/><br/>The Learner Fund is linked to the introduction of the mandatory qualifications and while other training priorities can be examined at a future date, the priority for now must be to use the funding available for staff who must achieve mandatory qualifications. <br/><br/>A National Early Years Quality Support Service, <i>Better Start</i>, has been introduced under the Early Years Quality Agenda.  Funding has been provided to allow for the recruitment of 30 graduates in early childhood care and education to work directly with services to assist services in implementing the S&iacute;olta Framework and the Aistear Curriculum and improving the quality of childcare provision.  <br/><br/>The new support service will work closely with the City and County Childcare Committees and the Voluntary Childcare Organisations to support service providers in improving the quality of their services.  The work of the service will be based on a new Practice Guide based on S&iacute;olta and Aistear, which is currently being developed by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA). </p></reply>

At December 2014, there are 936 referred clients on drug rehabilitation places, compared to 824 in 2012. In addition, there are 220 support workers giving a total of 1,156 places dedicated to drugs rehabilitation on CE. This number is very close to full capacity. </p>  <p>  A key first step in securing this improvement was the establishment of a stakeholder group which now assists the Department to identify and implement enhancements to the scheme. In addition, workshops have been held with the scheme supervisors and departmental staff to ensure that the schemes meet the needs of participants. To complement these changes, an improved vacancy notification system and referral process was introduced by this Department. </p>  <p>  During any given year, participants may exit for many reasons, including illness/relapse, gaining employment, maternity leave, retirement, emigration, transfer to another scheme, exit to a training programme or completion of CE.  Therefore, there is a cycle of places becoming vacant and being filled on an ongoing basis on schemes.  All referrals to the drug rehabilitation places come directly from treatment centres or other designated personnel engaged in the rehabilitation process.</p>  <p>  The CE Drug Rehabilitation Scheme plays an important role in helping recovering drug users to develop their personal and employment skills.  In this regard, I am pleased that the number of places filled increased substantially last year and that this will continue in 2015.</p></reply>

Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives. This is particularly important given the challenge that increased longevity is posing for the future sustainability of the State pension.  Therefore, when assessing whether an individual is entitled to a State pension, and to ensure that they can maximise such entitlement, all contributions (paid or credited) from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account. </p>  <p>  The State already assists those with caring roles to qualify for a State pension (contributory). The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme makes qualification for State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme, which was introduced in 1994, allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age or incapacitated people to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes.  Given the valuable nature of the State pension (contributory), those who qualify under the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme still need to fulfil the eligibility requirements for that scheme, and have at least 520 paid contributions over the course of their working lives. </p>  <p>  However, for those with insufficient contributions to meet the requirements for a State pension (contributory), the State pension system provides alternative methods of support.  If someone has been a carer for nearly all of their adult life and has paid little or no PRSI, they may qualify for a means tested State pension (non-contributory), the maximum personal rate for which is &euro;219, which amounts to just over 95% of the maximum rate of the State pension (contributory).  Alternatively, if their spouse or civil partner is in receipt of a State pension (contributory) they may instead qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult of up to &euro;206.30, which is just under 90% of the maximum personal rate of the State pension (contributory). </p>  <p>  It is expected that a total contributions approach to pension qualification will replace the current average contributions test for State pension (contributory) from 2020, although that date is subject to change.  Issues such as equality of outcomes for women and men, including those who spend some years outside the labour market on caring duties, will be considered carefully in the context of that reform. </p></reply>

Over &euro;822 million is being provided this year for these direct supports, up nearly &euro;17 million from that provided for in 2014. In 2014, more than 80,000 carers benefited from the respite care grant at an estimated cost of &euro;122 million.</p>  <p>  Any change to the rate of RCG can only be considered in the context of Budget preparations and I was not in a position to provide for an increase in the respite care grant in the 2015 Budget. However, I did announce a number of welfare initiatives which will benefit carers, pensioners, and people with disabilities who are in receipt of a welfare payment. These initiatives included the re-introduction of a Christmas Bonus, an increase in Child Benefit and an increase in the Living Alone Allowance.</p>  <p>  The Christmas Bonus was abolished by the previous Government in 2009. I was in a position to partially restore the bonus last year. A bonus of 25% was paid in early December to all long-term welfare recipients including all pensioners and carers. This is in recognition of the position of vulnerable households. I should also point out that recipients of half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance also received a bonus.</p></reply>

The works involve refurbishment to facilitate the introduction of an INTREO Office facility, a key element of the Government's Pathways to Work programme.  The Office of Public Works and the Department of Social Protection staff are liaising with the main contractor and specialist sub-contractors to remove, contain and encapsulate low risk asbestos flooring material identified prior to and during the refurbishment works in the building, without posing any risk to our staff or our clients, in accordance with standard practice.  The removal of asbestos will follow a strict &lsquo;Method Statement&rsquo; that forms part of the Health and Safety procedures. </p>  <p>  On 21/02/2015, some asbestos material was removed by a specialist company and a separate specialist company carried out 20 number reassurance air tests throughout the building.  Tests were carried out on all floors in both the front and rear blocks and within the temporary prefabs.  All of the air tests were negative for asbestos.  </p>  <p>  Based on clear air tests and the results of the material and dust samples, the offices can be re-occupied by staff.  However in the light of staff concerns, staff are currently being accommodated in alternate accommodation in the Department&rsquo;s Offices at Oliver Plunkett Road, and this is being kept under constant review.  Prior to re-occupancy all areas will be tested again for further assurance that there is no risk to staff or clients.</p></reply>

There are currently approximately 70,700 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;298 million for 2015. <br/><br/>Rent supplement is subject to a means test which is normally calculated to ensure that a person, after the payment of rent, has an income equal to the rate of basic supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to their family circumstances, less a minimum contribution which recipients are required to pay from their own resources. <br/><br/>Under social welfare legislation payment received under the domiciliary care allowance scheme is classed as non-assessable means for the purposes of calculating rent supplement and is excluded from the assessment of means.<br/><br/>The reduced rates of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance for younger persons encourage young jobseekers to improve their skills and remain active in the labour market in order to avoid the risk of becoming long-term unemployed. Where a person is in receipt of a reduced rate of jobseeker's allowance and he or she participates in a course of education or training a higher rate of &euro;160 applies. <br/><br/>The aim of the Youth Guarantee is to provide young people under the age of 25 with a good quality offer of employment, continued education, an apprenticeship or a traineeship within a short time of becoming unemployed. The main plank of the guarantee is assistance to young people in finding and securing sustainable jobs, through earlier and enhanced engagement processes.  In addition, additional places on a number of programmes and youth-oriented variants of existing schemes have been rolled out. Young people who are assessed as having a low to medium probability of securing employment in the absence of any support, will receive a Youth Guarantee offer within four months of an initial one-to-one interview. <br/><br/>The Department is actively engaging with Tusla and non-Government organisations in providing the necessary support to vulnerable young people leaving care who are experiencing homelessness or in insecure situations. These cases are managed on a case by case basis and the payment of deposits and rent in advance is considered. This form of assistance is very important to those on low incomes who are at risk of, or who are homeless, or who rely on the private rented market to meet their housing needs. <br/><br/>In 2014, the Department made a total of some 3,000 payments of rent deposits/rent in advance at a cost of &euro;1.48 million throughout the country, of which some 850 payments at a cost of over &euro;360,000 were made to persons&rsquo; aged under 25 years. </p></reply>

Applicants who are under age 66, including those with learning disabilities, must be in receipt of a qualifying payment in order to qualify for the scheme.  The qualifying payments for those aged under 66 are invalidity pension, blind pension, disability allowance, carer&rsquo;s allowance or an equivalent social security payment from a country covered by EC Regulations or one with which Ireland has a Bilateral Social Security Agreement.  Free travel is provided for people in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance to facilitate their caring role and support their social inclusion.</p>  <p>  There is a provision for free travel passes for visually impaired children who satisfy the medical conditions for the blind pension.  The provision is a long-standing one based on supports for the blind, including the blind pension, that predated other supports for the disabled.  </p>  <p>  Children with other disabilities may qualify for the domiciliary care allowance.  This is a monthly payment of &euro;309.50 to the carer of a child with a disability.  The allowance may be used for the additional costs involved in caring for the child and this may include additional transport costs.

The DACT projects commenced at the end of 2012 and will end on 30 April 2015, as the ESF portion of the funding was provided under the Human Capital Investment Operational Programme 2007- 2013 and this programme has recently come to an end. </p>  <p>  There is therefore no provision for ESF co-funding arrangements to continue beyond the end of April next.  This position was recently communicated to the individual projects and it was pointed out that the terms of the grant agreement with each DACT project stipulated that the project must be delivered and completed by the end of April this year.</p>  <p>  I very much welcomed and supported the setting up of these projects as they set out to explore a variety of routes towards ensuring that people with disabilities are enabled to avail of progression, education and development opportunities within the world of work.  However, the projects were not intended to become ongoing service delivery organisations.  </p>  <p>  The Department has now commissioned an independent evaluation of the projects and a key part of this evaluation will be to identify from the projects what works with regard to increasing the capacity and potential of people on disability/illness welfare payments to participate in the labour market, and which of those are capable, where appropriate, of being mainstreamed in the delivery of supports to people with disabilities in the future.  In the meantime, the Department is considering the position of those people who will still be participating in the projects at the end of April.</p></reply>

The 2015 Estimates for the Department provide for expenditure this year on the jobseekers&rsquo; schemes of &euro;3.01 billion.    </p>  <p>  In the case of persons aged under 25 years of age, the means test for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance takes account of the value of any benefit and privilege enjoyed by a claimant as a result of residing with a parent or step-parent.  The calculation of such value is based on the level of parental net income.  Parental income is calculated as gross income less tax, PRSI, Universal Social Charge, superannuation and union dues.  Rent or mortgage repayments are disregarded, where appropriate and a parental allowance of &euro;600 per week per couple plus &euro;50 per week in respect of other dependent children applies.  The balance is assessed at 34% and this constitutes the weekly value of benefit and privilege.  Once the person concerned reaches 25 years of age, the value of any benefit and privilege will no longer be regarded as means.</p>  <p>  Reduced rates for younger jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance recipients were first introduced in 2009.  Budget 2014 further extended the reduced rates of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance to recipients under 26 years of age.  This is a targeted measure aimed at protecting young people from welfare dependency.  It aims to incentivise young jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance recipients to avail of education and training opportunities.  If a jobseeker in receipt of the reduced jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance rate participates on an education or training programme he or she will receive a higher weekly payment of &euro;160. </p>  <p>  To guard against the development of welfare dependency I believe that it is necessary to provide young jobseekers with a strong financial incentive to engage in education or training or to take up employment.  If they do not improve their skills, it will be much more difficult for them to avail of job opportunities as the economy recovers and they are at risk of becoming long-term unemployed from a young age.  </p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s primary strategy to tackle youth unemployment is through policies to create the environment for a strong economic recovery by promoting competitiveness and productivity.  Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth and the availability of productive employment for young people.  This strategy has been succeeding, with an increase of over 80,000 in employment over the last two years. </p>  <p>  Reflecting the improvement in the labour market, youth unemployment continues to fall.  For example the youth unemployment rate in Ireland as estimated by Eurostat was 21.6% in December 2014 as compared to 30.8% in December 2011.  However, the Government recognises that as the recovery takes hold, there is a need for additional measures to ensure that as many as possible of the jobs created are taken up by jobseekers and young jobseekers in particular.  This is the rationale behind the Government&rsquo;s Pathways to Work strategy and the Youth Guarantee Implementation Plan.</p></reply>

The maximum rate of an IQA for someone over 66 is &euro;206.30, and so in most cases where it is claimed, such couples have additional income or means above their State pension, as otherwise they would obtain a higher payment by the dependent spouse making a claim to the State pension (non-contributory), which is means-tested and has a maximum personal rate of &euro;219 weekly (plus additional allowances, such as the over-80 allowance, where applicable).

The overall aim of the Department is to provide people with the information, financial support and other services that they require in a timely and customer friendly way.  The Department is committed to delivering a high quality customer service to all its customers.<br/><br/>The Department&rsquo;s Customer Charter and Action Plan 2013 - 2015 sets out the level of service customers can expect when dealing with the Department and its commitment to provide a professional, efficient, courteous and timely service to all customers.  The Customer Charter is prominently displayed in all public offices and is also available on the Department&rsquo;s website at .<br/><br/>Under the Civil Service Code of Standards and Behaviour, civil servants are required to deal sympathetically, efficiently and promptly with members of the public.  They are also required to give their names to any member of the public with whom they are dealing, except where given a special exemption, for example, on security grounds.<br/><br/>The Department operates a code of practice for Inspectors which requires Inspectors to identify themselves when interviewing a customer.  Inspectors are also provided with a Certificate of Appointment which includes a photograph and this is shown to customers for identification purposes.<br/><br/>I wish to assure the Deputy that the Department is committed to ensuring that a customer service ethos is embedded in everything it does and is embraced by everyone in the organisation.  While there is no current plan to introduce staff name badges, the Department will continue to consider and implement varied initiatives in order to further enhance the quality of our customer service provision.</p></reply>

These changes included moving the Budget date to October in coordination with other EU Member States.  The Government is always considering initiatives that would improve the budgetary process, particularly in relation to multi-annual planning.  In this context, the Government is also considering the introduction of a Spring Economic Statement, which would incorporate the Stability Programme Update that must be submitted to the European Commission by the end of April each year.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware from my reply to a recent parliamentary question that I am considering a proposal for an independent office that would provide costings of alternative budgets on request from members of the Oireachtas.  At the moment, my Department provides costings in regard to taxation proposals on a confidential basis to assist parties in advance of general elections or budgets.  However, these costings are limited by being provided on a static, individual basis without analysis of the general government implications or potential second round economic effects.</p>  <p>  Various models of this type of service and body already exist internationally, including independent bodies or offices under the aegis of parliaments.  My current thinking is that this should by done by a unit within the ambit of the Oireachtas Commission and that it should then be independent of the Government and the Department of Finance.</p></reply>

For this reason, Revenue debt management caseworkers actively encourage taxpayers or businesses experiencing payment difficulties to engage with them as soon as difficulties start to arise so that solutions can be put in place that restore voluntary timely compliance as quickly as possible without the need to refer the debt for enforcement action.</p>  <p>  However, where a taxpayer or business fails to meaningfully engage with Revenue, then it has no alternative but to refer the outstanding debt for enforcement to protect the Exchequer and to maintain a level playing field  for the vast majority who pay their taxes in full and on time.</p>  <p>  Specifically in regard to referring outstanding tax debts to the Sheriffs, Revenue has confirmed that they (the Sheriffs) are officers of the Court, as provided for by Section 12 of the Court Officers Act, 1945.

However, in doing so a credit union must retain the responsibility of ensuring members' funds are not put at undue risk.</p>  <p>  I am always open to considering proposals in relation to credit unions, particularly those that would see the development of the credit union business model and an increase in income for the sector.</p>  <p>  The Registrar of Credit Unions at the Central Bank is responsible for the regulation of credit unions and as such, any proposal in relation to credit unions would be subject to regulatory approval by the Regulator.</p>  <p>  The Report of the Commission on Credit Unions recommended that the credit union sector be restructured on a voluntary, time-bound and incentivised basis, in order to improve efficiency and maintain the strength and stability of the movement into the future.

The person with the disability must occupy the property as his or her sole or main residence after the adaptation is completed.  Under the Disability Act 2005 disability means &quot;a substantial restriction in the capacity of an individual to carry on a profession, business or occupation in the State or to participate in social or cultural life in the State by reason of an enduring physical, sensory, mental health or intellectual impairment.&quot;<br/><br/>Section 10B of the LPT Act provides that an exemption from the charge to LPT may apply to a residential property purchased, built or adapted to make it suitable for occupation by a permanently and totally incapacitated individual as their sole or main residence, where an award has been made by the Injuries Board (formerly known as the Personal Injuries Assessment Board) or a court, or where a trust has been established, specifically for the benefit of such individuals.  In the case of adaptations to a property, the exemption only applies where the cost of the adaptation work exceeds 25% of the market value of the property before it was adapted.<br/><br/>Entitlement to the exemption provided for in section 10B will depend on whether the extent of a person's disability is such that they are permanently and totally incapacitated from being able to maintain themselves.  &quot;Maintain&quot; in this context means a person's ability to support themselves by earning an income from working.  Total incapacity in this context means that the individual is not capable of earning a living from any kind of work.  The incapacity must also be permanent, that is, there must be no prospect of the individual recovering, or of the condition improving, to the extent that they become capable of maintaining themselves.  I am also advised that whether households, where high level care is provided, qualify for relief under section 15A, or for exemption under section 10B, will depend on the facts and circumstances of each case.<br/><br/>The Deputy may be aware that following representations and a review of the reliefs, I announced on 2 May 2014 that I intend bringing forward legislation amending section 15A to remove the requirement that any adaptation work on the residential property must be grant-aided, or has been approved for grant-aid, by a local authority as one of the qualifying conditions for the tax relief.  I also intend to remove the requirement, by way of legislation amending section 10B, that a permanent and totally incapacitated person must have benefitted from a Court or Injuries Board award or a public trust fund, to qualify for the exemption.<br/><br/>My officials wrote to the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners advising her of my intention to retrospectively amend the legislation.  In view of this, the Chairman has advised me that Revenue will apply the exemption and the tax relief in line with the proposed revised legislation.  The Commissioners have published detailed guidelines which describe how a residential property qualifies for the reduction in market value or the exemption under the new arrangements, and how liable persons should make their application to Revenue.  The Guidelines are available on their website at: .<br/><br/>Under the new arrangements, applications for the reduction in market value should be made on . Applications for the exemption should be made on or, where the application concerns a permanently and totally incapacitated child for whom the Department of Social Protection pay a Domiciliary Care Allowance should be completed.  Applications should be sent to the Revenue Commissioners, LPT Branch, PO Box 1, Limerick.  I am informed that Revenue will examine each application and may seek additional information if considered necessary before determining whether the person is entitled to a reduction in the market value of the property or to the exemption, whichever one is being claimed.<br/><br/>The Commissioners have also advised that no further action is required where a property previously qualified for the reduction in the market value under the LPT legislation and the liable person declared the reduced valuation when filing the 2013 LPT1 Return.  Similarly, no further action is required where a property previously qualified for the exemption and the exemption was claimed when filing the 2013 LPT1 Return.  The reliefs will continue to apply for all years up to 2016, inclusive.<br/><br/>I have no plans at this time for the further extension of exemptions in relation to the above issues.</p></reply>

In this regard, it is no different to money gifted to a child towards a deposit on a house.  Accordingly, the to which the Deputy refers (Guide to the CAT treatment of receipts by children from their parents for their support, maintenance or education) apply to a gift of money to assist with mortgage repayments in the same way as to a gift towards a deposit on a house.  The guidelines are available on the Revenue website.  Therefore, the first &euro;3,000 of such a gift to a child in any year is exempt from CAT under the annual small gifts exemption.  This means that a parent can give a gift to a value of &euro;3,000 to a child (or to anyone else) in each calendar year without any CAT charge arising.  Where relevant, two parents can make gifts to a child to the value of &euro;6,000 in any year free of CAT or could, if they wished, gift &euro;12,000 in total each year to each son or daughter and to their respective partner (e.g. fianc&eacute;e, fianc&eacute;, daughter-in-law, son-in-law) free of CAT.<br/><br/>If gifts in excess of the annual small gifts exemption of &euro;3,000 are taken in any year, there would be no liability to CAT unless the aggregate amount of gifts and inheritances (if any) taken by the child from his or her parents (not counting small annual gifts of up to &euro;3,000 from each parent, which are exempt) exceed the child's life time tax-free threshold of &euro;225,000.  Where the aggregate of the gifts and inheritances received by a child from parents exceeds &euro;225,000, only the excess is charged to tax as demonstrated in Example 1 of the Revenue guidelines.</p></reply>

Petrol stretching involves the illegal addition of a low tax commodity to petrol, and the motive of the criminals who engage in this activity is to profit from the sale of the adulterated petrol, thereby defrauding motorists and the State.  Revenue has received 135 complaints to date, the majority of which originated in Revenue's Border Midland West Region.  The numbers of complaints relating to counties Longford and Westmeath are 3 and 7 respectively.</p>  <p>  Every filling station about which a complaint was made has been visited by Revenue enforcement officers and fuel samples taken from them have been sent for analysis by the State Laboratory. Over 300 samples of petrol from filling stations and other sources have been referred to the State Laboratory.</p>  <p>  The scientific analysis required is complex and time-consuming and the State Laboratory has conducted an extensive series of tests and re-tests on the samples.  Despite this extensive testing, evidence of the presence of prohibited stretching agents has been found in only two samples, both from one location.  The conclusive results received from those tests have resulted in the seizure of the product, and files are being prepared with a view to prosecution.</p>  <p>  Following a series of further tests conducted by the State Laboratory, results were received which indicate the presence of traces of road diesel in several samples taken from a variety of locations.  This could indicate that petrol was contaminated with road diesel at some point in time.  There is no rational economic reason or fraudulent incentive for anyone to mix normal road diesel with petrol.  If the problems that have come to light were caused by unintended contamination as a result of diesel being inadvertently mixed with petrol at some point along the supply chain, there would be no Revenue offence involved.  However, the Revenue Commissioners are investigating vigorously the possibility of tax fraud being associated with the identified problems.  In any instances where the analysis of samples by the State Laboratory indicates the presence of illegal stretching agents in petrol, Revenue will take swift and robust action and pursue prosecutions against  alleged offenders where possible.</p>  <p>  Revenue will also continue to work closely with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and share information and intelligence with them on this issue.</p>  <p>  I am also advised by Revenue that they undertake, on an ongoing basis, an extensive programme of compliance and enforcement actions to ensure adherence to the legal requirements governing the supply and sale of mineral oil and to allow action to be taken against fraud.  This involves, among other things, carrying out analysis of the monthly oil movement returns that oil traders are required to make, and of other supply chain data.  In addition, Revenue officers conduct control or compliance visits to mineral oil traders, during which they examine transport and movement documents and take samples of fuel for analysis.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the Revenue Commissioners are taking all possible action to identify the problem and challenge any instances of identified fuel fraud, including, where possible, pursuing prosecutions against offenders.</p></reply>

The principal developments are set out below:<br/><br/><b>New rules in respect of key management positions</b><br/><br/>Under the Central Bank Reform Act 2010 a new Fitness and Probity Regime came into effect on 1 December 2011 for all regulated financial service providers other than credit unions (whose fitness and probity regime came in on 1 August 2013).  This new regime was fully implemented by 1 December 2012.<br/><br/>47 senior positions are prescribed as Pre-Approval Controlled Functions for regulated financial service providers other than credit unions.  The prior approval of the Central Bank of Ireland is required before an individual can be appointed to a Pre-Approval Controlled Function.<br/><br/><b>Enhanced monitoring and enforcement powers for the Central Bank</b><br/><br/>The Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act, 2013 (the &quot;Act&quot;) was enacted on 11 July 2013 and came into operation on 1 August 2013, with the exception of Section 72.  This Act significantly enhances the capacity of the Central Bank to supervise regulated financial services providers and enforce financial services legislation.  The fitness and probity provisions are reinforced by the whistleblower protections.  The Act also provides for the Central Bank to commission, as part of the proper and effective regulation of financial service providers, an independent expert report at the cost of the financial service provider.  It strengthens the authorised officer regime, enables the Central Bank to secure assurances from auditors of regulated financial service providers.  It also strengthens the enforcement powers of the Central Bank and provides for a substantial increase in monetary penalties. The Central Bank also has the power to suspend or revoke a regulated entity's authorisation following an Inquiry.<br/><br/><b>Client Assets Regulations for investment firms</b><br/><br/>An independent review of the Regulatory Regime for the Safekeeping of Client Assets was published by the Central Bank in 2012 and is available on the Central Bank website.  The Central Bank accepted the specific recommendations contained in this independent review and established a process of implementing all of the necessary changes required.  In 2013 the Central Bank published on its website a Consultation Paper on Client Assets Regulations and Guidance, which will replace the existing client assets requirements (issued in 2007). It is envisaged that the new rules for the Safekeeping of Client Assets will be in place in the first half of this year.<br/><br/><b>Return of Investor Funds Client or Other Client Property Regulations under the Investor Compensation Act 1998</b><br/><br/>This Investor Compensation Act was amended in 2013 (section 33b) to give the Minister for Finance regulation making powers providing for the return of investors' funds or investment instruments following the appointment of an administrator, where the Minister considers it necessary to do so in order to provide for their efficient, equitable and prompt return.  A Working Group, chaired by my Department and also represented by the Central Bank and the Investor Compensation Company Limited, was established in April 2014 to draft such regulations. A public consultation on these draft regulations was held (closed on 23 January 2015). I would anticipate being able to bring forward these regulations in the first half of this year.  They will very much complement the Client Assets Regulations for investment firms.<br/><br/>The Central Bank provides updates on the CHC case  which can be accessed at: .</p></reply>

When inequality in Ireland is looked at in terms of disposable income, in other words what people have in their pockets, Ireland is in very much line with the EU 28 average. This is recognised by TASC in their report.  This reflects, inter alia, the effectiveness of the Irish tax and social welfare system in reducing inequality of market incomes.  This is evidenced by the fact that the tax and social welfare system in Ireland reduces the Gini-coefficient (which is a measure of income inequality) by more than any other country in the OECD. </p>  <p>  While our tax and social welfare system already does much to reduce market income inequality a number of Government policies should help to reduce income inequality over the coming years.  In the most recent Budget, the Government removed 80,000 people from liability to the Universal Social Charge (USC). </p>  <p>  Lowering the tax burden on those lower down the income distribution not only has the effect of helping to further reduce disposable income inequality it also serves to make work pay, rewarding the unemployed who take up employment.  It is well recognised that participation in the labour market is one of the most effective ways to reduce income inequality, especially market income inequality.  In keeping with this, the Government has made a commitment to the unemployed through further education and training programmes such as Momentum and Springboard.  These provide the skills necessary for those currently unemployed to benefit from job creation.</p>  <p>  Beyond these polices the Government has established the Low Pay Commission which will advise the Government annually on the National Minimum Wage earned by those at the bottom of the wage distribution. </p>  <p>  I am confident that the continued pursuit of these Government policies over the coming years will help to promote fairness and combat income inequality.</p></reply>

The Revenue Commissioners advise me that, while there is no reliable estimate of the extent of illegal activity in the fuel sector, they recognise that fuel fraud, including the laundering of markers from rebated fuel, is a significant threat to Exchequer revenues.  Action against this illegal activity is, therefore, a priority for Revenue, which is implementing a comprehensive strategy to tackle the problem.  Key elements of this strategy include the following:</p>  <p> - The licensing regime for auto fuel traders was strengthened with effect from September 2011 to limit the ability of fuel criminals to place laundered fuel on the market.</p>  <p> - A new licensing regime was introduced for marked fuel traders in October 2012, designed to limit the ability of criminals to source marked fuel for laundering.</p>  <p> - New requirements in relation to fuel traders' records of stock movements and fuel deliveries were introduced to ensure that data would be available to support supply chain analysis.</p>  <p> - Following a significant investment in the required IT systems, new supply chain controls were introduced from January 2013.  These controls require all licensed fuel traders, whether dealing in road fuel or marked fuel, to make monthly electronic returns of their fuel transactions to Revenue.  These data are being used to identify suspicious or anomalous transactions and patterns of distribution that will support follow-up enforcement action where necessary.</p>  <p> - Close co-operation, in the framework of the Cross Border Fuel Fraud Enforcement Group, with other enforcement authorities in this jurisdiction and in Northern Ireland in combating the all-island problem of fuel fraud.  This has proven effective in supporting the identification and targeting of the organised crime groups, many with links to paramilitaries and former paramilitaries, which are responsible for the bulk of fuel fraud.</p>  <p> - Following a joint process, Revenue and HM Revenue and Customs have identified a new and more effective product to mark rebated fuels.  The new marker will be produced by Dow Chemical Company and will be introduced in the State and in the UK from the end of March 2015, providing a significant boost in the fight against illegal fuel laundering in both jurisdictions.  In addition, I have introduced a range of legislative measures in recent years to support Revenue's work in fighting fuel fraud, including reckless trading provisions that ensure a mineral oil trader is liable for the mineral oil tax evaded where that trader knew, or was reckless as to whether or not, in making a supply or delivery, he or she was participating in a transaction or series of transactions connected to the evasion of mineral oil tax.  In the Finance Act 2014, I introduced measures to further strengthen Revenue's ability to refuse or revoke a mineral oil trader's licence where the trader does not comply with excise law, does not maintain adequate stock management systems and records, or provides false or misleading information.  Revenue's strategy has yielded significant results.  Since mid-2011, 134 filling stations were closed for breaches of licensing conditions, over 3 million litres of oil have been seized and 31 oil laundries were detected and closed down.  Industry sources indicate a much-reduced incidence of laundered fuel on the market, and road diesel consumption and tax revenues have risen significantly compared with a couple of years ago.  Obviously, other economic factors have contributed to this growth but reduced fraud is also an important factor.  There were four convictions between 2010 and 2014 for offences related to the illegal laundering of markers from fuel.  In addition, there were twelve convictions in that period for offences related to the sale or distribution of laundered fuel, in respect of which the penalties imposed by the Courts included fines amounting to &euro;37,000.  The Revenue Commissioners are not responsible for the collection of fines imposed by the Courts and would not have details about their payment.  The Revenue Commissioners work to ensure also that the tax affairs on any persons found to be involved in the illegal laundering of fuel are subjected to full and rigorous examination, and that monies owed, including interest and penalties where applicable, are recovered.  In relation to the resources allocated to investigate this form of fuel fraud, I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they are a fully integrated tax and customs administration and that it is not possible to disaggregate resources deployed exclusively at any given time on action against fuel laundering.  Revenue currently has approximately 2,000 staff engaged on activities that are dedicated to targeting and confronting non-compliance.  These front-line activities include anti-smuggling and anti-evasion, investigation and prosecution, audit, assurance checks, anti-avoidance, returns compliance and debt collection.  The Revenue Commissioners were subject to the Employment Control Framework staffing reductions imposed since 2009.  Revenue's overall staffing levels have reduced from a total of 6,581 full-time equivalents at the end of 2008 to the current level of 5,661.  Notwithstanding this reduction, Revenue staff resources assigned to compliance activities have been maintained at around 2,000.  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they are committed to ensuring that, despite the staffing reductions, enforcement work generally, and action against fuel fraud specifically, will continue to be resourced to the maximum extent possible.</p></reply>

In order to address the risk of widespread abuse of the scheme, provision was made for certain restrictions on the means by which the auto-diesel concerned may be purchased.  Purchases in bulk must be made from a licensed mineral oil trader, and delivered, in a quantity exceeding 2,000 litres, to a premises or place that is under the control of that qualifying road transport operator. </p>  <p>  Bulk purchases from licensed mineral oil traders can be verified by reference to the monthly electronic returns that the oil traders are required to make to Revenue.  These returns form part of the supply chain controls introduced by Revenue to tackle the problem of illicit fuel, prior to the introduction of the diesel rebate scheme.  The return provides an electronic record of the purchases, stock movements and sales of mineral oil each month by licensed mineral oil traders, by oil product type, including bulk sales to customers exceeding 2000 litres.  This information can be used to verify electronically claims for bulk purchases under the diesel rebate scheme. </p>  <p>  Purchases by means of a fuel card, approved by Revenue for the purpose of the scheme, also qualify for repayment and there is no minimum requirement on purchases made in this way.  A fuel card will be approved where Revenue is satisfied that the fuel card provider will supply it with the information required about purchases of auto-diesel by means of that card.  Fuel cards are widely available and are usable across the road network and there are a number of fuel card providers who can supply suitable fuel cards to road transport operators and fuel retailers.</p>  <p>  As outlined, the scheme is not solely confined to the minimum purchase requirement of 2,000 litres.  Purchases by a qualifying coach operator by means of a fuel card approved by Revenue are not subject to a minimum purchase requirement and allow the coach operator concerned to avoid fuel storage while claiming under the scheme, thereby alleviating the security risks identified. </p>  <p>  The current purchasing arrangements under the scheme are necessary to enable Revenue to manage repayments to qualifying transport operators while controlling the risk of fraud.  I am satisfied that the purchasing arrangements achieve the right balance between making the scheme available to compliant transport operators and allowing Revenue to manage effectively the risk of fraud and I do not plan to change these arrangements.</p></reply>

In recent years this has obviously been very different for Irish banks compared to their counterparts in other European countries.  Funding models also differ between Ireland and other countries.Finally, they pointed out the shortcomings of comparing mortgage rates against short term ECB funding rates given the significant liquidity risk which is a feature of mortgages that typically have a term of 20+ years.<br/><br/>The Deputy will be aware however that I, in my role as Minister for Finance, have no direct function in the relationship between the banks and their customers.

This administrative Scheme's eligibility criteria, including a requirement that any measures are cost beneficial are published on the OPW website, .  It is not available for repair of damaged infrastructure or for maintenance of existing flood defence or coastal protection assets.

The nature of this medical condition has at least one of the following characteristics: acute life threatening physical illness; chronic progressive illness, with well-established potential to reduce life expectancy (in circumstances where there is no medical intervention); major physical trauma ordinarily requiring corrective acute operative surgical treatment; in-patient hospital care of two consecutive weeks or greater. In the case of pregnancy-related or assisted pregnancy-related illness, the requirement for hospitalisation of two consecutive weeks will be reduced to two or more consecutive days of in-patient hospital / clinic care</p>  <p>  The HR Manager will then decide, following consideration of the advice of the occupational health physican, whether to grant extended paid sick leave under the critical illness provisions.  It should also be noted that where there are - in objective terms - exceptional circumstances relating to an illness or injury that warrant the application of the critical illness provisions where the strict medical criteria do not apply, the HR Manager may grant access to extended paid sick leave.</p></reply>

In the area of Education we have sought to protect DEIS expenditure which prioritises the educational needs of children and young people from disadvantaged areas. Furthermore, this prioritisation of expenditure has been pursued against the backdrop of increasing demands on public services due to cyclical economic conditions and demographic factors.</p>  <p>  Last year's Comprehensive Review of Expenditure informed the expenditure measures in Budget 2015. The Review was informed by Government priorities and took into account economic and societal demands. The main objectives of the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure process were to provide Government with the necessary evidence and analysis to re-align spending with the priorities set out in the Programme for Government; meet overall fiscal objectives; and explore new and innovative ways of delivering Government policy in a reformed public sector.</p>  <p>  In the context of the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure, Ministers and their Departments had primary responsibility for delivering a detailed expenditure report based on evaluation of each budgetary programme under their remit, including programmes delivered by Government Agencies. The analysis carried out by Departments drew on a wide-ranging base of evidence developed since the last Comprehensive Review of Expenditure, including previous expenditure evaluations and policy analysis. Naturally, as part of the overall approach to undertaking this analysis Departments considered any relevant obligations leading to expenditure commitments, as deemed appropriate by each Department. </p>  <p>  Overall the Government's approach to implementing the difficult but necessary fiscal adjustment over recent years has ensured that vital public services were protected during challenging economic times. On the back of these efforts, the economic and fiscal position in which Ireland now finds itself is vastly improved, and Budget 2015 provided an opportunity to alleviate pressures and enhance certain key services. The Comprehensive Expenditure Report 2015   2017 and the Revised Estimates for Public Services 2015 protects and provides for expenditure allocations in fundamental policy areas: anticipated Live Register savings from falling unemployment in 2015 have been reinvested to ensure that Ireland's effective system of social transfers is adequately funded in the face of rising demographic pressures; the allocation provided to the Health sector will deliver 1.7 million Medical Cards and a further 0.4 million GP Visit Cards; capital investment of &euro;2.2bn (public and private) on the multi-annual housing programme will lead to an additional 10,000 social housing units by 2018; increased investment in education will allow for an additional 920 mainstream teachers, an additional 480 resource teachers for children with special education needs and 365 Special Needs Assistants; funding is provided for the establishment of the Low Pay Commission.  The overall 2015 expenditure allocations will support the ongoing work of Government in furthering the economic, social and cultural rights of all Irish citizens.</p></reply>

The Equality Tribunal as one of the quasi-judicial bodies of this Department and is operated independently of the Minister and as such the Minister does not interfere in the exercise by that body of its quasi-judicial functions including how it deals with cases. All decisions of the Equality Tribunal may be appealed to the Labour Court or the Circuit Court depending on the legislation. As with all quasi-judicial bodies it is subject to the oversight of the High Court through the system of Judicial Review. Such review is the appropriate channel to seek a remedy for any dissatisfaction a party to a complaint may have with either a decision issued or the processes involved.     The Workplace Relations Bill currently before the Oireachtas is expected to be enacted early this year. On commencement, the Equality Tribunal will cease to exist and all cases on hands and all new cases will be a matter for the Workplace Relations Commission.</p>  <p>  The establishment of the Workplace Relations Commission, replacing the Equality Tribunal as well as the Labour Relations Commission, the Employment Appeals Tribunal and the National Employment Rights Authority will allow greater resources to be applied to processing complaints of discrimination and a quicker and more efficient service is expected.</p></reply>

In general, an employee has no right under employment law to be paid by their employer while on sick leave. Consequently, it is at the discretion of the employer to decide his/her own policy on sick pay and sick leave, subject to the employee&rsquo;s contract or terms of employment.  Under Section 3 of the Terms of Employment (Information) Act 1994, an employer must provide an employee with a written statement of terms of employment within two months of the commencement of the employment.  One of the terms referred to in this Act on which the employer must provide information is any terms or conditions relating to incapacity for work due to sickness or injury and paid sick leave.  The terms of employment should also include a reference to any Collective Agreements that may be in place which may contain a provision regarding sick pay.</p>  <p>  A person my get Illness Benefit from the Department of Social Protection if they cannot work because they are sick or ill and meet the qualifying conditions.

The Regional Action Plans will identify specific measures that can be taken to help each region to realise its economic potential, with a view to increasing the number of people at work in the region.  My objective is that six Regional Action Plans, including one for the Border region, will be launched by July, with two remaining Plans in development at that stage. </p>  <p>  In launching the Action Plan for Jobs: Regional initiative, I announced that new funding of up to &euro;250 million will be made available over the next five years to support job creation through enterprise growth in the regions.  This sum includes &euro;150 million for an IDA property investment programme to attract foreign direct investment into the regions, and &euro;100 million to Enterprise Ireland to support indigenous enterprises to start up, grow and export. </p>  <p>  As part of IDA&rsquo;s capital investment programme, a total of nine locations were identified in the recent announcement as headline investments to occur in the period 2015-2017; these investments include facilities at Sligo and Dundalk within the Border Region. </p>  <p>  IDA regularly assesses property requirements in Regions and has identified locations where quality building and site solutions would enhance the winning of FDI for a region, commencing with identified locations over the next 3-5 year period.  The locations identified provide a good offering to companies seeking to invest, for example- a good population base, the presence of a third   level college, an existing base of FDI and indigenous companies and good transportation links.  </p>  <p>  In addition, it should be noted that the Advance Facilities announced recently represent less than half of the total investment in property solutions as part of the new IDA Strategy.  Significant resources will be invested in utility intensive strategic sites which have a track record of attracting FDI as well as a substantial upgrade of large sections of the existing Business Park network to ensure an attractive suite of investment location options are available to potential investors.</p>  <p>  Consultation with local stakeholders will be an essential part of the process of developing the Regional Action Plans for Jobs.  In this context, officials from my Department and the Enterprise Development Agencies will consult with all relevant bodies who can assist in the development of these Regional Action Plans, including the local Chambers of Commerce. The local Chambers can also play an important role in promoting and delivering actions to support enterprise development and job creation in each region. I look forward to the contribution they can make, throughout the country, to the Regional Action Plans for Jobs.</p></reply>

In this context membership of international research organisations can play an important role in enhancing and supporting the effectiveness and output of Ireland&rsquo;s innovation system.  However, Ireland&rsquo;s membership of international research organisations must be predicated on whether the benefit of membership, in terms of supports to Irish researchers, companies and jobs, justifies the costs involved.  My Department is currently undertaking a review of Ireland's membership of international research organisations.  The review encompasses those international research organisations of which Ireland is currently a member as well as those &ndash; including CERN &ndash; to which we do not subscribe at present.  The extent to which membership might support national strategic objectives will be considered, particularly in the light of the development of a successor strategy to the Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation 2006-2013.  </p>  <p>  Concerning the cost to the Exchequer if Ireland were to join CERN, our current understanding is that the annual cost of full membership of CERN would be in the region of &euro;10m.  CERN also provide an associate membership option.  Normally, the cost of this would start at 25% of the full cost of membership in Year 1, increasing incrementally until reaching the 100% level in Year 4.  </p></reply>

I intend to prioritise their applications under the Targeted Agricultural Modernisation scheme (TAMS), with grant-aid payable at 40%, being introduced under the new RDP.  EU Commission approval is awaited on the proposed schemes under TAMS.  Under Pillar 1 the Regulation provides that young farmers and new entrants are priority categories under the National Reserve. It also provides scope to include an optional provision whereby Member States may use the National Reserve to allocate new entitlements or give a top-up on the value of existing entitlements for persons who suffer from a &lsquo;Specific Disadvantage&rsquo;.  With regard to the group of young farmers who established their holding in 2008 and 2009, but who missed out on both the Young Farmer Installation Scheme which closed to applications in 2008 and the Young Farmer priority category under the National Reserve which includes young farmers who commenced since 2010, I am glad to say that this category can be considered as a &lsquo;group suffering from specific disadvantage&rsquo;.  </p>  <p>  The positive result of this development is that these young farmers will be eligible to apply under the second phase of the National Reserve to be given new entitlements or be given a top-up on the value of existing entitlements.  </p>  <p>  Applications will be made available in early April 2015. This is a very welcome outcome that I   feel will address an anomaly in the system and allow for fair and equal treatment for this particular category of young active farmers.   </p></reply>

Provision is included within that Act for the removal, without a licence, by a public authority of roadside trees that are considered dangerous.  New legislation to replace the 1946 Act, the Forestry Act 2014, was passed in late 2014 and provides for exemptions in certain circumstances from the requirement for a felling licence. These include removal by a planning authority of trees considered dangerous on account of their age, condition or location, and removal by private landowners of trees within 10 metres of a public road which, in the opinion of the owner, are dangerous to persons using the public road on account of their age and condition. It is expected that the provisions of the new Act will be commenced in or around mid 2015.</p></reply>

The Deputy will be aware that there are also a significant number of businesses, particularly restaurants, operating in the Harbour. With that in mind the Department is anxious to increase the profile of the Harbour for the betterment of the wider community. </p>  <p>  To this end, the Harbour regularly approves applications for events, yacht races, local celebrations and various functions etc within the harbour precincts. For example, in July 2014, the Asgard Centennial Celebrations were held at Howth harbour, with the keynote Address delivered by President Higgins. It is estimated that this event alone attracted in excess of 25,000 visitors to the harbour.   </p>  <p>  In addition, the Department approved locating the Howth Tourism Information Office within the confines of Howth Fishery Harbour Centre. This facility opened in July 2014.   </p>  <p>  My Department liaises with all key stakeholders, in particular Fingal County Council, on an ongoing basis in relation to a wide range of harbour activities at Howth and is of course available to meet the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to discuss any matters of mutual interest pertaining to the harbour.</p></reply>

I also established a Trade Team within the Department in order to ensure a strategic , coordinated and proactive approach to identification of export targets and markets and pursuit of market access. I hosted numerous inward visits so that I could demonstrate first hand to our target markets the quality and sustainability of Irish agrifood production. I also appointed agricultural attach&eacute;s to Beijing and Moscow reflecting the importance of the Chinese and Russian markets in our export strategy.  <br/><br/>The list below illustrates the main tangible outcomes to date of these efforts. Of course, it does not include the many agreements on greater cooperation and information exchange which have been concluded on a government to government and business to business basis, which are too numerous to list here but which are a major significance in the development of new markets. Nor does it capture the continuous ongoing engagement that is required to arrive at these concrete results. Overall, I am very pleased with the progress made. The value of Ireland&rsquo;s agrifood exports has grown phenomenally in recent years and they are now valued at over &euro;10.5billion. We have secured access to new lucrative markets in the US, Japan and China and developed and expanded our existing trade. The principal outcomes are as follows:<br/><br/><b>2011</b><br/><br/><b>Turkey</b>: Market opened for beef and live cattle<br/><br/><b>Singapore</b>: Market opened for beef <br/><br/><b>Tunisia:</b>Market opened for live cattle<br/><br/><b>Egypt</b>: Veterinary Certificateagreed for beef and market opened for live cattle<br/><br/><b>Ukraine</b>: Market opened for breeding pigs<br/><br/><b>China</b>: Market opened for breeding pigs<br/><br/><b>Serbia</b>: Certificate agreed for meat products<br/><br/><b>Chile:</b>Certificate agreed for bull semen<br/><br/><b>Canada</b>: Certificate agreed for fresh pig semen<br/><br/><b>UAE</b>: Market opened for bovine semen<br/><br/><b>2012</b><br/><br/><b>Singapore:</b>Veterinary Certificates agreed for sheep meat<br/><br/><b>South Africa:</b>Veterinary Certificates agreed for sheep meat<br/><br/><b>UAE:</b>Veterinary Certificates agreed for sheep meat<br/><br/><b>Morocco and UAE:</b>Veterinary Certificates agreed for poultry meat and poultry meat products<br/><br/><b>China:</b>Agreement secured on exports of boarfish<br/><br/><b>Iran:</b>Market opened for beef<br/><br/><b>UAE:</b>Removal of age restriction on beef exports<br/><br/><b>China:</b>Agreement secured on export of horse feed<br/><br/><b>China:</b>Agreement secured on export of porcine semen and export certificate agreed<br/><br/><b>China:</b>Agreement secured on export of horses direct to China<br/><br/><b>Hong Kong:</b>Health certificate agreed for export of fishery products<br/><br/><b>Serbia</b>: Veterinary certificate agreed for fresh/frozen pigmeat<br/><br/><b>2013</b><br/><br/><b>US: </b>Initial positive steps taken to reopen the market to beef<br/><br/><b>Japan:</b>Market opened to beef<br/><br/><b>UAE:</b>Market opened for sheep-meat<br/><br/><b>Libya:</b>Market opened for livestock<br/><br/><b>Australia:</b>Market opened for pig-meat<br/><br/><b>Iran:</b>Market opened for beef<br/><br/><b>GCC:</b>Ban lifted for beef and sheep-meat<br/><br/><b>Canada:</b>Market opened for Sheep-meat.<br/><br/><b>China:</b>Market opened for Salmon<br/><br/><b>Russia:</b>Access permitted for meat products previously excluded.<br/><br/><b>Azerbaijan</b>: Agreement on veterinary health certificate for finished meat products<br/><br/><b>2014</b><br/><br/><b>Lebanon</b>: Agreement on export of meat/meat products of bovine origin<br/><br/><b>Lebanon</b>: Agreement on export of meat/meat products of ovine origin<br/><br/><b>Lebanon</b>: Agreement on export of cooked meat/meat products of bovine and ovine origin<br/><br/><b>Hong Kong</b>: Agreement on veterinary health certificate for the export of sheep-meat<br/><br/><b>Namibia</b>: Agreement on veterinary health certificate for fresh/frozen meat of bovine, ovine and caprine origin<br/><br/><b>Philippines</b>: Agreement on veterinary health certificate for the export of beef<br/><br/><b>Philippines:</b>Agreement on veterinary health certificate for the export of sheepmeat<br/><br/><b>Philippines</b>: Agreement on veterinary health certificate for the export of pigmeat<br/><br/><b>Vietnam</b>: Agreement reached on the export of pigmeat<br/><br/><b>New Caledonia</b>: Adoption of veterinary health certificate for the export of fresh meat and meat products of bovine origin<br/><br/><b>2015 (to date)</b><br/><br/><b>US:</b>Market opened to Irish beef<br/><br/><b>China:</b>Market opened to Irish beef</p></reply>

The payment due under the 2014 Disadvantaged Areas' Scheme was not affected by the over-declaration referred to above. This payment under this scheme issued to the nominated bank account of the person named on 9 January 2015. </p>  <p>  A review of the outcome of this inspection identified the need for the verification of the position on the ground by means of a field visit.

The basis for these inspections is governed by EU legislation and there are certain minimum numbers and types of inspections that must be conducted each year. Details of these inspections and the regulations involved are published in the Terms and Conditions of the Schemes which are sent to every applicant annually.  These inspections are a necessary requirement in order to draw down approximately &euro;1.5 billion of EU funds annually and to avoid EU disallowances. The inspections are subject to repeated audits by the European Commission, the European Court of Auditors and the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s Office and this ensures an independent verification that inspections are conducted in full compliance with the legal requirements. In abiding with the findings of these audits my Department ensures that these inspections are conducted in a fair and equitable manner and in full accordance with the legislative provisions. Furthermore inspecting officers are very experienced and are regularly trained to ensure that they carry out inspections in a professional manner, with a process of continuous oversight by supervisors and random verification of inspections to ensure a fair and consistent approach. Also when conducting inspections standardised inspection report forms and guidance documentation are provided to the inspecting officers, with the inspection outcome being recorded on the relevant schemes&rsquo; IT system. This approach ensures that both the quality and consistency of inspections are maintained at extremely high levels.</p>  <p>  A comprehensive appeal mechanism is in place in order to protect the interests of farmers who have difficulties with the inspection findings or who consider that the inspection has not been conducted in accordance with legislative requirements. This appeal system incorporates the option for a farmer to initially seek to have the inspection outcome reviewed internally by an officer more senior than the inspecting officer. Where the farmer remains dissatisfied, the decision can be appealed to the independent Agriculture Appeals Office and ultimately to the Office of the Ombudsman.</p></reply>

Accordingly, the detailed information sought by the Deputy for the years 2007 to 2009 is not available.  I am, however, advised by INIS that in 2009, an estimated 368 entry visas were granted for the purpose of joining Irish spouses or partners.  For the reason outlined above, a further breakdown of these figures is not possible, including the number of refusals.  In 2010, 539 Irish entry visas were granted for the purpose of joining Irish spouses or partners and 76 were refused.</p>  <p>  The total number of refusals of Irish entry visa applications for the period 2011 to 2014, made for the purpose of joining Irish spouses or partners, was 495.  A breakdown of the number of applications granted and refused in each of these years was provided to the Deputy in reply to her question of 20 January, 2015.</p>  <p>  Applications for visas for family reunification are refused for a range of reasons such as insufficient documentation furnished by the applicant or in some cases suspected fraudulent documents.  In addition, visas are refused because of the financial capacity of the Irish national sponsor. Indeed in many cases there can be a combination of these and other reasons for refusal.  Accordingly, it is not possible to provide the breakdown sought by the Deputy without the examination of the file of each individual application which would require the expenditure of an inordinate amount of staff time and resources being diverted away from processing of applications which could not be justified.</p>  <p>  The Department's Policy Document on Non-EEA Family Reunification, referred to by the Deputy, was published in December 2013 and came into force on 1st January 2014.  In that year, a total of 760 entry visas were granted for the purpose of joining an Irish spouse or partner. The policy document specifically recognises ministerial discretion indicating that such discretion applies to most of the decision making in the area of family reunification as covered by the policy document.  It is more a question of the policy document providing greater detail on how that discretion is intended to be applied.  Accordingly, the visa deciding officer considers the full circumstances of each case which are fully taken into account in deciding each application.  In addition, appeals of decisions are considered by a different officer of my Department who is generally at a more senior level.</p></reply>

An application fee of &euro;175 is payable on application for a certificate of naturalisation and a fee is payable by applicants on the issue of a certificate of naturalisation.  The standard certification fee is &euro;950, while a reduced fee of &euro;200 applies in the case of an application made on behalf of a minor or in certain cases where the application is made by a widow, widower or surviving civil partner of an Irish citizen.  In the case of refugees and stateless persons the certification fee is nil.  The certification fees were last changed in 2008.</p>  <p>  The standard fees payable by an applicant are designed to reflect the effort and cost involved in processing applications for a certificate of naturalisation.  Every application must be assessed to establish if the statutory requirements are met.  It is notable that the volume of applications for -a certificate of naturalisation increased by over 50% in 2011, and increased further in 2012. The Deputy will be aware that following the grant of citizenship it is no longer necessary for the person concerned to register their presence in the State with the Garda National Immigration Bureau which requires the payment of a fee of &euro;300 per registration. I do not accept that the fees related to naturalisation are a barrier to migrants in the State becoming Irish citizens. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware formal citizenship ceremonies have been introduced at no extra cost to applicants. These have been universally well received by participants as the ceremonies provide a sense of dignity and occasion that serves to underscore the importance to both the State and the applicant of the granting of Irish citizenship.  Democratic participation by citizens is a cornerstone of our representative democracy and a leaflet informing new citizens of their right to register and vote in all elections in the State and how to register is included in the ceremony packs issued to candidates for citizenship. </p>  <p>  All of the fees payable under the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956 are kept under ongoing review by my Department.</p></reply>

The Strategy is founded on a partnership approach with Government Departments, Agencies and the Community and Voluntary sectors working collectively to tackle the problem.<br/><br/>The Strategy is being led out under the stewardship of my colleague<font color="#0000FF"> </font>the Minister for Health Mr. Leo Varadkar T.D<font color="#0000FF">.</font>who chairs the Oversight Forum on Drugs under which the implementation of the Strategy is monitored. <br/><br/>My Department and its agencies continue to progress the actions assigned to the criminal justice sector under the National Strategy and to actively participate in all of the structures in place under the Strategy, including for example, the Oversight Forum, the National Advisory Committee on Drugs and Alcohol and the National Co-ordinating Committee on Drugs and Alcohol Task Forces.<br/><br/>Of course, that Strategy will now fall to be reviewed and Minister Vardakar was recently in contact with me to flag the development of  the  National Drugs Strategy post 2016 in respect of which planning has already begun in the Department of Health. <br/><br/>My Department also actively contributes to relevant international drugs policy fora, in partnership with the Departments of Health and Foreign Affairs and Trade,  including the EU Horizontal Working Party on Drugs and the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs<font color="#0000FF">.</font><br/><br/><font color="#0000FF">  </font>I can  assure the Deputy that I meet on a regular basis with the Garda Commissioner concerning law enforcement matters generally which would  include drugs related issues. Just last December, I met with the Garda Commissioner , other senior Garda officers and senior officials from my Department and relevant agencies to further develop responses to particular concerns regarding drug dealing and anti-social behaviour manifesting in the Dublin city centre area. <br/><br/>In addition, drug law enforcement remains a key priority area for the Government and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. This is clearly reflected in the Programme for Government commitments and  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Policing Plan for 2015 which highlights a strong focus in combating serious crime in all its forms. <br/><br/>The Deputy will appreciate that drugs related issues feature prominently across the criminal justice policy areas for which I have responsibility whether it is in the context of crime policy, penal policy, prison and probation initiatives, youth diversion initiatives  etc. <br/><br/>Given the extent to which this issue permeates the work of my Department detailing the resources including staff resources associated with that work is not without its difficulty.  Having said that, details of drug related expenditure incurred by national authorities is collated for EU data collection purposes on an annual basis. Within that framework, expenditure by this Department in 2014 was estimated to be &euro;18.5m. This included funding in areas such as the community based addiction projects supported by the Probation Service, Garda Youth Diversion Projects and the criminal justice related costs associated with the Drug Treatment Court and the National Drug Related Deaths Index. </p></reply>

The Deputy will appreciate that I do not have a direct role in Garda operational matters.   I am, however, assured by  the Garda authorities that all incidents where persons have been reported missing remain open and under investigation until such times as the person is located.   I am further advised that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has strong formal and informal relationships with the UK authorities which assists in such investigations.  More broadly, the services of Interpol can be utilised, providing An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with a formal network of communication involving 190 international police forces.</p>  <p>  In so far as the general Garda Missing Persons Protocols are concerned, when a missing report is made, the Garda authorities complete a risk assessment on PULSE asking specific question about the person&rsquo;s disappearance resulting in a specific level of risk being assigned to the investigation ( i.e. High, Medium or Low risk).</p>  <p>  A Garda assessment of a missing person as &lsquo;High Risk&rsquo; indicates the person is in danger due to their own vulnerability and/or that they may have been a victim of crime.  An Inspector is required to oversee such cases and all available Garda resources are deployed including the establishment of an incident room, deployment of a Senior Investigating Officer, appointment of a Detective Sergeant and other resources deemed appropriate such as a Search Manager, Family Liaison Officer, Juvenile Liaison Officer or Ethnic Liaison Officer. High risk cases are reviewed regularly and actions taken are based on the presumption that the case may escalate.  District Officers (Superintendents) have responsibility for reviewing the incident including the initial risk assessment, quality assuring any actions taken and checking for outstanding and incomplete actions. </p>  <p>  All available opportunities to disseminate information regarding missing persons cases are availed of, including through media organisations, and the Garda Community Text Alert scheme.  In addition, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has put in place Child Rescue Ireland (CRI) Alert, a rapid information dissemination process, which enables the Garda&iacute; seek the assistance of members of the public in circumstances where a child has been abducted and there is a reasonable belief that there is an immediate and serious risk to the health or welfare of a child. </p>  <p>  I am further advised that that the Garda Missing Person Guidance Manual, which was introduced in May 2012, will be subject to a Garda review process later this year.

As previously notified to the Deputy, responsibility for the processing of asylum and subsidiary protection applications rests with the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner (ORAC).</p>  <p>  The Commissioner has informed me that the median processing time for asylum applications is 21 weeks for cases determined to date in 2015.  This is due to the substantial increase in asylum applications recorded in 2014 and to date in 2015.</p>  <p>  As regards the processing of subsidiary protection applications generally the Deputy will be aware that responsibility for processing such applications transferred in November, 2013 to the Refugee Applications Commissioner under the European Union (Subsidiary Protection) Regulations 2013. The Commissioner announced in March 2014 that he is according priority to certain classes of applications for subsidiary protection. The legal basis for the prioritisation of applications is set out in the 2013 Regulations. Prioritisation relates solely to the scheduling of interviews and has no implications for any recommendation that might be made by the Commissioner. The classes of applications to be prioritised includes those cases longest in the system and those prioritised based on country of origin. The UNHCR as part of its mandate in relation to international protection has provided advice in relation to the prioritisation of applications.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that the time taken to process a protection application to finality can be prolonged by the lodging by applicants of appeals with the Refugee Appeals Tribunal against determinations made by ORAC or the taking of judicial review proceedings against decisions made at various stages of the protection determination process.</p></reply>

A child can only be received into the care of the Child and Family Agency where there are welfare or protection concerns and, as part of this process, care plans are devised. These care plans may, in certain instances, refer to additional supports required by the child&rsquo;s family.</p>  <p>  Homelessness as part of a family group is not, in of itself, a basis for seeking to receive a child into care. Furthermore, there is no statutory basis for the preparation of care plans for families with children entering emergency accommodation. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government recently issued a Ministerial Direction to the four Dublin local authorities and to certain other housing authorities prioritising homeless households and other vulnerable groups (including young people leaving State care) for housing in their respective areas for a six-month period. This measure should reduce the number of homeless persons including families in emergency accommodation.</p>  <p>  The December 2014 Action Plan to Address Homelessness includes a commitment for the Child and Family Agency and Dublin City Council to coordinate operations to ensure that services are fully responsive to the particular protection and welfare needs that might arise for families in emergency accommodation.</p>  <p>  The Child and Family Agency has advised me that they have had meetings with Focus Ireland, the Department of Social Protection and Dublin City Council in relation to vulnerable families and issues facing care leavers. The Agency intends to create a multi-agency protocol to be clear about individual agency and multi-agency responsibilities with regard to homelessness and work on this will commence shortly.</p>  <p>  In cases where there are welfare or protection concerns in relation to children in families presenting as homeless, the reporting of such concerns to the Child and Family Agency is governed by Children First: National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children [2011].</p></reply>

This funding ensures that more than 100,000 children have access to quality child care each year.  This high level of support, which is in addition to the support provided to all parents in the form of Child Benefit, has been maintained despite the difficult budgetary situation that prevailed in recent years. </p>  <p>  I wish to point out to the Deputy that, while the annual spend on child care related programmes has been in the region of 0.2 per cent of GDP in recent years, this expenditure does not include expenditure under other programmes or by other Departments and therefore does not represent the full extent of State expenditure. Ireland spends over 0.4% of GDP relative to the OECD average of 0.7%.</p>  <p>  It is clear that accessibility, affordability and high quality child care can play a critical role in achieving a number of Government priorities, including improving educational outcomes for children, reducing poverty and increasing parents' participation in the labour market.  To ensure that all the benefits of child care investments are fully realised, future public investment in child care must be evidence-based and strategically coordinated. I am establishing an Inter-Departmental Group to look at the provision right across the 0 to 6 age group as well as to consider the after-school needs of older school-going children. It is crucial that we develop a coherent whole-of-Government approach to investment in child care services.</p>  <p>  This new Group will include representatives of the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Social Protection, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Department of Finance and the Department of the Taoiseach and will be led and supported by my Department.

Part of the resources made available to support the ECS was redirected to provide for the free preschool provision, introduced under the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme.</p>  <p>  The ECCE programme represents an annual investment of almost &euro;175 million and provides free preschool care and education to approximately 68,000 children each year.  This funding has been maintained despite the difficult budgetary position that has prevailed over the last four years. The introduction of a second preschool year would require considerable additional funding, broadly in line with the cost of the current one-year provision and this additional funding is not presently available due to the financial constraints under which the Government is operating.  </p>  <p>  I will be looking at the question of appropriate supports for child care in a wider context.

To help address the issue of child care costs, in the region of &euro;260 million is provided annually by my Department to support a number of child care programmes.  More than 100,000 children benefit from this investment each year.  These programmes are in addition to the support provided to all parents in the form of Child Benefit.   </p>  <p>  The programmes include the free preschool year provided under the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme. In the region of 68,000 children benefit each year from the programme at a cost of &euro;2,375 per child.  The Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme provides funding to community child care services to support disadvantaged or low income families.    In the case of full day care, parents can have up to &euro;95 per week deducted from the overall charge. In the region of 25,000 children each year benefit from the CCS programme.  Further child care support is provided under a number of labour activation measures which support parents returning to the work force or availing of education or training opportunities. Increased capitation and subvention payments under the support programmes could reduce the cost to parents and I have indicated that if resources become available, I will review the scope for increasing the level of payments.   </p>  <p>  The question of tax allowances for working parents was considered prior to the introduction of the support programmes.  A number of issues emerged at that time which did not favour the introduction of tax relief for child care.  For example, the introduction of tax credits would not help to support quality improvements within the child care sector and would not help those families on low pay who may not have any tax liability.  There is also concern that the application of tax credits could lead to increased prices and therefore have limited impact in terms of savings to parents. </p>  <p>  I want to look at the question of appropriate supports for child care in a wider context. It is crucial that we develop a coherent whole-of-Government approach to investment in child care services.

In September 2014 officials from my Department and the Child and Family Agency met with the National Carers' Association to discuss the role of the Department and the Agency in relation to the National Carers' Strategy. </p>  <p>  The  Child and Family Agency Act 2013 brings together a range of existing services for children and families to one agency.  As of 1st January 2014, the Child and Family Agency is  responsible for the former Family Support Agency, the National Educational Welfare Board and also for the functions of Child and Family services previously provided by the HSE.   The Agency's functions  include maintaining and developing services in order to support and promote the development, welfare  and protection of children and to support effective functioning of families. In so doing  the Agency will promote enhanced interagency cooperation  to ensure that services  are coordinated on the principle of the best interest of all children and their families.</p>  <p>  The Educational Welfare Service (EWS) of the Child and Family Agency is in the process of refining and implementing a new strategic approach to service delivery through an integrated model of service committed to the principle of &ldquo;One Child, One Team, One Plan&rdquo;. The EWS of the Child and Family Agency is developing national guidelines as a practical support for schools in the preparation of School Attendance Strategies as outlined in Section 22 of the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000. The guidelines will assist schools to implement effective measures to support children at risk of poor attendance and participation, including those with caring responsibilities. It is anticipated that the guidelines will be completed before the beginning of the 2015/16 academic year. </p>  <p>  In order to learn more about children that undertake caring roles, my Department requested the Central Statistics Office to help to identify the extent to which children have caring responsibilities.    The Census of Population 2011 found that 6,449 children, or 5.6 per 1,000 children provided regular unpaid personal help for a friend or family member with a long-term illness, health problems or disability.  Rates ranged from 4.3 per 1,000 in Co. Louth to 8.2 per 1000 in Co. Leitrim.  Under the National Strategy for Research and Data on Children&rsquo;s Lives (2011-2016) analysis of those figures in the 2011 Census will help to inform future policy as to how best to address the support needs of children and young people who undertake caring roles. This analysis will be published in 2015.</p>  <p>  A National Youth Strategy is also being developed by my Department.  It will be a universal strategy for all young people aged 10 to 24 years. It will have a particular focus on those who are most disadvantaged or at risk and who have the poorest outcomes and therefore in most need of support. The consultation process in the development of this strategy has included a number of major stakeholder consultation events and I am pleased that representatives of the Carers Association participated in these consultations.  </p></reply>

These programmes are in addition to the support provided to all parents in the form of Child Benefit.</p>  <p>  Increased capitation and subvention payments under the child care support programmes could reduce the cost to parents, and support child care services to meet the overall costs of child care provision. I have indicated that if resources become available, I will review the scope for increasing the level of payments.  </p>  <p>  I will be looking at the question of appropriate supports for child care in a wider context. It is crucial that we develop a coherent whole-of-Government approach to investment in child care services.  To ensure that all the benefits of our full range of child care investments are fully realised, future public investment in child care must be evidence-based and strategically coordinated.  I have established an Inter-departmental Group to look at the provision right across the 0 to 6 age group as well as to consider the after-school needs of older school-going children.  I have asked the Group to report to me by the Summer. </p></reply>

The funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 380,000 young people and involve approximately, 1,400 youth work staff in 477 projects and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country.  In 2014, funding of &euro;49.78m was provided to my Department for these schemes.<br/><br/>The funding allocated by my Department in respect of the schemes indicated in the Deputy's question is set out in the table, below.<table><tr><th>Scheme</th><th>2014</th></tr><tr><td>Youth Service Grant Scheme </td><td>&euro;9.949m </td></tr><tr><td>Special Projects for Youth </td><td>&euro;14.4m </td></tr><tr><td>Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund (Round 1 and 2) </td><td>&euro;18.397m </td></tr><tr><td>Local Youth Club Grant Scheme</td><td>&euro;1.035m </td></tr><tr><td>Youth Information Centres </td><td>&euro;1.234m </td></tr><tr><td>Local Drug Task Force projects </td><td>&euro;1.151m </td></tr></table><br/><br/>In addition, in 2014 a capital allocation of &euro;500,000 was made available to fund small capital projects in the youth services.  Some 50 local youth projects received grants under the scheme.<br/><br/>Details of the youth organisations and youth projects throughout the country that received funding under each of the schemes are being compiled and will be forwarded to the Deputy.<br/><br/>My Department is developing a National Youth Strategy. The new strategy will be based on Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures, the National Policy Framework for Children and Young People. It will be a universal strategy for all young people aged 10 to 24 years. It will have a particular focus on those who are most disadvantaged or at risk and who have the poorest outcomes and therefore in most need of support.<br/><br/>A consultation on the new strategy is underway at present. It includes consultation on the priorities for the new strategy and the findings of the recently completed Value for Money and Policy Review of Youth Programmes that target disadvantaged young people.  The review makes recommendations for the future operation of youth funding schemes and their development in the years ahead to ensure effective, evidence based value for money programmes designed to ensure the  optimal outcomes for young people who are at risk of disadvantage and in need of additional support. It is my intention that the recommendations in the review will be progressed over 2015 and 2016 in the context of the new Youth Strategy.  <br/><br/>The consultation on the new National Youth Strategy will run to the end of this month and I anticipate that the strategy will be completed promptly thereafter. </p></reply>

The Department of Justice and Equality has primary responsibility in the area of asylum and immigration.<br/><br/>The Deputy may be aware that a report &lsquo;<i>Review of the operation of the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002&rsquo;,</i>was submitted by the former Ombudsman for Children, Ms Emily Logan to the then Minister for Children and Youth Affairs in March 2012. One of the recommendations contained in that report was that <i>&ldquo;&hellip; section 11(1) (e) should be amended to clarify that the exclusion regarding the administration of law in the area of asylum, immigration, naturalisation or citizenship relates solely to decisions taken by the relevant authorities in accordance with statutory procedures for determining whether a person is entitled to a particular status.&rdquo; </i>My Department engaged with the Department of Justice and Equality on this recommendation, among others.  The then Minister for Justice and Equality considered that no legislative change was required and this position has been reaffirmed by that Department.<br/><br/>In a reply to a question by Deputy Brendan Griffin  (Reference No. 31092/14 on 15th July 2014), the Minister for Justice and Equality addressed, among other issues, the question of the Ombudsman for Children being given jurisdiction in the direct provision system and for the Health Information Quality Authority (HIQA) to be allowed inspect direct provision hostels.  In replying, the Minister made reference to provisions in both the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002 and Ombudsman Act 1980 which excludes either Ombudsman from investigating any action taken by or on behalf of a person in the administration of law relating to, inter alia, asylum.  If I may quote from Minister Fitzgerald's response, she said &quot;<i>Whilst there are no plans to change those legislative provisions, the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) including RIA, has administrative arrangements in place with both Offices to assist and provide information on matters brought to its attention by them</i>&quot;.<br/><br/>The Department of Justice and Equality has established a working group to review a range of issues pertaining to asylum seekers and direct provision.  The first meeting of the Working Group on the Protection Process was held on the 10th November 2014, chaired by Judge Bryan McMahon. The Working Group consists of children's rights advocates, organisations engaged with asylum groups and representatives from a range of relevant government departments, including a representative from my own Department. I look forward to learning of the findings and recommendations of the working group in the Spring of 2015. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-02-24a.660.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015022400068#WRO02100"><p>Aftercare is a term used to describe the planning and support put in place to meet the needs of a young person who is leaving statutory care at 18 years of age, to assist him/her in making the transition to independent living.  It is essential that all young people leaving care are provided with the type of transitional support that their individual situation requires. Aftercare is available to all those eligible irrespective of previous care placement, for example, foster care or residential care.</p>  <p>  The Child Care Act 1991 provides that the core eligible age range for aftercare is from 18 years up to 21 years.  This can be extended until the completion of a course of education and training in which a young person who has left care, or is leaving care, is engaged, up to the age of 23 years.</p>  <p>  Section 45 of the Child Care Act 1991 provides that the Child and Family Agency may assist a child leaving its care if it is satisfied that the person has a &ldquo;need for assistance&rdquo;. The provisions have been interpreted and applied on the basis that young people who have had a care history with the Agency are entitled to an assessment of need, from which an aftercare plan may be prepared and an aftercare service may be offered (based on the assessed needs).</p>  <p>  Current aftercare provision incorporates advice, guidance and practical (including accommodation and financial) support.  Advocating on behalf of young people to support their development as fulfilled adults in their community and, when necessary, to link them to targeted adult services, are also crucial elements of an aftercare service.</p>  <p>  Between 450 and 500 young people leave care annually upon turning 18.  According to the Child and Family Agency, at the end of September, 2014 there were 1,698 young people aged 18 to 23 years (inclusive) in receipt of an aftercare service.  Of those, 946 (56 %) were in full time education.  </p>  <p>  A significant number of these young people are supported financially to remain living with their foster carers, in addition to having access to an aftercare worker.  The most vulnerable group of children are those leaving residential care or short term foster care placements.  Children, who come into care late, in their mid to late teens, may not have developed the relationships with staff or aftercare workers that help them achieve good outcomes.  </p>  <p>  Young people who do not have family support from a foster carer or family base are assisted in finding accommodation in supported lodgings, sheltered housing or independent accommodation and encouraged and supported financially in furthering their training and education.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, as the Deputy is aware, it has been decided to strengthen the legislative provisions regarding aftercare.  This is in response to concerns that there was insufficient focus in this area and that such planning was not taking place on a properly structured and consistent basis.  The approach adopted is to impose a statutory duty on the Child and Family Agency to prepare an aftercare plan for an eligible child or eligible young person.  The aim is to create an explicit, as opposed to implicit, statement of the Agency&rsquo;s duty to satisfy itself as to the child&rsquo;s or young person&rsquo;s need for assistance by preparing a plan that identifies those needs for aftercare supports.</p>  <p>  It is anticipated that the Aftercare Bill will be published in the early part of 2015.</p></reply>

One of the recommendations was that a single national anti-bullying website is to be developed to provide information for parents, young people, youth workers, sporting and cultural associations and school staff on types and methods of bullying and how to deal with bullying behaviour. This is now being considered as part of the implementation plan for Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures.<br/><br/><b>Cyberbullying</b><br/><br/>The Minister of Communications established an Internet Content Governance Advisory Group under the chair of Dr. Brian O&rsquo;Neil in December 2013 to ensure our national policy represents best practice in offering the same online protections to our citizens as those available in the offline world.<br/><br/>The Group&rsquo;s report was approved by Cabinet and published in May 2104 and makes several recommendations aimed at protecting children and young people without unduly limiting their opportunities and rights online.  Along with changes to institutional, administrative and legal structures, the report makes four specific recommendations on cyberbullying aimed at providing stronger supports for tackling this issue through primary and post-primary curricula, and additional training and awareness measures.<br/><br/>In Ireland Safer Internet Day is promoted by the PDST Technology in Education and Webwise.ie.

We have contact with the Ombudsman for Children in the context of our relationship with that Office under the governing legislation.<br/><br/><i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures: the National Policy Framework for Children and Young People 2014-2020</i>is a document for the whole of government and indeed the whole of society. The <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures</i>Advisory Council was established in November 2014 and includes representatives from key groups working in the areas of Early Years, Children and Youth, as well as independent experts and individuals nominated by myself. The Advisory Council ensures that the expertise and perspectives from the areas informs the implementation of<i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures. </i><br/><br/>The Advisory Council provides a platform for the community and voluntary sector to support the implementation of <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures, </i>and to connect with the other implementation structures.  As the community and voluntary sector connects with and mobilises communities, families and individuals, and are an essential partner to ensuring the successful implementation <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures </i>and securing better outcomes from children and young people.<br/><br/>Children and Young People&rsquo;s Services Committees (CYPSCs), previously known as Children's Services Committees (CSCs), are an initiative of my Department bringing together a diverse group of agencies in local county areas to engage in joint planning of services for children and are firmly embedded in <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures.</i>as an important vehicle for local interagency work.  All major organisations and agencies working locally on behalf of children and young people up to the age of 24 are represented on CYPSCs.  These committees work to improve the lives of children, young people and families at local and community level through integrated planning and improved service delivery.  Communications are directed through a National Coordinator reporting to my Department and through a National Steering Group which will be reconstituted in the first quarter of 2015 with support and representation from my Department.<br/><br/>My Department works closely with the youth sector interests in developing key initiatives such as the National Youth Strategy 2014-20. The National Youth Work Advisory Committee, whose members include representatives of the national youth organisations, Government departments and the Education and Training Boards, that support youth services at local level, has an important advisory role to me in matters to do with provision for young people. In September 2014 I met with the representatives of some 30 national and major regional youth organisations to see how we can work together within resources available to ensure that programmes and services being provided are relevant and responsive to young people&rsquo;s needs. <br/><br/>In the development of the Children First legislation, a number of roundtable meetings were held with key stakeholders to brief them on the provisions of the Bill. Further consultations with stakeholders will be undertaken in the context of the passage of the Children First legislation through the Houses of the Oireachtas. <br/><br/>My Department works with a wide range of non-government organisations in the development of policy and practice on children and young people&rsquo;s participation in decision-making. A National Strategy on the Participation of Children and Young People in Decision Making is currently being developed. <br/><br/>Some specific topics involve contacts with particular groups. For example,<br/><br/>- the Children's Rights Alliance in relation to policy matters arising under the United Nation Convention on the Rights of the Child  - specifically the Third Optional Protocol to the UNCRC on a Communications Procedure;<br/><br/>-the ISPCC in relation to the Missing Children's Hotline which is now funded by DCYA;<br/><br/>-Barnardos in relation to the provision of Guardian Ad Litem services under the Child Care Act 1991;<br/><br/>-The Children&rsquo;s Research Network for Ireland and Northern Ireland, established in 2010 to support the research community to better understand and improve the lives of children and young people, by creating and maintaining an inclusive, independent, non-profit network through which information, knowledge, experience, learning and skills can be shared.<br/><br/>The Children Detention Schools (CDS) have a service level agreement with certain organisations. Empowering People in Care (EPIC) provide advice, support and individual advocacy services to children and young people in care, those preparing to leave care and those in aftercare. The Youth Advocate Programmes (YAP) organisation build partnerships between vulnerable young people, their families and communities to support their full potential through a community based, strengths focused, intensive support to selected young persons for up to six months on their discharge to aid their re-integration into their community where the child doesn't have other adequate supports in place.<br/><br/>The Early Years Policy Unit in my Department has ongoing interaction on a range of child care related issues with the 31 City and County Childcare Committees and the 7 National Voluntary Childcare organisations that represent child care providers and also advocate in relation to child care issues.  The voluntary organisations include Barnardos, Early Childhood Ireland, Childminding Ireland, Border Counties Childcare Network, St. Nicholas Montessori, Irish Steiner Waldorf Organisation and Forbairt Na&iacute;onra&iacute; Teoranta.<br/><br/>Contacts with any other organisations not mentioned above can take place during the year, either at my request or in response to requests from the organisations concerned.</p></reply>

Such liaison with various voluntary support bodies across the spectrum of activity of my Department embraces the ongoing issues and challenges nationwide, including in Co. Kildare.<br/><br/>The Deputy will be aware that Children and Young People&rsquo;s Services Committees (CYPSCs), which were previously known as Children&rsquo;s Services Committees (CSCs), are an initiative of my Department bringing together a diverse group of agencies in local county areas to engage in joint planning of services for children and are firmly embedded in <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures: the national policy framework for children and young people 2014-2020</i>as an important vehicle for local interagency work.  All major organisations and agencies working locally on behalf of children and young people up to the age of 24 are represented on CYPSCs.  These committees work to improve the lives of children, young people and families at local and community level through integrated planning and improved service delivery. <br/><br/>The inaugural meeting of the Kildare Children and Young People's Services Committee took place in June 2010.  Communications are directed through a National Coordinator reporting to my Department and through a National Steering Group which will be reconstituted in the first quarter of 2015 with support and representation from my Department.</p></reply>

Targeted supports for disadvantaged, marginalised and at risk young people are provided through the Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund, Rounds 1 and 2,   Local Drugs Task Force Projects and certain other programmes including the Local Youth Club Grant Scheme and Youth Information Centres.  The funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 380,000 young people and involve approximately, 1,400 youth work staff in 477 projects and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country.  In 2015, funding of &euro;49.9m has been provided to my Department for these schemes. There has been no reduction in the overall allocation for youth services in 2015 which was a key priority for youth organisations.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that my Department is developing a National Youth Strategy. The National Youth Strategy will focus on the youth-related policy commitments outlined in Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures, the National Policy Framework for Children and Young People. It will be a universal strategy for all young people aged 10 to 24. It will have a particular focus on those who are most disadvantaged or at risk and who have the poorest outcomes and therefore in most need of support.</p>  <p>  A National Youth Strategy Task Group, convened by my Department, is overseeing the development of the new Strategy. This Task Group comprises statutory youth interests and voluntary agencies and organisations working with young people.</p>  <p>  I am keen that all stakeholders have a role to play in the development of the new National Youth Strategy and a comprehensive consultation process is underway at present. It includes online surveys of young people and those working with young people and a number of major stakeholder consultation events. These events are for young people, the youth sector, NGOs working for and with young people, Education and Training Boards, Government departments, agencies, business and academia and other youth interests. The consultation provides key stakeholders with the opportunity to reflect on the emerging priorities, to discuss the actions that will be required to achieve the Strategy&rsquo;s goals and their own roles in implementing the actions to secure improved outcomes for young people. The events include consultation on the priorities for the new Strategy and the findings of the recently completed Value for Money and Policy Review of Youth Programmes that target disadvantaged young people. The review makes recommendations for the future operation of youth funding schemes and their development in the years ahead to ensure effective, evidence based programmes designed to secure the optimal outcomes for young people at risk of disadvantage and their communities. </p>  <p>  The National Youth Strategy will provide a framework for actions initiated by Government Departments, statutory and non-statutory organisations into a co-ordinated, society-wide plan for young people. Key priority areas will be underpinned by realistic and achievable actions tied to specific outcomes and measurable indicators.  The consultation on the new National Youth Strategy concludes at the end of this month and I anticipate that the Strategy will be completed promptly thereafter.</p></reply>

It comprises services for the protection and welfare of children, fostering and residential care services, family support, inspection of early years services and services relating to domestic, sexual and gender based violence.   In relation to receiving children into care this can be by a voluntary agreement with parents or guardians, or through a care order that is granted by the Courts .  The majority of children who are in care are in foster care with other placements being used where this is assessed as not being suitable for their needs.  This can include residential care, special care or other placements (including supported lodging or disability placements).  As of October 2014 there were 6,454 children in care, of which 93% were in foster care, 5% were in residential care and the remaining 2% were in other placements.  There is statutory provision for support and supervision of children in care; latest figures show that the majority of children in care had an allocated social worker and written care plan.  In exceptional cases where an allocated social worker is not in place, the case is monitored at principal social worker level and managed by the duty social work team.  It is important to note that urgent cases where a child is at imminent risk are acted upon immediately.  </p>  <p>  In relation to children for whom particular needs have been identified, it is important to state that children in care attend the same schools and services as other children in the community.  This means that if a child in care needs a psychology assessment it would be accessed through the National Educational Psychology Service (NEPS) or through the community  psychology service in primary care in the first instance depending on the particular need.  These needs would be set out in the child's written care plan.  Some residential care service have access to dedicated professionals.  For example, children in special care attend school on-site and therapeutic services provided by the Assessment, Consultation and Therapy Service (ACTS).  </p>  <p>  The Agency has a budget of &euro;643 million for 2015, an increase of &euro;34 million on 2014.  I am satisfied that the work of the Agency is being well monitored by my Department and that the Agency has prepared a comprehensive business plan that aims to ensure that all children in care receive the supports and service they require.</p></reply>

As provided for in the Framework, the Department of Social Protection is the lead department on child poverty and has lead responsibility for the commitment to lift over 70,000 children out of consistent poverty by 2020, a reduction of at least two-thirds on the 2011 level.  The Department of Social Protection also has lead responsibility for the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion.  The outcomes of the recent European Commission/ Departmental of Social Protection / Department of Children and Youth Affairs national seminar will inform the development of an implementation plan for tackling child poverty.<br/><br/>My Department is working on a number of initiatives which are relevant in addressing issues related to children poverty. My Department is leading the implementation of the Area Based Childhood (ABC) Programme (2013-2016).  The ABC Programme is being co-funded by Atlantic Philanthropies and will have a total funding allocation of up to &euro;29.7 million.  The ABC Programme draws on best international practice to break the cycle of child poverty where it is most deeply entrenched, and improve the outcomes for children and young people and existing services.<br/><br/>My Department is spending &euro;260 million annually on childcare support programmes which provide childcare to 100,000 children. A number of these programmes are targeted at those on lowest incomes.  We know from experience of other countries that investment in quality early childhood care and education is important in breaking the inter-generational cycle of poverty. <br/><br/>I have established an Inter-departmental Group to look at the provision right across the 0 to 6 age group as well as to consider the after-school needs of older school-going children.  The Group&rsquo;s work involves, inter alia, identifying policy objectives to guide investment in contributing towards improvements in social inclusion and poverty reduction.  It is crucial that we develop a coherent whole-of-Government approach to investment in childcare services.<b></b>I have asked that this work be carried out within a relatively short time frame and I expect that the Group will be in a position to report me in the Summer.<br/><br/>My Department also provides targeted support for disadvantaged, marginalised and at risk young people are provided through the Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young People's Facilities and Services Fund, and Local Drugs Task Force projects.In addition, some 31 national and major regional youth work organisations are supported under my Department's Youth Service Grant Scheme.  Other grant schemes include the Local Youth Club Grant Scheme and Youth Information Centres.  In 2015, current funding of &euro;49.93m will be provided to my Department for these schemes.  </p></reply>

As the Deputy has noted, detailed opinions on the proposed measures were received from a number of Member States. Ireland&rsquo;s response to these opinions was submitted to the Commission on 26 January 2015. The Commission has not issued any comment on the matter.

In relation to the Standardised Packaging legislation, the legislation is being prepared by the Department of Health and not by the HSE. </p>  <p>  The HSE has informed me that its contracting model for legal services came into effect in 2011 following a competitive tender process.  The HSE&rsquo;s model for legal services involves in excess of thirty law firms delivering services through four geographical panels; each panel representing a HSE Administrative Area. The law firms on these panels deliver advices and services across a broad range of areas, reflecting the breath of services and activities of the HSE. Arthur Cox Solicitors act as the service manager for the contract and provide the HSE with corporate legal advice. The HSE should be informed of any direct conflicts of interest that exist between it and other clients of service providers. The HSE indicated that they were not notified by Arthur Cox in relation to JTI, and that it is making enquiries with Arthur Cox regarding any potential conflicts of interest in this regard as a matter of urgency.</p></reply>

It is critical, therefore, that the development of a full range of mental health services, including those for young people, reflects modern national and international practice to best meet evolving challenges within our society.  This Government has always recognised the need to bring about the fundamental changes necessary to mental health care, and I think that this is generally acknowledged across the mental health sector.<br/><br/>In line with the Programme for Government, and notwithstanding severe economic constraints, we have prioritised modernisation of mental health services in line with the widely agreed policy document <i>A Vision for Change.</i>This year, the total HSE budget for mental health is in the region of &euro;790 million. We have, since 2012, provided an additional &euro;125 million, including around 1,150 new posts to develop the mental health care programme. Approximately 235 of these posts were focused towards the Child and  Adolescent area. The large majority of these have been filled, and the remainder are going through normal recruitment processes.<br/><br/>At the start of this year, there were<b></b>54 operational child and adolescent beds<b></b>available to the HSE. Overall, the HSE are targeting to increase its operational capacity to 74 such beds nationally by the end of 2015. It should be noted that difficulties with re-opening some existing beds at local level, already resourced in the system, primarily relates to securing or retaining staff, rather than a question of funding. The question of providing new bed capacity beyond this year can only be realistically considered in the light of evolving annual service priorities and resource availability.<br/><br/>A key element in relation to the issue raise by the Deputy is the recent decision by the HSE to re-focus its various operational initiatives across the mental health spectrum to achieve improvement in mental health services for young people in 2015. This includes clearly indicated, and agreed, priority actions to enhance performance in this area. I can assure the House that I, and the Department of Health, will continue to liaise closely with the HSE over the remainder of the year to ensure that evolving challenges are met to the greatest extent possible.</p></reply>

It is important to note that the actions in the Roadmap for Implementation are those that can be achieved on a cost neutral basis.<br/><br/>The National Carers' Strategy committed to the production of an Annual Report on progress which would be published on the websites of relevant Departments.  The first Annual Report on implementation of the Strategy was published in November 2013 and the second in January 2015, both of which are available on my Department's website.  These Annual Reports will provide the Deputy with a list of actions that were identified in the Strategy and what progress has been made on each one since the Strategy&rsquo;s publication.<br/><br/>Steps have been taken to improve liaison with carers' representatives and to establish clearer lines of accountability.  The Department of Health and the Health Service Executive met with carers' representatives at the Annual Carers' forum hosted by the Department of Social Protection today.<br/><br/>The Department of Social Protection has responsibility for the main funding schemes for carers; the Carer's Allowance, Carer's Benefit, Respite Care Grant and the Domiciliary Care Allowance.  Further details of these schemes are available on their website . </p></reply>

Health care professionals should proactively encourage patients at all stages to involve their family and/or carer in the development of these plans.</p>  <p>  I also accept, however, that patient confidentiality is important and should not be compromised, where in some limited cases, patients specifically request that contact not be made with families and/or carers.  For the benefit of the patient, every effort must be made to encourage him or her to involve family and/or carers, but it is equally important to recognise that breaching this confidence against the patient&rsquo;s wishes, can damage the health professional /patient relationship.  It should be noted however that the Medical Council's Ethical Guide does specifically allow a doctor to ethically breach confidentiality if, for example, he/she believes that the patient is at risk of harming himself/herself or others.</p>  <p>  An Expert Group which I set up to review the Mental Health Act 2001 has recently completed its work and has presented its final report to me for consideration.  The Group examined a range of issues, including the one mentioned by the Deputy.  I intend to publish the Expert Group review early next month.</p></reply>

The additional funding provided for mental health is being used, in part to ensure that at a minimum, at least one of each mental health professional discipline is represented on all of those teams.  This has involved the recruitment of a significant number of multidisciplinary health professionals since 2012 to strengthen this service.<br/><br/>In line with the Programme for Government, my priority as Minister has been to modernise our mental health services, notwithstanding the severe resource constraints overall in recent years, and to prioritise new resources to underpin implementation of <i>A Vision for Change.</i>In that regard, the Government has provided an additional &euro;125 million and some 1,150 posts for mental health comprising &euro;35m with 416 posts in 2012, &euro;35m with 477 posts in 2013, &euro;20m for the recruitment of approximately 250 posts in 2014 and a further &euro;35 million in 2015.  The funding is being used to continue to strengthen Community Mental Health Teams for both adults and children, to enhance specialist community mental health services for older people with a mental illness, those with an intellectual disability and mental illness, forensic mental health services, and to enhance access to counselling and psychotherapy in primary care and investment in suicide prevention measures.<br/><br/>At end December 2014, of the 416 approved posts in 2012, approximately 95% (397) are now filled. Of the 477 approved posts in 2013, 78% (367) are filled.  The remainder of vacant posts are at various stages of recruitment, with some difficulties in identifying outstanding candidates, primarily for geographic and qualification reasons.  Therefore, approximately 86% of combined posts over 2012-13 have taken up duty. Recruitment for 225 approved allocated posts for 2014 has commenced with 4 having agreed start dates and a further 5 posts have been accepted.  The remaining approved posts are to be recruited in early 2015.</p></reply>

It is based on a co-ordinated approach across many Government Departments and Agencies in conjunction with the Community and Voluntary sectors and I intend that this approach will continue.<br/><br/>Periodic reviews of progress across the five pillars of the Strategy are carried out through the Oversight Forum on Drugs which I chair.  <br/><br/>A progress report on each of the 63 Actions of the National Drugs Strategy is prepared each year and posted on my Department's website at <i>www.health.gov.ie</i>.  The draft report for 2014 is still under consideration by the Oversight Forum on Drugs.

During the course of this Government HIQA&rsquo;s function has been extended to residential services for those with disabilities and child protection services. </p>  <p>  As regulator, HIQA&rsquo;s remit operates at the level of facilities rather than that of individual complaints, but the requirements at facility level impact very directly on how individual cases are dealt with.</p>  <p>  All nursing homes are required to have an accessible and effective complaints procedure, including an appeals process.  They must investigate all complaints promptly, and following investigation put in place any measures required for improvement.  Records of complaints made are required to be kept. These are available for inspection, thus enabling the HIQA inspector to determine whether the complaints system is sufficiently robust. </p>  <p>  HIQA takes into account and uses all information received to inform and plan its regulatory activity, and information on individual cases can provide useful pointers in this context.  HIQA&rsquo;s programme of both scheduled and unannounced inspections helps to ensure that standards are maintained and where issues of non-compliance arise, that these are addressed and rectified.  If a nursing home is found not to be in compliance with the Regulations it may either fail to achieve or lose its registration status.  HIQA also has wide discretion in deciding whether to impose conditions of registration on nursing homes.</p>  <p>  My Department, in consultation with both HIQA and the service providers, is working on an ongoing basis to improve and update the requirements that apply to nursing home care.  Any request from HIQA for an extension of their remit on the lines suggested by the Deputy will be carefully considered.</p></reply>

It should be noted that the nature of orthodontic care means that immediate treatment is not always desirable. It is estimated that in up to 5% of cases it is necessary to wait for further growth to take place before treatment commences.  Patients are assessed by the HSE Orthodontic Service under the modified Index of Treatment Need. Patients with the greatest level of need, i.e. Grade 5 or some with a Grade 4 are provided with treatment by the HSE. <br/><br/>Information on waiting times is collated by the HSE by region and for the intervals as shown below only. The information is not collated by age. In general, those waiting over 4 years would be expected to be 16 years or over since they are usually referred at 12-13 years of age approximately. <br/><br/>The information on waiting times for treatment for Quarter 4 of 2014 is as follows:<table><tr><th>Waiting time from assessment to commencement of treatment</th><th>1-6 months</th><th>7-12 months</th><th>13-24 months</th><th>25-36 months</th><th>37-48 months</th><th>Over 48 months</th><th>TOTAL</th></tr><tr><td>HSE Dublin Mid-Leinster</td><td>972</td><td>998</td><td>1,313</td><td>867</td><td>448</td><td>156</td><td>4,754</td></tr><tr><td>HSE Dublin North East</td><td>283</td><td>477</td><td>1,020</td><td>842</td><td>504</td><td>637</td><td>3,763</td></tr><tr><td>HSE South</td><td>812</td><td>632</td><td>703</td><td>888</td><td>599</td><td>24</td><td>3,658</td></tr><tr><td>HSE West</td><td>1,133</td><td>1,131</td><td>1,894</td><td>1,096</td><td>112</td><td>60</td><td>5,426</td></tr><tr><td>TOTAL</td><td>3,200</td><td>3,238</td><td>4,930</td><td>3,693</td><td>1,663</td><td>877</td><td>17,601</td></tr></table><br/><br/>The HSE has established a pilot scheme in Dublin North East which will involve the use of orthodontic therapists in the treatment of a number of eligible children. In addition to the services provided by HSE staff, orthodontic treatment for certain categories of misalignment will be provided by a panel of independent practitioners under contract to the HSE over the next three years. A national procurement process is being finalised. This initiative will especially focus on those waiting for 4 years or longer. It is expected that this initiative will commence later this year and will have a positive impact on waiting times.</p></reply>

HIQA takes into account and uses all information received to inform and plan its regulatory activity and information on individual cases can provide useful pointers in this context.  If there is a serious risk to the health and welfare of service users, the Authority may decide to take appropriate action in relation to that service.</p>  <p>  All nursing homes are required to have an accessible and effective complaints procedure, including an appeals process.

In the meantime, monthly payments have continued to be made by the Health Service Executive to 4,700 people who were in receipt of the Mobility Allowance at the time that the scheme closed.</p>  <p>  Work is ongoing on the policy proposals to be brought to Government for the drafting of primary legislation for a new scheme.  Once policy proposals have been finalised and approved by Government, the time frame for the introduction of a new scheme will become clearer.</p></reply>

Depending on contract type, a consultant may have no access to private practice (Type A contract holders), a cap of 20% private activity for newly appointed consultants (Type B) or a cap of up to 30% in the case of certain existing consultants. </p>  <p>  The level of fees charged by a consultant who sees a patient privately is a matter between the consultant and the patient.  The fees arising may be met personally by the patient concerned, by the patient's health insurer, or a combination of the two depending on the extent, if any, to which the patient has insurance cover for the service provided.  I have no authorisation to set or adjust the fees that consultants charge in their private capacity.</p>  <p>  Significant steps have been taken to make savings from hospital consultants pay in recent years.  The salary scales for new entrant consultants' were reduced by 10% with effect from 1 January 2011.  A further reduction of 30% was applied to these scales for those interviewed for posts on or after 1 October 2012.  However, this later reduction has been restored to a significant degree, pursuant to a related recommendation by the MacCraith Group.  In addition, on 1 July 2013 consultants' pay was reduced in line with the provisions of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2013. </p>  <p>  An essential component of the approach to addressing the State&rsquo;s fiscal difficulties has been the firm focus on improving public service efficiency and effectiveness.  Consultants have been subject to changes in work practices under the Public Service Agreement and the HRA.  These include the range of flexibilities agreed at the LRC in September 2012 to enhance productivity and efficiency and the additional hours under the HRA.  I have no plans to reduce consultant pay any further.</p></reply>

An additional &euro;4m was allocated in 2014 to assist in implementing the Programme, equating to approximately 80 additional therapy posts.  Further investment of &euro;4 million will also be made to support the development of therapy services in 2015 (equating to &euro;6 million in a full year).  Close collaboration between the health and education sectors on children's disability issues is greatly facilitated by the dedicated Cross Sectoral Team, which is in place, comprising representatives of the Departments of Health, Education and Skills, and Children and Youth Affairs and the HSE, NCSE and NEPS.<br/><br/>My Department has asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy in respect of the detailed operational issues that she has raised concerning health needs encompassing therapy supports and assessments for pre-school children with a disability or development delay.  If you have not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days please contact my Private Office and they will follow up the matter with them.</p></reply>

The change from the application of a rigid employment control framework, with its particular focus on a moratorium on recruitment and compliance with employment ceilings and targets, to one operating strictly within allocated pay frameworks will allow for recruitment where it is determined that this can achieve more economical service delivery.

The HSE issued a memorandum in October 2014 to management on measures to reduce agency usage and costs across the HSE and HSE funded acute hospital services.  It provides for the replacement of NCHD and Consultant agency with fixed term contracts of employment, and limits reliance on doctors employed on an agency basis.

Unfortunately it was one of two locations which did not complete the planning process within the timeframe for inclusion in the PPP project; the other was Knocklyon/Rathfarnham.  There is limited funding available for new construction projects over the next multiannual period 2015-2019 given the level of commitments and the costs to completion already in place. In addition, the HSE cannot exceed or plan to exceed its commitment thresholds.  It is essential that all projects, other than those where existing contractual commitments are in place, are assessed on their merits to ensure that the limited capital funding available goes to those developments which address the greatest service need.

I have also condemned other appalling acts of violence being perpetrated in Nigeria and its neighbouring countries by Boko Haram.  These include the killing in January of a large number of civilians in an attack by militants in the north-eastern state of Borno, and the more recent attacks in Chad, Cameroon and Niger.I have given my full support to the clear demands of the United Nations Secretary General and the High Representative of the European Union that the girls abducted in Chibok be released and that those responsible be brought to justice.  I am deeply disappointed that hopes that the girls would be released as a part of ceasefire discussions last October were not realised.   The EU as well as several individual EU Member States, the UN and the USA, continue to assist the Nigerian authorities in strengthening their ability to provide security and to combat terrorism.  The EU Foreign Affairs Council, which I attended in Brussels on 9 February, noted that the responsibility to address the immediate security challenge in the region lies primarily with the countries most affected, and called upon them to urgently intensify cooperation and coordination.  We welcomed the decision of the States in the region, endorsed by the African Union, to deploy a multinational force to combat Boko Haram, and this is now being established.</p>  <p>  The Council also expressed concern about the humanitarian consequences of the Boko Haram attacks and pledged to continue providing immediate relief to those in need and to increase supports at regional level.  Ireland provided &euro;1 million in December 2014 to the UNHCR to assist and support Nigerian refugees in Chad.</p>  <p>  Our Embassy in Abuja, working locally in cooperation with the EU and other key partners, remains in close contact with the Nigerian authorities on all issues related to the Boko Haram insurgency, including the appalling abduction of the schoolgirls.</p></reply>

From my first day in office, I have taken a strong interest, and an active role, in this case and indeed in my first week in office I spoke to Egyptian Foreign Minister Shoukry setting out my concerns.I have spoken to FM Shoukry on a number of further occasions, stressing that the individual was only 17 at the time of the alleged offences and asking for the case to be reviewed, so that he may be released and can return to his studies and his family.  I have also raised the matter with HRVP Mogherini who assured me of the ongoing assistance which the EU institutions can provide.   I have met this individual&rsquo;s family on a number of occasions, most recently on 12 February.</p>  <p>  We are monitoring all developments closely.  This is a difficult case involving a foreign legal system and the judicial processes of another state in which we cannot interfere.  However, I wish to assure the deputy of my ongoing commitment to the welfare of this young Irish citizen.  I wish also to assure the deputy that officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, both in Dublin and in Cairo, are in ongoing contact with this individual and his family, and with the Egyptian authorities, and will continue to work actively towards the achievement of a positive outcome to this case and will continue to offer full consular support to this Irish citizen.</p></reply>

It is apparent that tensions are growing and the country is suffering an increasing degree of political polarisation.  As I have indicated before, the deaths, casualties and detentions arising from the unrest there require full, impartial investigation in accordance with due legal process.  The apparently high levels of impunity in the case of serious crimes is a matter of further concern as is, indeed, the serious economic situation affecting the people of Venezuela.I share the concerns expressed by EU High Representative Mogherini, and those expressed previously by High Representative Ashton, concerning the detention of political figures and of students.  Human rights, including the freedom of expression, of assembly and of association must be protected and upheld.  I renew my call for all parties, including government, opposition, students and civil society, to work together to find a consensus for overcoming Venezuela&rsquo;s current difficulties.   I remain of the view that the best hope for progress in Venezuela, and for the successful conduct of the forthcoming elections, is for an inclusive dialogue that will address, through peaceful means alone, the legitimate concerns of all parties.</p></reply>

These outline plans are currently being developed and the public are being consulted for their views.My colleague, the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Heather Humphreys T.D., who has lead responsibility for the 1916 commemoration, has tasked a team from her Department to have meetings in all parts of the country to engage with people on how Easter 1916 is most appropriately commemorated. The Government has not issued any invitations to the United Kingdom or other international partners for events in Ireland to commemorate Easter 1916.  Clearly, some of the 2016 events will be moments for national commemoration, as may be the case for the Easter Sunday programme on the 27<sup>th</sup>March and the actual centenary of the start of the Rising on 24<sup>th</sup>April.  There may also be events, at home and abroad, where it would be appropriate to invite our international partners, at a suitable level, to join with us to reflect on the events of 1916 and to mark this key moment on Ireland&rsquo;s path to independence and place amongst the nations of the world.<br/><br/>This will be considered further by the Government following the publication of the Government&rsquo;s programme for Ireland 2016 in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-02-24a.1076.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1055" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015022400077#WRX00500"><p>Together with the Taoiseach, I launched the Government&rsquo;s review of Foreign Policy <i>The Global Island: Ireland&rsquo;s Foreign Policy for a Changing World </i>on 13 January 2015 at the conference organized by my Department on &ldquo;Representing the Global Island&rdquo;<i>. </i>The purpose of the review was to provide a progressive and forward looking statement of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy written in clear and accessible language.  The document includes features which communicate simply and effectively what is delivered across Government to achieve Ireland's foreign policy goals.<br/><br/>As I outlined in my foreword to the review, through our foreign policy we safeguard our peace, security and economic prosperity, and promote reconciliation and cooperation at home.  At the core of this foreign policy are the protection of our citizens and the promotion of our values abroad.  <i>The Global Island </i>considers the challenges and opportunities for Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy under five interconnected themes: Our People, Our Values, Our Prosperity, Our Place in Europe and Our Influence. <br/><br/><i>The Global Island</i>is the result of a wide-ranging process of consultation involving other Departments, State agencies, the Oireachtas, civil society and members of the public.  In the coming months, I will elaborate on a series of initiatives that I intend to bring forward to implement the vision and goals set out in the review.<br/><br/>As highlighted in <i>The Global Island</i>, the commitment of Ireland to the promotion and protection of human rights is an underlying principle of Ireland's foreign policy and is a priority for the Government.  We are also committed to open and constructive dialogue with Irish civil society on human rights issues, which is a highly valued and crucial aspect of the formulation of our international human rights advocacy.<br/><br/>The changing global environment poses new challenges and threats to human rights, which are under considerable pressure today.  In <i>The Global Island</i>, the Government has reaffirmed its commitment to the universality, indivisibility and interrelationship of all human rights in order to respond to this challenge.  As stated in the review, an Inter-Departmental Committee on Human Rights will be established, chaired by a Minister of State, in order to improve the coherence of the promotion and protection of human rights in our foreign policy.<br/><br/>In addressing human rights concerns, we must<font color="#004080"> </font>pursue them in the most effective way, taking advantage of the most appropriate opportunities to make our case, privately or publicly, bilaterally or multilaterally, as best fits the situation.  A primary approach is to engage with the international human rights machinery which has been established to monitor implementation of universal human rights standards.  As a small state with a limited diplomatic network, Ireland places great value on multilateralism as a platform for raising human rights issue.  This includes engaging actively at the UN Human Rights Council and in the Universal Periodic Review, the principal UN mechanism whereby the human rights record of each individual UN Member State is publicly examined by other Member States.<br/><br/>In addition to raising human rights concerns through multilateral channels, Ireland also raises human rights issues in our bilateral contacts.  The conversations are generally conducted on a confidential basis, in line with normal diplomatic practice.  I discuss human rights issues on a regular basis with Foreign Ministers from other countries, including when visiting foreign countries.  I also regularly address human rights issues at Ministerial meetings at the EU level with Foreign Ministers of third countries.<br/><br/>Officials in my Department<font color="#004080"> </font>make Ireland's views on human rights issues clear in their contacts with officials from other governments.  Irish embassies work, within the capacity of their resources and often as part of a coordinated approach, to support the work of human rights defenders and civil society organisations in third countries.  This includes addressing legislative and administrative restrictions on the operation of human rights defenders, drawing on findings by human rights agencies, raising cases with third country governments and contributing to the development of human rights country strategies by the EU.<br/><br/>The promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms is not confined to our international human rights advocacy.  Ireland's new policy on international development, 'One World One Future', reaffirms the centrality of human rights to Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy and aid programme, and commits to ensuring that human rights principles and standards are promoted, protected and integrated in all of our development efforts.  Irish Aid, Ireland's overseas development programme, addresses the root causes of poverty and exclusion by focussing on the most vulnerable and investing in state institutions and independent organisations that promote human rights, governance, and democracy in developing countries, particularly in its nine Key Partner Countries across Africa and Asia.<br/><br/>No country is perfect when it comes to human rights<font color="#004080">.  </font>Ireland&rsquo;s position on the responsibility of each government in relation to the promotion and protection of the human rights of their citizens is quite clear, and none of the countries with which we deal are in any doubt about our views in this regard.</p></reply>

Our policy on International Development, "One World, One Future", reaffirms our commitment to achieving the UN target of providing 0.7% of Gross National Product (GNP) for Official Development Assistance (ODA), when economic circumstances permit.  </p>  <p>  Over the past four years, despite the very difficult economic circumstances facing the country, the Government has successfully managed to stabilise allocations to Ireland's aid programme.  For 2015, we were again determined to protect the aid programme, and have provided a total allocation of just over &euro;600 million in Official Development Assistance, a small increase on 2014.</p>  <p>  This clearly demonstrates our commitment to the aid programme and represents a very significant contribution on behalf of the people of Ireland to assist those less fortunate than ourselves.  As our economic recovery consolidates and strengthens, I am determined to set out the strongest possible case for building further on our current commitment to the aid programme.</p>  <p>  Our priority now is to ensure we continue to focus on tackling the root causes of poverty and injustice, strengthening our key partner countries ability to deliver essential services to their citizens, and delivering real and sustainable improvements to the lives of some of the world&rsquo;s poorest people and communities.</p></reply>

It expresses a desirability of determining appeals and resolving grievances in the school concerned. <br/><br/>  Section 29 of the Act sets out a limited set of circumstances a parent can appeal administrative decisions of a school.  These are confined to expulsions, suspensions or refusal to enroll.  The Government has approved the drafting of the Admissions to School Bill 2014 in which the extent to which refusal to enroll will or will not be subject to a Section 29 appeal will be addressed.<br/><br/>  I am not satisfied with the current provisions of Section 28.  I plan to revise it in order to provide in law for a Parent and Student Charter.  Changing how schools engage with, listen and respond to parent concerns will be an important part of a Charter.  Providing parents with the rationale for any decision is important.  If schools help parents to understand the basis for a decision parents are more likely to accept the fairness of decisions.<br/><br/>  The Teaching Council is the body with statutory authority, under the Teaching Council Act 2001, for the professional regulation of teachers.  I intend to amend the Teaching Council Act to strengthen the legislative architecture for the Council's fitness to teach function and Garda vetting.<br/><br/>  Part 5 of the Teaching Council Act 2001 makes provision for the Council to conduct inquiries into a teacher's Fitness to Teach.  I intend to commence Part 5 later this year. Government approval was given on 10th December for drafting The Teaching Council (Amendment) Bill to provide for a wider range of sanctions such as advice, admonishment and censure, which may be applied by the Council following an inquiry.<br/><br/>  Procedures were introduced in 2009 under the Education Act (Section 24) for schools and Education and Training Boards (then VECs), as employers, to address teacher competence issues.  Generally speaking it will be necessary for these procedures to be exhausted before investigation by the Teaching Council under Part 5.<br/><br/>Once the relevant sections are commenced, the Council will investigate complaints against teachers through a number of phases, up to and including holding a hearing. The staged process ensures that the investigation is robust and that the rights of all parties, including teachers, to a fair hearing and due process is respected. <br/><br/>  This process will also allow for measures to be put in place to support those teachers who need help to bring their professional practice up to the high standards expected as well as for sanctions such as suspension or deregistration should the situation require it. <br/><br/>  However, it is important to note that the Council's fitness to teach processes will not replace the procedures that are already in place in schools to deal with issues of professional conduct and competence.  Underperformance or misconduct should be dealt with first at school level and these procedures exhausted before any inquiry by the Teaching Council would take place.  It would be expected that most cases should conclude at the level of the school.</p></reply>

These secondments are subject to annual review.  The arrangements provide flexibility and ensure that the in-service needs of teachers and other support priorities of the school system can be met within the resources available. <br/><br/>  Having teachers with relevant and recent teaching experience and expertise is a key requirement for the role.  It is a condition therefore that the maximum length of time that a teacher may be on secondment is five years, following which they return to their teaching roles within their schools.  In this way, their expertise and knowledge is not lost to the system. <br/><br/>  The support services have engaged in succession planning as a key strategy in ensuring continued support for teachers and school leaders in implementing national education policy priorities and CPD and which allows for continuity, quality planning and management. <br/><br/>  Therefore there are no plans to change the policy of the five year limit.</p></reply>

The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September.  The staffing arrangements also include an appeals mechanism for schools to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeals Board.  The Primary Staffing Appeals Board operates independently of the Minister and the Department and its decision is final.  The staffing arrangements for the 2015/2016 school year are set out in Circular 0005/2015 which is available on the Department website.<br/><br/>At primary level the staffing schedule operates in a clear and transparent manner and treats all similar types of schools equally irrespective of location.  The configuration of classes and the deployment of classroom teachers are done at local school level.  The primary staffing schedule currently operates on the basis of a general average of 1 classroom teacher for every 28 pupils, with lower thresholds for DEIS Band 1 schools. <br/><br/>  My Department's guidance to schools is that the number of pupils in any class is kept as low as possible taking all relevant contextual factors into account (e.g. classroom accommodation, fluctuating enrolment etc.).  School authorities are also requested, where possible, to use their autonomy under the staffing schedule to implement smaller class sizes for junior classes. <br/><br/>  The Government's approach to restoring the economy has helped Ireland to return to a position where we are seeing economic growth.  It is a continuing improvement in our economic growth over a sustained period that will enable us to move to a point where we can look again at providing for additional teacher resources in schools which could bring about an improvement in PTR, class size and support for classroom teachers.<br/><br/>  In the meantime, my Department's focus is on targeting any available resources to cater for the continued increase in student numbers.  In this regard, there were a thousand more teachers employed in schools around the country in the last school year, than there was the year before.  There will be a further increase of circa 1,300 teachers in the current school year. </p></reply>

These improvements particularly recognise the challenges faced by very small schools that are more than 8km from the next nearest school of the same type.<br/><br/>  This package of measures will provide rural communities with security about the future of their small schools, recognising the essential social function which small schools can play, especially in isolated communities.</p></reply>

It also involves other supports such as educational psychological services and guidance and counselling services, and the interface with other agencies, both nationally and locally.  Schools also engage in a wide range of sport and cultural co-curricular activities which provide an important opportunity for students to experience success and personal growth. <br/><br/>  Social Personal and Health Education (SPHE) is a mandatory part of the curriculum in primary schools and in junior cycle since 2003 and is designed to promote positive mental health.  It is supported by comprehensive teacher guidelines and curriculum support services which provide training and advice for schools and a resource directory.  The Department has also issued guidelines to schools on the development of whole-school policies in the areas such as anti-bullying, relationship and sexuality education, substance misuse, managing critical incidents, whole-school guidance planning etc. which are also important in promoting positive mental health<br/><br/>  I can also inform the Deputy that my Department produced and distributed for second level schools in 2013 the Well-being in Post-Primary Schools: Guidelines for Mental Health Promotion and Suicide Prevention and I with my colleague, Minister Kathleen Lynch launched in January of this year the Well-being in Primary Schools &ndash; Guidelines for Mental Health Promotion. <br/><br/>  The guidelines were developed, following a process of wide consultation, by a working group with representation from Teacher Education Section/Inspectorate, SPHE Support Service, National Psychological Service (NEPS), Department of Health and the Health Service Executive/National Office for Suicide Prevention (NOSP).<br/><br/>  The Guidelines are for all members of the school community, boards of management and in-school management teams who play a central leadership role in mental health promotion.  They will also be useful for parents' associations, student councils, health and other personnel who are seeking an understanding of how to work in and with schools.  The Guidelines provide practical guidance on how schools can promote mental health and well-being and school connectedness in an integrated way. The Guidelines also provide evidence-based advice on how to support young people who may be at risk. Information is also provided relating to accessing support from external agencies and support services. <br/><br/>  The key to successful implementation of these Guidelines lies in taking a coordinated whole-school approach.  This involves building and integrating school self-evaluation processes, implementing the Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) curriculum, developing the whole-school guidance plan, adopting the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) continuum of support, and building effective inter-agency relationships.<br/><br/>  The key strategic actions for positive mental health promotion that school personnel can undertake to promote well-being in post-primary schools are :<br/><br/>- Developing and maintaining a safe and caring environment within the school where a sense of belonging and connectedness is fostered <br/><br/>- Building positive teacher-student and student-student relationships to promote participation, social interaction and pro-social behaviour <br/><br/>- Actively involving young people and their parents/guardians in developing and implementing school policies to support mental health and health promotion <br/><br/>- Adopting a whole-school approach to health promotion, where health is promoted by all and not just a few members of staff <br/><br/>- Supporting and implementing a well-planned, consistent and integrated SPHE/RSE curriculum to enable young people enhance their coping, resilience, communication, conflict resolution, and problem-solving skills <br/><br/>- Developing a whole-school systems and structures to support the early identification of young people experiencing social, emotional, behavioural or learning difficulties <br/><br/>- Actively involving, supporting and encouraging young people's participation in extra-curricular activities <br/><br/>- Fostering a whole-school ethos that accepts and values diversity within the student and staff population <br/><br/>- Providing easy access to information for students and staff on supports available to them within the school and wider community <br/><br/>- Facilitating access to continuing professional development for school staff on the promotion of the mental health and well-being of young people.<br/><br/>  I hope this clarifies the issue for the Deputy.  </p></reply>

The works referred to by the Deputy are appropriate to the Summer Works Scheme, the purpose of which is to devolve funding to individual school authorities to facilitate schools carrying out small and medium scale building works that will improve and upgrade existing school facilities. <br/><br/>  As the Deputies will also be aware, spending of more than &euro;70 million was approved for the 2014 Summer Works Scheme to allow over 770 schools undertake improvement works. This allowed for the funding of applications received under categories 1-6. Schools which had applied under categories 7-10, including the school referred to by the Deputies, were advised that their applications would be retained for prioritisation if funding for further summer works projects could be secured for 2015.<br/><br/>  I am currently considering the feasibility of making further funding available to facilitate consideration of those applications which were received under categories 7-10 under the 2014 Summer Works Scheme. </p></reply>

The full year cost of 30 posts is circa. &euro;1.8m (&euro;0.6m in 2015) and is being managed within the Department's budget. <br/><br/>  These improvements particularly recognise the challenges faced by very small schools that are more than 8km from the next nearest school of the same type.<br/><br/>  This package of measures will provide rural communities with security about the future of their small schools, recognising the essential social function which small schools can play, especially in isolated communities.<br/><br/>  These improvements in the Staffing Schedule for small schools are the only changes that I am making to the staffing arrangements for primary schools for the 2015/16 school year.<br/><br/>  The Deputy has sought information on what the impact of these improvements would be for the 2014/15 school year if they were also applicable to this school year.  Firstly, I wish to make clear that they are not applicable to this year.  They come into effect from 1 September 2015.  Secondly, there is no scope within my Department to do the detailed analysis requested by the Deputy in relation to the 2014/15 school year given that the focus is now on the staffing and redeployment arrangements for the coming school year.  However, the number of schools benefiting for the 2015/16 school year could be used as a guide for the number of schools that would benefit for the 2014/15 school year.<br/><br/>  The cumulative savings achieved to date from the 2012 small schools budget measure are of the order of &euro;20m. The number of posts lost is about 120 posts and the number of posts not gained is about 80 posts as a result of the increased pupil thresholds. This gives an indication of the overall costs involved in relation to restoring teacher numbers in small schools. </p></reply>

Parents have the right to choose which school to apply to and where the school has places available the pupil should be admitted.  However, in schools where there are more applicants than places available a selection process may be necessary.

Admissions to the institutions are regulated by the institutions themselves.</p>  <p>  I have been informed by the HEAR/DARE Steering Group that HEAR was developed to target students from socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds attending secondary school (i.e. sitting the Irish Leaving Certificate) and residing in the Republic of Ireland.  HEAR is the primary mechanism through which participating HEIs reach national targets, identified by the Higher Education Authority (based on Republic of Ireland data and research), which points to particular socio-economic groups being under-represented relative to their share of the Republic of Ireland's population as a whole.</p>  <p>  The six indicators employed by HEAR to identify eligible students are all Republic of Ireland proxies for long-term socio-economic disadvantage.  Consequently students educated and resident outside the Republic of Ireland cannot meet the eligibility criteria for the HEAR scheme.  This policy was agreed by all participating HEAR institutions when HEAR was established in 2009.  It is acknowledged that there is an anomaly regarding students who are for example, resident in the Republic of Ireland and attending secondary school in Northern Ireland and sitting A-Levels.  This has been brought to the attention of the DARE HEAR Steering Group and National Policy Group.  This will not result in any changes to the HEAR scheme for students applying for entry in 2015 as the terms, conditions and criteria for application were published in August 2014.  To date no correspondence or complaint has been received (by the DARE HEAR Shared Services Unit or HEAR HEIs) from third level applicants or parents of applicants residing in Northern Ireland or the border counties on this matter, or from any schools in Northern Ireland.  The position of A-Level applicants resident in the Republic of Ireland will be reviewed for those students applying to higher education in 2016.</p>  <p>  Individual students who have queries on this matter can contact HEAR Higher Education Institutions directly.  The Deputy may wish to contact the Irish Universities Association in this instance.</p></reply>

The criteria for enrolment in a Special Class for pupils with SSLD is set out in my Department's Circular 0038/2007.</p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible for opening special classes in schools, where sufficient need arises. The NCSE will be able to advise parents with regards to the availability of special classes in their area or with regards to the potential establishment of new classes.</p>  <p>  All schools have the names and contact details of their local Special Educational Needs Organiser (SENO).

It is a matter for individual schools to use their professional judgement to identify pupils who will receive this support and to use the resources available to the school to intervene at the appropriate level with such pupils.</p>  <p>  I wish to advise the Deputy that the enrolment of a child to a school is a matter in the first instance for the parents of the child and the Board of Management of a school.

Proposals will come from consortia of industry sectors and education and training providers and I expect that both Education and Training Boards and Institutes of Technology will positively consider links with industry partners. Later this year, implementation of phase 2 of the Plan will focus on the detailed development of successful proposals into new apprenticeships.  This will include determining the specific arrangements for each new apprenticeship in terms of qualifications, curriculum and programme delivery.</p></reply>

The HAP scheme will bring all social housing supports provided by the State under the aegis of local authorities. The scheme will remove a barrier to employment by allowing recipients to remain in the scheme if they gain full-time employment. HAP will also improve regulation of the rented accommodation being supported and provide certainty for landlords as regards their rental income.  Further to the enactment of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014 on 28 July 2014, the first phase of the HAP statutory pilot commenced with effect from 15 September 2014 in Limerick City and County Council, Waterford City and County Council and Cork County Council. HAP commenced in Louth, Kilkenny, South Dublin and Monaghan County Councils from 1 October. Subsequently, on 18 December, Dublin City Council became part of the statutory HAP pilot, with a specific focus on accommodating homeless households. Dublin City Council is implementing the HAP pilot for homeless households in the Dublin region on behalf of all 4 Dublin local authorities, including D&uacute;n Laoghaire Rathdown County Council.</p>  <p>  There are now 921 households in receipt of HAP across the local authority areas taking part in the statutory pilot scheme.</p>  <p>  During the legislation&rsquo;s passage through the Oireachtas in July 2014 an undertaking was given that a report would be prepared for the relevant Oireachtas Committee, that would include a full review of the statutory pilot phase. Data for this report is being gathered from pilot sites and the report will be submitted to the Oireachtas Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht shortly. Based on data gathered for the review, consideration is currently being given to the sequencing of local authorities to commence HAP on an incremental basis this year.</p></reply>

The scheme is administered by local community and voluntary groups with the support of my Department.  My Department undertook to consider new approaches to the Seniors Alert Scheme in 2014 and arising from this, it was decided that the scheme be managed by Pobal, given that organisation&rsquo;s significant experience delivering programmes on behalf of Government.</p>  <p>  Pobal&rsquo;s management and administrative services for the Scheme included an invitation to tender for the supply and installation of personal monitored alarms, which was publicly advertised on eTenders on 20 October 2014. The tender included a requirement for suppliers to set out their value added services, including the supply of smoke detectors and carbon monoxide alarms. The tender process, which is being led by Pobal, is almost complete and following this a panel of regional suppliers will be contracted to provide the equipment within specific regional areas and the question of funding for such value added services will be further considered once the outcome of the competition is made public.</p></reply>

Applications for a new round of funding, which commenced on 1 July 2014, were subject to an appraisal process. 55 applications were approved for funding for the two-year period from 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2016. The organisation referred to by the Deputy in the details supplied was not successful on this occasion.  Pobal were asked to undertake the appraisal and management of the scheme and, in that context, put in place a dedicated team to deal with any inquiries from applicants and to provide detailed feedback. Furthermore, an appeals process was put in place, on foot of which Pobal submitted a report, which is currently being considered.<br/><br/>On 18 July 2014, it was announced that bridging funding of &euro;1.4million would be allocated for a twelve month period to a number of previously funded health, disability and other organisations that were not approved for funding under the new scheme, pending the carrying out of a review of the public funding of national organisations in the health and disability sector. This bridging funding in 2014/2015 is a once-off transitional arrangement and will enable organisations to plan for their future, whether with or without State support, such as that provided under the SSNO. The organisation in question was allocated &euro;37,304 for the 12 month period to 30 June 2015.<br/><br/>The review process is underway and is being advanced in consultation with the Department of Health. The Health Service Executive and Pobal are also participating in the review. All organisations in receipt of bridging funding have been contacted to make submissions as part of the review process. I intend to complete and publish the outcome of the review over the coming months.<br/><br/>It should be noted that funding under the SSNO is provided for ongoing core operational costs of national organisations within the community and voluntary sector. The definition of core funding for the purpose of the <i>SSNO</i>refers to financial support that covers basic core organisational and administrative costs of an organisation; this includes core staff, facilities and the direct administration expenses of day-to-day work.</p></reply>

Following public concern with regard to the widespread failure to comply with regulatory requirements in all sectors of the construction industry, the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014 (S.I. No. 9 of 2014) were introduced to strengthen the arrangements in place by requiring greater accountability in relation to compliance with Building Regulations. Over 5,000 construction projects have commenced to date since the new regulations took effect on 1 March 2014 and thus require statutory certification of design and construction, lodgement of compliance documentation, mandatory inspections during construction and validation and registration of certificates.</p>  <p>  In relation to the self-build sector I refer to the reply given in response to Questions Nos. 541 and 542 of 18 December 2014. Price is determined by market forces and is therefore outside of the scope of my regulatory powers. Nevertheless, I recognise the importance of ensuring that the regulations do not impact unduly on the self-build sector, particularly in relation to cost. As indicated previously, my Department, in conjunction with the Housing Agency and the construction professional bodies, is currently finalising additional guidance on an appropriate inspection plan for a typical single dwelling. This guidance will be helpful in better informing the market in relation to offering realistic and appropriately priced professional services for such work.</p>  <p>  I also intend to announce details of the imminent review of S.I. No. 9 of 2014 early next month. A full report on the matter will be produced by the second quarter of 2015 and will inform further regulation in this critical area. I will arrange for a copy of the report to be made available in the Oireachtas Library in due course.</p></reply>

Such reforms include administering the technical assessment process on a cyclical basis where briefing, guidance and support for candidates can be administered in a structured manner, mentoring and supporting applicants, facilitating assessment based on recent projects, facilitating applicants with reassessment/reapplication (i.e. ensuring it is not seen as a one chance only route to registration) and reviewing and simplifying guidance materials with direct input from practically trained persons. I have asked my Department and the RIAI as registration body to continue to work with the Architects Alliance of Ireland and others in this manner to achieve whatever further reasonable and practical improvements of the technical assessment process can be made in the context of the Fennell report or otherwise.</p>  <p>  In relation to the proposals for the statutory registration of Architectural Technologists, I refer to the reply given to Question No. 519 of 18 November 2014 which remains the position. I welcome the decision by Quality Qualifications Ireland to facilitate the development of a common standard for architectural technology in line with the National Qualifications Framework which is an important step towards the development of a statutory register. I am committed to advancing plans for the statutory registration of architectural technologists as quickly as possible. I intend carrying out a public consultation on the matter over the coming months with a view to early publication of legislative proposals thereafter.</p></reply>

Prior to 2014 national data on homelessness was available through <i>Housing Needs Assessment</i>reports, which were generally carried out every three years, or through the CSO&rsquo;s special Census report, <i>Homeless Persons in Ireland</i>, which was published in 2012. The Housing Needs Assessment reports break down the categories of housing need, including in respect of homelessness but only where an application had been made to a housing authority.  The Pathway Accommodation and Support System (PASS) was developed as a single integrated national data information system on the use of homeless services and is provided through Dublin City Council as a national shared service. The PASS system allows housing authorities to produce good quality, timely data in relation to homelessness and how it is addressed and, in quantifying its ongoing dynamics, supports the development and implementation of appropriate policy responses. <br/><br/>PASS was initially piloted in the Dublin Region and was rolled-out on a national basis during 2013, which means that 2014 was the first year for which PASS produced composite national data on homelessness. Quarterly reports from lead housing authorities are published on my Department's website as soon as they are available. These quarterly reports provide a range of data on homelessness, including details of Individuals moved on to independent living. These reports are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: <br/><br/></p></reply>

Statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of accommodation and related services for homeless persons rests with individual housing authorities.  The purposes for which housing authorities may incur expenditure in addressing homelessness are prescribed in Section 10 of the Housing Act 1988.  Housing authorities provide monthly reports on homelessness in which identify the number of people utilising State-funded emergency accommodation on a regional and county basis.

The rates applicable for the half-yearly and quarterly options are 55.5% and 28.25% of the annual charge, respectively. These relativities have remained generally consistent since the 1960s.  The differential takes account of the extra workload for staffing in motor tax offices and the National Vehicle and Driver File Unit of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, and the resultant administrative costs and printing costs that arise, including the issuing of renewal notices. Each quarterly renewal of motor tax follows the same administrative procedures as the annual renewal process.

The scheme will operate along the lines of the incremental purchase model. As with the existing incremental purchase sales schemes for local authority apartments and newly built local authority houses, Part 3 of the 2014 Act provides that, where the tenant purchaser complies with the conditions of the sale of the house, the incremental purchase charge on the property will reduce annually by the equivalent of 2% of the value of the property, thus eliminating the entire charge by the end of the charge period. Where the tenant purchaser, with the consent of the housing authority, resells the dwelling within the charge period, he or she must pay to the council the value on the date of resale of the remaining incremental purchase charge on the property.<br/><br/>Full details of the new scheme, including the income related discounts available to tenant purchasers, will be set out in regulations that I will make in advance of its introduction.</p></reply>

Firstly, it supports electricity generation which was constructed for security of supply purposes, including peat generation. Secondly, it supports the development of renewable electricity which is important for both security of supply and for reducing carbon emissions from electricity generation. The levy is designed to compensate electricity suppliers for the additional costs they incur by purchasing electricity generated by these producers. It has been in place since 2001.  The legal basis for the PSO levy and its method of calculation are set out in Regulations made under the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 (S.I. 217 of 2002). The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) determines the PSO levy which is a charge on all electricity customers without exception. The annual PSO levy amount for 2014/2015 is &euro;335.4 million. This equates to &euro;64.37 per annum for residential customers, &euro;221.66 per annum for small to medium sized business customers and &euro;34.20/kVA for medium and large customers. </p>  <p>  While I fully understand and appreciate concerns about the cost of the PSO levy to customers, the development of renewable energy in Ireland, supported by the renewable part of the PSO, will enable Ireland to reduce its fossil fuel dependency and vulnerability to rises in fossil fuel prices. The PSO levy is also vital to enable Ireland to meet its 2020 40% target for electricity generated from renewable sources by 2020, which in turn is important for the achievement of Ireland's 16% EU 2020 target for renewable energy.</p>  <p>  The biggest driver for the levy rise for this year is the lower predicted wholesale market electricity price, which is estimated to be around 10% lower than last year. This results in lower predicted market income for the PSO plants and, therefore, a higher levy is required to cover their allowed costs. The lower wholesale electricity price is being driven by lower international gas prices which in turn drives up the PSO levy. However, lower gas and wholesale prices also reduce the wholesale cost of electricity that suppliers pay. In turn, suppliers are in a position to reduce their retail prices and potentially offset the PSO levy increase. Increased competition in the retail electricity market has led to a number of suppliers reducing their retail prices of late and I welcome these developments. The CER is tasked with retail market monitoring and executes this role vigorously to ensure competition leads to the fairest prices for customers.</p></reply>

The fishery reopened, with strict biosecurity conditions, very shortly after the outbreak. The design and build of a disinfection station prototype has been completed and four units, funded by ESB have been installed on site. <br/><br/>While IFI has no statutory remit as regards Alien Invasive Species, they are coordinating the response actions of a range of State bodies. Following these initial steps, IFI also conducted a comprehensive scientific survey to provide critical information on the nature and extent of the infestation. <br/><br/>Since it discovered the outbreak IFI has been facilitating and chairing meetings of relevant Agencies, including Waterways Ireland, the ESB, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Bord Na Mona and Longford and Roscommon County Councils. The cross agency group has agreed a plan to carry out a trial dredge operation on the &ldquo;hot water&rdquo; stretch. This trial will inform on the feasibility and success rate of the method(s) to be used in any larger scale operation. Consultation with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government is also underway as regards disposal. <br/><br/>I am advised that the trial dredge will commence once water levels facilitate an operation which is safe for personnel and which takes precaution against further spread. I am advised that equipment to carry out the trial is already on site while the appropriate weather window and water level is awaited. IFI, on behalf of the Agency Group, has kept local stakeholders advised of developments as they occur and will provide further updates closer to the commencement of the trial operation. <br/><br/>However, it is important to understand that Asian Clam, like many other aquatic invasive species, is extremely pervasive in the environment, and once in a water body it is likely that operations will be focused on managing the infestation rather than eradication.</p></reply>

I appreciate that many people, particularly in rural areas, feel that this is harsh.  However, it is important for people to understand that a learner permit is not meant to be a substitute for an actual licence, and holders should not expect to be able to drive freely in the same manner as licence holders.</p></reply>

The Council sought that provision be made through primary legislation to regulate the operation of rickshaws.</p>  <p>  As it is a requirement that a Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) be prepared in respect of any proposal to Government seeking permission to regulate through primary legislation and given that rickshaws are a local matter, I have responded to the Council that it would be appropriate that the Council  prepare a RIA. The purpose of the RIA is to establish more clearly the issues that need to be addressed and the kind of regulatory initiative that is most appropriate to deal with those issues. The RIA would include, amongst other things, an assessment of the measures that could be adopted within the existing bye-law making powers of local authorities and also help determine whether any proposal for primary legislation should be dealt with as a matter of road traffic legislation or local government legislation.</p></reply>

However, the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government administers a grant scheme for the renewal or repair of thatched roofs of owner occupied houses.  I refer the Deputy to that Department for details of eligibility criteria for that scheme.<br/><br/>A number of State financial supports provide for the conservation and preservation of heritage structures in general. On 9 February last, I announced an allocation of &euro;624,000 for the Structures at Risk Fund 2015,<i></i>to enable conservation works to heritage structures, in both private and public ownership, which are protected under the Planning and Development Acts 2000, as amended, and are deemed to be at significant risk of deterioration. This Fund, which will be administered through the local authorities, encourages the regeneration and reuse of heritage properties and helps to secure the preservation of protected structures, which might otherwise be lost. The Fund is open to two applications per local authority, of which only one application may be in respect of a publicly-owned building. The amount of funding available per project will be subject to a minimum level of &euro;15,000 and a maximum level of &euro;60,000.  Final details of projects funded will be made available once all applications are received by the local authorities and assessed by my Department. Since 2011, over 100 structures have been safeguarded for the future as a result of the Structures at Risk Fund.<br/><br/>The Heritage Council, which my Department also funds, is administering a community-based heritage grants scheme for the protection and preservation of the built heritage.  I understand that applications are open until 20 March 2015 for the scheme. The Heritage Council&rsquo;s website is .<br/><br/>In addition, as part of an Architectural Advice Series, my Department plans to publish an advice book on thatching this year, which will include practical advice and guidance on aspects of conserving and restoring thatched structures.</p></reply>

This is a legal obligation and a number of EU Member States, including Ireland, have been subject to adverse judgements of the Court of Justice of the EU (CJEU) in relation to failures to fully comply with the Directives.</p>  <p>  The Hen Harrier was a key issue in the judgment of the CJEU in 2007 against Ireland in the &ldquo;Birds Case&rdquo; for failure to provide adequate protection for wild birds. In that context, Ireland designated six Special Protection Areas (SPAs) for the conservation of the Hen Harrier in 2007. This case remains open, with the continuing possibility of reputational damage and fines being imposed on Ireland if it is not seen to be in compliance with the judgment.  </p>  <p>  The designation of land under the Directives has been tested in the Irish courts on a number of occasions. While the nomination of a site for designation as an SPA or Special Area of Conservation (SAC) may have an impact on the manner in which certain lands may be farmed, the designation does not mean that the lands are subject to blanket restrictions, although they must be managed appropriately. </p>  <p>  There is significant funding available via the Basic Payment Scheme and agri environment schemes (operated by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine) to assist farmers in meeting the requirements of the Birds and Habitats Directives. Participation in the Basic Payment scheme requires farmers to abide by the statutory requirements relating to Special Protection Areas and Special Areas of Conservation. Furthermore, my colleague the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine announced this week that he was extending GLAS+ to all farms identified as habitats of endangered birds, including the hen harrier. This means that all such farmers will be able receive up to &euro;7,000 a year, if the area they have to manage is large enough.  </p>  <p>  My Department, in partnership with other stakeholders, is working on a Threat Response Plan, which is intended to improve the prospects for the Hen Harrier, while bringing clarity to wider issues of concern for landowners and farmers. It is intended to examine all issues at hand, including forestry consents, planning permissions for wind farms and financial supports for farmers, with a view to determining the appropriate course of further action. The Threat Response Plan will be key in ensuring the long-term conservation of the Hen Harrier.</p></reply>
