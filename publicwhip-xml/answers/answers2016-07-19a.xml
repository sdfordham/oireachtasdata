    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-07-19a.9.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016071900062#WRA00800"><p>​The derogation permitting a maximum weight laden limit of 42 tonnes for 2 axle tractor units towing 3 axle semi-trailers expired on 30 June last.</p>  <p>  Under the Road Traffic (Construction and Use of Vehicles) Regulations 2003 (SI. No. 5 of 2003), the upper weight limit for these vehicles was set at 40 tonnes with an initial derogation in these Regulations permitting such vehicles to continue to operate up to 42 tonnes until the end of 2008.  Since 2008 the derogation was extended seven times affording the industry an extensive period of time to adapt to its eventual ending.#</p>  <p>  The original motive behind granting this derogation was to allow the haulage industry time, from 2003 onwards, to renew their then existing fleet of 2 axle tractor units with more road friendly 3 axle ones. This was aimed at securing a significant decrease in road and bridge infrastructure damage caused by such vehicles and to thereby reduce the costs to the public finances in terms of maintaining and repairing vital road and bridge infrastructure.    </p>  <p>  While derogations from Directive 96/53/EC may permit a higher weight limit for certain articulated vehicle combinations operating within the borders of other EU jurisdictions, given the lower levels of maintenance funding as compared with many of our peer jurisdictions, the Irish road and bridge infrastructure network cannot sustain increased regulatory weight limits for such vehicles.</p>  <p>  As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport I must have regard to the overarching need to maintain national transport infrastructure in as cost effective manner as possible.  It is primarily for this reason, as well as the over 13 years given to the industry to adjust, that the previously existing derogation has not been renewed.</p></reply>

In this regard, the Government is making significant investment in cycling infrastructure​.</p>  <p>  Safe cycle routes have been delivered in a number of towns throughout the country under Smarter Travel programmes such as Active Travel Towns, Smarter Travel Areas and National Cycle Networks.  Significant investment has also been made in cycling greenways and in cycling infrastructure in urban areas.  In Dublin, the recently published 2015 Canal Cordon Count demonstrates how effective the investment in cycling in Dublin has been.  It shows that there has been a steady year on year growth in the number of cyclists crossing the cordon in the morning peak - almost 11,000 in 2015, an increase of 125% when compared with 2006.</p>  <p>  My Department is interested in further improving the cycling infrastructure throughout the country.  The Programme for Partnership Government commits that future investment in our public transport system will uphold the principles of smarter travel.  Under the Capital Plan, &euro;100 million is being committed to smarter travel and carbon reduction measures, including cycling greenways and other cycling infrastructure.  We have also committed to supporting the extension of the existing public bike schemes in a number of our cities and driving the roll-out of additional schemes in other areas.</p>  <p>  In support of this infrastructural investment, my Department has also funded the development of a new cycling training standard - Cycle Right - that will facilitate high quality cycling and cycle safety training for our young people in particular.</p></reply>

In this context my Department is not operating an annual application process at present under the Specific and Strategic Grant Schemes.</p><p>Again as I have outlined, <font color="#181818">the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, together with the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, has announced the establishment of a Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund of &euro;150m, to be matched by &euro;50m in local authority funding, to relieve critical access and supporting infrastructural blockages and enable the delivery of large-scale housing on key development sites, with the potential to open up lands and deliver significant level of new housing in Dublin and other urban areas.  Once details of the arrangements relating to the Fund are finalised and a call for proposals issues later this year, it is open to local authorities, including Cork County Council, to consider submitting a bid proposal to access such funding for suitable projects.</font></p></reply>

Following an examination of the applications in accordance with the relevant legal and policy framework, full approval was granted in Autumn last year by my Department in respect of two of the five categories sought. In relation to the remaining three categories of courses, there was a series of correspondence and a meeting with the College, following which renewed applications were received in Spring 2016.  My Department gave preliminary approval to the NMCI to deliver these courses within a matter of weeks of receiving the final applications.  In accordance with long standing MSO policy and practice, final approval is given when the MSO officials attend the first programme and confirm that it is delivered in accordance with the approval.</p>  <p>  To date, the NMCI has not notified us of the date for the first programme.  However, I can confirm that my officials remain available to attend any programme given by NMCI.</p>  <p>  My Department has received in recent days similar programmes from SEFtech/NMCI Offshore Training Limited (SNO) and has now given these programmes preliminary approval.  In fact, I can confirm that officials from my Department are today attending the first sessions of these courses with a view to final approval.  This will deal with the issues around employment, validity and certification of courses and the protection of maritime safety.</p></reply>

The arrangements for the implementation of the Regulation are being discussed between my Department and the Attorney General's Office in that context.    </p>  <p>  The Regulation concerns the implementation of the "Balanced Approach" to noise management, a concept developed by the International Civil Aviation Organisation for  the process to be followed when introducing noise-related operating restrictions at EU airports.  While the process is predominantly an aviation transport issue, there are land-use planning and management considerations  which are germane to my colleague, the Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government.  That Department is accordingly also contributing to current discussions.</p></reply>

They, like all road traffic, are obliged to obey road traffic law.  The measures which were introduced last year to allow An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to issue fixed charge notices to cyclists also apply to pedal-powered rickshaws and provide an important tool for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in enforcing the law.</p>  <p>  Mechanically propelled rickshaws when carrying passengers for reward in a public place, come within the definition of 'small public service vehicle' (SPSV) and are prohibited under current SPSV legislation.  Pedal-powered rickshaws do not come within the definition of 'small public service vehicle' and therefore fall outside the ambit of the National Transport Authority (NTA) under the Taxi Regulation Act 2013.  Therefore, neither the NTA nor my Department currently have powers to ban pedal-powered rickshaws.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will recall from recent Parliamentary Question replies that, in response to some concerns - primarily of a safety nature - both Dublin City Council (DCC) and the NTA had obtained legal advices in relation to their respective powers to regulate pedal powered rickshaws, and my Department was examining these with a view to consulting the Attorney General on the best way to proceed to provide for the appropriate regulation of rickshaws.</p>  <p>  However, I now understand that in the interim, further discussions have taken place between DCC and the NTA who have agreed a proposed approach to regulating pedal powered rickshaws.  The NTA wrote to my Department last week informing it of their agreed outline proposal which would require the drafting and introduction of primary legislation.</p>  <p>  My Department will now be engaging further with the NTA on this matter, and will also be working in consultation with the Attorney General.  As part of this, it will be necessary to clearly frame the policy to guide any detailed legislative drafting.  I will consider the legislative proposals which emerge when this work has been progressed.  </p></reply>

IAG also confirmed that the existing employment rights of the employees of Aer Lingus would be fully safeguarded.</p>  <p>  The Offer closed on 2 September 2015 having been accepted by over 98% of the issued share capital of Aer Lingus, including the State's 25.1% shareholding and Aer Lingus largest shareholder at the time, Ryanair.</p>  <p>  Since then IAG's plans for Aer Lingus have progressed broadly in line with those outlined in the offer documentation. Aer Lingus has launched a number of new routes and the airline also announced that passenger numbers and revenue per passenger kilometre were up over 10% in the first five months of this year.</p>  <p>  These figures are in line with an overall significant growth in air traffic in and out of the country this year. This can only be good news for jobs in the Irish aviation sector.</p>  <p>  I am encouraged to see that Aer Lingus is growing its business as an Irish airline within the IAG Group and that the jobs and working conditions of its employees remain secure.</p></reply>

This brings the total  regional and local road allocation for Cavan to &euro;11,350,211 and for Monaghan to &euro;12,313,432 for 2016.  All available funding for 2016 has now been allocated.</p>  <p>  When allocating grant funding, my Department has emphasised that the commitment of local authorities to contribute significantly from their own resources towards the cost of improving and maintaining the regional and local roads network is essential.  Full consideration needs to be given to utilising the Local Property Tax to boost own resources expenditure on regional and local road maintenance and renewal.</p></reply>

This represented 41% of our total overseas visits.</p>  <p>  CSO figures for the period January to May 2016 show further strong performance from the GB market with growth in visit numbers of over 15.7%, when compared with the same period of 2015. </p>  <p>  Tourism Ireland, the agency responsible for marketing the island of Ireland as a visitor destination in overseas markets, has an extensive marketing programme in place for the second half of 2016 which is under way in 23 markets including Great Britain. </p>  <p>  In the longer term, the Programme for Government commits to implementing the policy objectives in the Tourism Policy Statement "People, Place and Policy &ndash; Growing Tourism to 2025" and achieving the targets for Irish tourism contained therein. The UK vote does not change this. </p>  <p>  While the GB market contributed 41% of overseas visits in 2015, the share of overseas visitor revenue from British visitors is approximately 23%. There is a commitment in the Tourism Policy Statement to prioritising tourism marketing efforts towards those markets providing higher revenue returns.</p>  <p>  In the short term, there are no changes to how people can travel between Ireland and the UK and the Government will be doing its upmost in future discussions to maintain the Common Travel Area. In terms of the relative reduction in the value of sterling and the implications for the cost of a holiday here, this has similar implications for all eurozone countries, many of which compete with us for these tourists.</p>  <p>  The Great Britain market will remain of significant importance to Irish tourism in the future and I believe that Ireland's excellent tourism offering  will ensure that we continue to perform strongly.  Tourism Ireland is closely monitoring the situation and is due to meet with tourism industry representatives later this week to plan ahead in this new market environment. In the longer term, we will work closely with other Departments and our agencies and respond to any changes as necessary. I remain confident  however, that our overall long term ambitious targets for Irish tourism will be achieved.</p></reply>

No. 5 of 2003.  While Directive 96/53/EC sets maximum limits for vehicles moving between jurisdictions within the EU, it does not impose an absolute weight limit for national vehicle movement. This allowed Ireland to set its own internal gross vehicle weight (GVW) limits.</p>  <p>  To allow the haulage industry renew their then fleets, a derogation allowing an increase in the gross weight of 5 axle articulated vehicles from 40 tonnes under EU Directive 96/53/EC to 42 tonnes was conceded by the then Minister in 2003, to end in 2008. This deadline was extended seven times, as a further concession to the industry.</p>  <p>  Given the ongoing challenges in maintaining our critical roads infrastructure with constrained resources, the derogation was ended on 30 June 2016.  This was necessary to permit a decrease in road and bridge infrastructure damage caused by such vehicles and to thereby reduce the costs to the public finances in terms of maintaining and repairing vital road and bridge infrastructure.</p>  <p>  As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport I must have regard to the overarching need to maintain national transport infrastructure in as cost effective manner as possible. It is primarily for this reason, as well as the extensive period of over 13 years given to the industry to adjust, that the previously existing derogation has not been renewed.​</p></reply>

Based on the findings in that report it is envisaged that maintenance and renewal of our land transport network will continue to be the main priority over the next period and the bulk of the capital budget is earmarked for such essential work.</p>  <p>  This is the first year of the Capital Plan and my Department's capital envelope this year is &euro;1.075 billion.  By 2021, our capital envelope under the Capital Plan will have increased to &euro;2 billion.</p>  <p>  The Road Investment Programme has a capital budget this year of over &euro;700 million allocated to the national, regional and local roads programme, which includes a number of existing Public Private Partnership schemes, all of which are progressing well. It is envisaged that under the Capital Plan, the maintenance and renewal of the road network will continue to be a key priority with the bulk of the roads capital budget, over &euro;4 billion over the lifetime of the Plan, earmarked for such essential work with a further &euro;600 million allocated for implementation of the PPP road programme which is already under way.</p>  <p>  The Public Transport Investment Programme has a capital budget this year of &euro;347 million.  Again, most of this is tied to maintenance of the rail network and delivering existing commitments, including LUAS Cross City, which is progressing on time and within budget.

Works on those roads are funded from local authorities own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.</p>  <p>  There is ample scope in the structure of the grant programme for local authorities to prioritise drainage works.  In reviewing the submissions received from local authorities in connection with the severe weather events late last year and early this year, my officials were struck by the scale of the backlog in drainage works that seems to have built up and of course this does have knock-on effects when severe weather occurs.  Proper drainage does help protect the road network and my Department expects local authorities to take on board their responsibilities in this respect. </p>  <p>  When notifying local authorities of the additional severe weather funding being provided by Government this year, local authorities were advised that, in the first instance, priority would be given to works involving the repair of roads and bridges together with drainage.

Garda management keep this distribution under continuing review taking into account crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the best possible use is made of these resources. </p><p>I have been informed by the Garda Commissioner that on 31 May 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available, there were 674 members assigned to the 13 stations in the Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR) North Division. I have further been informed that as of 15 July, the latest date for which information is readily available, there were 126 vehicles allocated to the Division.  The detailed information requested is set out in the following tables.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, when the financial crisis hit, the Government of the time introduced a moratorium on recruitment and the four year National Recovery Plan, published in 2010, envisaged a steady reduction in Garda numbers. Thankfully, in a recovering economy, we were able to reopen the Garda College in September 2014, and a total of 851 Garda trainees have been recruited with a further 300 planned to be recruited during the remainder of this year. So far 534 of the new Garda trainees have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream uniform duties nationwide with another 150 more planned to attest in November.  Of the newly attested members, 41 have been assigned to the DMR North Garda Division. </p><p>The Programme for Government, &quot;<font color="#2F2F2F">A Programme for a Partnership Government&quot; commits to</font>continuing the ongoing accelerated Garda recruitment programme with a view to increasing Garda numbers to 15,000.  Taking account of projected retirements, the current rate of recruitment will bring Garda numbers to around the 13,000 mark this year. We must, I believe, endeavour to make more rapid progress than this to reach our target of 15,000 and I am engaging with my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, in relation to increasing the planned annual intake this year and in coming years.</p><p>In relation to the fleet, the position is that since 2012 some &euro;34 million has been invested in the Garda fleet, with over 720 new vehicles coming on stream since the start of 2015.  This significant investment provides the Garda&iacute; with additional high-powered vehicles, marked and unmarked patrol cars, and motorcycles for high-visibility road policing.  Investment in a modern, effective and fit-for-purpose Garda fleet will continue under the Government&rsquo;s Capital Plan 2016-2021 which provides &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles, ensuring that Garda&iacute; can be mobile, visible and responsive on the roads and in the community to prevent and tackle crime. </p><p><b>Dublin Metropolitan Region North 31 May

In announcing the Programme, the Government recognised the importance of addressing the position of unaccompanied children.  However, as indicated in previous responses to parliamentary questions, the pace of the relocation programme in Ireland and across the European Union has been hampered by significant operational delays and technical issues due to the sheer numbers involved and other logistical difficulties that have arisen at the 'hotspot' locations in Italy and Greece.</p>  <p>  A team of officials from my Department, including the Director of the Irish Refugee Protection Programme, travelled to Greece last month to meet with Irish embassy officials and relevant Greek authorities both to signal Ireland's tangible willingness to assist and to identify ways of addressing the obstacles that have arisen.  The outcome of that visit has been very positive and the Greek authorities have now confirmed that, within the coming months, they will be able to increase significantly the overall numbers available to Ireland.  In making this commitment, the Greek authorities also signalled that they will be in a position to include small numbers of unaccompanied minors among the groups being allocated.  This will greatly facilitate Ireland&rsquo;s efforts to meet the targets foreseen in last September's Government decision and fulfil our commitment to prioritise unaccompanied minors.</p>  <p>  I recently chaired a meeting of the high level Task Force established to oversee the implementation of the IRPP during which an approach to taking unaccompanied minors from Greece was discussed. Unaccompanied minors taken in under the relocation strand of the IRPP will be cared for by Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, which operates under the auspices of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and has statutory responsibility for the care of unaccompanied minors in the State.</p>  <p>  I continue to work proactively with my colleagues in Europe to ensure that Ireland and the European Union responds comprehensively to all aspects of the ongoing migration and refugee crisis. All aspects of the crisis were most recently discussed at ministerial level at the meeting of EU justice and home affairs Ministers on 7 July last. I share the concerns of the Deputy in relation to unaccompanied minors as an especially vulnerable group and I expect this issue to remain high on the agenda at EU level.</p></reply>

His family deserve every sympathy for their terrible loss.</p>  <p>  The first thing I should say is that an investigation by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission (GSOC) is ongoing.  That investigation was initiated following complaints made by the family of the young man.  Subsequently, a previous Minister for Justice and Equality, considering that it was desirable in the public interest to do so, referred the matter to GSOC under Section 102 (5) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.  I understand that the investigation is still on-going.  As the Deputies are aware GSOC is an independent statutory body and it is entirely a matter for that body how it conducts its investigation.</p>  <p>  I should also mention that a civil action has been initiated by the mother of the young man against the State in respect of various matters surrounding his tragic death.  The existence of those proceedings imposes clear constraints on me and the Government regarding this case.</p>  <p>  In the circumstances I hope that the House will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to comment or act in any way that might interfere, or might be construed as interfering, with a GSOC investigation or with a legal action that has been initiated.</p>  <p>  For the sake of completeness, however, I can inform to the House that this particular case was amongst those considered under the Independent Review Mechanism.  This was the process established for the independent review of certain allegations of Garda misconduct, or inadequacies in the investigation of certain allegations, which had been made to me as Minister for Justice and Equality, or the Taoiseach, or other public representatives.  A panel consisting of two Senior and five Junior Counsel was established for the purpose, all selected on the basis of their experience of the criminal justice system.  I would like to emphasise that every case under the Independent Review Mechanism was reviewed by independent counsel, who made an objective recommendation. It was open to counsel to make any recommendation that they saw fit, including, if they considered it appropriate, some form of independent inquiry.</p>  <p>  Following their review of this case counsel made a recommendation to me, as Minister, on the outcome of that review.  The recommendation made by counsel was that I should take no further action in this case.  The recommendation and the reasons for it were communicated to the complainant last December.</p></reply>

Therefore, the recording of a person's details on PULSE must be considered in the context of each entry which seeks to describe the circumstances of the interaction with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  For example, this could include an entry on the system as a result of the person being an injured party or as a witness to an incident as well as where a person is a suspect or a suspected offender.  Essentially, a PULSE identification number is intended to be a unique identifier for any future interactions, of any nature, that the person may have with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  With regard to the information requested by the Deputy relating to children under five years of age who have a PULSE file entry and have been ascribed a criminal intelligence number separate from a parent or guardian during each of the past four years, I am informed that this specific information is not available.</p></reply>

In that sense, community policing involves far more than a single unit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, a point highlighted by the Garda Inspectorate in their third report entitled &quot;Policing in Ireland - Looking Forward&quot; in which they stated that community policing is a fundamental policing philosophy and that there is a strong foundation for it in Ireland. </p><p>The Garda Commissioner's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021, published on 9 June 2016, places a strong emphasis on developing and supporting the community policing ethos of the organisation and enhancing the current delivery model so that Garda&iacute; spend more time in the community, gaining public confidence and trust and providing a greater sense of security.  </p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, when the financial crisis hit, the Government of the time introduced a moratorium on recruitment and the four year National Recovery Plan, published in 2010, envisaged a steady reduction in Garda numbers.

It commits the Government to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime. Key to achieving this goal is the commitment in the Programme <font color="#2F2F2F">to</font>continue the ongoing accelerated Garda recruitment programme with a view to increasing Garda numbers to 15,000 as well as doubling the Garda Reserve and increasing the number of civilian staff so as to free-up Garda&iacute; for front-line policing.

Of these, 40 newly attested members have been assigned to the DMR South Garda Division.</p><p>The Programme for Government, &quot;<font color="#2F2F2F">A Programme for a Partnership Government&quot; commits to</font>continuing the ongoing accelerated Garda recruitment programme with a view to increasing Garda numbers to 15,000.  Taking account of projected retirements, the current rate of recruitment will bring Garda numbers to around the 13,000 mark this year. We must, I believe, endeavour to make more rapid progress than this to reach our target of 15,000 and I am engaging with my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, in relation to increasing the planned annual intake this year and in coming years.</p></reply>

This applies to both visa required and non-visa required nationals.  It is only in cases where a person's circumstances have changed since the grant of the visa or entry to the State that an application for an extension of visitor's permission will be considered.  An example of this would be an unexpected illness of either the visitor or the family member they are visiting.  If there has been an unexpected change in the circumstances of the visitor, that could not have been foreseen before entering the State, then an application for an extension of visitor&rsquo;s permission can be made.</p><p>If there is a compelling need in unexpected circumstances for the visitor to extend their visitor permission beyond the 90 days they should make an application in writing to:</p><p>Residence Division</p><p>Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS)</p><p>PO Box 12695</p><p>Dublin 2</p><p>The application must include the following information:</p><p>1.  A full copy of the person&rsquo;s current passport showing how they entered the State and the entry stamp</p><p>2.  A detailed account of the reason for the request including documentary supporting evidence e.g. medical reports</p><p>3.  How much extra time is required?</p><p>4.  Any family members resident in the State and their current circumstances ie. studying or working</p><p>5.  Any other information considered important to the application</p><p>6.  Evidence of private medical insurance (if request is on medical grounds)</p><p>Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by email using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.  This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process.  The Deputy may consider using the email service except in cases where the response from INIS is, in the Deputy's view, inadequate or too long awaited.</p></reply>
