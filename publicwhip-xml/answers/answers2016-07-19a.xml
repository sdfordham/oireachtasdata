    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-07-19a.9.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016071900062#WRA00800"><p>​The derogation permitting a maximum weight laden limit of 42 tonnes for 2 axle tractor units towing 3 axle semi-trailers expired on 30 June last.</p>  <p>  Under the Road Traffic (Construction and Use of Vehicles) Regulations 2003 (SI. No. 5 of 2003), the upper weight limit for these vehicles was set at 40 tonnes with an initial derogation in these Regulations permitting such vehicles to continue to operate up to 42 tonnes until the end of 2008.  Since 2008 the derogation was extended seven times affording the industry an extensive period of time to adapt to its eventual ending.#</p>  <p>  The original motive behind granting this derogation was to allow the haulage industry time, from 2003 onwards, to renew their then existing fleet of 2 axle tractor units with more road friendly 3 axle ones. This was aimed at securing a significant decrease in road and bridge infrastructure damage caused by such vehicles and to thereby reduce the costs to the public finances in terms of maintaining and repairing vital road and bridge infrastructure.    </p>  <p>  While derogations from Directive 96/53/EC may permit a higher weight limit for certain articulated vehicle combinations operating within the borders of other EU jurisdictions, given the lower levels of maintenance funding as compared with many of our peer jurisdictions, the Irish road and bridge infrastructure network cannot sustain increased regulatory weight limits for such vehicles.</p>  <p>  As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport I must have regard to the overarching need to maintain national transport infrastructure in as cost effective manner as possible.  It is primarily for this reason, as well as the over 13 years given to the industry to adjust, that the previously existing derogation has not been renewed.</p></reply>

In this regard, the Government is making significant investment in cycling infrastructure​.</p>  <p>  Safe cycle routes have been delivered in a number of towns throughout the country under Smarter Travel programmes such as Active Travel Towns, Smarter Travel Areas and National Cycle Networks.  Significant investment has also been made in cycling greenways and in cycling infrastructure in urban areas.  In Dublin, the recently published 2015 Canal Cordon Count demonstrates how effective the investment in cycling in Dublin has been.  It shows that there has been a steady year on year growth in the number of cyclists crossing the cordon in the morning peak - almost 11,000 in 2015, an increase of 125% when compared with 2006.</p>  <p>  My Department is interested in further improving the cycling infrastructure throughout the country.  The Programme for Partnership Government commits that future investment in our public transport system will uphold the principles of smarter travel.  Under the Capital Plan, &euro;100 million is being committed to smarter travel and carbon reduction measures, including cycling greenways and other cycling infrastructure.  We have also committed to supporting the extension of the existing public bike schemes in a number of our cities and driving the roll-out of additional schemes in other areas.</p>  <p>  In support of this infrastructural investment, my Department has also funded the development of a new cycling training standard - Cycle Right - that will facilitate high quality cycling and cycle safety training for our young people in particular.</p></reply>

In this context my Department is not operating an annual application process at present under the Specific and Strategic Grant Schemes.</p><p>Again as I have outlined, <font color="#181818">the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, together with the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, has announced the establishment of a Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund of &euro;150m, to be matched by &euro;50m in local authority funding, to relieve critical access and supporting infrastructural blockages and enable the delivery of large-scale housing on key development sites, with the potential to open up lands and deliver significant level of new housing in Dublin and other urban areas.  Once details of the arrangements relating to the Fund are finalised and a call for proposals issues later this year, it is open to local authorities, including Cork County Council, to consider submitting a bid proposal to access such funding for suitable projects.</font></p></reply>

Following an examination of the applications in accordance with the relevant legal and policy framework, full approval was granted in Autumn last year by my Department in respect of two of the five categories sought. In relation to the remaining three categories of courses, there was a series of correspondence and a meeting with the College, following which renewed applications were received in Spring 2016.  My Department gave preliminary approval to the NMCI to deliver these courses within a matter of weeks of receiving the final applications.  In accordance with long standing MSO policy and practice, final approval is given when the MSO officials attend the first programme and confirm that it is delivered in accordance with the approval.</p>  <p>  To date, the NMCI has not notified us of the date for the first programme.  However, I can confirm that my officials remain available to attend any programme given by NMCI.</p>  <p>  My Department has received in recent days similar programmes from SEFtech/NMCI Offshore Training Limited (SNO) and has now given these programmes preliminary approval.  In fact, I can confirm that officials from my Department are today attending the first sessions of these courses with a view to final approval.  This will deal with the issues around employment, validity and certification of courses and the protection of maritime safety.</p></reply>

The arrangements for the implementation of the Regulation are being discussed between my Department and the Attorney General's Office in that context.    </p>  <p>  The Regulation concerns the implementation of the "Balanced Approach" to noise management, a concept developed by the International Civil Aviation Organisation for  the process to be followed when introducing noise-related operating restrictions at EU airports.  While the process is predominantly an aviation transport issue, there are land-use planning and management considerations  which are germane to my colleague, the Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government.  That Department is accordingly also contributing to current discussions.</p></reply>

They, like all road traffic, are obliged to obey road traffic law.  The measures which were introduced last year to allow An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to issue fixed charge notices to cyclists also apply to pedal-powered rickshaws and provide an important tool for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in enforcing the law.</p>  <p>  Mechanically propelled rickshaws when carrying passengers for reward in a public place, come within the definition of 'small public service vehicle' (SPSV) and are prohibited under current SPSV legislation.  Pedal-powered rickshaws do not come within the definition of 'small public service vehicle' and therefore fall outside the ambit of the National Transport Authority (NTA) under the Taxi Regulation Act 2013.  Therefore, neither the NTA nor my Department currently have powers to ban pedal-powered rickshaws.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will recall from recent Parliamentary Question replies that, in response to some concerns - primarily of a safety nature - both Dublin City Council (DCC) and the NTA had obtained legal advices in relation to their respective powers to regulate pedal powered rickshaws, and my Department was examining these with a view to consulting the Attorney General on the best way to proceed to provide for the appropriate regulation of rickshaws.</p>  <p>  However, I now understand that in the interim, further discussions have taken place between DCC and the NTA who have agreed a proposed approach to regulating pedal powered rickshaws.  The NTA wrote to my Department last week informing it of their agreed outline proposal which would require the drafting and introduction of primary legislation.</p>  <p>  My Department will now be engaging further with the NTA on this matter, and will also be working in consultation with the Attorney General.  As part of this, it will be necessary to clearly frame the policy to guide any detailed legislative drafting.  I will consider the legislative proposals which emerge when this work has been progressed.  </p></reply>

IAG also confirmed that the existing employment rights of the employees of Aer Lingus would be fully safeguarded.</p>  <p>  The Offer closed on 2 September 2015 having been accepted by over 98% of the issued share capital of Aer Lingus, including the State's 25.1% shareholding and Aer Lingus largest shareholder at the time, Ryanair.</p>  <p>  Since then IAG's plans for Aer Lingus have progressed broadly in line with those outlined in the offer documentation. Aer Lingus has launched a number of new routes and the airline also announced that passenger numbers and revenue per passenger kilometre were up over 10% in the first five months of this year.</p>  <p>  These figures are in line with an overall significant growth in air traffic in and out of the country this year. This can only be good news for jobs in the Irish aviation sector.</p>  <p>  I am encouraged to see that Aer Lingus is growing its business as an Irish airline within the IAG Group and that the jobs and working conditions of its employees remain secure.</p></reply>

This brings the total  regional and local road allocation for Cavan to &euro;11,350,211 and for Monaghan to &euro;12,313,432 for 2016.  All available funding for 2016 has now been allocated.</p>  <p>  When allocating grant funding, my Department has emphasised that the commitment of local authorities to contribute significantly from their own resources towards the cost of improving and maintaining the regional and local roads network is essential.  Full consideration needs to be given to utilising the Local Property Tax to boost own resources expenditure on regional and local road maintenance and renewal.</p></reply>

This represented 41% of our total overseas visits.</p>  <p>  CSO figures for the period January to May 2016 show further strong performance from the GB market with growth in visit numbers of over 15.7%, when compared with the same period of 2015. </p>  <p>  Tourism Ireland, the agency responsible for marketing the island of Ireland as a visitor destination in overseas markets, has an extensive marketing programme in place for the second half of 2016 which is under way in 23 markets including Great Britain. </p>  <p>  In the longer term, the Programme for Government commits to implementing the policy objectives in the Tourism Policy Statement "People, Place and Policy &ndash; Growing Tourism to 2025" and achieving the targets for Irish tourism contained therein. The UK vote does not change this. </p>  <p>  While the GB market contributed 41% of overseas visits in 2015, the share of overseas visitor revenue from British visitors is approximately 23%. There is a commitment in the Tourism Policy Statement to prioritising tourism marketing efforts towards those markets providing higher revenue returns.</p>  <p>  In the short term, there are no changes to how people can travel between Ireland and the UK and the Government will be doing its upmost in future discussions to maintain the Common Travel Area. In terms of the relative reduction in the value of sterling and the implications for the cost of a holiday here, this has similar implications for all eurozone countries, many of which compete with us for these tourists.</p>  <p>  The Great Britain market will remain of significant importance to Irish tourism in the future and I believe that Ireland's excellent tourism offering  will ensure that we continue to perform strongly.  Tourism Ireland is closely monitoring the situation and is due to meet with tourism industry representatives later this week to plan ahead in this new market environment. In the longer term, we will work closely with other Departments and our agencies and respond to any changes as necessary. I remain confident  however, that our overall long term ambitious targets for Irish tourism will be achieved.</p></reply>

D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Company, as a port of Regional Significance, is designated under the policy for transfer to D&uacute;n Laoghaire Rathdown County Council.</p>  <p>  The process of transferring governance is on-going. The future governance and operational structures of the port are primarily matters for agreement between the local authority and the port company.</p>  <p>  The port and local authority are working together on due diligence which I understand is well advanced. When the due diligence is completed, I expect that substantial progress will be made towards finalising the preparations for transfer.</p></reply>

No. 5 of 2003.  While Directive 96/53/EC sets maximum limits for vehicles moving between jurisdictions within the EU, it does not impose an absolute weight limit for national vehicle movement. This allowed Ireland to set its own internal gross vehicle weight (GVW) limits.</p>  <p>  To allow the haulage industry renew their then fleets, a derogation allowing an increase in the gross weight of 5 axle articulated vehicles from 40 tonnes under EU Directive 96/53/EC to 42 tonnes was conceded by the then Minister in 2003, to end in 2008. This deadline was extended seven times, as a further concession to the industry.</p>  <p>  Given the ongoing challenges in maintaining our critical roads infrastructure with constrained resources, the derogation was ended on 30 June 2016.  This was necessary to permit a decrease in road and bridge infrastructure damage caused by such vehicles and to thereby reduce the costs to the public finances in terms of maintaining and repairing vital road and bridge infrastructure.</p>  <p>  As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport I must have regard to the overarching need to maintain national transport infrastructure in as cost effective manner as possible. It is primarily for this reason, as well as the extensive period of over 13 years given to the industry to adjust, that the previously existing derogation has not been renewed.​</p></reply>

Based on the findings in that report it is envisaged that maintenance and renewal of our land transport network will continue to be the main priority over the next period and the bulk of the capital budget is earmarked for such essential work.</p>  <p>  This is the first year of the Capital Plan and my Department's capital envelope this year is &euro;1.075 billion.  By 2021, our capital envelope under the Capital Plan will have increased to &euro;2 billion.</p>  <p>  The Road Investment Programme has a capital budget this year of over &euro;700 million allocated to the national, regional and local roads programme, which includes a number of existing Public Private Partnership schemes, all of which are progressing well. It is envisaged that under the Capital Plan, the maintenance and renewal of the road network will continue to be a key priority with the bulk of the roads capital budget, over &euro;4 billion over the lifetime of the Plan, earmarked for such essential work with a further &euro;600 million allocated for implementation of the PPP road programme which is already under way.</p>  <p>  The Public Transport Investment Programme has a capital budget this year of &euro;347 million.  Again, most of this is tied to maintenance of the rail network and delivering existing commitments, including LUAS Cross City, which is progressing on time and within budget.  The Plan will facilitate a major upgrade to the public transport system in the Greater Dublin Area so that it has the capacity to meet growing demand which would otherwise be detrimental to competitiveness, economic growth and quality of life.  Construction of a metro link between the city centre, Dublin Airport and Swords will commence around 2021 so as to be operational around 2026/27.  The upgrade will also include further progress in the DART expansion programme including, in particular, the extension of the Dart to Balbriggan.  The Underground element of this will be redesigned to achieve a more affordable solution.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Government proposes to undertake a Mid-Term Review of the Capital Plan, which will take stock of progress and provide the Government with an opportunity to consider the scope for increased levels of investment, including in the transport sector, taking economic growth and fiscal progress into account.</p></reply>

Works on those roads are funded from local authorities own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.</p>  <p>  There is ample scope in the structure of the grant programme for local authorities to prioritise drainage works.  In reviewing the submissions received from local authorities in connection with the severe weather events late last year and early this year, my officials were struck by the scale of the backlog in drainage works that seems to have built up and of course this does have knock-on effects when severe weather occurs.  Proper drainage does help protect the road network and my Department expects local authorities to take on board their responsibilities in this respect. </p>  <p>  When notifying local authorities of the additional severe weather funding being provided by Government this year, local authorities were advised that, in the first instance, priority would be given to works involving the repair of roads and bridges together with drainage.

Garda management keep this distribution under continuing review taking into account crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the best possible use is made of these resources. </p><p>I have been informed by the Garda Commissioner that on 31 May 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available, there were 674 members assigned to the 13 stations in the Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR) North Division. I have further been informed that as of 15 July, the latest date for which information is readily available, there were 126 vehicles allocated to the Division.  The detailed information requested is set out in the following tables.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, when the financial crisis hit, the Government of the time introduced a moratorium on recruitment and the four year National Recovery Plan, published in 2010, envisaged a steady reduction in Garda numbers. Thankfully, in a recovering economy, we were able to reopen the Garda College in September 2014, and a total of 851 Garda trainees have been recruited with a further 300 planned to be recruited during the remainder of this year. So far 534 of the new Garda trainees have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream uniform duties nationwide with another 150 more planned to attest in November.  Of the newly attested members, 41 have been assigned to the DMR North Garda Division. </p><p>The Programme for Government, &quot;<font color="#2F2F2F">A Programme for a Partnership Government&quot; commits to</font>continuing the ongoing accelerated Garda recruitment programme with a view to increasing Garda numbers to 15,000.  Taking account of projected retirements, the current rate of recruitment will bring Garda numbers to around the 13,000 mark this year. We must, I believe, endeavour to make more rapid progress than this to reach our target of 15,000 and I am engaging with my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, in relation to increasing the planned annual intake this year and in coming years.</p><p>In relation to the fleet, the position is that since 2012 some &euro;34 million has been invested in the Garda fleet, with over 720 new vehicles coming on stream since the start of 2015.  This significant investment provides the Garda&iacute; with additional high-powered vehicles, marked and unmarked patrol cars, and motorcycles for high-visibility road policing.  Investment in a modern, effective and fit-for-purpose Garda fleet will continue under the Government&rsquo;s Capital Plan 2016-2021 which provides &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles, ensuring that Garda&iacute; can be mobile, visible and responsive on the roads and in the community to prevent and tackle crime. </p><p><b>Table A</b></p><p><b>Dublin Metropolitan Region North 31 May 2016</b><table><tr><th>DISTRICT</th><th>STATION</th><th>GDA</th><th>SERG</th><th>INSP</th><th>SUPT</th><th>CHIEF</th><th>TOTAL</th></tr><tr><td></td><td>BALBRIGGAN</td><td>55</td><td>10</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td></td><td>68</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>GARRISTOWN</td><td>2</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>LUSK</td><td>9</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>BALBRIGGAN             <br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br /></td><td>SKERRIES</td><td>8</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>BALBRIGGAN              Total</td><td>74</td><td>12</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td></td><td>89</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>BALLYMUN</td><td>96</td><td>20</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>121</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>DUBLIN AIRPORT</td><td>18</td><td>2</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>BALLYMUN               <br /><br /> <br /><br /></td><td>SANTRY</td><td>72</td><td>10</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>82</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>BALLYMUN                Total</td><td>186</td><td>32</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>223</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>COOLOCK</td><td>84</td><td>14</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td></td><td>102</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>MALAHIDE</td><td>27</td><td>4</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>31</td></tr><tr><td>COOLOCK                <br /><br /> <br /><br /></td><td>SWORDS</td><td>58</td><td>11</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>69</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>COOLOCK                 Total</td><td>169</td><td>29</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td></td><td>202</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CLONTARF</td><td>58</td><td>8</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>66</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>HOWTH</td><td>24</td><td>4</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>28</td></tr><tr><td>RAHENY                 <br /><br /> <br /><br /></td><td>RAHENY</td><td>55</td><td>9</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td></td><td>66</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>RAHENY                  Total</td><td>137</td><td>21</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td></td><td>160</td></tr><tr><td>DMR NORTH TOTAL </td><td></td><td>566</td><td>94</td><td>8</td><td>5</td><td>1</td><td>674</td></tr></table></p><p><b>Table B</b></p><p><b>Vehicles allocated to the DMR North Division as of 15</b><b><sup>th</sup></b><b>July 2016</b><table><tr><th></th><th></th><th>CARS</th><th></th><th></th><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr><tr><td></td><td>MARKED</td><td>UNMARKED</td><td>VANS</td><td>4X4</td><td></td><td>Others</td><td>Total</td></tr><tr><td>BALBRIGGAN DISTRICT</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>0</td><td></td><td>0</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>BALLYMUN DISTRICT</td><td>13</td><td>25</td><td>24</td><td>2</td><td></td><td>3</td><td>67</td></tr><tr><td>COOLOCK DISTRICT</td><td>10</td><td>15</td><td>2</td><td>0</td><td></td><td>0</td><td>27</td></tr><tr><td>RAHENY DISTRICT</td><td>8</td><td>8</td><td>4</td><td>0</td><td></td><td>0</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>DMR NORTH</td><td>36</td><td>52</td><td>33</td><td>2</td><td></td><td>3</td><td>126</td></tr></table></p></reply>

In announcing the Programme, the Government recognised the importance of addressing the position of unaccompanied children.  However, as indicated in previous responses to parliamentary questions, the pace of the relocation programme in Ireland and across the European Union has been hampered by significant operational delays and technical issues due to the sheer numbers involved and other logistical difficulties that have arisen at the 'hotspot' locations in Italy and Greece.</p>  <p>  A team of officials from my Department, including the Director of the Irish Refugee Protection Programme, travelled to Greece last month to meet with Irish embassy officials and relevant Greek authorities both to signal Ireland's tangible willingness to assist and to identify ways of addressing the obstacles that have arisen.  The outcome of that visit has been very positive and the Greek authorities have now confirmed that, within the coming months, they will be able to increase significantly the overall numbers available to Ireland.  In making this commitment, the Greek authorities also signalled that they will be in a position to include small numbers of unaccompanied minors among the groups being allocated.  This will greatly facilitate Ireland&rsquo;s efforts to meet the targets foreseen in last September's Government decision and fulfil our commitment to prioritise unaccompanied minors.</p>  <p>  I recently chaired a meeting of the high level Task Force established to oversee the implementation of the IRPP during which an approach to taking unaccompanied minors from Greece was discussed. Unaccompanied minors taken in under the relocation strand of the IRPP will be cared for by Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, which operates under the auspices of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and has statutory responsibility for the care of unaccompanied minors in the State.</p>  <p>  I continue to work proactively with my colleagues in Europe to ensure that Ireland and the European Union responds comprehensively to all aspects of the ongoing migration and refugee crisis. All aspects of the crisis were most recently discussed at ministerial level at the meeting of EU justice and home affairs Ministers on 7 July last. I share the concerns of the Deputy in relation to unaccompanied minors as an especially vulnerable group and I expect this issue to remain high on the agenda at EU level.</p></reply>

His family deserve every sympathy for their terrible loss.</p>  <p>  The first thing I should say is that an investigation by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission (GSOC) is ongoing.  That investigation was initiated following complaints made by the family of the young man.  Subsequently, a previous Minister for Justice and Equality, considering that it was desirable in the public interest to do so, referred the matter to GSOC under Section 102 (5) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.  I understand that the investigation is still on-going.  As the Deputies are aware GSOC is an independent statutory body and it is entirely a matter for that body how it conducts its investigation.</p>  <p>  I should also mention that a civil action has been initiated by the mother of the young man against the State in respect of various matters surrounding his tragic death.  The existence of those proceedings imposes clear constraints on me and the Government regarding this case.</p>  <p>  In the circumstances I hope that the House will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to comment or act in any way that might interfere, or might be construed as interfering, with a GSOC investigation or with a legal action that has been initiated.</p>  <p>  For the sake of completeness, however, I can inform to the House that this particular case was amongst those considered under the Independent Review Mechanism.  This was the process established for the independent review of certain allegations of Garda misconduct, or inadequacies in the investigation of certain allegations, which had been made to me as Minister for Justice and Equality, or the Taoiseach, or other public representatives.  A panel consisting of two Senior and five Junior Counsel was established for the purpose, all selected on the basis of their experience of the criminal justice system.  I would like to emphasise that every case under the Independent Review Mechanism was reviewed by independent counsel, who made an objective recommendation. It was open to counsel to make any recommendation that they saw fit, including, if they considered it appropriate, some form of independent inquiry.</p>  <p>  Following their review of this case counsel made a recommendation to me, as Minister, on the outcome of that review.  The recommendation made by counsel was that I should take no further action in this case.  The recommendation and the reasons for it were communicated to the complainant last December.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. The specific information on the number of Community Garda&iacute; in Finglas, Santry and Ballymun on the 31 December 2010 - 2015, and on the 31 May 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available, is as set out in the table below.</p><p>Of course, it is the case that all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in addressing community policing issues as and when the need arises. In that sense, community policing involves far more than a single unit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, a point highlighted by the Garda Inspectorate in their third report entitled &quot;Policing in Ireland - Looking Forward&quot; in which they stated that community policing is a fundamental policing philosophy and that there is a strong foundation for it in Ireland. </p><p>The Garda Commissioner's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021, published on 9 June 2016, places a strong emphasis on developing and supporting the community policing ethos of the organisation and enhancing the current delivery model so that Garda&iacute; spend more time in the community, gaining public confidence and trust and providing a greater sense of security.  </p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, when the financial crisis hit, the Government of the time introduced a moratorium on recruitment and the four year National Recovery Plan, published in 2010, envisaged a steady reduction in Garda numbers.

So far 534 of the new Garda trainees have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream uniform duties nationwide with another 150 more planned to attest in November.</p><p>The Programme for a Partnership Government recognises that community policing is the embodiment of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, providing a means of recognising that every community &ndash; both urban and rural &ndash; has its own concerns and expectations.  It commits the Government to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime. Key to achieving this goal is the commitment in the Programme <font color="#2F2F2F">to</font>continue the ongoing accelerated Garda recruitment programme with a view to increasing Garda numbers to 15,000 as well as doubling the Garda Reserve and increasing the number of civilian staff so as to free-up Garda&iacute; for front-line policing. Community policing, and all other Garda activities, will undoubtedly benefit from the resources now coming on stream through the accelerated Garda recruitment programme.</p><p><b>Community Police </b><table><tr><th>Station</th><th>2010</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th><th>*2016</th></tr><tr><td>Finglas</td><td>16</td><td>17</td><td>15</td><td>11</td><td>12</td><td>12</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>Santry</td><td>6</td><td>6</td><td>11</td><td>8</td><td>6</td><td>4</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Ballymun</td><td>15</td><td>15</td><td>12</td><td>10</td><td>8</td><td>6</td><td>8</td></tr></table></p><p>*31 May 2016</p></reply>

This applies to both visa required and non-visa required nationals.  It is only in cases where a person's circumstances have changed since the grant of the visa or entry to the State that an application for an extension of visitor's permission will be considered.  An example of this would be an unexpected illness of either the visitor or the family member they are visiting.  If there has been an unexpected change in the circumstances of the visitor, that could not have been foreseen before entering the State, then an application for an extension of visitor&rsquo;s permission can be made.</p><p>If there is a compelling need in unexpected circumstances for the visitor to extend their visitor permission beyond the 90 days they should make an application in writing to:</p><p>Residence Division</p><p>Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS)</p><p>PO Box 12695</p><p>Dublin 2</p><p>The application must include the following information:</p><p>1.  A full copy of the person&rsquo;s current passport showing how they entered the State and the entry stamp</p><p>2.  A detailed account of the reason for the request including documentary supporting evidence e.g. medical reports</p><p>3.  How much extra time is required?</p><p>4.  Any family members resident in the State and their current circumstances ie. studying or working</p><p>5.  Any other information considered important to the application</p><p>6.  Evidence of private medical insurance (if request is on medical grounds)</p><p>Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by email using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.  This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process.  The Deputy may consider using the email service except in cases where the response from INIS is, in the Deputy's view, inadequate or too long awaited.</p></reply>

It is acknowledged that over the last 18 months or so, there have been some difficulties with aspects of the system, particularly in relation to the availability of flood cover and the significant increase in the cost of motor insurance.  However, a State owned company would have to operate subject to the same prudential rules as a private company, and there is no basis to conclude that the same problems would not periodically arise with this model.  In addition, there would be significant capital costs for the State.</p>  <p>  The Government has in the past examined the introduction of a scheme of State indemnification in respect of flooding.  This approach was not considered financially viable because it is believed that over time it would distort the market and could incentivise industry to discontinue the provision of flood cover in medium and high risk areas, thus making the cost of such a scheme prohibitive.  Furthermore, any potential regulatory implications would need to be examined in consultation with the Central Bank and the Office of the Attorney General.</p>  <p>  Finally, in relation to the difficulties currently in the insurance market, a task force has been established within my Department to undertake a review of various aspects of policy in the insurance sector.  An important element of this review is an assessment of the factors contributing to the increasing cost of insurance.  Progress on the review will be overseen by a Working Group on the Cost of Insurance with representatives from all relevant Departments and Agencies and chaired by Minister of State Eoghan Murphy.  The Working Group will identify issues that can be addressed on a more immediate basis and also those that require more long-term policy solutions.  The first meeting of the Working Group will take place on 20 July with further meetings scheduled for early September and in the coming months.</p></reply>

This wage moderation also served to reduce nominal unit labour costs and as a result was key to underpinning the gains in competitiveness which Ireland has recorded in recent years.  These competitiveness gains, together with prudent management of the public finances, have underpinned GDP growth, rising employment and falling unemployment. </p>  <p>  The Report further outlines that whilst the surge in unemployment experienced in Ireland during the crisis was followed by falling nominal wages, once unemployment began to recede, wage growth began to rebound with real wages growing by 0.4 per cent in 2015.  This is relative to an OECD average of 1.2 per cent. </p>  <p>  There is at present, however, no evidence of significant wage pressures, notwithstanding the sharp declines seen in unemployment.  The Government's approach as confirmed in both the Programme for Government and Summer Economic Statement is to continue to boost labour supply by rewarding work for those at the lower and middle-end of the pay spectrum.</p>  <p>  It is crucial, particularly in the context of sterling depreciation, that cost competitiveness is maintained in Ireland.  To this end, the Government will continue to actively monitor overall developments and take remedial action where necessary.  This will allow us to ensure that developments in unit labour costs continue to support Ireland's overall competitiveness.</p></reply>

Ceteris paribus, this will reduce the level of royalty imports and as result increase Irish GDP;</p>  <p>  -  An increase in new aircraft imports to Ireland for international leasing activities generating substantial fee income without significant employment effects.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that these factors do not reflect activity levels we are seeing on the ground.  Although these revisions have significantly boosted investment and net export growth, they do not have a direct bearing on employment and wealth creation for Irish citizens. </p>  <p>  It is important to stress that whilst these headline GDP figures have clearly been distorted and are exaggerated in an Irish context, more concrete indicators of the underlying levels of economic activity point to a continuation of a now firmly-rooted recovery.  Specifically, indicators such as consumer spending, tax trends and labour market developments all confirm that Ireland's economic fundamentals remain strong. </p>  <p>  It is also important to stress that the figures published by the CSO are compiled in accordance with best international practice and statistical standards.  They measure what they are supposed to measure.  However, in a small, open and very globalised economy such as Ireland, it is clear that relevance of these figures as a metric by which underlying economic trends and changes in living standards can be assessed is considerably less than elsewhere.</p>  <p>  With this in mind, the Central Statistics Office is to put together a group of experts to provide guidance on how a more relevant indicator could be produced and published alongside these figures in the future.  My Department will be represented on this group.</p>  <p>  In light of the exceptional nature of these growth figures I also wish to make clear that the Government will not formulate policy on the basis of these inflated figures.  Rather, policy will continue to be designed on the basis of more normal growth rates in the region of 3&frac12; to 4 per cent per annum over the coming years. </p>  <p>  Irish GDP is volatile by comparative standards due to the small open nature of the Irish economy.  The best way to mitigate risks associated with this volatility is through prudent management of the public finances and competiveness-oriented policies.  That is what the Government will continue to do.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-07-19a.327.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016071900068#WRG03500"><p>As the Deputy is aware, small and medium sized businesses, including those in the hotel and catering industry, play a central role in the sustainable recovery of the Irish economy.  To support economic recovery, Government policy is focused on ensuring that all viable SMEs have access to an appropriate supply of credit from a diverse range of bank and non-bank sources.  </p>  <p>  In terms of monitoring the requirements for SMEs, my Department commissions biannual surveys to ascertain the demand for credit by SMEs.  This survey series, currently being conducted by Red C, is the most comprehensive survey of SME credit demand in Ireland, covering 1,500 respondents and involving over 6,000 direct telephone calls to SMEs.  SMEs of all sizes trading in all sectors, excluding property development and speculative activities, are included.  The survey covers demand for credit from both bank and non-bank sources.</p>  <p>  I would draw the Deputy's attention to the most recently published Department of Finance SME Credit Demand Survey covering the October 2015 to March 2016, which can be found at www.finance.gov.ie.  The results of this survey shows that, when pending applications are excluded, 89% of credit applications to banks were approved or partially approved (up 4% from the previous survey).  Working capital requirements were provided as the main reason for applying for bank finance with 39% of respondents stating that they required finance for working capital (down 9%).  When asked about sources of finance for working capital, internal funds/retained earnings were the main finance source of working capital with 67% of working capital coming from this source (up 4%).  The survey also showed continued positive trends in terms of trading performance, profitability and employment.</p>  <p>  My Department has also been involved in a range of initiatives to encourage access to credit for small and medium sized businesses.  The SME State Bodies Group provides a forum for the development and implementation of policy measures to enhance SMEs' access to a stable and appropriate supply of finance.</p>  <p>  Some of the main policies introduced to encourage access to credit for small and medium businesses include:</p>  <p>  -  The Supporting SMEs Online Tool, a cross-government initiative, was launched in May 2014.  On answering 8 simple questions, the small business will receive a list of available Government supports.  The Supporting SMEs Online Tool is available at www.supportingsmes.ie.</p>  <p>  -  The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland has been established as a means of ensuring that SMEs are provided with sufficient finance for growth.  The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) is an initiative designed to increase the availability of funding to SMEs at a lower cost and on more flexible terms than have recently been available on the Irish Market.  The SBCI does not lend directly to SMEs.  It uses a network of lending partners known as 'on lenders' to make its funds available to SMEs.  More information on the SBCI can be found on www.sbci.gov.ie.</p>  <p>  -  The Credit Guarantee Scheme encourages additional lending to small businesses by offering a partial Government guarantee to banks against losses on qualifying loans to eligible SMEs.</p>  <p>  -  The Microenterprise Loan Fund, administered by Microfinance Ireland, provides support in the form of loans for up to &euro;25,000, available to start-up, newly established, or growing micro enterprises employing less than 10 people, with viable business propositions.  Microfinance Ireland works in partnership with the Local Enterprise Offices nationally to administer this fund (www.microfinanceireland.ie).</p>  <p>  -  The Credit Review Office helps SME or Farm borrowers who have had an application for credit of up to &euro;3 million declined or reduced by the main banks, and who feel that they have a viable business proposition.  They also examine cases where borrowers feel that the terms and conditions of their existing loan, or a new loan offer, are unfairly onerous or have been unreasonably changed to their detriment.  This is a strictly confidential process between the business, the Credit Review Office and the bank.  The Credit Reviewer and his team have overturned more than 50% of the refusals that have been appealed to the Office.  Further details are available at www.creditreview.ie. </p>  <p>  The Government remains committed to the SME sector, as reflected in the recently published Programme for a Partnership Government, and sees it as a key engine of ongoing economic growth.  Consequently my Department and the Credit Review Office, working with the other relevant Departments and Agencies, will continue to monitor the availability of both bank and non-bank credit on both a macro and sectoral basis in order to ensure that sufficient access to finance is available to facilitate participants in the SME sector to reach their full potential in terms of growth and employment generation.  This work will be particularly important in light of the outcome of the UK referendum on membership of the EU.</p></reply>

This is available on the NAMA website, www.nama.ie.  NAMA does not make retention payments to staff whilst they remain in its employment.  Retention payments are only made where staff are departing the organisation under the Agency's redundancy programme.  The retention payment for individual staff is dependent on NAMA achieving its targets and on satisfactory individual performance ratings.  Redundancy dates are pre-agreed with staff as part of NAMA's wind down strategy and payment will only be made when and if the staff member leaves the organisation on the pre-agreed date. </p><p>All NAMA officers are employees of the NTMA and are assigned to NAMA by the NTMA.  These staff have a diverse range of skills and experience from the disciplines of banking, finance, law property, insolvency and planning, among others.  The number of staff which are assigned to NAMA by the NTMA is outlined in the Annual Reports and Financial Statements published by the Agency.  This includes 50 employees who exited the Agency as part of the Voluntary Redundancy Programme.</p><p>As set out in my Department's Section 227 Review of NAMA in July 2014, the ability of NAMA to obtain the best achievable financial return for the State is heavily dependent on its retention of expertise.  That view has been strongly endorsed by the NAMA Board.  Given that, I agreed with the NAMA Board in the context of NAMA's accelerated senior debt redemption target and its ancillary residential and commercial development funding activities, that a redundancy programme reflecting public sector norms and also comprising a retention payment element would be introduced to enable NAMA retain key staff.</p><p>Staffing Numbers 2010 - End June 2016<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Staff Numbers</th></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>103</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>193</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>224</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>331</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>369</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>341</td></tr><tr><td>End June 2016</td><td>303</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Decisions on future investment in relation to flood risk management will be informed by the FRMPs. </p>  <p>  This strategy is complemented by a Memorandum of Understanding between the OPW and Insurance Ireland which provides for the transfer by the OPW of data in relation to completed flood defence schemes to the insurance industry. </p>  <p>  An Inter-Departmental Flood Policy Co-ordination Group has been established to examine the issue of flooding, and to ensure a whole of Government approach in the area of Flood Policy.  This Group is chaired by Se&aacute;n Canney TD, Minister of State with special responsibility for the Office of Public Works and Flood Relief.  The OPW are the lead agency and have responsibility for submitting the final report of the group to Government.  Each Department on the Group will submit a report to the OPW dealing with policy issues in their own area with a view to directly improving preparation for and response to flooding or strategic policies which impact on people's risk and experience of flooding.  </p>  <p>  As an input to the Inter-Departmental Group's work the Department of Finance has carried out a review of flood insurance with a particular focus on the strategies that other jurisdictions have implemented to increase the availability of flood insurance cover.  This work examined a number of policy options and has made a number of recommendations.  The completed report has been provided to OPW to feed into the final report of the Inter-Departmental Group which is due to be presented to Government very shortly.</p>  <p>  The first and most appropriate course of action for individuals who are experiencing difficulty in obtaining flood insurance and who believe that they are being treated unfairly, is to contact Insurance Ireland which operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to insurance.  This service can be contacted at (01) 676 1914 or by email at info@insuranceireland.eu.</p></reply>

In addition, a second tier of larger cases are dealt with by other Divisions.</p>  <p>  As regards offshore avoidance and evasion, I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that Revenue has been to the forefront in acting against the use of offshore accounts, trusts and structures to evade tax liabilities and Revenue's approach has set the model for much of the work undertaken by other tax administrations in this area. </p>  <p>  Revenue's investigations in that regard, have to date resulted in the recovery of &euro;2.8 billion in tax, interest and penalties.  Of this sum, Revenue's Offshore Assets Group, whose remit is to investigate the use of offshore accounts to evade or avoid tax, accounts for &euro;1.022m of that sum and the Group has, in the course of its work, made extensive use of the suite of powers available to Revenue.  The Revenue Offshore Assets Groups is part of Revenue's Investigation and Prosecution Division.  There are currently 151.80 staff in this Division.</p>  <p>  As indicated in my response to Parliamentary Question 21233/16 of 12 July 2016, while historically, Revenue's efforts in this space were set against a backdrop of bank secrecy and lack of exchange of information between tax administrations, the international climate over the past decade has and continues to change fundamentally.  Legislation has been enacted enabling a number of key initiatives for the sharing of information with overseas tax administrations.  These include the OECD's Common Reporting Standard, involving over 100 jurisdictions, the EU's Directives on Administrative Cooperation and the US Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) initiative.</p>  <p>  Most recently, revelations in early April 2016 by way of a set of leaked documents to the media from the files of the Panamanian-based law firm Mossack Fonseca have provided an unprecedented amount of information which has again focussed worldwide debate on offshore structures and how countries are going to respond.  In that regard, Revenue is actively engaging with the OECD Joint International Taskforce on Shared Intelligence and Collaboration (JITSIC) Network to agree concrete actions that tax administrations can take in response to this information. </p>  <p>  While effective cooperation between countries - as reflected in the offshore financial information that the various Automatic Exchange of Information agreements will provide - is essential in tackling this worldwide problem, it is both necessary and desirable that domestic legislation governing Revenue powers is kept under constant review to ensure that it continues to be fit for purpose.  In that regard, any recommendations from Revenue for increased powers are carefully considered.  As indicated in my response to Parliamentary Question 10831/16 of 18 May 2016 discussions are ongoing between my officials and those in Revenue in relation to Revenue powers in the context of the next Finance Bill. </p>  <p>  I have also indicated to the Chairman of Revenue that I am committed to supporting any new legislative changes that he feels are needed to tackle tax evasion using offshore structures or accounts.</p></reply>

"Qualifying assets" for Section 110 purposes includes a broad range of financial and other assets including shares, bonds, derivatives, loans, deposits, commodities, plant and machinery and invoices and other types of receivable.</p>  <p>  - The value of "qualifying assets" must be at least &euro;10Million at the time they are acquired by the Section 110 company.</p>  <p>  - Apart from the holding or managing of the "qualifying assets" the company cannot carry on any other activities.</p>  <p>  The profits or gains of such companies are subject to corporation tax at a rate of 25%.  This is the rate of tax for passive income but the taxable profit is calculated using the normal rules that apply to trading activities.  Such companies are allowed a full deduction for interest paid recognising their role in raising funding for the originator of the securitisation.</p>  <p>  A company must notify the Office of the Revenue Commissioners in advance of its intention to fall within the scope of section 110 TCA 1997.  The companies are required to pay their taxes and file their tax returns in the same way as all other companies and are subject to the same monitoring by the Revenue Commissioners. </p>  <p>  I understand that officials from the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners are currently examining recent media coverage concerning the use of certain vehicles for property investments.  Should these investigations uncover tax avoidance schemes or abuse, which erodes the tax base and causes reputational issues for the State, then appropriate action will be taken and any necessary legislative changes that may be required will be put forward for my consideration. </p>  <p>  On so-called "vulture funds" more generally, the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act, 2015 was enacted on 8 July 2015.  It was introduced to fill the consumer protection gap where loans were sold by the original lender to an unregulated firm.  The 2015 Act introduced a regulatory regime for a new type of entity called a 'credit servicing firm'.  Credit Servicing Firms are now subject to the provisions of Irish financial services law that apply to 'regulated financial service providers'.  This ensures that relevant borrowers, whose loans are sold to third parties, maintain the same regulatory protections they had prior to the sale, including under the various statutory codes (such as the Consumer Protection Code, Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, Code of Conduct for Business Lending to Small and Medium Enterprises and the Minimum Competency Code) issued by the Central Bank of Ireland and the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 (Section 48) (Lending to Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises) Regulations 2015 which comes into operation on 1 July 2016.</p></reply>

Entitlement to the tax exemption is available to charities that meet the qualifying criteria regardless of whether they are in receipt of funding from the Health Services Executive (HSE) as provided for by Sections 38 and 39 of the 2004 Health Act.</p><p>The exemption applies to Income Tax, Corporation Tax, Capital Gains Tax, Capital Acquisitions Tax, Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT), Dividend Withholding Tax and Stamp Duties in certain circumstances.  The relief does not extend to fiduciary taxes such as VAT or PAYE.  A comprehensive list of the various tax reliefs and exemptions available to charitable bodies and details of how these can be applied for is available on the Revenue website at <i>.</i></p><p>In order to qualify for a charitable tax exemption an organisation must be registered with the Charities Regulatory Authority (CRA) and must also satisfy Revenue that it has a proper legal structure, that it is constituted and operated exclusively for charitable purposes, and that it applies its income for charitable purposes.  It must have a governing instrument which outlines the objectives of the organisation in precise terms that clearly demonstrate a recognised charitable purpose.</p><p>While Revenue is constrained by confidentiality in accordance with Section 851A of the Taxes Consolidation Act and cannot provide data on specific cases or provide any information that could inadvertently lead to the identification of individual cases, I am assured that charities are subject to the same level of compliance scrutiny as any other entity in respect of the taxes they are obliged to remit.  The type of scrutiny involved could include various debt management interventions or a Revenue compliance intervention in accordance with the 'Code of Practice for Revenue Audit and other Compliance Interventions'.  Additionally, charities that have a charitable tax exemption are subject to Revenue oversight to ensure they comply with the terms under which it was granted.</p><p>For the years 2007 to 2016 year to date, Revenue conducted almost 7,500 debt management interventions and in excess of 1,600 compliance interventions in respect of charities.  Revenue also carried out almost 5,500 reviews of charities in respect of the charitable exemption and charitable donations schemes.  It should be noted however that Revenue's role in these interventions is limited to examination of the tax compliance and charitable exemption risks of the entities concerned.  Revenue has no role to play in regard to the overall regulation of charities, which is the remit of the Charities Regulator.</p><p>Where any underpayments of tax are identified the charity is required to immediately pay the outstanding amount, including any interest and penalties.  The only exception in this regard would be where it requests and is granted a phased payment arrangement.  The charity may also be published in the quarterly defaulters list in accordance with Section 1086 of the TCA depending on the nature and amount of any settlement reached with Revenue.</p></reply>

The Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2015 was enacted on 8 July 2015.  It was introduced to fill a consumer protection gap that existed where loans were sold by the original lender to an unregulated firm.  The 2015 Act introduced a regulatory regime for a new type of entity called a 'credit servicing firm'.  Credit Servicing Firms are now subject to the provisions of Irish financial services law that apply to 'regulated financial service providers'. </p><p>This ensures that relevant borrowers, whose loans are sold to third parties, maintain the same regulatory protections they had prior to the sale, including under the various statutory codes (such as the Consumer Protection Code, Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, Code of Conduct for Business Lending to Small and Medium Enterprises and the Minimum Competency Code) issued by the Central Bank of Ireland. </p><p>Additionally, following a review in 2015, the Central Bank Code of Conduct for Business Lending to Small and Medium Sized Enterprises has been strengthened resulting in the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 (Section 48) (Lending to Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises) Regulations 2015 which comes into operation on 1 July 2016.  The aim of the Code and these Regulations is to facilitate access to credit, promote fairness and transparency, and provide a framework for dealing with financially difficult cases. </p><p>Purchasers of loan books must either be regulated by the Central Bank themselves or else the loans must be serviced by a credit servicing firm who is regulated by the Central Bank.  Furthermore, it is important to highlight that the transfer of a loan from one entity to another does not change the terms of the contract or the borrower's rights and obligations under the original contract.</p><p>The Credit Review Office has information available on its website for SMEs who have had their loans sold on, which may be of interest to the Deputy's constituent.

In advance of the updating of the model this year, an analysis of the First Year/Full Year apportionment of costs was also undertaken to ensure the estimated apportionment is as accurate as possible.

Because they are treated separately for tax purposes, tax credits, bands and reliefs cannot be transferred from one partner to the other.  Cohabitants do not have the same legal rights and obligations as a married couple or couple in a civil partnership which is why they are not accorded similar treatment to couples who have a civil status that is recognised in law.</p><p>The basis for the current tax treatment of married couples derives from the Supreme Court decision in Murphy <i>v.</i>Attorney General (1980).  This decision was based on Article 41.3.1 of the Constitution where the State pledges to protect the institution of marriage.  The decision held that it was contrary to the Constitution for a married couple, both of whom are working, to pay more tax than two single people living together and having the same income.  </p><p>To the extent that there are differences in the tax treatment of the different categories of couples, such differences arise from the objective of dealing with different types of circumstances while at the same time respecting the Constitutional requirements to protect the institution of marriage.  Any change in the tax treatment of cohabiting couples can only be addressed in the broader context of future social and legal policy development in relation to such couples.</p><p>From a practical perspective, it would be very difficult to administer a regime for cohabitants which would be the same as that for married couples or civil partners.  Married couples and civil partners have a verifiable official confirmation of their status.  It would be difficult, intrusive and time-consuming to confirm declarations by individuals that they were actually cohabiting.  It would also be difficult to establish when cohabitation started or ceased.</p><p>There would also be legal issues with regard to 'connected persons'.  To counter tax avoidance, 'connected persons' are frequently defined throughout the various Tax Acts.  The definitions extend to relatives and children of spouses and civil partners.  This would be very difficult to prove and enforce in respect of persons connected with a cohabiting couple where the couple has no legal recognition.  There may be an advantage in tax legislation for a married couple or civil partners as regards the extended rate band and the ability to transfer credits.  However, their legal status has wider consequences from a tax perspective both for themselves and persons connected with them.</p></reply>

Instead, the relevant input is the estimate of the potential growth rate of the economy, as estimated by the European Commission each Spring. </p>  <p>  The rationale for this is simple: budgetary policy should not be pro-cyclical.  In other words, fiscal space should not increase when there is a cyclical improvement in the economy and, similarly, fiscal space should not reduce when there is a cyclical downturn. </p>  <p>  The fiscal space of just under &euro;1 billion for 2017 set out in the Summer Economic Statement (SES) is not expected to change materially as almost all the inputs used to calculate it under the expenditure benchmark are fixed following the publication of the European Commission's spring 2016 forecasts.</p>  <p>  Revised estimates of the fiscal space for the years 2018-2021 will be published on Budget day, based on my Department's projections for key inputs including the GDP deflator, reference rate and convergence margin.</p>  <p>  The revised GDP growth rate for last year of over 26 per cent reflects the impact of a small number of large multinational firms, and bears little resemblance to underlying economic developments.  In this regard, I want to assure the Deputy that government policy will not be based on one off or exceptional growth.  Instead, we will set policy on the basis of more 'normal' growth rates such as those projected by my Department, and endorsed by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council.</p></reply>

This is 17.5% ahead of profile.</p>  <p>  The date for the commencement of standardised packaging in Ireland has not been announced.  The Department of Health have said that the commencement of the required legislation is a priority.  Therefore the current trend of moving products out of tax warehouses does not necessarily relate to the introduction of standardised packaging.  However, separately, new Europe-wide standards for tobacco products packaging were introduced in May 2016 under the Tobacco Products Directive, and all packs must meet these new standards by May 2017.  The tobacco industry may be moving current stock out of tobacco products warehouses in order to clear packets with packaging that do not meet the Tobacco Products Directive standards in advance of May 2017.  This trend may continue into 2017, although from May 2017 no packet that does not meet the new standards can be sold in Ireland.</p>  <p>  While it is difficult to estimate the impact at this stage, it is not expected that the current trend will have a major impact on the fiscal space for 2017.</p></reply>

The proposals for the changes were also recommended in the Report of the Forum on Philanthropy and Fundraising.</p>  <p>  I am informed by Revenue that in respect of 2014, the latest year for which returns are available in respect of both individual and corporate donations, &euro;31 million was refunded to approved bodies in respect of 127,000 donors.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-07-19a.435.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016071900071#WRK01300"><p>Approved Retirement Funds (ARFs) are part of the flexible options at retirement introduced in Finance Act 1999 to provide control, flexibility and choice to the holders of personal pension plans and proprietary director members of occupational pension schemes in relation to the drawdown of their retirement benefits.  Prior to that Act, any person taking a pension from a Defined Contribution (DC) scheme or a Retirement Annuity Contract had no choice but to purchase an annuity with their remaining pension pot after drawing down the permissible retirement lump sum.  These flexible options at retirement have since been extended to the benefits taken by any individual from DC pension arrangements, generally.</p>  <p>  An imputed distribution of the value of assets in an ARF was introduced because an internal review of tax relief for pensions provision undertaken by my Department and the Revenue Commissioners in 2005 found that the ARF option was largely not being used as intended to fund an income stream in retirement but was, instead, being used to build up funds in a tax-free environment over the long-term. </p>  <p>  In an effort to counteract this, Budget and Finance Act 2006 introduced, with effect from 2007, an imputed or notional distribution of 3% of the value of the assets of an ARF on 31 December each year (subsequently changed to 30 November each year).  The notional distribution arrangement only applies where the ARF owner is 60 years or over for the whole of a tax year.  The notional distribution was phased in over the period 2007 to 2009, with 1% applying in 2007, 2% in 2008 and the full 3% from 2009.  The notional amount is taxed at the ARF owner's marginal income tax rate.  Funds actually drawn down by ARF owners are credited against the imputed distribution in that year to arrive at a net imputed amount, if any, for the year.  Budget and Finance Act 2011 increased the rate of the notional distribution to 5% of the value of the assets of an ARF, while Finance Act 2012 further increased the rate to 6% in respect of ARFs with values over &euro;2 million.</p>  <p>   In Finance Act 2014, however, I reduced the 5% rate to 4% for ARF owners who are under the age of 70 (and where the value of assets in the ARF is &euro;2 million or less).  This reduction in the imputed distribution rate is intended to reduce the risk that individuals in the age group 60 to 70 years might outlive the funds in their ARFs.</p>  <p>   An important point to note is that, while most ARF owners take actual draw downs at least equal to the notional distribution rate, there is no obligation on them to do so.  The requirement in the legislation is not a statutory minimum drawdown condition.  The only requirement is that tax is paid from the ARF on the notional drawdown amount, whether it is drawn down or not. </p>  <p>  I do not accept the implied suggestion in the question that the imputed distribution arrangements for ARFs should not apply in order to facilitate financial planning.  We operate what is known as an EET system of pension taxation, whereby contributions to pension arrangements and the build-up of the pension assets in the pension fund are both tax-exempt, while pensions are taxed as income in the pay-out phase.  ARFs, although they are post-retirement investment vehicles and not pension funds per se, nonetheless represent an alternative to the traditional pay-out phase of a taxable annuity for those who choose that option.  Pension fund assets are not taxed on transfer to an ARF.  The ARF benefits from gross roll-up and so it is only right that tax is applied at the point when the ARF owner accesses his or her funds.  As already mentioned, the imputed distribution regime was introduced to encourage ARFs to be used as intended, that is, to provide an ongoing income stream in retirement as a flexible alternative to annuities.</p></reply>

The proposed measure aims to encourage entrepreneurs and growing businesses to use public equity markets as a source of funding for growth and the creation of jobs.  Discussions are on-going with the EU Commission.</p>  <p>  Relief from stamp duty on agricultural leases (Section 74 Finance Act 2014)</p>  <p>  It is proposed that this relief would apply to leases for a period of not less than 6 years and not more than 35 years.  The land must be used exclusively for farming carried on by the lessee.  The lessee who acquires the lease of the land must be either a farmer with an agricultural qualification or a farmer who spends not less than 50% of his or her normal working time farming on a commercial basis and with a view to the realisation of profits.  This relief is subject to a Commencement Order pending State Aid approval by the European Commission.  In this regard, Responsibility for discussions with the Commission lies with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p>  <p>  Succession Farm Partnerships (Section 667D Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 as inserted by Section 19 Finance Act 2015)</p>  <p>  A limited tax relief for Succession Farm Partnerships was introduced in Budget 2016.  This is a succession planning model that encourages older farmers to form partnerships with young trained farmers and to transfer ownership of the farm, within a specified period, to that young trained farmer.  As this measure requires the approval of the European Commission, a commencement order was included in the Finance Act 2015 pending this approval.</p></reply>

Activate can provide up to 90% of project funding and will provide funding for both the acquisition of land and to bring projects through the planning process.  Its product is flexible as to term and repayment schedules, thereby enabling alignment with the cashflows of any particular development opportunity.  To date, Activate has provided finance in respect of around 800 residential units and has a promising pipeline of further opportunities.</p>  <p>  In addition, ISIF is currently exploring supporting the delivery of housing-related enabling infrastructure in large scale priority development areas.  This is in order to kick start the development process, provided such financing can be done on the basis of appropriate risk and commercial return for the risks taken.  Proposals will be assessed on a project by project basis.  ISIF's flexible approach to funding and ability to look at potential longer timeframes means it can play a role that is not suited to more traditional debt providers or developer equity.  Such finance for housing infrastructure would unblock large development sites to enable individual developers to proceed with building houses on individual landbanks and sites owned by them within the larger scale priority development areas.</p></reply>

Revenue's commitment in this regard is clearly demonstrated by the fact that it currently supports over 8,000 taxpayers in respect of almost &euro;100m of debt with phased payment arrangements.</p>  <p>  However, where an acceptable solution can not be agreed or where the taxpayer does not engage with the issue in an open and realistic manner then Revenue has no alternative but to protect the Exchequer by using its debt collection/enforcement options.  In most cases the enforcement option is likely to be either the sheriff or solicitor and once a case is referred, the collection agent is fully empowered to agree appropriate phased payment arrangements.</p>  <p>  The case in question has a very poor tax compliance record and has consistently failed to file Returns or pay tax liabilities on a timely basis.  This has resulted in both declared and estimated liabilities being referred to the sheriff for collection.  At this point it is not possible for Revenue to agree any arrangement with the business as there are still a number of tax Returns outstanding and as a consequence the total liability can not be fully quantified.</p>  <p>  If the business now wishes to properly engage with Revenue it should immediately file all of the outstanding Returns, including in respect of any periods that are already with the sheriff on an estimated basis.  Once the outstanding Returns are submitted and the liability is quantified, Revenue will be in a position to discuss the issue with the business and/or its tax advisor.  The business should provide clear proposals on how it intends to meet the liabilities in advance of any such discussions. </p>  <p>  Any phased arrangement will include statutory interest on which Revenue has no discretion and will require clear commitments from the business in regard to the timely payment of current taxes.

Since October 2015, investigations in three other Member States have concluded.  In each of these cases the Commission found that the Member States granted an illegal State Aid to the companies in question.</p>  <p>  While the Commission has opened a formal investigation in relation to one particular case involving Ireland, it has not yet made a final determination in the matter.  </p>  <p>  This a priority matter and Ireland has co-operated fully with the process to date and will continue to do so.  My Department has engaged closely with the Commission throughout this process.  Detailed and comprehensive responses have been provided to the Commission demonstrating that the appropriate amount of Irish tax was charged in accordance with the relevant legislation, that no selective advantage was given and that there was no State Aid.</p>  <p>  Last week, ahead of the ECOFIN council meeting, I met with the Commissioner for Competition, Margrethe Vestager.  During the course of this meeting, I underlined the Government's position that the ongoing State Aid case is unfounded, that there was no breach of State Aid rules in this case and that the legislative provisions were correctly applied. </p></reply>

This is because almost all the factors used to calculate the fiscal space for a particular year are fixed on the basis of the European Commission's spring forecasts in the previous year.  The Commission adopts this approach to 'fixing' the inputs in order to provide <i>ex ante</i>clarity and certainty to Member States in relation to how their budgetary plans will be assessed.</p><p>This means that for 2017 almost all of the inputs to the expenditure benchmark calculation of fiscal space were fixed on the basis of the Commission's spring 2016 forecasts, which were published before the significant revisions to the GDP figures were made by the Central Statistics Office.  </p><p>Finally, I would point out that policy will be made on the basis of more 'normal' growth rates rather than the exceptional figure for last year, which was distorted by factors which have very little relevance to actual economic developments in Ireland.</p></reply>

It applies to home, motor and commercial insurance.  The purpose of the ICF is to protect policy holders in the event of their insurer becoming insolvent or to allow the administrators of an insurance company to meet their financial obligations as they arise.  The management and administration of the ICF is under the control of the President of the High Court acting through the Office of the Accountant of the Courts of Justice. </p>  <p>  The Central Bank of Ireland has responsibility under Section 6 of the Insurance Act 1964, as amended, to carry out an annual assessment of the ICF to see if it needs financial support.  Where the Central Bank is of the view that the state of the ICF is such that financial support should be provided for it, it is allowed to determine an appropriate contribution to be paid to the ICF by each insurer.  This is calculated as a percentage determined by the Central Bank, not exceeding 2 per cent of the aggregate of the gross premiums paid to the insurer or insurer authorised in another Member State in respect of policies issued in respect of risks in Ireland.  If the Central Bank envisages a deficit may exist in the fund at any time in the calendar year after the contributions received from each insurer, it may recommend to me, as Minister for Finance, to advance funds to the ICF from the central fund.  This advance would be a loan and must be repaid to the Exchequer, with interest.  </p>  <p>  At present, the balance owed to the Exchequer by the ICF is &euro;812.3m.  Since approximately &euro;65-70m is collected each year under the 2% levy, it will take several years for the ICF to collect and repay the amount owed.  </p>  <p>  It should be noted that included in the estimate for capital resources for 2016 is a receipt of &euro;50 million from the Insurance Compensation Fund(ICF) to the Exchequer.  The estimate of Exchequer receipts from the ICF during 2016 was updated to &euro;100 million as part of the preparation of the fiscal forecast contained in the Stability Programme Update.  The estimate of &euro;100 million is made up of 2 receipts of &euro;50 million each, the first expected during the third quarter of this year and the second receipt expected close to the year end.</p>  <p>  Estimates of future Exchequer receipts from the ICF may be revised again, pending an updated forecast of the cash requirements of the ICF, as part of the Budget 2017 fiscal forecast.</p></reply>

Changes to these regulations would have to follow the normal EU approach starting with a proposal from the Commission before consideration by Member States and the European Parliament.  There is no facility under the Stability and Growth Pact to allow for a derogation to borrow outside the fiscal rules.   </p>  <p>  Having said that, it is important to note that there are existing provisions in the fiscal rules that are designed to promote public investment.  For instance, within the expenditure benchmark pillar of the rules, public investment is granted favourable treatment - as a result of four-year capital smoothing, only one quarter of the increase in public investment must be funded in the first year from within the fiscal space.  This provision means capital spending for housing and other purposes can be leveraged within the EU rules.</p>  <p>  Moreover, in line with the European Commission approach, the Government adopted a slightly less stringent medium-term budgetary objective (MTO) of a structural deficit amounting to 0.5 per cent of GDP in the Summer Economic Statement (SES) which was published in June.  As I have already communicated, this policy initiative will result in an additional &euro;1&frac12; billion in fiscal space becoming available under the EU rules once the MTO is reached.  Taking account of this development and capital smoothing we will, as set out in the SES, be bringing forward proposals for an additional cumulative &euro;4 billion in capital formation over the period 2017 - 2021. </p>  <p>  It should also be noted that the fiscal rules provide for certain flexibilities, particularly with a view to encouraging public investment.  Specifically the rules allow for temporary deviations from the required structural budgetary adjustment if spending on capital investment can be shown to qualify for either the investment clause or the structural reform clause.  Both of these provisions are subject to strict conditions; and while Ireland has not yet been in a position to apply given where we are in the business cycle, the situation is kept under constant review.</p>  <p>  I would point out that we are continually exploring how permitted flexibility within the existing framework can be optimised as well as seeking to improve the implementation of the SGP.  For instance, a number of proposals from Ireland to improve the application of the fiscal rules were adopted by the Commission last year.  </p>  <p>  Finally, I wish to assure the Deputy that ending the Housing shortage and Homelessness is a priority for this Government.  In this context, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government will shortly set out the new Government Action Plan for Housing.   </p></reply>

The Government is committed to increasing excise duty on tobacco in successive budgets as one policy measure amongst multiple other public health interventions in order to achieve this goal.  Ireland has increased tobacco products taxation in 20 of the past 24 budgets, and data from the National Tobacco Control office of the Health Service Executive shows that smoking prevalence amongst the general population has fallen from 28.3% in June 2003 to 19.2% in 2015. </p>  <p>  The PfPG also commits to the introduction of a tax on sugar-sweetened drinks (SSDs).  The tax will contribute towards important public health goals, as well providing a new source of revenue for public spending and decreases in personal income taxation.  The tax on sugar-sweetened drinks has been proposed by the Department of Health in order to reduce added-sugar in diets, particularly the diets of children and young people, and comprises one measure in a comprehensive Department of Health plan to tackle obesity in Ireland, which is due to be published this year. Sugar-sweetened drinks taxes have been introduced in a number of European countries in recent years, with the UK due to introduce a soft-drinks industry levy from 2018.  The design and implementation of the tax is a matter for the budgetary process. </p>  <p>  Stakeholders who have called for a SSD tax include the Irish Heart Foundation, Social Justice Ireland, the Irish Medical Organisation, the Royal College of Physicians Ireland, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the HRB Centre for Health and Diet Research. </p></reply>

A REIT is a collective investment vehicle designed to hold properties in a tax neutral manner.  The function of the REIT framework is not to provide an overall tax exemption, but rather to facilitate collective investment in rental property by removing a double layer of taxation which would otherwise apply to property investment via a corporate vehicle.   As such, the estimated cost attached to REITs relates not to tax foregone, but rather to the move from direct taxation of rental income in the hands of investors, to the taxation of dividends distributed to investors from REIT profits arising from that rental income.  A REIT is exempt from any tax on its qualifying income and gains from rental property, however, the REIT is obliged to distribute 85% of its profits to shareholders.  </p>  <p>  The overarching objective of the REIT regime is to remove a tax bias - caused by the double layer of taxation - which typically discourages risk-diversified collective investment in property through a company.</p></reply>

Prior to 1 July 2013, collection of the original &euro;100 HHC was the responsibility of the Local Government Management Agency (LGMA) on behalf of the Local Authorities.</p>  <p>  As part of the handover of responsibility, Revenue received the HHC database from the LGMA and carried out a comprehensive data matching exercise with its own LPT Property Register.  The data matching exercise produced a list of properties in respect of which the HHC did not appear to be paid.  The property in question was included on this list.</p>  <p>  As part of a comprehensive communications strategy around HHC Revenue very clearly stated that it could not be absolutely certain that the list was fully accurate due to the format of the information held on the LGMA database, for example, capturing the details of the person that physically paid the bill rather than the liable person and not capturing data in respect of exemptions/waivers.  Revenue also advised that where property owners received a payment demand and were of the opinion that the charge was not correctly due they should contact the LGMA or their local authority to clarify the issue. </p>  <p>  In regard to the property in question, Revenue accepts that the property owner made every effort to pay the original HHC liability of &euro;100 to his Local Authority.  On that basis Revenue will accept a payment of &euro;100 as full settlement of the outstanding charge.  A member of the LPT team will make direct contact with the person in the coming days to confirm the arrangement and complete the transaction.  </p>  <p>  Finally, Revenue is not in a position to explain the failure to cash the cheque as it was submitted by the person to the Local Authority in 2012 prior to Revenue assuming responsibility for HHC.  </p></reply>

As mentioned above, GNI is an important input into the calculation of Ireland's EU Budget contributions, representing c.75% of our total contributions. </p>  <p>  We currently estimate the impact of the CSO revision on our EU Budget contribution for 2017 as c. &euro;380m.  However, other mitigating factors mean the overall increase in the EU budget contribution is now estimated to be in the order of &euro;280m when compared to the forecast underlying the Summer Economic Statement (SES).</p>  <p>  It must be emphasised that the final impact depends on a number of variables including the size of the overall EU budget for 2017 (which is not due to be agreed until November 2016), GNI movements in other EU Member States and other EU budget operational developments.</p>  <p>  The estimate is also premised on the likely ratification of the Own Resources Decision (ORD) by all Member States this year (it is now ratified by 27 out of 28 Member States).  The ORD is required at EU level to translate political agreement on the methods for financing the EU Budget for the current Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) 2014-20 into legal form. </p>  <p>  Our revised forecast for 2016, assuming ORD ratification by all Member States, is now &euro;2,145m.  The increase compared to PQ 75 of 28 January 2016 is largely due to the likely implementation of the ORD with retrospective payments associated with 2014 and 2015.</p></reply>

Alternative measures of growth, such as increases in consumer spending, tax revenue and employment gains clearly demonstrate that the economy is growing at a solid rate of around 4-5 per cent this year.  These, and other indicators, are consistent with an economy where recovery is firmly established. </p>  <p>  The general government debt-to-GDP ratio, as defined in the EU regulations implementing the Maastricht Treaty, is the standard measure used within the EU for comparative purposes.  On foot of the revised GDP figures for last year, the debt-to-GDP ratio has fallen significantly.  </p>  <p>  Having said that, it is important to look at other metrics in order to accurately assess debt developments, especially given the distortions evident in last year's data.  In this regard, an important measure is the proportion of tax revenues that must go towards servicing the interest on our debt.  In the latest Government Finance statistics, published by the Central Statistics Office, it is estimated that around 13 per cent of tax revenues was required to service the interest on the State's national debt in 2015.  Based on the Stability Programme Update April 2016 projections, by 2021 some 8 per cent of our total tax revenues will be required for that purpose.</p>  <p>  In summary, while I welcome the continued decline in the debt-to-GDP ratio, I am conscious of the need for in-depth analysis of all the factors that affect our debt sustainability.

In total there will be 1,153 special classes available next year, which is an increase of over 100% in the number of special classes which were available in 2011, which was 548. </p><p>  For the coming school year, there will be 127 early intervention classes, 525 primary ASD classes and 237 post-primary ASD classes, which represents an increase of approx. 16% on 2015/16 classes for children with autism.</p><p>  The NCSE makes allocations for SNA support in accordance with the criteria set out in my Department's Circular 0030/14, which is available on my Department's website<i></i><i><i>www.education.ie</i></i>.  This circular sets out my Department's policy in relation to the Special Needs Assistant (SNA) scheme.  The Circular explains that SNA support is not provided to pre-school services which operate outside of the primary or special school provision.  SNA supports are provided for early intervention classes in recognised primary schools, and special schools.  This support is provided as part of the schools total quantum of SNA support. </p><p>  I recently announced that from September next 12,900 Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) will be available for allocation to primary and secondary schools, which is 860 more posts, or a 7% increase in the number of posts over which were available last year.  In total, the number of SNA posts available has increased by almost 22% from 10,575 posts, available in 2011.  About 69% of all students with ASD access SNA support. </p><p>  While there are no plans currently to change the system for allocating SNA support to schools, including early intervention classes, the Deputy may be aware that I have recently announced, that the Government has decided to proceed with a comprehensive assessment of the SNA Scheme, to be carried out by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), a significant part of which will include consultation with relevant stakeholders.  The aim of this process will be to provide better outcomes for students with special educational needs and to ensure that we are making the best form of investment for children with special needs. </p><p>  The terms of reference and timeframes for this assessment are currently being developed.  On completion of the assessment, the NCSE will submit its report and recommendations to me.</p></reply>

In addition, the apprenticeship population will be further significantly supplemented by registrations on new apprenticeships which are being developed under the auspices of the Apprenticeship Council.</p>  <p>  SOLAS and the Council are developing a plan that will set out how the Programme for Government commitments will be delivered through the expansion of apprenticeship into a range of new areas and through registrations in the existing trades.  This will include managing the pipeline of new apprenticeships already identified by the Apprenticeship Council, including those in categories 2 and 3 and looking at the timing and nature of new calls for proposals.  I expect this plan to be finalised in early September.</p>  <p>  The achievement of these ambitious targets will require commitment from a number of key stakeholders and is dependent on strong employer demand.

On the basis of this information, these redundancies do not meet a number of intrinsic requirements, including the scope and intervention criteria, of Regulation (EU) No. 1309/2013 which governs the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF).  Rather than the redundancies occurring as a result of adverse globalisation impacts, the reason being cited by the company for these redundancies is a direct consequence of the bringing into force of EU legislation, namely the EU Tobacco Products Directive 2014/40/EU.  The European Commission has been consulted by the Department and has confirmed that this rationale does not constitute eligible grounds for the making of an EGF application.</p>  <p>  While EGF co-financing was granted in 2013 in support of several hundred workers made redundant in the tobacco industry in another EU Member State, the circumstances of that case were materially different and are not comparable to the Irish case in question.</p>  <p>  In this context, the Department considers that a feasible application for EGF co-financing support cannot be made in this case.   </p></reply>

The system uses a range of data sources in carrying out nationwide demographic analyses to determine where additional school accommodation is needed.

This patronage process incorporates consideration of, and the potential for, Irish-medium provision.  It is open to all patron bodies and prospective patrons, including patrons involved in Irish-medium provision and indeed any prospective patron which wishes to provide Irish-medium education, to apply for patronage of a new school under the patronage process.  Parental preferences for each patron, together with the extent of diversity currently available in the area, are key to decisions in relation to the outcome of this process.  In this regard, as part of the application process, prospective patrons must submit completed parental preferences. </p></reply>

Guidance is defined as "a range of learning experiences provided in a developmental sequence, that assist students to develop self-management skills which will lead to effective choices and decisions about their lives. It encompasses the three separate, but interlinked, areas of personal and social development, educational guidance and career guidance". (Department of Education and Science; 2005, pg. 4).</p>  <p>  The provision of guidance is a whole school activity and the guidance counsellor due to his/her specialist training in guidance counselling has a key role in leading, co-ordinating and delivering the school guidance programme in association and collaboration with members of school management and other staff.</p>  <p>  A whole school guidance programme plan presents the range of guidance activities offered to all students in line with students' needs and school resources.  Not all students will require one-to-one inventions throughout their five/six years in second level  education.  However, for those that do, the school's guidance plan outlines how the needs of these students will be met.  Students' guidance needs are met through whole school guidance counselling activities (classroom career learning and development programmes), through group-work and individualised approaches.</p>  <p>  Students who require individual meetings to support their career learning and development, and who are making important transitions (such as transition to first year, senior cycle, further/higher education and training) are provided with opportunities to have one-to-one meetings with the guidance counsellor. </p></reply>

The range of student supports that are available include the Student Grant Scheme, the Student Assistance Fund and the Fund for Students with Disabilities. </p><p>The National Access Plan also contains a number of new actions that will benefit these target groups.  These include reaching out directly to disadvantaged communities, encouraging more students from the target groups to access initial teacher education, and addressing non-completion in higher education.  These actions are currently being progressed by my Department in conjunction with the Higher Education Authority.</p><p>In publishing the report of the expert group on future funding of the higher education sector, I recently indicated my intention to ensure that any additional funding for higher education would be supported by new performance-based funding mechanisms and new targets for improved outcomes for the users and funders of the service.  This will include new targets that will widen access to and participation in higher education for students from disadvantaged areas and other underrepresented groups.</p></reply>

While a small number of these staff remain in schools, the schemes are being phased out and have been superseded by a more extensive capitation grant scheme.  The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools in the Free Education Scheme now receive capitation grant assistance to provide for caretaking, secretarial or cleaning services.  Within the capitation grant schemes, it is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs and the Department does not stipulate how such services are to be obtained.  Where a school uses the capitation grant funding to employ a caretaker, secretary or a cleaner, such staff are employees of individual schools.  My Department therefore does not have any role in determining the pay and conditions under which they are engaged.  These are matters to be agreed between the staff concerned and the school authorities. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the above, in 2015 my Department agreed to engage with the union side in relation to the pay of School Secretaries and Caretakers who are employed using grant funding and to enter an arbitration process if necessary.  The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for School Secretaries and Caretakers comprehended by the terms of the arbitration process and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 for such staff be phased in over the period 2016 to 2019.</p>  <p>  The Arbitrator's recommendations were accepted by both sides.  My Department issued Circulars to schools which gave effect to the measures which applied from 1 January 2016 (i.e. an increase of 2.5% in the hourly pay rate and the introduction of a minimum hourly rate of &euro;10.25) to School Secretaries and Caretakers comprehended by the terms of the arbitration process and also revised grant rates.  Staff who were not comprehended by the Arbitrator's recommendations will benefit from the pay restoration measures contained in the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2015.</p></reply>

Consideration is being given to various options and potential actions that will be most beneficial for the regeneration and survival of the Irish language and of the role Gaeltacht education has to play in this.  The document needs to be discussed by me with my Cabinet colleagues.  Proposals in the document are also being discussed as part of the estimates process for the forthcoming budget.</p><p>My Department will continue to monitor on-going progress in the implementation of the 20 Year Strategy and, in collaboration with the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, will continue to support and promote best practice with regard to the Irish Language not only in Gaeltacht areas but also throughout the education system.</p></reply>

Legal advice provided to my Department indicates that the EPSEN Act, as it is currently constituted, may not be implemented on a phased, or age cohort, basis.</p><p>The Sections of the EPSEN Act which have not been implemented are those which would have conferred a statutory entitlement to:</p><p>- an educational assessment for all children with special educational needs.</p><p>- consequent development of a statutory individual educational plan (IEP).</p><p>- the delivery of detailed educational services on foot of this plan.</p><p>- an independent appeals process. </p><p>The NCSE published a Plan for the Implementation of the EPSEN Act in 2006. This report concluded that additional investment over a period of years of up to &euro;235m per annum, across the education and health sectors, would be required to fully implement the EPSEN Act.</p><p>My Department's opinion is that the level of investment required could be significantly greater than that envisaged in the NCSE report. </p><p>While awaiting the full implementation of the EPSEN Act, the NCSE has published a number of policy advice papers which make recommendations aimed at developing a better or more effective alternative to the current resource allocation model, and which aims to move the system towards ultimate implementation of the EPSEN Act.</p><p>These reports include the NCSE policy advice on Supporting Students with Special Educational Needs in Schools, published in 2013, and the Report of the Working Group on a Proposed New Model for Allocating Teaching Resources for pupils with Special Educational Needs, published in 2014.  The alternative model was piloted in 47 schools during 2015/16 school year and the effectiveness of the pilot is currently being reviewed.  This review will allow us to take into account the learning experiences of schools, principals, pupils and the views of parents over the course of the pilot. </p><p>It is therefore intended to bring into effect many of the good ideas contained in the EPSEN Act, on a non-statutory basis initially, through policy developments across a range of areas, in conjunction with NCSE policy advice.</p><p>Under the Programme for a Partnership Government, I have also committed to consulting with stakeholders to see how best to progress sections of the EPSEN Act that were introduced on a non-statutory basis.</p></reply>

The number of SNA posts available for allocation to schools has increased from 10,575 posts in 2011, to 12,040 to June 2016.  In the same period the number of children accessing SNA support has grown from approximately 22,000 to some 30,000 by the end of 2015. </p>  <p>  The increase in SNA numbers has also been supported by a very significant increase in the Budget for SNAs, rising from &euro;332 million in 2011 to &euro;402 million by the end of 2015.</p>  <p>  This has provided for a higher level of SNA support than ever before, which ensures that children with special educational needs can continue to participate in education and be supported in a manner appropriate to their needs.</p>  <p>  However, it is also incumbent upon us to continue to review the scheme in order to ensure that the scheme is meeting its objectives to support children with special needs in schools, in the intended manner.  A further review of the scheme was undertaken, which took the form of a Focussed Policy Assessment (FPA). </p>  <p>  This FPA forms part of the Department of Education and Skills (DES) commitment to the Public Spending Code (PSC) and evidence informed policy making.  Throughout this process, the priority is what the best form of additional investment is for children with special educational needs and how to provide the best possible outcomes for those children.</p>  <p>  The Report of the FPA will be published shortly and next steps will be considered. </p></reply>

This figure will increase to 1,153 special classes available next year of which 889 will be for children with Autism.</p><p>The NCSE has advised that for the coming school year there will be 127 early intervention classes, 525 primary ASD classes and 237 post-primary ASD classes, which represents an increase of approx. 16% on 2015/16 classes for children with autism. </p><p>Of these there will be 42 ASD classes in Co. Tipperary, including 8 Early Intervention Classes for children who are not yet school going age, 20 primary school classes and 14 post primary level classes in mainstream schools.  6 of these classes are new classes due to open in September 2016, 5 in primary schools and 1 in a post primary school.  This will result in the provision of 48 places in early intervention classes, 120 places for primary school pupils and 84 places for post primary pupils in Co. Tipperary.

These supplementary assignment arrangements for SNAs continue to operate under the Lansdowne Road Agreement, and both unions representing SNAs, namely SIPTU and IMPACT, have signed up to that agreement.  As set out in the LRC proposals, the supplementary assignment arrangements for SNAs only apply to current SNAs who are notified that they are to be made redundant. Accordingly, the purpose of these arrangements is to facilitate eligible SNAs who are being made redundant by one employer in filling SNA vacancies that may become available in another school/ETB.</p><p>Once an SNA with a minimum of one year's service (service in a substitute capacity i.e. covering for maternity leave, sick leave, career breaks, job-sharing etc. does not count) is notified by his/her employer that s/he is to be made redundant then s/he shall be deemed to be a member of a supplementary assignment panel for SNAs. The detailed supplementary assignment arrangements for SNAs for the 2016/2017 school year are set out in Departmental Circular 0035/2016 which issued on 20 May 2016 and which is available on the Department's website at the following address:</p><p><i></i></p><p>The operation of this panel is described and outlined in Circular 0035/2016 and it is designed to be as flexible as possible which enables all eligible SNAs, who have the requisite Panel Form 1 completed by their former employer, to apply for any SNA position that is advertised by a school or an ETB with no sectorial, diocesan or geographical limitations imposed. It does not work on a list basis. Every eligible SNA will remain on the panel for two years with a view to getting further employment. If they are not successful over that period of time in obtaining a further SNA position then they will be eligible for a redundancy payment. Furthermore, an SNA may opt out of this supplementary assignment panel at any point in time triggering the processing of his/her redundancy payment in line with the terms set out in the SNA redundancy scheme (DES Circular 58/06) or any revision of same that is applicable at that time.</p><p>It is important to note that when an employer has a vacancy to fill, they must undertake the recruitment process in accordance with the provisions outlined in Circular 0035/2016. My Department has set up a dedicated e-mail address to deal with all queries in relation to the SNA Supplementary Assignment Panel and any queries in respect of the operation of the Panel can be directed to this dedicated e-mail address: snasupplementpanel@education.gov.ie.</p><p>In regard to Montessori teachers, the supplementary panel application process for eligible fixed-term (temporary/substitute) and part-time teachers for the 2016/17 school year is set out in Circular 0058/2015 which is available on my Department's website.</p><p>Since 2006, the Teaching Council is the body with statutory responsibility and authority for regulation of the teaching profession, including the registration of teachers under the Teaching Council Acts 2001-2015.</p><p>Under the Teaching Council [Registration] Regulations 2009, Regulation 3 (Montessori and other categories), graduates with certain Montessori qualifications (Level 8 on the National Framework of Qualifications) are allowed to be registered as teachers to teach in certain restricted settings in recognised schools.</p><p>Lengthening and reconfiguring the programmes of initial teacher education is a key component of the National Strategy to Improve Literacy and Numeracy among Children and Young People 2011-2020. These changes were incorporated into the Teaching Council's Policy Paper on the Continuum of Teacher Education, which set the criteria for providers of initial teacher education.</p><p>The position is that, since the end of the 2012/13 school year, the Supplementary Special National Panel is being phased out and no new applications are being accepted. This decision by my Department reflects the wider availability of primary teachers who are qualified to work in all settings, which was not the case when this panel was originally set up.</p><p>Since 2012, the Teaching Council has responsibility for determining policy, procedures and criteria for the induction and probation of newly qualified teachers. Droichead which is the enhanced model of induction for Newly Qualified Teachers (NQTs) developed by the Council is being phased in at present and will be the only recognised route of induction for all new teachers from September 2018. In the meantime, NQTs in mainstream settings may complete probation through external evaluation conducted by my Department's inspectors. However, completion of the induction/probation process in special education settings can only be achieved through the Droichead process.</p><p>Arrangements for the Supplementary Panel will be reviewed with the relevant education stakeholders later this year to determine what adjustment, if any, is required for the 2017/18 school year.</p></reply>

Focussed efforts to secure sites in this area have been ongoing for some time. The school to which the Deputy refers is currently in temporary accommodation. It is one of a number of schools which have been announced to serve the Dublin South City area. There are 2 new schools to open in 2018, a new primary school to serve the Dublin South City Centre areas of Dublin 2, 4 and 6 and a new post-primary school to serve the areas of Dublin 2, 4, 6 and 8. Sites will also be required to accommodate schools to serve future residential development in the area.</p>  <p>  Officials in my Department have identified a number of potentially suitable permanent sites for school accommodation in the South Dublin City area and are in discussions with the vendors of these sites. Due to commercial sensitivities it is not possible to provide further details at this time.</p>  <p>  The exact configuration of schools to be provided on individual sites has not yet been finalised. A decision in relation to which school will be located on a specific site will ultimately be made in the context of the overall portfolio of sites acquired, the feasibility of development of individual sites and the timelines for acquisition, planning permission and development.</p></reply>

Locally based SENOs consult widely with parents/guardians, teachers, health care professionals, school authorities, HSE and other relevant government agencies.</p><p>There are currently 80 employees in the SENO grades in the  NCSE. These include 1 Senior SENO Manager, 9 Senior SENOs and 69 SENOs.</p><p>I have arranged for NCSE to reply directly to the Deputy in relation to information requested relating to the number of SENOs by county. The number of schools with SNAs organized by SENOs is available on the NCSEs website at www.NCSE.ie. The number of SENO posts from 2012 to 2016 is included in the attached document.</p><p>Since 2014, the number of SENO posts have increased from 67 to 69 while the NCSE's SENO management structure was  strengthened in 2014, with the creation of a new professional post of Senior SENO Manager to directly manage the SENO grades. The NCSE are currently in the process of filling a SENO position which will increase the total number of SENO posts to 81 in 2016.</p><p>The Deputy may be aware that in 2015, the establishment of a new Inclusion Support Service within the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) was announced to assist schools in supporting children with special education needs.</p><p>The service will include the Special Education Support Service (SESS), the National Behaviour Support Service (NBSS) and the Visiting Teacher Service for children who are deaf/hard of hearing and for children who are blind/visually impaired (VTHVI service).</p><p>This change will mean that schools will receive a better and more integrated service from this new Inclusion Support Service.</p><p>I can advise that work is ongoing to transfer these services to the NCSE, who are currently recruiting, through the Public Appointments Service, a new Head of Service and Deputy Head of Service for the Visiting Teacher Service for young children and students who are Deaf/Hard of Hearing and to those who are Blind/Visually Impaired, their families and schools.</p><p>It is intended that the Inclusion Support Service will be operational before the end of the year. It is also intended, however, that the existing services will continue as normal as the new arrangements are put in place, with as little disruption as possible to service users, as progress is made to transfer these services to the NCSE.</p><p>My Department is currently in discussions with the NCSE relating to overall staffing requirements including SENO posts.</p><p>This Government is fully committed to ensuring that children with Special Educational Needs are fully and appropriately supported while they attend school.</p><p>I recently announced that from September next 12,900 Special Needs Assistants (SNAs), at a total gross annual cost of &euro;425 million will be available for allocation to primary and secondary schools. This is 860 more posts, or a 7% increase, in the number of posts over which were available last year. In total the number of SNA posts available has increased by almost 22% from 10,575 posts available in 2011.</p><p>There are currently over 11,800 Learning Support and Resource Teacher posts in mainstream primary and post primary schools providing additional teaching support to pupils with special educational needs.</p><p>In May of this year the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) allocated 7,015 Resource Teaching posts to mainstream schools for September 2016, which is an increase of approximately 9% over the number allocated at September 2015.</p><p>In total, 7,452 Resource Teacher posts will be available for allocation to schools for 2016/17, which represents an increase of 41% from 5,265 posts available in 2011.</p><p>In addition, approximately 150 new Special Classes will be opened for the 2016/17 school year, which means there will be over 1,150 special classes in place, compared to 548 special classes in 2011. Of these 1153 classes, there will be 237 post primary, 525 primary and 127 Early Intervention classes for children with autism, in mainstream schools. </p><p>The number of SENOS in 2012-2015 is set out in NCSEannual reports.<table><tr><th></th><th>SENO</th><th>SSENO</th><th>Head Local Service</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>73</td><td>9</td><td>-</td><td>82</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>71</td><td>9</td><td>-</td><td>80</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>67</td><td>9</td><td>1</td><td>77</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>69</td><td>9</td><td>1</td><td>79</td></tr><tr><td>2016 (current)</td><td>69</td><td>9</td><td>1</td><td>80</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The Paris Agreement puts in place the necessary framework for all countries to take ambitious action, as well as providing for a transparency system to ensure that ensures all countries can have confidence in each other&rsquo;s efforts.  The Agreement sets out a long-term goal to put the world on track to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees centigrade above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees.  It should be noted that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has been tasked with evaluating what will be the specific policy implications of this goal with a special report to be published in 2018. </p>  <p>  The Agreement aims to tackle 95% of global emissions through 188 Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs).  Ireland will contribute to the Paris Agreement via the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDC) tabled by the EU on behalf of Member States, which commits to 40% reduction in EU-wide emissions by 2030 compared to 1990.

However, it is still open to a company to charge on a pay-by-weight basis.  Indeed, many companies already have a pay-by-weight element to their charging structure and their customers are quite happy with this approach.</p>  <p>  However, in response to the reported escalation of waste bills for customers of certain companies, particularly in relation to some proposed increases in service charges, I have actively engaged with waste industry representatives to agree a way forward that results in customers paying no more than they are currently paying for waste over the next 12 months, by means of a price freeze to end-June 2017.</p>  <p>  The operation of the price freeze by the industry will be closely monitored by Government and, in the event of evidence of the agreement being breached legislation will be brought forward to address the issue.  In this regard, my Department has met with representatives of the waste industry and will continue to liaise with operators as necessary with regard to the consistent implementation of the agreement.</p></reply>

To be eligible, tenants must meet certain criteria, including having been in receipt of social housing support for a minimum period of one year and having a minimum reckonable income of &euro;15,000 per annum.</p>  <p>  The Housing (Sale of Local Authority Houses) Regulations 2015 governing the Scheme provides for a number of specified classes of houses to be excluded from sale, including houses specifically designed for older persons, group Traveller housing and houses provided to facilitate people with disabilities transferring from institutional care to community-based living.  The Regulations do not exclude bungalows, including bungalows which have been adapted to meet specific needs, from sale under the scheme. </p>  <p>  Housing authorities may, within the provisions of the Regulations, exclude certain houses which, in the opinion of the authority, should not be sold for reasons such as proper stock or estate management.  It is a matter for each individual housing authority to administer the Scheme in its operational area in line with the over-arching provisions of the governing legislation for the scheme, and in a manner appropriate to its housing requirements.</p>  <p>  The allocation of social housing support to qualified households, including households with specific adaptation requirements, is a matter for the housing authority concerned, under its allocation scheme, made in accordance with Section 22 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 and the associated Social Housing Allocation Regulations 2011.</p>  <p>  In line with the commitment in the new Programme for a Partnership Government, I intend to undertake a review of the 2016 scheme following its first 12 months of operation.

In that time, the number of projects that have moved through all 4 stages would not provide a basis for generating a meaningful average.  Secondly, my Department encourages a pragmatic approach to the engagement with local authorities around the approval of social housing construction projects, as well as informal technical dialogue to resolve issues. That approach can result in either a truncating of the 4-stage process - for example, stages 2 and 3 may be assessed together in some cases - or it might add to the time it takes to issue an approval in nominal terms, to allow for technical-focused dialogue, but would be a more productive approach in terms of getting projects from conception to completion as efficiently as possible.</p>  <p>  The 4-stage approval process is a streamlining of the stages covered under Capital Works Management Framework and consists of:</p>  <p>- Stage 1 - Capital Appraisal (establish the business case);</p>  <p>- Stage 2 - Brief pre-planning developed design and cost check;</p>  <p>- Stage 3 - Pre-tender cost check;</p>  <p>- Stage 4 - Tender approval.</p>  <p>  These 4 stages are advanced largely in parallel with the normal local authority work on planning, designing and tendering of social housing construction projects. Therefore projects continue to be advanced while stages are cleared and the approval process does not negatively impact on the overall delivery.</p>  <p>  The time taken for advancement through the various stages will always vary, with the quality and completeness of the initial proposal and the subsequent submissions a key input in this regard, along with the scale and complexity of individual projects. During this time when projects are being advanced and reviewed, the local authority advances the issues relating to planning, design, procurement and statutory consents.</p>  <p>  While I am satisfied that the pragmatic approach to the approval of social housing projects is the right balance between getting projects advanced, while ensuring the oversight required for publicly-funded construction projects, the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness published today commits to the early establishment of a high-level Housing Delivery Office within my Department and to carry out a further review of the social housing approval process within three months.</p></reply>

The plan is available at the website www.rebuildingireland.ie<font color="#0000FF">.</font></p><p>The plan is divided into five pillars, with each targeting a specific area of the housing system for attention. Pillar 3, entitled <i>Build More Home</i>, has a key objective of increasing the output of private housing to meet demand at affordable prices.  The range of actions are summarised in Appendix 1 of the Plan, and they include a new Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund (LIHAF) with &euro;200m in funding for infrastructure to facilitate housing provision at more affordable prices.</p><p>Pillar 4 of the Plan, entitled <i>Improve the Rental Sector</i>, has the overarching objective of addressing the obstacles to greater private rental sector delivery at more affordable rents.  A key action under this pillar will be the introduction of a new model of affordable rental to provide more housing options for low income households.  &euro;10m has already been committed by Government for a pilot programme in 2016, and this is to be an on-going annual commitment.  The details of the Scheme are currently being finalised in my Department for roll-out in the coming months.</p></reply>

The library services of the respective local authorities will not be merged.  The provision of library services will remain a core function of each library authority.  The role of each authority and their respective elected members will be safeguarded and local authorities will still be responsible for the policies, priorities and budgets for their library services.

All local authorities completed and returned their individual reports, which will be collated in the National Report.</p>  <p>  From the outset of the project, a collaborative approach, which incorporated the concerns, views, advice and knowledge of Travellers and Traveller Organisations was adopted, working together in a National Steering Group with fire safety professionals in the local authority fire service and staff in local authority housing departments.</p>  <p>  The report will provide relevant back ground information and describe the methodology adopted for the task of auditing local authority provided Traveller accommodation against appropriate fire safety benchmarks which were set out in the Guide to Fire Safety in Existing Traveller Accommodation.  This review process has focussed on the fire safety measures which are perceived to be the most effective in protecting life safety among the Traveller community.  Three specific issues were identified from an early stage:</p>  <p>- The absence of smoke alarms which would alert sleeping families to the dangers of fire at an early stage and enable them to evacuate quickly;</p>  <p>- The danger posed in multi-unit accommodation by the layout of units where a fire in one could prevent people from another unit escaping to safety;</p>  <p>- The dangers of fire (and electrocution) posed by inappropriate extension of electrical connections between units.</p>  <p>  The report will describe the extent to which the process has seen improvement works carried out to address the above key issues and a range of other fire safety factors.  In addition to the physical works, the report will describe a parallel programme of &ldquo;community fire safety&rdquo; which has been undertaken incorporating training for key workers and engagement with community groups on fire safety awareness.  Fire services have also carried out &ldquo;Pre-Incident Planning&rdquo; visits to ensure familiarity with the location of Traveller accommodation and to deal with access and water supply issues in case of response to future fire incidents.</p>  <p>  It is expected that, when the National Steering Group has reviewed the draft report, it will include a number of conclusions and recommendations to clarify recommended approaches and to ensure the issue of fire safety in Traveller accommodation is embedded into future work programmes.</p></reply>

This survey showed that, at that point in time, there were 5,655 completed housing developments nationally which were not taken in charge by local authorities.  The NTICI funding is being provided to accelerate current applications within the taking-in-charge process submitted to the relevant local authority, relating to around 1,500 applications.</p>  <p>  Local authorities were invited to submit proposals under the NTICI in respect of three measures, namely:</p>  <p>- Measure 1: Housing Estates not containing Developer Provided Water Services.</p>  <p>- Measure 2: Housing Estates served by Developer Provided Infrastructure.</p>  <p>- Measure 3: Technical Assistance Funding.</p>  <p>  Under Measure 2, local authorities were invited to submit proposals, based on an indicative allocation of &euro;3.5m proposed to be made available to seven local authorities (Cork County, Clare, Donegal, Galway County, Kerry, Tipperary and Wexford County Councils) for demonstration projects relating to housing estates served by Developer Provided Infrastructure (DPI), based on an earlier pilot study, although consideration may also be given to other counties within the indicative funding available.  While the estate in question is included in the survey of completed housing developments nationally not taken in charge by local authorities, it was not included among proposals seeking funding under the NTICI by Cork County Council.</p>  <p>  Consideration of the submissions put forward by the local authorities is on the basis of the provisional funding levels available and weighted towards those local authorities that demonstrate a high level of collaborative problem-solving and leveraging of complementary funding from developer, bond provider, receiver or other sources.  Proposals under the NTICI from the local authorities were evaluated by a Steering Group, composed of representatives from my Department, Irish Water and the EPA, who considered the eligibility and selection criteria under the foregoing three measures.</p>  <p>  On 8 July 2015, I announced the allocation of &euro;9 million to assist local authorities in taking in charge 356 developments (accounting for over 17,000 households).  In addition to the &euro;9m allocation, almost &euro;4.5m of funding will be sourced by local authorities through bonds and other sources.</p>  <p>  The experience gained through the initiative in 2016 and associated demonstration projects is intended to establish a co-ordinated taking-in-charge programme to progressively address the issue on a multi-annual basis, in the light of available local authority, Irish Water, bond and other funding sources and the general Government financial position.</p></reply>

My Department is in on-going correspondence with the EU Commission to address outstanding issues in these cases as soon as possible. </p><p>My Department continues to put in place the necessary measures to improve the transposition, implementation and enforcement of environmental law in Ireland.  A dedicated Environmental Compliance Unit within my Department is responsible for engaging with the EU Commission on these issues and works closely with other Departments and Agencies, as required, in response to each case. </p><p>My Department arranges regular meetings in Dublin with the Commission&rsquo;s DG Environment, most recently in November 2015, to discuss infringements and general issues regarding the implementation of EU environmental law. These meetings provide a constructive format for relevant officials from all relevant Departments to discuss and agree a road-map for closure of pilot and infringement cases. </p><p>Furthermore, in a recent meeting that I had with the EU Environment Commissioner, Karmenu Vella, on 8<sup>th</sup>July, I reassured him of my commitment to resolving these outstanding issues and ensuring that Ireland is fully compliant with EU environmental law.</p><p>As well as working closely with EU Commission officials, my Department also engages directly with environmental NGOs on these matters through the Environmental Law Implementation Group (ELIG). ELIG was formally established in 2012 as a platform for greater consultation and communication between my Department, other Departments and Agencies, and eNGOs regarding the effective implementation of environmental law in Ireland.  The Group facilitates public participation in decision-making and provision of access to justice for the public in respect of environmental issues, and also provides an opportunity to alert my Department of any potential or actual damage to the environment at the earliest possible time with issues being resolved before any further escalation.</p><p>As a result of my Department&rsquo;s continued commitment and engagement on these matters, there has been a considerable reduction in open environmental infringement cases against Ireland over a number of years from 31 environmental infringement cases back in 2010 to currently only 7 open cases, 3 of which are the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.</p><p>Further information on proceedings and investigations are available to the public on request through contact details provided on my Department&rsquo;s website.  However, as open cases are considered formal legal proceedings, the disclosure of information is restricted to a degree until a case is closed or the Court has delivered a judgement.</p></reply>

A household is deemed to qualify for social housing support where it demonstrates its eligibility and need for such support in accordance with the qualification criteria set down in section 20 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 and the Social Housing Assessment Regulations made thereunder.</p>  <p>  The Summary process requires housing authorities to review qualified households who are not currently in receipt of housing support to ensure that they still qualify and still require support, and to ensure that the detail of the applicant households is up to date and accurate. At recent information sessions, housing authorities were reminded by my Departmental of the provisions of the relevant regulations. </p>  <p>  For the purpose of assessing households under the income eligibility criteria, the Social Housing Assessment Regulations prescribe the maximum net income limits that can be set by each housing authority to be applied in assessing an applicant&rsquo;s eligibility for social housing support. The 2011 Regulations do not provide housing authorities with any discretion to exceed the thresholds that apply to their administrative areas. </p>  <p>  Income is assessed under the Household Means Policy, which applies in all housing authorities. Under the policy, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, PRSI and the universal social charge. The policy provides for a range of income disregards, and housing authorities also have discretion to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once off. </p>  <p>  Under Regulation 28 of the Assessment Regulations, a household&rsquo;s qualification for support may be reviewed at the discretion of a housing authority and Regulation 29 provides that the household&rsquo;s qualification for support shall be reassessed at the point of allocation of support.</p></reply>

Details of these delegated regional allocations for 2016 are set out in following table.</p><p><b>Delegated Regional Allocation Under Section 10 of the Housing Act, 1988</b><table><tr><th>Region </th><th>2016 - &euro; </th></tr><tr><td>Dublin </td><td>37,160,000 </td></tr><tr><td>Mid- East </td><td>1,200,000 </td></tr><tr><td>Midland </td><td>800,000 </td></tr><tr><td>Mid- West </td><td>3,500,000 </td></tr><tr><td>North - East </td><td>1,000,000 </td></tr><tr><td>North- West </td><td>4 25,000 </td></tr><tr><td>South - East </td><td>2,500,000 </td></tr><tr><td>South- West </td><td>5,000,000 </td></tr><tr><td>West </td><td>2,000,000 </td></tr></table></p><p>A total of &euro;53.585m of the &euro;70m made available under Budget 2016 has been allocated under the delegated arrangements, leaving some &euro;16.415m million available for assignment on the basis of further needs arising.  It is recognised that, given the current pressures being experienced in the housing sector in many regions, some housing authorities will not be able to control the rate of presentation to homeless services nor programme for expenditure on measures such as the utilisation of hotels as emergency accommodation.  Consequently, as happened in previous years, housing authorities have been advised that further Exchequer funding may be recouped outside of the delegated arrangements where additional expenditure arises as a result of increased rates of homeless presentation.</p></reply>

My Department&rsquo;s funding is to support the authorities in tackling those houses that may require a greater level of remediation than the normal level of pre-letting repairs that is the responsibility of local authorities, as part of their ongoing repair and maintenance of local authority housing.</p><p>The funding from my Department has a particular focus on returning homes to productive use in a highly energy efficient condition, which contributes to Ireland&rsquo;s targets to reduce carbon emissions and helps tackle fuel poverty.  In that regard, my Department has not imposed a cap of &euro;30,000 for the refurbishment of vacant local authority units; rather, that is the maximum funding my Department provides per unit in supporting local authorities to prepare such units for re-letting in an energy efficient condition.  It should be noted that local authorities can and do contribute additional funding where appropriate.</p><p>Between 2014 and 2015, my Department provided funding of &euro;60 million to assist local authorities in returning 5,000 vacant units to productive use, with a further &euro;24 million being allocated to date in 2016.  The programme will support the remediation of over 6,500 units between 2014 and 2016, on top of units completed by the local authorities themselves outside of the funding support from my Department.</p><p>The funding support drawn down per unit from my Department by local authorities is an average of &euro;18,000.  This reflects the fact that, as would be expected, the remediation cost ranges widely and the majority of houses require only a modest level of remediation.  In recognition of the limited cases where a high level of remediation is required, my Department is also providing Exchequer funding to support local authorities in tackling more seriously derelict social houses.  This programme is now underway and I expect that the average cost per unit will be somewhat above &euro;50,000 per unit.</p><p>Between the various funding supports available from my Department, alongside the efforts of local authorities themselves, I am satisfied that local authorities are in a position to ensure that all social housing units for which there is a housing need can be returned to use. </p><p>In a limited number of cases under the programme to tackle vacant units, clarification is sought where required from local authorities on issues such as housing need, while there is also a small number of cases where the very low level of pre-letting repairs made it more appropriate to deal with the unit under normal local authority pre-letting repairs as part of their repair and maintenance work.  Arising from this, while all units proposed for remediation under the 2015 programme have been funded, it is likely that two low cost units will not be funded by my Department in 2016 - in Donegal and in Tipperary - as it is more appropriate to deal with them under normal local authority pre-letting repairs.  The number of units supported under the programme to tackle vacant units in 2015 and the numbers sanctioned to date for 2016 are set out in the following table. </p><p>The Government&rsquo;s new housing action plan, the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness which I launched today, includes commitments in respect of the better management of social housing stock, in line with best asset management practices, so that the re-letting of vacant social housing units is achieved with minimal delay.<table><tr><th></th><th>Local Authority</th><th>Units Completed in 2015</th><th>Units Approved for 2016</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Carlow</td><td>28</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Cavan</td><td>28</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Clare</td><td>96</td><td>27</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Cork City</td><td>281</td><td>115</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Cork County</td><td>199</td><td>69</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown </td><td>24</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Donegal</td><td>146</td><td>65</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>Dublin City</td><td>787</td><td>339</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>Fingal</td><td>139</td><td>137</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>Galway City</td><td>25</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>Galway County</td><td>59</td><td>35</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>Kerry </td><td>103</td><td>56</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>Kildare</td><td>20</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>Kilkenny</td><td>23</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>Laois</td><td>12</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>Leitrim</td><td>9</td><td>29</td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td>Limerick</td><td>52</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td>Longford</td><td>22</td><td>23</td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td>Louth</td><td>21</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>Mayo</td><td>86</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>21</td><td>Meath</td><td>54</td><td>33</td></tr><tr><td>22</td><td>Monaghan</td><td>13</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>23</td><td>Offaly</td><td>55</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><td>24</td><td>Roscommon</td><td>36</td><td>65</td></tr><tr><td>25</td><td>Sligo</td><td>39</td><td>54</td></tr><tr><td>26</td><td>South Dublin</td><td>27</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>27</td><td>Tipperary</td><td>115</td><td>71</td></tr><tr><td>28</td><td>Waterford </td><td>56</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>29</td><td>Westmeath</td><td>74</td><td>14</td></tr><tr><td>30</td><td>Wexford</td><td>24</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>31</td><td>Wicklow</td><td>43</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Totals</td><td>2,696</td><td>1,302</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Professionals in possession of qualifications as listed in Annex V of the Directive are eligible for automatic recognition in other Member States.  Annex V comprises the qualifications that meet the stated minimum training conditions necessary for inclusion in the automatic recognition system.  In Ireland, the competent authority for the registration of architects is the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland (RIAI), who register the persons who fulfil the competencies set out in the Directive with the MRIAI qualification.  As MRIAI is listed in Annex V, architects who hold the MRIAI qualification are eligible for automatic recognition in other Member States.  While a professional may obtain automatic recognition, further authorisation or registration requirements may need to be fulfilled prior to being able to practice in other Member States.</p>  <p>  For architects whose qualifications may not be listed in Annex V and are not eligible for automatic recognition, recognition may be sought under the general system.  Under the general system, a professional can submit their qualifications for recognition to the relevant competent authority, in the Member State in which they intend to practice, who will in turn complete an assessment and reach a decision in accordance with the terms of the Directive.  Architects who hold the MRIAI (IRL) qualification fall into this category.  These comprise of architects who have demonstrated that they meet the requirements for registration in the State as set out in Part 3 of the Building Control Act 2007, having qualified through a number of special entry routes available, or previously available, in Ireland (e.g. the Minister&rsquo;s List, the Technical Assessment Procedure or the Prescribed Register Admissions Examination).  These special entry routes have not been recognised by the European Commission for the purposes of automatic recognition under the Directive.</p>  <p>  The RIAI is designated as the registration body for the purposes of Part 3 of the Building Control Act of 2007 and is the competent authority for the purposes of Directive 2005/36/EC (as amended) on the recognition of professional qualifications.  Any changes to the arrangements in place for the automatic recognition of architects registered in Ireland are a matter for the RIAI, as the competent authority in Ireland for the registration of architects, and the European Commission. I have no direct role in these aspects of the matter.</p></reply>

I believe that economic and labour market conditions have changed for the better since the scheme was introduced in 2011 and that a new scheme should reflect that.</p>  <p>  JobBridge has been successful in meeting its objectives over the past five years.  It has helped over 21,000, mainly small, employers to provide valuable work experience to over 48,000 unemployed jobseekers.  An independent evaluation of JobBridge published in 2013 found that overall satisfaction levels with the scheme were very high, with two thirds of respondents stating that would recommend the scheme to a friend or family member. Levels of abuse of the scheme by employers were very low.  Most notably the evaluation found that about 61% of participants progressed into paid employment within a short period of completing their internship.  This is a very high progression rate and suggests that JobBridge has helped about 30,000 jobseekers to secure employment.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding these achievements, JobBridge has been subject to a high level of criticism, albeit that much of that is based on anecdote or very small-scale surveys by various interest groups.  I intend to respond to these criticisms in the design of a new work experience scheme.</p>  <p>  It is, however, important that any new scheme be informed by the best available evidence.  It is for this reason that I intend to await the results of a second large scale evaluation of JobBridge which is currently under way.</p>  <p>  You may be aware that I have asked the Labour Market Council to work with the Department in the design of the new scheme.  I am anxious to finalise the design as quickly as possible and I have asked the Council to respond to me no later than September.  I will announce my proposals for a new scheme shortly thereafter.</p></reply>

My Department continues to engage with general practitioners and others to clarify the medical requirements of our schemes so that adequate information may be provided with the initial claim.</p><p>This increases the likelihood of an eligible initial decision and therefore reduces the need for further evidence to be submitted for review at a later stage.</p><p>My Department has 27 Medical Assessors (MAs) including the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) and the Deputy Chief Medical Officer (DCMO).  Due to work-sharing, the full-time equivalent number of Medical Assessors currently serving is 23.5 including the Chief Medical Officer and the Deputy Chief Medical Officer. The delay in processing medical assessments is due to a number of factors including the increase in volume of customer claims to particular schemes and the time involved in assessing cases where there is lengthy medical evidence to be considered.  Current Medical Assessor resources are focused on ensuring that claims for the various disability and illness schemes are prioritised above other work until the backlog is eliminated.</p><p>My Department is also addressing the issue by ensuring that there are sufficient Medical Assessors available to provide a quality customer service. The Department has engaged with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (D/PER) and completed a recruitment competition through the Public Appointment Service (PAS) for the recruitment of new Medical Assessors.  Appointments from this competition and from the previous panel are being offered at the moment.  My Department intends to conduct a further recruitment competition later in 2016.</p><p>Since May 2016, my Department has introduced new workflow monitoring and management processes to improve the efficiency of its Medical Assessors.  This is reflected in the attached figures which show a reduction in claims pending medical assessment between 30 April 2016 and 30 June 2016.

Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives. To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension, all contributions paid or credited over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement. Since 1961, when contributory pensions were introduced, the average contributions test has been used in calculating pension entitlement. Once over 16 years of age, the date a person enters into insurable employment is the date used for averaging purposes. In this context, even if someone has only 10 years (520 weeks) of paid reckonable contributions between their 16th and 66th birthdays, they may qualify for a State pension (contributory), although the rate payable would vary depending on their circumstances. </p><p>The home-makers scheme makes qualification for a higher rate of State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme, which was introduced in and took effect from 1994, allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age (or caring for incapacitated people over that age) to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes, subject to the standard qualifying conditions for State pension contributory also being satisfied.  This has the effect of increasing the yearly average of the pensioner, which is used to set the rate of their pension. The scheme does not involve the award of credits.  The 2007 Green Paper on Pensions estimated an annual cost of backdating the Homemaker's scheme, at that time, as &euro;150 million (if to 1973) or &euro;160 million (if to 1953).  However it described those estimates as &ldquo;extremely tentative&rdquo; and the passage of time means that the potential cost now would be significantly higher.</p><p>&ldquo;Developing the National Pensions System - Final Report of the National Pensions Board&rdquo; published in 1993, recommended that the number of<i>paid</i>contributions required to qualify for a contributory pension should be increased to 520 and the necessary legislation to effect these recommendations was contained in Section 12 of the Social Welfare Act 1997 which provided for their implementation in two stages, with the paid contribution requirement being standardised at 260 from 2002, rising to 520 from April 2012. </p><p>Where people who were unattached to the labour market during most of their adult lives may not qualify for a contributory pension in their own right as they have paid few or no contributions, or cannot qualify for a full rate as a result of an intermittent PRSI record, the social protection system provides alternative methods of supporting such pensioners in old age. If their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension, which by default is paid directly to them. Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State Pension (non-contributory), amounting up to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate. </p><p>It is worth noting that the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund in 2012 confirmed that the Fund provides better value to female rather than male contributors.  This is due to the distributive nature of the Fund.  For example, those with a yearly average of only 20 contributions (38% of the maximum) may qualify for 85% of the maximum rate.  The Review also examined the changes in the contribution rules and the associated rates of payment which were to be introduced in September 2012.  The Review found that those with lower earnings and those with shorter contribution histories still obtain the best value from their contributions. </p><p>Work is underway to replace the &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; system with a &lsquo;total contributions approach&rsquo;.  Under this approach, the number of contributions recorded over a working life will be more closely reflected in the rate of pension payment received.  It is expected that the total contributions approach to pension qualification will replace the current average contributions test for State pension (contributory) for new pensioners from 2020, although that date is subject to change, as this is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative, and technical components to be put in place prior its implementation.  The position of women who were home-makers will be considered very carefully in developing this reform.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The Act does not cover situations of informal insolvency where employers cease trading without engaging in any formal wind-up process and their former employees are left with wage-related payments owing to them.  </p>  <p>  The Department is continuing to review the situation of informal insolvency and to establish, what if anything, can be done to provide access for employees to the Insolvency Payments Scheme in such situations.  The Department is actively consulting with a range of interested parties, including the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the Revenue Commissioners, in respect of this issue. </p>  <p>  The Department is also considering legal advice on the difficult and complex company and employment law issues arising and the potential impacts that any potential policy developments could have on existing legislation.  In particular, the Department of Social Protection is mindful of its responsibility to uphold the legal structure within which companies operate.  </p>  <p>  Officials from the Department are continuing to engage with all relevant parties to try to progress the situation of informal insolvency.  I am not in a position to indicate at this stage how or when this will be resolved.</p>  <p>  I hope that this clarifies the current state of play for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Applicants who are under age 66, including those with learning disabilities, must be in receipt of a qualifying payment in order to qualify for the scheme.  The qualifying payments for those aged under 66 are invalidity pension, blind pension, disability allowance, carer&rsquo;s allowance or an equivalent social security payment from a country covered by EC Regulations or one with which Ireland has a Bilateral Social Security Agreement.  Free travel is provided for people in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance to facilitate their caring role and support their social inclusion.</p>  <p>  Allocation of funding for the free travel scheme is dependent on a number of factors, including the number of people in receipt of qualifying benefits, the number of participating companies and routes, and fare levels, not all of which can be predicted 5 years in advance.</p>  <p>  While changing demographics are expected to result in increased numbers of people qualifying for the travel pass, notably among pensioners, the payments to operators who accept the free travel pass are calculated on the basis of fares foregone (at a reduced rate to take account of travel generated by the free travel scheme), and not simply by the numbers who are entitled to a free travel pass.  Other factors that can affect the overall cost include the number of operators who participate in the scheme and potential future fare increases by those operators.</p>  <p>  Consequently, the funding for the subsequent 12 months is agreed in the context of the Budget process each year.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

An eligible employee is entitled to two weeks statutory redundancy payment for every year of service, plus a bonus week.  Compensation is based on the worker&rsquo;s length of reckonable service and reckonable weekly remuneration, subject to a ceiling of &euro;600 per week and applicants must meet the scheme qualifying requirements.  Payments are made from the Social Insurance Fund, which is mostly funded from employee and employer PRSI contributions. </p>  <p>  A liquidator was appointed to the company on 13 June, 2016.  When a company goes into liquidation, the liquidator takes the place of the employer for the purposes of administering redundancy payments.</p>  <p>  Before payments can be made under the Redundancy Payments Scheme, the liquidator must provide certain information to the Department of Social Protection, including the Deed of Appointment certified by the Companies Registration Office, a Statement of Affairs at the date of liquidation, and applications on behalf of individual employees, with the information provided certified by the liquidator as being correct based on the books and records of the company.</p>  <p>  My Department is liaising with the liquidator on these matters and redundancy claims for the former employees of the company will be processed once all the required information is received.

The objective of the scheme is to provide regular, nutritious food to children who are unable, due to lack of good quality food, to take full advantage of the education provided to them.</p>  <p>  In recent years, priority for new applications for funding has been given to schools which are part of the Department of Education and Skills initiative for disadvantaged schools &ldquo;Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools&rdquo; (DEIS) in line with the National Policy Framework for Children and Young People, Better Outcomes Brighter Futures.  There has been a particular focus on the promotion of breakfast clubs within the programme, which provide very positive outcomes for vulnerable children in terms of their school attendance, punctuality and energy levels.</p>  <p>  Based on the 2016 budgetary allocation of &euro;42 million, the additional annual cost of expanding the school meals programme by 5% is &euro;2.1 million, at a cost of approximately &euro;840,000 in the first year covering the school-term from September to December.

Currently, to qualify for a State pension (contributory), a person must satisfy a number of qualifying conditions which include commencing insurable employment at least 10 years before pension age, having a minimum of 520 qualifying PRSI contributions and achieving a yearly average of at least 10 qualifying contributions, paid or credited, over their working life.  </p><p>Social insurance contributions (Class S PRSI) were introduced for self-employed people on 6 April 1988.  These contributions provide<font color="#004080"> </font>cover for self-employed people for long-term benefits such as State pension (contributory) and widows/widowers pension (contributory).  In addition to the qualifying conditions above, a person must have paid self-employment contributions in respect of at least one contribution year prior to reaching age 66,<font color="#004080"> </font>and all self-employment contributions payable must have been paid in full. </p><p>The State pension (contributory) half-rate pension for self-employed people was one of a number of measures which was introduced by the Government.  The legislation providing for this partial pension came into effect from the 9 April 1999 to provide a basic payment for groups who would not otherwise qualify for a contributory social welfare pension, and who did not satisfy the means test for the State pension (non-contributory).  In this case, the measure was designed to benefit self-employed people who were already over 56 years of age when compulsory self-employed social insurance was introduced in 1988, who had not paid other contributions (such as voluntary contributions, or other contributions while in employment), and who could not therefore satisfy the condition of having entered insurance 10 years before pension age.  The pension requires a minimum of 5 years contributions and is payable at 50% of the standard rate.  The pension was seen as a reasonable response to the position of the self-employed and I believe most would agree that it represents good value for the contributions made<font color="#0000FF">.</font></p><p>It is worth noting that the most recently published Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund found that the self-employed achieve very good value for money from the fund. </p><p>A person<font color="#0000FF"> </font>who is unable to meet the qualifying conditions for a State pension (contributory), or who is only eligible for a reduced rate of contributory pension, may alternatively apply for State pension (non-contributory) amounting up to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate which is subject to a means-test.  </p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

It is designed to be a temporary fixed-term activation intervention.  The programme assists participants to enhance and develop both their technical and personal skills which can then be used in the workplace. </p>  <p>  JobPath is a new approach to employment activation that supports people who are long-term unemployed and those most distant from the labour market to secure and sustain full-time paid employment.  Participants on JobPath receive intensive individual support to help them tackle barriers to employment and to assist them in finding jobs.  Each person is assigned to a personal adviser who assesses a person&rsquo;s skills, experience, challenges and work goals.  The personal adviser works with the jobseeker to agree a personal progression plan that includes a schedule of activities, actions and job focused targets.  Participants are also provided with a range of training and development supports including online modules, career advice, CV preparation and interview skills.  They spend a year on JobPath and if they are placed into a job they will continue to receive support for at least three months and up to twelve months while in employment.</p>  <p>  I understand that the person concerned is aged 61 years and has already completed 6 years on a Community Employment (CE) scheme. Under current CE rules, a person over 55 years of age is limited to a maximum period of 6 years on the scheme. The person concerned is currently not eligible to participate on a CE scheme. </p>  <p>  The person concerned was referred to JobPath on 21 June 2016. He attended a meeting with his personal adviser and agreed a personal progression plan on 30 June 2016. He will reach the age of 62 later this year. When a jobseeker is selected for any activation programme and reaches 62 years of age while on the programme they are expected to complete the programme.  </p>  <p>  A CE pilot initiative called the Service Support Stream was introduced in December 2015 to enable those aged 62 and over to extend their participation on CE beyond the standard maximum participation limits provided the eligibility conditions are met.  Participants aged 62 and over, are allowed to participate on CE on a continuous basis up to the state pension age, subject to satisfactory performance on the scheme and to annual approval by the department.  The total number of places allocated for these participants within each individual CE scheme is limited to 7% of each scheme&rsquo;s overall budgeted places. The limitation on such places per scheme is in place to maintain the overall throughput on the programme.  The participation limit is set to allow for the highest utilisation of places amongst qualifying persons and aims to ensure the benefit of these schemes are available to the widest possible number of jobseekers.  </p>  <p>  The person concerned may be considered for the CE Service Support Stream initiative after he has completed 52 weeks on JobPath and provided he is still in receipt of a CE-qualifying social welfare payment for the requisite period of time. A CE placement will also be dependent on there being such a place available on the CE scheme with regard to the 7% per scheme limit on such places.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

As such, those with a stronger attachment to the workforce, who have paid more into that fund, are more likely to be paid at a higher rate under that scheme, than those with more intermittent contributions made during their working life.</p>  <p>  There are a number of criteria which must be satisfied in order to qualify for a State pension contributory, whether at full or reduced level.  These include that the person must be aged 66 or over, and that they have at least 520 paid contributions, i.e., a minimum of 10 years.  Provided a person satisfies all the relevant conditions, they may qualify for a State pension contributory, the minimum personal rate of which is &euro;93.20, and the maximum personal rate of which is &euro;233.30.</p>  <p>  Since the contributory pension was introduced in 1961, the &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; contributions test has been used in calculating the level of pension entitlement, where the total contributions paid or credited are divided by the number of years of the working life (from their entry into insurable employment up to the year prior to their reaching State pension age).</p>  <p>  The home-makers scheme makes qualification for a higher rate of State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme, which was introduced in and took effect for such periods from 1994, allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age (or caring for incapacitated people over that age) to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes, subject to the standard qualifying conditions for State pension contributory also being satisfied.  This has the effect of increasing the yearly average of the pensioner, which is used to set the rate of their pension.</p>  <p>  It should also be noted that, where people cannot qualify for a full rate contributory pension as a result of an intermittent PRSI record, the social protection system provides alternative methods of supporting such people in old age.  For example, if their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension, which by default is paid directly to them.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State pension (non-contributory), amounting up to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate.</p>  <p>  It is expected that the total contributions approach to pension qualification will replace the yearly average contributions test for State pension (contributory) for new pensioners from 2020, although that date is subject to change, as this is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative, and technical elements in its implementation.  When proposals are agreed, legislation will be brought forward to underpin the necessary changes.  I believe that it is important that the changes be announced well in advance of introduction to enable those affected to include the new factors into their retirement planning.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

There are few western countries as consistently engaged on this issue as Ireland.  I have worked continuously to try and maintain the problems of Palestine on the EU and international agenda, despite a wave of concurrent crises in the immediate neighbourhood, and have urged stronger international actions.  We will continue to do so.</p>  <p>  I have myself recently returned from my second extensive visit to the area in just over a year, meeting the parties and trying to urge them to move forward.</p>  <p>  Ireland is also engaged on the ground in trying to combat the effects of the occupation, both through our own humanitarian work and through our support of local NGOs engaged on justice and human rights work, a number of whom are among the signatories of this letter.</p>  <p>  I fully share the frustration of the signatories, of Deputies in the House, and of others, that the process has been completely stalled in recent years, and that there is not a stronger international will to drive it forward.  I have therefore given the Government&rsquo;s full support to the efforts by France in recent weeks to do just that.</p>  <p>  The letter, and the Questions posed by Deputies, make particular reference to the call for trade sanctions upon Israel.  We have discussed this question on many occasions, with this NGO, here in the House, and elsewhere.  The essential point remains unchanged: I am opposed to sanctions and, in any event, there is no possibility of obtaining any support for such sanctions at EU level, which is where they would have to be implemented.  I have, however, been an advocate of measures which differentiate clearly between Israel and the illegally occupied settlements.  These include the guidelines adopted on research co-operation which exclude entities based in the settlements from benefitting from funding under the EU-Israel research agreement, and on origin of products to ensure that consumers are not misled as to the provenance of any products emanating from the settlements.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-07-19a.1256.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016071900089#WRCC01500"><p>I take very seriously the reported abuses in the report referred to by the Deputy and condemn all such affronts against the fundamental rights and dignity of the persons concerned.  I do not accept the contention that serious human rights&rsquo; abuses are a direct result of the EU's efforts to stem migration from Libya.  The current political situation in Libya, with the absence of a functioning government, and the existence of a large number of irregular military groups has created the conditions where people are particularly vulnerable to breaches of their human rights.  Ireland&rsquo;s efforts in Libya are focused on working with our EU partners and the UN in supporting the formation of a functioning government which will be in a better position to protect the rights of both Libyan citizens and foreign nationals.  In addition, there are several ongoing European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI) programmes in Libya targeted towards protecting vulnerable people, including migrants.</p>  <p>  Operation Sophia is working to prevent this loss of life at sea by disrupting the business model of people smugglers and traffickers who exploit vulnerable people for profit and place their lives at risk.  The Mission is one element of the comprehensive approach being pursued by the EU to address the migration crisis.  It is being conducted in strict accordance with international law and participating vessels must be ready and equipped to perform search and rescue tasks.  To date, the mission has rescued over 19,000 people.  Ireland has not, to date, participated in the Mission and there are currently no plans to do so.  Separately, over the past year, Ireland has assisted the Italian authorities on a bilateral basis in humanitarian search and rescue operations to prevent further tragedy and loss of life at sea.  Almost 10,000 migrants have been rescued by Irish naval vessels operating in the Mediterranean since they commenced their deployments in May 2015.</p>  <p>  In May, the Foreign Affairs Council agreed to extend Operation Sophia&rsquo;s mandate until July 2017.  It also agreed to broaden the mandate by adding two supporting tasks: training of the Libyan Coastguard and Navy; and implementation of the UN arms embargo based on a new UN Security Council Resolution, UNSCR 2292.  This resolution was adopted on 14 June 2016 and now underpins the arms embargo task.  When fully implemented, these measures will help towards restoring a level of stability, and assist in the building of a more effective political entity where human rights abuses are less likely to occur.</p></reply>

Given there was no majority, the decision of the lower Court stands and the Executive Orders cannot be implemented.</p>  <p>  Had they been implemented, the measures proposed by President Obama would have benefitted some of the Irish undocumented who met the criteria under the proposed Deferred Action for Parents of Americans (DAPA) programme, allowing them to work and travel more freely in the US and generally plan their lives free from fear.</p>  <p>  Achieving relief for undocumented Irish migrants in the US and agreement on a facility for future legal migration between Ireland and the US remains a key objective for the Government.  Our Embassy in Washington and Consulates elsewhere in the US are very active in advocating for immigration reform while the issue is also regularly addressed in high level political contacts between Ireland and the US Government.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach discussed the prospects for immigration reform with Vice President Biden during his visit to Ireland last month.  While in Washington for St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day, the Taoiseach and I met President Obama, Vice President Biden, Speaker Ryan, Senator Schumer and other key Congressional contacts from both sides of the aisle.  During these meetings we emphasised the plight of the undocumented Irish in the US and encouraged both Houses of Congress to work on a bipartisan basis towards a comprehensive package of immigration reform measures.</p>  <p>  The current political environment in the United States is not particularly conducive to achieving the necessary political consensus that would facilitate the advancement in the short term of comprehensive immigration reform in the US Congress.  Nevertheless, the Government, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and our Embassy in Washington, working closely with Irish American community leaders, continues to actively pursue all viable opportunities to advance immigration reform that would be of benefit to our citizens, with the US Administration, both political sides of the aisle in Congress and the US Embassy in Ireland.</p></reply>

The aim of these rules is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers best value for money.  It would be a breach of the EU rules for a public body to favour or discriminate against particular candidates on grounds such as nationality, organisational size, etc. and there are legal remedies which may be used against any public body infringing these rules.</p><p>There is, however, a recognition at EU level a recognition of the need to promote and facilitate SME participation in public procurement.  The New EU Directives on Procurement are intended to make it easier for businesses and SMEs to tender for public sector procurement contracts.  Specific measures aimed at facilitating SME participation in public procurement include the following:</p><p>-  financial capacity criterion is now less demanding; it is generally limited to twice contract value;</p><p>-  electronic methods of communication is now mandated in parts of the award process;</p><p>-  the use of a self-declaration European Single Procurement Document by suppliers is introduced to reduce red tape;</p><p>-  there is the discretion to divide public contracts into lots, with the proviso that opting not to divide a contract into lots must be explained in  the procurement documents;</p><p>-  there is a provision for &quot;consortia bidding&quot; to encourage SME involvement;</p><p>-  there is explicit provision for prior discussion with suppliers and independent experts, with safeguards against distorting competition or violating transparency and non-discrimination principles;</p><p>-  there are reductions in the time limits for receipt of tenders by 30%;</p><p>-  Member States are required to report back to the Commission every 3 years on SME participation in public procurement</p><p>These measure were transposed into Irish law in May of this year by the Office of Government Procurement (OGP).  A number of them had been accelerated into policy in Ireland in 2014 by way of Circular 10/14, which was broadly welcomed by SME representative bodies at the time.</p><p>The OGP will continue to work with industry to ensure that winning government business is done in a fair, transparent and accessible way and to ensure that government procurement policies are business friendly.  Procurement reform is being carried out in a manner that recognises the clear importance of small and medium-sized enterprises to the country's economic recovery.</p></reply>

If necessary, they may also put forward proposals to the relevant central Government Departments for funding of appropriate measures depending on the infrastructure or assets under threat.  The Office of Public Works (OPW) operates the Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme, under which applications for funding from local authorities are considered for measures costing not more than &euro;500,000 in each instance.  Funding for coastal erosion risk management studies may also be applied for under this scheme.  Funding of up to 90% of the cost is available for projects which meet the eligibility criteria including a requirement that the proposed measures are cost beneficial. Full details are available on the OPW's website at: </p><p>In May 2011 Mayo County Council submitted a number of applications for funding under the OPW minor works scheme for coastal erosion measures but these did not  satisfy the eligibility criteria under the scheme.</p><p>In June 2012 following a review of the eligibility criteria for such cases all local authorities were requested to resubmit coastal applications under the new criteria in order to be eligible for consideration. </p><p>Apart for the exceptional situation in relation to storm damage repair works as detailed below, no applications have been received from and no funding has been made available to Mayo County Council for coastal erosion measures in the last five years.</p><p>Funding of &euro;4.211 million was approved in 2014/2015 by the OPW for coastal protection repair works in respect of infrastructure damaged during the coastal storms of December 2013 to January, 2014.

Its Work Programme which is monitored by the Group is available on the OPW website sets out co-ordinated actions and activities for the Shannon catchment.  The Group has engaged in a programme of public consultation and has held a series of open days on its work programme.  It is also considering in co-operation with the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office the development of appropriate guidance that will set out more clearly the rights and responsibilities of non-statutory bodies in relation to watercourses.</p><p>I met the group on 12 July and got an update from each of the state agencies on their actions and activities for the Shannon Catchment.  We also discussed the draft Shannon Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management Plan which was published for public consultation on 15 July.  The CFRAM is the core strategy for addressing flood risk in the Shannon Catchment.  </p><p>A report of progress by the Group was reported to the Cabinet Committee on Regional and Rural Affairs at its meeting on 27 June.  The Group has not to date identified the need for any policy or legislative changes to support co-ordination to manage flood risk for the Shannon catchment.  I asked the Group to consider any changes that it considers may assist with timely implementation of the CFRAM Flood Risk Management Plans.  I will consider any proposals and report these to the Cabinet Committee.</p><p>I am satisfied that the Shannon Flood State Agency Co-ordination Working Group is focussed on ensuring the best possible level of co-ordination between the statutory bodies on the River Shannon and that it will deliver the highest level of efficiencies to add value to the Shannon CFRAM programme.</p></reply>

The procurement reform is being carried out in a manner that recognises the clear importance of small and medium-sized enterprises to the country's economic recovery. European and National rules ensure that procurement processes must be transparent and equitable in the treatment of all suppliers.  The Office of Government Procurement (OGP) has estimated that approximately 93% of this annual procurement spend goes to Irish suppliers which illustrates that public procurement activity is a significant enabler of employment and economic activity within the State. </p><p>The recently transposed EU rules on Public Procurement are designed to facilitate SMEs to tender for public sector procurement contracts.  Measures specifically designed to improve access for SMEs and start-ups include:</p><p>-  financial capacity criterion is less onerous; it is generally limited to twice contract value;</p><p>-  use of a self-declaration (European Single Procurement Document) of compliance with selection and exclusion criteria by suppliers should reduce the cost of participation;</p><p>-  the discretion to divide public contracts into lots, with the proviso that opting not to divide a contract into lots must be explained;</p><p>-  provision for &quot;consortia bidding&quot; to encourage SME involvement.</p><p>A number of these measures were included in Circular 10/14 issued by the OGP in advance of transposition; a measure broadly welcomed by SME representative bodies at the time.</p><p>The reform of public procurement across the public service is on-going and will continue to provide opportunities to the SME sector to win business.  The OGP will continue to work with industry and state agencies to ensure that winning government business is done in a fair, transparent and accessible way and to ensure that government procurement policies are business friendly.</p><p>In relation to the tender for public libraries, this is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.</p></reply>

The review was undertaken by an Inter-Departmental Review Group, led by the Minister of State at the Department of Finance with special responsibility for the Office of Public Works (OPW).  The Review Group prepared a report that was put to Government, and subsequently approved and published in September 2004.</p><p>The scope of the review included a review of the roles and responsibilities of the different bodies with responsibilities for managing flood risk, and to set a new policy for flood risk management in Ireland into the future.</p><p>Three specific recommendations of the Report, led to the development and implementation of the Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme.  These were:</p><p>-  Focus on managing flood risk, rather than relying only on flood protection measures aimed at reducing flooding.</p><p>-  Taking a catchment-based approach to assess and manage risks within the whole-catchment context.</p><p>-  Being proactive in assessing and managing flood risks, including the preparation of flood maps and flood risk management plans. </p><p>In 2005, a Plan for the implementation of the new policy was developed by the OPW, and this included the proposed approach for developing and implementing what became the National CFRAM Programme.  This Programme would be a major undertaking that is new within Ireland, and so it was hence decided that pilot projects should be undertaken to develop and test the process before rolling the Programme out at a larger scale.  It was intended that pilot testing might be undertaken over a range of catchments to develop an understanding of the different issues that might arise in catchments of different characters (as influenced by factors such as size, degree of urbanisation and availability of data).  The selection of pilot catchments was however primarily governed by data availability, the pro-activeness of Local Authorities and prioritisation based on the existing degree of potential risk and the pressure for future development</p><p>The Implementation Plan identified nine candidate communities or catchments as possible pilot CFRAM projects.  Four pilots were eventually progressed, which were:</p><p>-  The Lee CFRAM Pilot Project, which included large urban areas of high risk (i.e., Cork City), as well as a number of smaller towns and villages potentially ay risk, with flooding occurring from both the rivers and the sea.  This catchment hence included priority areas of assessment (i.e., Cork City) as well as a diverse range of factors that would enable robust testing of the CFRAM process.</p><p>-  The Dodder CFRAM Pilot Project, which included significant urban areas within Dublin that had previously experienced severe flooding, and hence was a priority area of assessment.</p><p>-  The Fingal - East Meath Pilot CFRAM Project where there was significant pressure for development leading to the relevant councils proactively seeking flood risk assessments to inform sustainable development.</p><p>-  The Suir CFRAM Project, where previous work had been done, and which was deemed suitable to be undertaken in-house to build the technical expertise to enable OPW staff to critically assess and work with the CFRAM outputs, noting the OPW&rsquo;s responsibility to maintain and review the Plans.</p><p>Of the remaining candidates projects, it might be noted that:</p><p>-  two candidate rivers/catchments were integrated to form part of the scope of the Fingal - East Meath Pilot CFRAM Programme,</p><p>-  flood risk assessments and/or the development of flood risk management measures were taken forward for two candidate communities through other projects, and,</p><p>-  major schemes were progressing to address the principal areas of risk in two other candidate catchments.</p><p>The first of the Pilot CFRAM Studies (the Lee Pilot CFRAM Study) commenced mid-2006, and the Dodder Pilot CFRAM Study and then Suir Projects then commenced shortly thereafter.  The Fingal-East Meath Pilot CFRAM (the FEM-FRAM) Study began in 2008 following a request from Fingal County Council.  The projects have been delayed by a number of factors, including aerial survey delays.</p><p>The draft Flood Risk Management Plans, which represents substantial completion of the work, were published as follows:</p><p>-  Lee Catchment: February 2010</p><p>-  Fingal - East Meath Area: November 2011</p><p>-  Dodder Catchment: March 2012</p><p>The completion of the Suir CFRAM Project is now aligned and co-ordinated with the South Eastern CFRAM Project, given the overlap of membership between the Steering Groups for both projects.</p><p>The contracted and out-turn costs for the pilot CFRAM Studies is as set out as follows:<table><tr><th>-</th><th>Contract</th><th>Out-Turn</th></tr><tr><td>Lee Pilot CFRAM Project: </td><td>&euro;1.8m</td><td>&euro;3.0m</td></tr><tr><td>Fingal - East Meath Pilot CFRAM Project: </td><td>&euro;1.5m</td><td>&euro;2.3m</td></tr><tr><td>Dodder Catchment Pilot CFRAM Project:</td><td>&euro;1.1m</td><td>&euro;1.3m</td></tr><tr><td>Suir CFRAM Project:</td><td>&euro;2.4m</td><td>&euro;2.7m1</td></tr></table></p><p>1: Projected cost to end 2016</p><p>Costs have increased above those contracted by &euro;2.4m.  Of this increase, &euro;1.1m is for additional work agreed in advance, including the development of new methods and approaches for testing in the Pilot Studies, and subsequent application in the National CFRAM Programme, and the work required to re-calibrate and validate the Lower Lee model after the flood of November 2009.  Payments of &euro;1.2m have also been made as compensation to the consultants for disruption and additional work related primarily to the delays in the delivery of the survey data. </p></reply>

This included the reporting of the maps for the Lee, Dodder and FEM-FRAM Pilot CFRAM Projects.</p>  <p>  The OPW has engaged with the European Commission on an ongoing basis since 2013 in relation to the progress in Ireland with regard to producing and submitting its map requirements in line with the EU timeframe. </p>  <p>  The OPW had signalled to the EU Commission that it could report its national predictive flood maps to meet its compliance with the EU Floods Directive but that, given the approach of the work being undertaken by the OPW, it did not consider doing so to be of benefit purely for the sake of reporting compliance. </p>  <p>  All of the flood maps were published in November 2015 for public consultation under SIs 122 and 495 of 2010 and 2015 respectively.  Since closure of the public consultation on 23 December 2015, the OPW has been updating and finalising the maps on the basis of the observations and objections submitted.</p>  <p>  All of the flood risk and hazard maps were reported to the EU Commission in February 2016.  Note that the delay from the intended December 2015 date quoted was due to the winter flooding of 2015/16 and the associated demands this placed on OPW resources.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that the flood mapping being developed under the CFRAM Programme significantly exceeds the requirements of the EU 'Floods' Directive, as it is deemed that additional maps are required to optimise the benefits of the maps and ensure the robust development of flood risk management measures.  The production of these additional maps has placed increased resource demands on the consultants undertaking the CFRAM Projects. </p>  <p>  Examples of additional mapping includes:</p>  <p>  -  Preparation of flood maps for two potential future scenarios reflecting the potential impacts of climate change - This will permit the consideration of potential future adaptation requirements into the flood risk management planning process, and can also inform spatial planning and development management decision-making.</p>  <p>  -  Preparation of flood maps for eight flood event magnitudes/probabilities, where the Directive requires only two - This provides a significantly better understanding of flood risk, and can inform emergency response given the detailed understanding as to how a flood can develop and evolve.</p>  <p>  -  Flood Zone maps, which are not a requirement of the Directive - These maps correspond to the Flood Zones defined in the Guidelines on the Planning System and Flood Risk Management (DECLG/OPW, 2009), hence directly supporting sustainable planning and development, and the avoidance of building in floodplains.</p>  <p>  In total, the OPW is producing approximately 40,000 flood maps through the National CFRAM Programme, of which only approximately 13,000 are required under the EU 'Floods' Directive.</p></reply>

The provision of insurance cover and the price at which it is offered is a commercial matter for insurance companies and is based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept and adequate provisioning to meet those risks. </p><p>In March 2014, a Memorandum of Understanding was signed between Insurance Ireland (II), the representative body for the insurance industry in Ireland, and the Office of Public Works (OPW).  This Memorandum sets out principles of how the two organisations will work together to ensure that appropriate and relevant information on completed OPW flood defence schemes is provided to insurers to facilitate, to the greatest extent possible, the availability to the public of insurance against the risk of flooding.  II members have committed to take into account all information provided by OPW when assessing exposure to flood risk within these areas.</p><p>The Memorandum came into effect on 1 June, 2014 with an initial tranche of data provided by the OPW to II in respect of 12 completed flood defence schemes and showing the design, extent and nature of the protection offered by these works.  The schemes concerned are:</p><p>-  Clonmel (River Suir) </p><p>-  Dublin (River Dodder Tidal)</p><p>-  Dublin (River Tolka)</p><p>-  Dublin Fingal (River Tolka)</p><p>-  Duleek (River Nanny)</p><p>-  Dunmanway (River Bandon)</p><p>-  Ennis (River Fergus Upper)</p><p>-  Fermoy (River Blackwater)</p><p>-  Kilkenny City (River Nore)</p><p>-  Meath (River Tolka)</p><p>-  Mornington (River Mornington)</p><p>-  Tullamore (River Tullamore).</p><p>A further tranche of data was provided to II in January 2015 covering a further 4 completed flood defence schemes.  These schemes are:</p><p>-  Munster Blackwater, Mallow South and West, Co. Cork</p><p>-  Hazelhatch, Celbridge, Co. Kildare</p><p>-  Derrymullen, Ballinasloe, Co. Galway</p><p>-  Carlow.</p><p>OPW will continue to provide data to II as flood defence schemes are completed.</p><p>Insurance Ireland estimates that flood cover is included as standard in 98% of household insurance policies throughout the country.  II has carried out a number of surveys among its members to ascertain the extent to which flood insurance cover is available in the areas for which OPW has provided data on completed flood defence schemes.  The results of these surveys are summarised in the following table:</p><p><b>Percentage of Property Insurance Policies which include flood cover</b><table><tr><th>-</th><th>13 January 2015*</th><th>17 November 2015</th><th>22 January 2016</th></tr><tr><td>Areas Protected by Permanent Flood Defences</td><td>91</td><td>86</td><td>89</td></tr><tr><td>Areas where Protection includes Demountable Defences</td><td>66</td><td>67</td><td>78</td></tr><tr><td>All Protected Areas</td><td>77</td><td>75</td><td>83</td></tr></table><blockquote>*13 January 2015 data are information from the first 12 schemes on which the OPW provided data to Insurance Ireland.</blockquote>II has pointed out that the effective operation of demountable flood defences requires accurate forecasting systems and methods, flood alert systems and monitoring, efficient mobilisation of equipment, manpower and materials and the timely and correct operation of the demountable defences.  It has identified a number of specific risks associated with the operation of demountable defences and has stated that, should a failure occur in the deployment of demountable flood defences, the financial impact for insurers would most likely be very significant.  Because of this potential exposure, insurers have limited risk appetite for providing flood insurance in areas protected by demountable defences.</p><p>I met recently with Insurance Ireland to stress the need for flood victims to have the best possible chances to be able to obtain insurance cover at reasonable cost.  I highlighted that OPW schemes using demountable defences are built to the required standard and to provide robust levels of flood protection to properties.  I welcome a commitment given to me by II to assess the risk from the deployment protocols, warning systems and emergency response systems in place.  II and OPW will begin work to share information on the performance and deployment procedures of these defences.</p><p>The subject of insurance against the risk of flooding is one of the matters which will be addressed in the forthcoming report to Government from the Inter-Departmental Flood Policy Co-Ordination Group.  The Group is due to report to me with its recommendations shortly.  I will then bring the Group&rsquo;s report to Government for its consideration as soon as possible.</p></reply>

II members have committed to take into account all information provided by OPW when assessing exposure to flood risk within these areas.</p>  <p>  The Memorandum came into effect on 1 June, 2014 with an initial tranche of data provided by the OPW to II in respect of 12 completed flood defence schemes and showing the design, extent and nature of the protection offered by these works.  A further tranche of data was provided to II in January 2015 covering a further 4 completed flood defence schemes.  OPW will continue to provide data to II as flood defence schemes are completed.</p>  <p>  There are no plans for transfer of information from the Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) programme to the insurance industry.  Under this Programme which is being undertaken by engineering consultants on behalf of the Office of Public Works (OPW) working in partnership with the local authorities, detailed draft flood maps have been produced for 300 communities at potentially significant risk from flooding.  The insurance sector was informed that the draft flood maps cannot be relied upon to inform insurance premiums, policies or excesses.  The maps are now being finalised following completion of a statutory public consultation, and finalised maps are being published together with draft Flood Risk Management Plans.  Access to the finalised maps is subject to acknowledgement and acceptance that the maps may not be used for any commercial, business, professional or other income generating activity.</p>  <p>  Insurance Ireland estimates that flood cover is included as standard in 98% of household insurance policies throughout the country.  II has carried out a number of surveys among its members to ascertain the extent to which flood insurance cover is available in the areas for which OPW has provided data on completed flood defence schemes.  The results of the most recent survey were provided in January of this year; they indicate that 83% of property insurance policies in these areas include cover against flood risk.  Where the defences are permanent in nature the percentage is 89%; where demountable defences are used the percentage is 78%.</p>  <p>  II has pointed out that the effective operation of demountable flood defences requires accurate forecasting systems and methods, flood alert systems and monitoring, efficient mobilisation of equipment, manpower and materials and the timely and correct operation of the demountable defences.  It has identified a number of specific risks associated with the operation of demountable defences and has stated that, should a failure occur in the deployment of demountable flood defences, the financial impact for insurers would most likely be very significant.  Because of this potential exposure, insurers have limited risk appetite for providing flood insurance in areas protected by demountable defences.</p>  <p>  I met recently with Insurance Ireland to stress the need for flood victims to have the best possible chances to be able to obtain insurance cover at reasonable cost.  I highlighted that OPW schemes using demountable defences are built to the required standard and to provide robust levels of flood protection to properties.  I welcome a commitment given to me by II to assess the risk from the deployment protocols, warning systems and emergency response systems in place.  II and OPW will begin work to share information on the performance and deployment procedures of these defences.</p>  <p>  The subject of insurance against the risk of flooding is one of the matters which will be addressed in the forthcoming report to Government from the Inter-Departmental Flood Policy Co-Ordination Group.  The Group is due to report to me with its recommendations shortly.  I will then bring the Group&rsquo;s report to Government for its consideration as soon as possible.</p></reply>

The Programme involves the production of predictive flood mapping for 300 locations nationwide (Areas for Further Assessment or AFAs), the development of preliminary flood risk management options and the production of flood risk management plans.  The CFRAM flood risk and hazard mapping is being finalised following the conclusion of the national statutory public consultation process on 23rd December, 2015. </p><p>Following the finalisation of the flood mapping and the preliminary flood risk management options, the final output from this important project will be integrated Flood Risk Management Plans containing specific measures to address in a comprehensive and sustainable way the significant flood risks identified.</p><p>The draft Plans are being made available for public consultation on a rolling basis from Friday 15th July, 2016.  The draft Plans for the Shannon and South Western River Basin Districts will be available first, from two of the six CFRAM study areas.  This public consultation will run for ten weeks until Friday 23rd September 2016.  Further details are available on the dedicated consultation website www.opw.ie/FloodPlans.  Copies of the draft Plans, related Environmental Assessments and an information leaflet are also available at the principal offices of each local authority.  Observations or comments must be made directly in writing to the Office of Public Works (OPW) or via the email address . </p><p>Following the public consultation process, the draft Plans will be finalised taking on board the comments received.  The finalised Plans will include a prioritised list of measures, both structural and non-structural, to address flood risk in an environmentally sustainable and cost effective manner.  The Plans, scheduled to be completed by the end of 2016, will then be sent to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform who may approve the Plans, refuse to approve them, or refer the Plans back to the Commissioners for revision.  If approved by the Minister, they will be sent to the local authorities who will have three months to consider and examine them.  The councils may decide to adopt them or otherwise. </p><p>The Government recently announced increased levels of investment in the area of flood relief as part of the overall Capital Investment Plan 2016-2021 and this investment programme will allow for consideration of measures arising from the Flood Risk Management Plans. </p></reply>

Kerry County Council may carry out flood mitigation works using its own resources.  The Council may also apply to the Office of Public Works (OPW) for funding of flood mitigation works under the Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme.  The purpose of this scheme is to provide funding to local authorities to undertake minor works to address localised flooding and coastal protection problems within their administrative areas.  The scheme generally applies to relatively straightforward cases where a solution can be readily identified and achieved in a short time frame.  Any application received will be considered in accordance with the scheme eligibility criteria, including a requirement that any measures are cost beneficial, and having regard to the overall availability of resources for flood risk management.

The Department has responsibility for all the matters that previously came within the remit of the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, which was itself established on 2 June 2011, and in addition is also responsible for certain functions transferred from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and from the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  The details requested by the Deputy in respect of the nine reports commissioned by the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht are set out in the Table below. </p><p>Contracts for the provision of services are not included in this Table. I would also point out that my Department also commissions engineering or environmental experts from time to time to provide technical reports on specific issues, as required.  While the providers of these services are consultant engineers, environmental consultants or may describe themselves in other such terms, their work is not classified as consultancy services and is not funded from my Department's Administrative Budget. </p><p>The &quot;<i>Review of PSO Air Service for the Aran Islands</i>&quot; and <i>&quot;Review of financial submissions relating to the Public Service Obligation Air Service for the Aran Islands&quot; </i>were published in 2014. The &quot;<i>Updated Business Case for</i><i>Restoring the Ulster Canal from Lough Erne to Clones&quot; </i>and the<i>&quot;Cost Benefit Analysis of the National Gallery Redevelopment Project&quot;</i>were published in 2015.  The remaining reports have not been published and publication of these reports will be considered on case by case basis.</p><p>For completeness, I wish to provide information to the Deputy in relation to three reports commissioned by other Departments in relation to matters that are now the responsibility of my Department.  The University of Birmingham was commissioned in 2010 by the then Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, to undertake a review relating to peatlands. The resulting report, &quot;<i>Review of Archaeological Survey and Mitigation Policy relating to Bord na M&oacute;na Peatlands</i>&quot; was published in June 2013 and the associated costs of &euro;34,337 were met by the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.</p><p>In 2015, the then Department of Environment, Community, and Local Government commissioned a Review of Comhairle na Tuaithe and the implementation of the National Countryside Recreation Strategy.  This report was completed by ILC Sports and Recreation at a cost of &euro;15,341.  The final report was received earlier this year but has not yet been published.</p><p>Finally, the then Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources published the Final Report of the Post Office Network Business Development Group in January 2016.

I can assure the Deputy that I will be engaging with my colleagues in Government and with the Oireachtas to seek to advance this commitment in the context of the forthcoming estimates and budgetary processes. </p><p>I understand that the figures quoted by the Deputy are from a Council of Europe project called <i>Compendium - Cultural Policies and Trends in Europe</i>.

Once adopted by the Commission, these sites are known as candidate special areas of conservation in Ireland.  Legal protections, commensurate with those set out in the EU Habitats Directive, apply to the sites since initially proposed for designation and Ireland&rsquo;s planning and environmental legislation takes the proposed designations into account.  The additional technical steps to formal designation do not affect the legal protection of a site.</p>  <p>  Ireland has 430 areas identified for designation as special areas of conservation.  Most of these were proposed for designation between 1997 and 2005, with some more recent additions in the marine environment. </p>  <p>  Under the Habitats Directive, formal designation must be completed within 6 years of a candidate special area of conservation being adopted by the European Commission.  With the 6 year period passed for most of the sites in question, the Commission opened an infringement case against Ireland in February 2015. The case is understood to be a horizontal action with proceedings also issued against a number of other Member States. </p>  <p>  A project has been put in place within my Department to oversee formal designation of all special areas of conservation.  This has involved a significant amount of scientific work to ensure that boundaries of sites are cleared of appeals and finalised for designation, and updating the mapping format used to provide the most accurate and user friendly information to all parties, particularly landowners. </p>  <p>  The final phase of formal designation involves the signing of a Statutory Instrument for each special area of conservation.  That process began earlier this year and some 86 special areas of conservation have now been designated by Statutory Instrument.  Work is continuing with the aim of formally designating all remaining special areas of conservation as early as possible.</p>  <p>  While there is no explicit obligation under the Habitats Directive to develop site specific conservation objectives, these are being produced by my Department in order to define the conditions to be achieved by species and habitat types within the respective sites which will in turn maximize the contribution of the sites to achieving favourable conservation status at various levels.  These site specific conservation objectives continue to be developed on a prioritised basis, with some 129 published to date in relation to special areas of conservation. </p>  <p>  A strategy for the establishment and improved coordination and delivery of conservation measures at site level has been recently developed.  A detailed structure and enhanced programme of work will be put in place with the aim of developing and implementing conservation measures.  This will be a significant programme of work, but one that has the potential to ensure the protection and restoration of species and habitats.  In the longer-term, there are significant economic benefits to be realised through the effective management and restoration of special areas of conservation and the subsequent benefits to issues such as climate change mitigation, flood risk management, water quality and pollination.</p></reply>

To date in 2016, approximately &euro;1.2m has been expended on projects under LEADER 2007-2013, with a further estimated &euro;0.7m to be spent before year-end.  The remaining allocation, some &euro;38m, was earmarked to cover preparatory support for the development of LEADER strategies, transitional funding for local development companies in the interregnum between the LEADER programmes and the costs associated with the implementation of the local development strategies under LEADER 2014-2020, including administration, animation and project expenditure.</p>  <p>  Spend on administration, animation and projects will be impacted by the timing of the roll-out of the programme in 2016, as well as the level of demand and eligible applications submitted locally.  For this reason, it is not possible at this time to determine with certainty the level of expenditure on projects under the new programme for the remainder of the year.  Matters will become clearer, however, once the programme is rolled-out in all LEADER areas and the level of demand at local level is quantified.  That said, while expenditure on animation activity and running costs tends to be higher in the earlier stages of the programme, I can assure the Deputy that a strong emphasis is being placed on progressing projects and maximising spend in 2016 with a view to securing the best outcomes for our rural communities.</p></reply>

The Department of Children and Youth Affairs has brought forward a new model of supports to facilitate the full participation of children with a disability in the ECCE Programme.  The new model, called the Better Starts Access and Inclusion Model (AIM) provides supports including enhanced continuing professional development for early years practitioners; grants for equipment, appliances and minor alterations; and access to therapeutic intervention.  Funding of &euro;15m has been provided to phase these supports in during 2016.  Full year costs for these supports are estimated to be &euro;33 from 2017 onwards.  This model of supports was launched on 18th November last by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs with the full support of both the Department of Health and the Department of Education and Skills.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives, provide greater independence in accessing the services they choose and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.  This commitment is outlined in the Programme for Partnership Government, which is guided by two principles: equality of opportunity and improving the quality of life for people with disabilities.</p>  <p>  Improving access to therapy services for children in primary care and in disability services is a particular priority for the Government.  Building on additional investment in recent years, funding of &euro;8m is being provided to the HSE in 2016 to expand the provision of Speech and Language Therapy in primary care and the further development of early intervention therapy services under the Progressing Disabilities Programme to facilitate the inclusion of children with a disability in mainstream pre-school settings, as part of the roll out of the new inclusive pre-schools model.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that while the Health Services executive has no statutory obligation to provide assistant supports for children with special needs wishing to avail of the ECCE scheme, it has, to date, worked at local level and in partnership with the relevant disability services to address individual needs as they arise.  This has been done for example, by funding special pre-schools that cater specifically for children with disabilities.  In some limited and specific cases at local level, disability services have in the past also facilitated children with a disability to attend mainstream pre-schools by providing additional supports where possible and where resources are available.  When introducing AIM, there was specific emphasis on the fact that all existing supports, should remain in place until the new model is fully embedded in the system.  This approach was agreed by the three Government Departments involved in the development of the model and remains the policy position.</p>  <p>  Within this context, I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy.  If the Deputy has not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days he should contact my Private Office and they will follow up the matter with them.</p></reply>

The Department is awaiting receipt of the HSE's evaluation of the CRC submission and their recommendation on how to address the pension issues with the CRC.</p>  <p>  On receipt of this evaluation, my Department will, in conjunction with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, urgently examine the HSE recommendation in the context of current policy and legislation in relation to superannuation.</p>  <p>  By way of background, I would like to clarify that employment in a public service body does not determine the type of pension scheme that is available to an individual employee.  There are a variety of pension schemes that operate in the public service depending on when and how an individual enters the public service.  In general, the majority of public servants are members of various public service &lsquo;pay as you go&rsquo; Defined Benefit (DB) schemes which may have different minimum pension age, accrual terms, contribution rates etc.  In addition, some employees of Section 38 agencies are members of funded Defined Benefit pension schemes which are administered by scheme trustees while others are members of Defined Contribution (DC) schemes.  New entrants to the public service recruited on or after 1 January 2013 are generally members of the Single Public Service Pension Scheme (SPSPS) and have career average pension benefits.   </p></reply>

It is not about closing Emergency Departments or diminishing services.  There are currently no plans to close or remove trauma services from any hospital.</p>  <p>  A trauma patient needs access to the best service that has the right resources to match their often multiple and critical needs in the shortest time possible.  The aim of developing national policy on trauma networks is to ensure that trauma patients are brought to the right place at the right time for the right care so they can make the best recovery possible.  It is about building on the strengths of pre-hospital care, all of our acute hospitals and post-acute services to provide an optimal configuration of trauma services.  The implementation of Hospital Groups provides an opportunity for hospitals to work together to enhance trauma services for patients.</p>  <p>  The need for a national trauma system has been recognised for many years.  In June 2015 the National Clinical Programme for Trauma and Orthopaedic Surgery published the Model of Care for trauma and orthopaedic surgery and strongly recommended that a national approach to trauma services should be taken.  The RCSI (the professional body representing all surgeons and emergency medicine specialists) also called for its establishment at their annual scientific meeting last year.  </p>  <p>  Last year, the then Minister for Health appointed a National Steering Group to develop policy on a major trauma system for Ireland.  This is a joint initiative from the Department of Health and the HSE, developed in recognition that we do not have a coordinated trauma network structure in Ireland.  </p>  <p>  The Steering Group has been working with the Department of Health, the HSE and all relevant HSE National Clinical Leads, including Surgery, Pre-Hospital Emergency Care, Critical Care,  Orthopaedics and Trauma on the development of the policy.  The group has not yet reported, I have not seen any output from this group and the Group's recommendations are not expected until later this year.</p></reply>

It is not about closing Emergency Departments or diminishing services.  There are currently no plans to close or remove trauma services from any hospital.</p>  <p>  A trauma patient needs access to the best service that has the right resources to match their often multiple and critical needs in the shortest time possible.  The aim of developing national policy on trauma networks is to ensure that trauma patients are brought to the right place at the right time for the right care so they can make the best recovery possible.  It is about building on the strengths of pre-hospital care, all of our acute hospitals and post-acute services to provide an optimal configuration of trauma services.  The implementation of Hospital Groups provides an opportunity for hospitals to work together to enhance trauma services for patients.</p>  <p>  The need for a national trauma system has been recognised for many years.  In June 2015 the National Clinical Programme for Trauma and Orthopaedic Surgery published the Model of Care for trauma and orthopaedic surgery and strongly recommended that a national approach to trauma services should be taken.  The RCSI (the professional body representing all surgeons and emergency medicine specialists) also called for its establishment at their annual scientific meeting last year.  </p>  <p>  Last year, the then Minister for Health appointed a National Steering Group to develop policy on a major trauma system for Ireland.  This is a joint initiative from the Department of Health and the HSE, developed in recognition that we do not have a coordinated trauma network structure in Ireland.  </p>  <p>  The Steering Group has been working with the Department of Health, the HSE and all relevant HSE National Clinical Leads, including Surgery, Pre-Hospital Emergency Care, Critical Care,  Orthopaedics and Trauma on the development of the policy.  The group has not yet reported, I have not seen any output from this group and the Group's recommendations are not expected until later this year.</p></reply>

Additional funding of &euro;1.042m was allocated under the 2015 Service Plan to increase capacity at OLCHC, and an additional orthopaedic surgeon, anaesthetist, and support staff, are now in place with recruitment of a further additional orthopaedic surgeon underway. Capital funding was also provided for a new theatre on site to expand theatre capacity further, and this is currently being commissioned.  The Children's Hospital Group is proactively working on nurse recruitment to support the opening of the new theatre. </p>  <p>  In the interim, significant external capacity was sourced in 2015 for OLCHC patients and 66 patients have been treated at other hospitals, including the Blackrock Clinic and the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital, Stanmore, UK. Further potential for additional external capacity to address waiting times is being examined.  My Department will continue to work with the HSE and the relevant hospitals to ensure improvements in access to spinal surgery.  </p></reply>

NIAC is a committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland comprising of experts in a number of specialties including infectious diseases, paediatrics and public health.  The committee's recommendations are informed by public health advice and international best practice.  In 2009, NIAC recommended HPV vaccination for all 12 year old girls, and in September 2010, the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in the first year of second level schools.  The HPV vaccine protects girls from developing cervical cancer when they are adults.  It is available free of charge from the HSE for all girls in 1st year of secondary school and over 200,000 girls have received the vaccine since its introduction . </p>  <p>  In Ireland, the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) is the regulatory authority for medicines in Ireland and is the appropriate authority to which possible adverse reactions to medicinal products should be reported.  In November 2015, the European Medicines Agency completed a detailed scientific review of the HPV vaccine.  The review which the HPRA participated in, specifically focused on rare reports of two conditions, complex regional pain syndrome and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome associated with heart rate increase.  The outcome of the review which was carried out by the EMA Pharmacovigilance and Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) found no evidence of a causal link between the vaccine and the two conditions examined.  The European Medicines Agency has advised healthcare professionals that available data does not warrant any change to the use of HPV vaccines as there are no new safety concerns regarding HPV vaccines.  Healthcare professionals should therefore continue using the vaccines in accordance with the current product information.  On 12 January 2016, the European Commission endorsed the conclusion of the European Medicines Agency stating that there is no need to change the way HPV vaccines are used or to amend the product information.  This final outcome by the Commission is now binding in all member states. </p>  <p>  I am aware of claims of an association between HPV vaccination and a number of symptoms experienced by a group of young women.  It appears that some girls first suffered symptoms around the time they received the HPV vaccine, and understandably some parents have connected the vaccine to their daughter's condition.  I want to provide assurances that, as well as being eligible to seek medical attention and to access appropriate health and social care services, irrespective of the cause of their symptoms, the HSE will be in a position to facilitate access to specialist services as required due to the individual nature of the needs of some children.</p></reply>

There are a variety of pension schemes that operate in the public service depending on when and how an individual enters the public service.  In general, the majority of public servants are members of various public service &lsquo;pay as you go&rsquo; Defined Benefit (DB) schemes which may have different minimum pension age, accrual terms, contribution rates etc.  In addition, some employees of Section 38 agencies are members of funded Defined Benefit pension schemes which are administered by scheme trustees while others are members of Defined Contribution (DC) schemes.  New entrants to the public service recruited on or after 1 January 2013 are generally members of the Single Public Service Pension Scheme (SPSPS) and have career average pension benefits.   </p></reply>

The Department of Children and Youth Affairs has brought forward a new model of supports to facilitate the full participation of children with a disability in the ECCE Programme.  The new model, called the Better Starts Access and Inclusion Model (AIM) provides supports including enhanced continuing professional development for early years practitioners; grants for equipment, appliances and minor alterations; and access to therapeutic intervention.  Funding of &euro;15m has been provided to phase these supports in during 2016.  Full year costs for these supports are estimated to be &euro;33 from 2017 onwards.  This model of supports was launched on 18th November last by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs with the full support of both the Department of Health and the Department of Education and Skills.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives, provide greater independence in accessing the services they choose and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.  This commitment is outlined in the Programme for Partnership Government, which is guided by two principles: equality of opportunity and improving the quality of life for people with disabilities.</p>  <p>  Improving access to therapy services for children in primary care and in disability services is a particular priority for the Government.  Building on additional investment in recent years, funding of &euro;8m is being provided to the HSE in 2016 to expand the provision of Speech and Language Therapy in primary care and the further development of early intervention therapy services under the Progressing Disabilities Programme to facilitate the inclusion of children with a disability in mainstream pre-school settings, as part of the roll out of the new inclusive pre-schools model.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that while the Health Services executive has no statutory obligation to provide assistant supports for children with special needs wishing to avail of the ECCE scheme, it has, to date, worked at local level and in partnership with the relevant disability services to address individual needs as they arise.  This has been done for example, by funding special pre-schools that cater specifically for children with disabilities.  In some limited and specific cases at local level, disability services have in the past also facilitated children with a disability to attend mainstream pre-schools by providing additional supports where possible and where resources are available.  When introducing AIM, there was specific emphasis on the fact that all existing supports, should remain in place until the new model is fully embedded in the system.  This approach was agreed by the three Government Departments involved in the development of the model and remains the policy position.</p>  <p>  Within this context, I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy.  If you have not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days please contact my Private Office and they will follow up the matter with them.</p></reply>

The strategy sets out a number of objectives and a road map for the delivery and implementation of eHealth, part of which is the development of an electronic health record (EHR) programme.  The Office of the Chief Information Officer in the HSE has recently submitted a detailed business case for the programme.  My Department is currently evaluating how this might be progressed particularly in delivering an EHR in the context of the work being planned for the New Children&rsquo;s Hospital which aspires to be the first digital hospital facility in the country. In developing a national electronic health record programme we must build on the progress to date in ICT deployment but also on the lessons learnt from other jurisdictions in developing an optimum solution for Ireland.  This programme, if progressed, will require a substantial investment in healthcare ICT.  It also offers the opportunity for a more patient centred and a more integrated approach along with significant efficiencies.  The business case highlights a number of optional timescales and investment approaches which will need to be considered.  The scale of the task in implementing an electronic health record programme is very large and requires a complex procurement and approval process.  It is a five to ten year programme of work depending on the scale of resources deployed.  </p><p>Two current legislative initiatives will help support the EHR - the Health Identifiers Act, 2014 is providing a legal basis for a system of identifiers in the health sector and the Health Information and Patient Safety Bill, currently being drafted, includes provisions for the making of standards to support interoperability of health care computer systems.  An EHR implementation will however require a robust legal framework to ensure confidentiality and security of patient data and must be consistent with the new EU data protection regulation, Regulation (EU) 2016/679.  My Department is currently examining the appropriate information framework that will provide the optimum environment to support eHealth and the deployment of electronic health records in the future.  The health care delivery system straddles both the public and private domains and requires an information governance environment to ensure the right information about the right patient is available securely, in the right place and at the right time.  A critically important aspect in the deployment of an EHR is the empowerment of patients to access and partake in managing their own data.  In developing new information structures to support health care, substantial engagement with patients and the public will be required along with other stakeholders such as the Office of the Data Protection Commissioners and the Health Information and Quality Authority.</p></reply>

There are currently no plans to close or remove trauma services from any hospital.</p>  <p>  A trauma patient needs access to the best service that has the right resources to match their often multiple and critical needs in the shortest time possible.  The aim of developing national policy on trauma networks is to ensure that trauma patients are brought to the right place at the right time for the right care so they can make the best recovery possible.  It is about building on the strengths of pre-hospital care, all of our acute hospitals and post-acute services to provide an optimal configuration of trauma services.  The implementation of Hospital Groups provides an opportunity for hospitals to work together to enhance trauma services for patients.</p>  <p>  The need for a national trauma system has been recognised for many years.  In June 2015 the National Clinical Programme for Trauma and Orthopaedic Surgery published the Model of Care for trauma and orthopaedic surgery and strongly recommended that a national approach to trauma services should be taken.  The RCSI (the professional body representing all surgeons and emergency medicine specialists) also called for its establishment at their annual scientific meeting last year.  </p>  <p>  Last year, the then Minister for Health appointed a National Steering Group to develop policy on a major trauma system for Ireland.  This is a joint initiative from the Department of Health and the HSE, developed in recognition that we do not have a coordinated trauma network structure in Ireland.  </p>  <p>  The Steering Group has been working with the Department of Health, the HSE and all relevant HSE National Clinical Leads, including Surgery, Pre-Hospital Emergency Care, Critical Care, Orthopaedics and Trauma on the development of the policy.  The group has not yet reported, I have  not seen any output from this group and the Group's recommendations are not expected until later this year.</p></reply>

This commitment is outlined in the Programme for Partnership Government, which is guided by two principles:  equality of opportunity and improving the quality of life for people with disabilities.  </p>  <p>  With regard to assisted living services, the Health Service Executive's (HSE's) priority in the 2016 National Service Plan is to protect the level of services provided in 2015 and to provide 1.3 million hours of Personal Assistant services to 2,000 people with a physical/sensory disability and 2.6 million hours of Home Support to 7,300 people with a range of disabilities.  The provision of Personal Assistant services has an annual cost of &euro;30 million, with an annual cost of &euro;52 million for Home Support services.</p>  <p>  Applicants are accessed through an application process or through referrals from public health nurses or other community based staff.  The needs of the person applying are evaluated against the prioritisation for the particular service and then decisions are made in relation to the allocation of resources.  Resource allocation is determined by the needs of the individual, compliance with prioritisation criteria and the level of resources available.  While the resources for the provision of assisted living services, including Personal Assistant services, are substantial, they are finite.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy's question relates to service matters, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the HSE for direct reply to the Deputy for a more comprehensive reply.  If the Deputy has not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days, he can contact my Private Office and they will follow the matter up with the HSE.  Furthermore, if the Deputy has a particular case in mind, he should contact the HSE with the details and it will arrange to have the matter followed up.</p></reply>

The Strategy states that, in determining the new model of care, patient safety is the first and overriding principle.  Integral to this are guidelines to assess and place women in the appropriate risk category which will ensure that their care is managed their care in line with best evidence. </p>  <p>  To this end, the Strategy underlines that this new model of care will be underpinned by evidence-based guidelines which will provide the necessary patient safety assurances, and help to ensure consistency in practice across the country. </p>  <p>  The Strategy recommended that the National Clinical Effectiveness Committee (NCEC) prioritises a set of National Clinical Guidelines for maternity services. </p>  <p>  The NCEC which is a Ministerial Committee has commenced the commissioning of these guidelines.  It is intended that the maternity guidelines will prioritise intrapartum care and will include a guideline on oxytocin use during labour. </p>  <p>  The guidelines once complete will be quality assured by the NCEC to ensure that they have been developed to an international standard.  They will be submitted to the Chief Medical Officer and the Minister for approval in order that they become mandated for full implementation across all maternity services.</p></reply>

The Bill and the subsequent Ministerial regulations made thereunder, will allow for the licensing, provision and operation of supervised injecting facilities under specific circumstances, whilst protecting the public health and ensuring that the prohibition on possession and supply of illicit drugs outside of such facilities is adequately maintained.  I intend to publish this Bill in the autumn and it is hoped that the legislation would be enacted by the end of 2016.  Regulations will be required in relation to the operation of the facility and other matters necessary for the proper functioning and security of a supervised injecting facility.  These regulations should be drafted by early Q2 2017.</p>  <p>  It is envisaged that initially one supervised injecting facility would be established on a pilot basis in Dublin city centre.  An independent evaluation would be an intrinsic element to this initiative, determining the utility, safety and cost-effectiveness of the supervised injecting facility in an Irish context.  The outcome of such an evaluation will inform any decision to licence further facilities.  In line with the experience of other countries which have established such facilities, it would be expected that the numbers would be few and the locations carefully selected to address most effectively the requirements and concerns of the service users and the wider community.</p></reply>

There has been a considerable increase in demand for care in our health system in recent years.  100,000 patients have an elective inpatient procedure and 800,000 have a planned day case procedure.  Up to the end of May 2016, there has been an increase of over 19,000 scheduled inpatient / daycase procedures, in comparison to the same period in 2015.</p>  <p>  The key issue for patients is how long they wait.  It is important to note that approximately 60% of patients wait less than 6 months for their required inpatient/daycase procedure and that 91% of patients wait less than the maximum permissible waiting time of 15 months for that procedure.</p>  <p>  I met with the HSE National Director for Acute Hospitals on Friday, 15 July, regarding proposed measures to tackle waiting lists.  I requested that the HSE prepare an action plan, setting out specific measures that the HSE will implement, in conjunction with hospitals, between now and the end of 2016 in order to tackle waiting lists.  I have agreed with the HSE that the action plan should focus on process improvement in how hospitals manage their waiting lists, with a particular focus on validating waiting lists, as well as on actions to reduce waiting times for those patients waiting longest.  The HSE will report to my Department on a regular basis regarding progress on implementing the action plan. </p>  <p>  This Government recognises that a sustained commitment to improving waiting times is required.  Consequently, the Programme for a Partnership Government commits to &euro;15m funding to the NTPF to address waiting lists in 2017, as part of the Programme&rsquo;s commitment to a continued investment of &euro;50m per year to reduce waiting lists.  This commitment seeks to utilise the expertise of the NTPF to further assist the HSE in addressing specific waiting list pressures.  The Department of Health has commenced engagement with the NTPF and the HSE to deliver on these waiting list commitments in the Programme for a Partnership Government. </p>  <p>  In respect of the detailed information sought by the Deputy, as these are service matters, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly.

The infection is generally mild affecting only the skin, but can occasionally be more severe and highly debilitating.  Lyme disease is the commonest cause of tick-borne infection in Europe.</p><p>The Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) of the HSE collects and collates surveillance data on notifiable infectious diseases.  Lyme borreliosis is notifiable in Ireland since 2012; the notifiable entity being the more severe neurological form of LB: Lyme neuroborreliosis.  </p><p>The number of annual neuroborreliosis notifications over the last few years is as follows: </p><p>- 2012 &ndash; 8 cases; </p><p>- 2013 &ndash; 13 cases; </p><p>- 2014 &ndash; 18 cases; </p><p>- 2015 &ndash; 12 cases.</p><p>This gives an average annual incidence rate of neuroborreliosis in Ireland of about 2.7 neuroborreliosis cases per million population. </p><p>Since 2013, the HPSC has held an annual &lsquo;Lyme Awareness Week&rsquo; at the beginning of the tick biting season, the purpose of which is to draw attention - particularly in the media - to Lyme disease and the ticks that can spread this disease.  The week beginning May 2 was designated as Lyme Awareness Week this year. </p><p>The literature on the HPSC website points out that that campers, walkers and certain occupational groups such as forestry workers, conservation workers, deer cullers and farmers are at particular risk of exposure to ticks (and therefore LB).  That said, anyone walking or hiking in the countryside is at risk of biting ticks.  The ticks responsible for LB are generally hard-bodied ticks (Ixodidae).  Ixodes ticks are hosted by a wide range of mammals including deer, sheep and cows, and occasionally birds; their tiny size (less than 2mm unfed) means they can remain undetected for long periods.</p><p>Ixodes ticks are most likely to be found in:  </p><p>-  Shady and humid woodland clearings with grass; </p><p>-  Open grassland, walking paths (especially those bordered by long grasses); </p><p>-  Wooded and forested areas; </p><p>-  Vegetation close to lakes and seaside beaches; </p><p>-  Parkland areas; and </p><p>-  Open fields and bushes.</p><p>They are present in both urban and rural environments and are active from spring to autumn. Lyme cases tend to appear in Ireland with greater frequency after April, hence the choice of this time of year for Lyme Awareness Week.</p><p>The HPSC emphasise that prevention of tick bites is the most effective way to prevent LB and a comprehensive amount of which will enable the public to:  </p><p>-  Identify likely areas of tick infestation; </p><p>-  Habits to develop to prevent tick biting them and their families; and </p><p>-  Habits to develop to examine oneself (and one&rsquo;s children and pets) to remove any ticks they discover after a day in the country.</p><p>In addition, a Lyme Borreliosis Subcommittee has been established to look at methods of raising awareness especially in those areas (including recreation areas) where Lyme carrying ticks can be most expected to be found. </p></reply>

However, further research has shown that it can also be beneficial in treating other conditions.  Many pregabalin products are now authorised for use in the treatment of generalised anxiety disorder and neuropathic pain.  The greater number of authorised indications may also be a contributory factor to the increase in the number of Pregabalin items dispensed.</p>  <p>  In June of this year the Early Warning Emerging Trends Subcommittee (EWET) of the National Advisory Committee on Drugs and Alcohol, with the agreement of my Department, wrote to Health Care Professionals highlighting the need for vigilance when prescribing and dispensing Pregabalin, as the drug presents a risk of addiction and a potential for illegal diversion and medicine misuse.  Prescribers were advised to always undertake a risk benefit assessment prior to prescribing either of these medicines for patients under their care.</p></reply>

Consequently, the Programme for a Partnership Government commits to &euro;15 million funding to the NTPF to address waiting lists in 2017, as part of the Programme's commitment to a continued investment of &euro;50 million per year to reduce waiting lists.  This commitment seeks to utilise the expertise of the NTPF to further assist the HSE in addressing specific waiting list pressures. </p>  <p>  The Department of Health is currently engaging with the NTPF and the HSE to finalise a dedicated 2016 waiting list initiative focused on endoscopy.

There are a variety of pension schemes that operate in the public service depending on when and how an individual enters the public service.  In general, the majority of public servants are members of various public service &lsquo;pay as you go&rsquo; Defined Benefit (DB) schemes which may have different minimum pension age, accrual terms, contribution rates etc.  In addition, some employees of Section 38 agencies are members of funded Defined Benefit pension schemes which are administered by scheme trustees while others are members of Defined Contribution (DC) schemes.  New entrants to the public service recruited on or after 1 January 2013 are generally members of the Single Public Service Pension Scheme (SPSPS) and have career average pension benefits.</p></reply>

Exports in 2015 recorded double digit growth to reach &euro;410 million.  In volume terms exports are likely to increase from 7 million cases in 2014 to 12 million cases by 2020 and 24 million cases by 2030.</p>  <p>  Significant investment has taken place since 2011 in expansion of existing facilities and development of new distilleries.  However, release of additional capacity on to the market will take time as whiskey must, under EU and Irish law, be matured in wood for at least three years.  So the product of distillations in 2016 and 2017 will come on the market close to 2020. </p>  <p>  I am aware of the Compecon report by Dr. Pat Massey which concluded that the lack of a wholesale market in Irish Whiskey and the ageing requirement are barriers to expansion. </p>  <p>  The recommendation on developing a wholesale whiskey market to facilitate the development of Irish Whiskey brands by businesses which do not themselves have distilling capacity is interesting and is also suggested in the industry Vision for Irish Whiskey.  I would welcome initiatives to facilitate the development of such a market but do not have the power to compel individual distilling companies to set aside part of their production for a wholesale market. </p>  <p>  Establishing an un-aged Irish Whiskey category is, however, ruled out by Regulation (EC) No 110/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council, which applies both to product placed on the market in the Community and that produced in the Community for export.  The Regulation defines the Whiskey category in some detail, including a requirement that the final distillate be matured for at least three years in wooden casks.  Product which has not been matured for this period may not be described as Whiskey or retain the EU geographical indication status accorded to Irish Whiskey, which is one of the geographical indications included in a number of bilateral trade agreements between the EU and third countries.  At national level, the Irish Whiskey Act, 1980 requires that Irish Whiskey be matured in wooden casks for at least three years in warehouses in the State and/or Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  I have asked my officials to explore with the industry and development agencies ways of developing and showcasing the portfolio of Irish Whiskey brands to promote awareness of Irish Whiskey in international markets and to contribute to the export and development goals of FoodWise 2025. </p></reply>

It is the controlling authority for the breeding and coursing of greyhounds. The ICC is subject to the general control and direction of Bord na gCon) under Section 26(2) of the Greyhound Industry Act, 1958 (the Act).  Bord na gCon is the statutory body with responsibility for the improvement and development of the greyhound industry, greyhound racing and coursing.</p>  <p>  Detailed rules governing the practice of the artificial insemination of greyhounds were set down in the Artificial Insemination of Greyhounds Regulations, 2005, (S.I. No. 561 of 2005), which were made by Bord na gCon under Section 39 of the Act.</p>  <p>  The Regulations included a two year limit on the use of semen for artificial insemination following the death of a stud dog, thereafter any unused semen had to be destroyed.</p>  <p>  As a result of the operational difficulties in the implementation of certain provisions of the Artificial Insemination of Greyhound Regulations, 2005, Bord na gCon invited industry stakeholders in March 2014 to submit proposals regarding the suitability of the Artificial Insemination of Greyhounds Regulations 2005, in the context of meeting current industry requirements.</p>  <p>  After a detailed consideration of submissions received, Bord na gCon decided in September 2014, having consulted with the ICC, to remove the two year limit on the use of semen following the death of a stud greyhound.  Arising from this decision, and with the consent of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, new regulations were introduced by Bord na gCon which came into effect on 1 November 2014 removing this two year limit on semen from an expired sire.   </p>  <p>  To assist the board in relation to policy development in this area Bord na gCon have commissioned a scientific study into inbreeding in Irish Greyhounds.  This study has now been completed and a report on the matter is currently being considered. </p></reply>

In general terms an eligible hectare is one that is used for an agricultural activity or, where the area is also used for a non-agricultural activity, is predominantly used for such activities. An area is predominantly used for agricultural activity if that activity can be exercised without being significantly hampered by the intensity, nature, duration and timing of the non-agricultural activity.</p><p>While cases involving solar panels will be examined on an individual basis, the European Commission has advised that the area covered by the solar panels will be deemed ineligible for the purposes of claiming BPS. Furthermore, in line with the Department&rsquo;s current approach on land eligibility, where the area of a parcel covered by solar panels is 70% or greater of the overall parcel, that parcel will be wholly ineligible. If less than 70% is covered by solar panels and the agricultural activity is not hampered by the presence of the solar panels, the area not covered by solar panels may be eligible.</p><p>From an Areas of Natural Constraints (ANC) perspective the area must initially be designated and subsequently must be available for agricultural purposes in the same way as is required for BPS. Participants in AEOS must continue to deliver the actions that they have included in their contract with the Department for the full duration of that contract. Anything that would affect the delivery of such actions in their entirety could have negative consequences for their AEOS payments, depending on the individual circumstances.</p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">  The Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources has informed me that before a final decision is taken on introducing a new support scheme - which may include support for solar PV - that Department will run a public consultation, which will give all interested parties an opportunity to participate in the development of the scheme. Details of the next public consultation will be advertised on their website </font><i><font color="#0D0D0D">www.dcenr.gov.ie</font></i><font color="#0D0D0D">.

The number of BPS entitlements allocated was determined by the number of eligible hectares declared by a farmer in 2013 or 2015, whichever was the lesser, and the value of entitlements allocated was based on a fixed percentage of the value of Single Payment Scheme entitlements owned by the farmer in 2014 and any payment received under the 2014 Grassland Sheep Scheme.</p>  <p>  The person named held 32.47 entitlements valued at &euro;243.60 each in 2014 giving him a payment of &euro;7,909.69 in 2014.  These entitlements expired on 31 December 2014 and he was then allocated 33.29 Basic Payment Scheme entitlements based on the eligible land declared in 2015. These entitlements are valued at &euro;156.96 each in 2015.  The value of the payment received by the person named in 2015, including his Greening Payment, which totals &euro;7,524.57, shows a marginal reduction on the value of his payment in 2014.  This is consistent with the marginal reduction to all farmers&rsquo; payments in 2015 based on the reduced national ceiling allocated to Ireland under CAP 2015-2019.  The value of the entitlements held by the person named will increase under convergence each year from 2015-2019 as set out in the Definitive Statement of Entitlements issued to the person named in early June 2016.</p></reply>

That report indicated that the industry employed 10,300 people directly and indirectly, that the gross wage bill generated by that employment was &euro;207 million per annum and that the tax contribution from that employment was &euro;21 million, and that much of this economic activity was generated in rural areas.</p>  <p>  While the sector has operated through extremely challenging times over the past several years, the Indecon report, commissioned by my predecessor, sets out a road map for its development, which is being implemented by Bord nag Con.

However I have no role in the setting of prices as is the case for any Agriculture Minister in the EU.</p>  <p>  A prolonged period of volatility in dairy markets has been in evidence in recent times.  However it is important to remember that the medium term prospects for global dairy markets are good.  How we mitigate the current volatility is the challenge.  Volatility in dairy markets is a global problem, an EU problem and an Irish problem for which there is no single silver bullet.  Fixed price and margin contracts, futures markets and access to increasingly flexible forms of credits are all part of the toolkit that will be required.  In this respect we must continue to work with industry and the financial services sector at a national level to ensure resilience is built into the sector in the current period of volatility and going forward, strengthening our position within the global market.</p>  <p>  I am anxious that we must focus on other support measures that can play a role in supporting the sector and it is vital that we continue to work closely with the Commission and all other key stakeholders in this regard.  The Commission has already deployed a range of market supports including intervention and Aids to Private Storage, and provided a financial package of &euro;500 million for liquidity assistance was agreed at the Agriculture council in September 2016.  At yesterday&rsquo;s Council of Agriculture Ministers, the Commission announced a further &euro;500m support package for EU farmers.  This is to be divided into two tranches, the first &euro;150m will be reserved for an EU-wide scheme compensating farmers who reduce their milk output over certain reference periods towards the end of 2016. </p>  <p>  For the other element of the package, &euro;350m is set aside for Member State initiatives with fixed allocations per MS.  Ireland will be allocated &euro;11m.  My firm view which I reiterated strongly at Council is that we must have maximum flexibility at MS level to use this funding as we wish and in a way which helps farmers while delivering maximum value for money.  In my view we have to use this in a way which provides relief from current liquidity issues for farmers.  There are considerable details yet to be worked out on both of these elements of the package and we are awaiting further details from the Commission.</p></reply>

Kerry are considered by my Department under the provisions of the Fisheries (Amendment) Act 1997, the Foreshore Act 1933 and applicable EU Directives.</p><p>Kilmackilloge Harbour is located within Kenmare River Special Area of Conservation (&lsquo;Natura 2000&rsquo; site).  All applications in &lsquo;Natura&rsquo; areas are required to be appropriately assessed for the purpose of environmental compliance with the EU Birds and/or Habitats Directives.  An Appropriate Assessment has been carried out by the Marine Institute in respect of Kenmare River Special Area of Conservation.  My Department has prepared an Appropriate Assessment Conclusion Statement which outlines how it is proposed to licence aquaculture in Kenmare Bay Special Area of Conservation in compliance with the Habitats Directive.  This Conclusion Statement is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.agriculture.gov.ie.</i></p><p>While the Appropriate Assessment is carried out on a bay-wide basis, each licence application within the bay must be assessed individually for licensing purposes.  Factors considered include navigation, suitability of the place or waters, likely ecological effects, other beneficial uses (existing or potential) of the waters concerned, the effect or likely effect on the environment in the vicinity of the water of the proposed aquaculture, carrying capacity of the bay, etc.</p><p>My Department has requested Bord Iascaigh Mhara (BIM) to carry out a &lsquo;Carrying Capacity&rsquo; study of Kilmackilloge Harbour.  BIM has expertise in this area having previously carried out a carrying capacity study in respect of Killary Harbour.  A carrying capacity study essentially seeks to scientifically establish if the existing and proposed density of sites, and longlines within sites, would have a detrimental effect on the growth of mussels due to, for example, a reduction in water flow or a reduction on plankton passing to mussel lines.  The results of the carrying capacity study will enable improved science-based licence decision making in Kilmackilloge Harbour.</p><p>In addition to Natura requirements, under EU Environmental Impact Assessment Directives all licence applications must undergo an Environmental Impact Screening Assessment.  This requires significant input from my Department&rsquo;s scientific and technical advisors.  All applications, in compliance with the requirements of the applicable legislation, are advertised in order to facilitate public consultation, and submissions or observations received must be considered as part of the licence determination process.</p><p>Every effort is being made to expedite the determination of aquaculture licence applications in Kilmackilloge Harbour having regard to all the complexities involved.</p></reply>

This is because these cows are on farms with 10 or less reference cows or are the first 10 cows on farms with more than 10 reference animals.</p>  <p>  As these animals are currently paid at the rate equivalent to &euro;90 per animal, it would cost an additional &euro;25.6m per annum to bring this payment up to &euro;200.  It should be noted however that any increase in payments would also require additional scheme participants to undertake additional actions, as BDGP payments are made on a cost incurred/income foregone basis as per the rules of the EU Rural Development Programme.  Any such increase would also require the approval of the EU Commission and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p></reply>

Food security is defined by the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) as: <i>&ldquo;a situation that exists when all people, at all times, have physical, social and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life&rdquo;.</i></p><p>At international level, Ireland&rsquo;s development aid programme has a strong focus on food and nutrition, including through funding from my own Department to the UN FAO and WFP (World Food Programme).  In 2015 my Department doubled its annual contribution of untied aid to the WFP to &euro;20 million a year for each of the next three years.  The WFP feeds 80 million of the most malnourished people in 80 countries and significantly contributes to the goal of zero hunger.  </p><p>At national level, food security is addressed through a range of Government policies providing social protection and supports for low income, disadvantaged and vulnerable groups.  Furthermore the Food Dudes and Food Dudes Boost programmes, managed by Bord Bia and co-funded by my Department under the EU School Fruit and Vegetable Scheme will be run in 700 national schools this year, reaching around 113,000 pupils.  </p><p>Specifically in relation to the carbon efficiency of red meat, Ireland&rsquo;s temperate climate and plentiful rainfall favours a grass-based system of beef and sheep production, resulting in significant carbon efficiencies: </p><p>- the maintenance of our permanent pastures which act as a carbon sink; </p><p>- a reduced dependence on imported cereals for animal feed; and </p><p>- the production of beef which is independently recognised as being both environmentally and resource efficient, and with the fifth lowest carbon footprint per unit of output in the EU.</p><p>The Food Wise strategy aims to grow the Irish agri-food sector in an economic, environmental and socially sustainable manner, building on our strengths in the production of safe, healthy and nutritious food.  Ireland is already one of the EU&rsquo;s most efficient producers of both milk and beef, in terms of carbon footprint per unit of output.  But under Food Wise we are implementing measures to drive down the carbon intensity of our food production even further, resulting in both economic returns and environmental sustainability.</p></reply>

The work focused on the emissions generated from livestock production and considered all upstream emissions, including those arising from the production of imported agricultural inputs such as nitrogenous fertiliser and feed, through to the farm gate.</p>  <p>  This analysis, which was published in 2010, confirmed Irish beef production to be amongst the lowest emitters of GHG emissions per kilogram of product, with average emissions per kg of beef estimated at 18.4 kg of CO2 equivalent.  Assuming an average protein content of 250g per kilogram of beef, this will equate to 73.6kg of CO2  equivalent per kilogram of protein.  These low emissions can be attributed to the application of grass-based production efficiencies and low &lsquo;land-use, land-use-change&rsquo; emissions from domestic cropland expansion.  In this regard, the Irish system of beef production can be described as unique in the EU. </p>  <p>  While our LCA figures for beef are among the best, they do not tell the full story.  For instance, they do not highlight the important contribution of our permanent pasture &ndash; some 90% of all Irish agricultural land &ndash; to maintaining a very significant carbon pool.  This carbon pool could be released to the atmosphere if land is converted to arable and contribute further to climate change. </p>  <p>  It should also be noted that LCA figures should not be considered as static but are used to benchmark further improvements in the efficiency of Irish beef production systems.  This is one of the core objectives of the new Beef Data and Genomics Programme which aims to further improve the environmental performance of Ireland&rsquo;s suckler beef herd. </p>  <p>  In addition, current and future research outputs funded by this Department and research outputs in partnership with European and international alliances will further assist with the refinement, development and deployment of new and innovative practices that will further reduce GHGs that are associated with agricultural production.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-07-19a.1986.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016071900105#WRTT01000"><p>The decision of the UK to leave the EU is one that creates considerable challenges for the agrifood sector.  The UK is by far our largest trading partner.  Last year we exported almost &euro;5.1 billion worth of agricultural products.  This included more than &euro;1.1 billion in beef products and almost &euro;970 million in dairy products.  Ireland is also the UK&rsquo;s largest destination for its food exports - worth &euro;3.8 billion last year.  This bilateral trade takes place on the basis of harmonised EU rules on animal and public health and labelling, without complex certification, quota limits or customs duties and tariffs.  And it is underpinned by the vital support of the CAP budget, to which the UK is a significant net contributor. </p>  <p>  Given these linkages, and as the UK is a net food importer, both countries have a strong interest in maintaining a close agrifood trading relationship.  In addition, the resilience of the Irish agrifood sector is well recognised, and this, together with the strong commercial relationships built up over years of trading, will help us to negotiate our way through the challenges ahead. </p>  <p>  It is important also to bear in mind that the precise implications of the referendum outcome will depend on the trade and other arrangements ultimately negotiated between the EU and the UK.  These negotiations may take up to two years, and perhaps longer, and over that period existing arrangements will continue to apply. </p>  <p>  Nevertheless, my Department has engaged in detailed contingency planning for the possibility of this result, and has published a summary of the key actions we are taking to address the contingencies arising from the UK&rsquo;s decision. </p>  <p>  The most immediate concerns for exporters centre on Euro-Sterling exchange rates.  It should be noted that the fall in the value of Sterling against the Euro, while significant, is not unprecedented.  Nevertheless, a sustained period of currency volatility could be of concern.  In that regard, the Central Bank of Ireland has pre-established contingency plans to deal with market volatility surrounding the referendum result.  The Bank will engage with the Department of Finance and individual financial institutions regarding potential risks. Actions by ECB and other global actors will be monitored closely.</p>  <p>  I have also asked the relevant agencies, including Bord Bia and Enterprise Ireland, to provide practical guidance to SMEs.  Last week Bord Bia announced a number of measures to support food and drink businesses.  These measures cover areas such as managing volatility impacts, providing consumer and market insight, deepening customer engagement and extending market reach, with the aim of helping companies maintain their competitiveness.  Similar support is also being provided by Enterprise Ireland.   </p>  <p>  Aside from currency fluctuations, the main areas in which potential impacts are foreseen are in relation to tariffs and trade, the EU budget, regulations and standards, and customs controls and certification, while complex issues also arise for the fisheries sector. </p>  <p>  However, we must remember that our trading relationship with the UK is not altered in any way until the negotiation process that will dictate the terms and conditions of the UK&rsquo;s departure is completed.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, and as part of our overall contingency planning, I have taken a number of measures to ensure a sensible, coherent approach is adopted, namely:   </p>  <p>-   I have established a dedicated unit in my Department to work on all of the issues that I have mentioned;   </p>  <p>-   I have convened a Consultative Committee of stakeholders, which has already met for the first time, to ensure a full exchange of information as the negotiations proceed;</p>  <p>-   I am also ensuring that the response of the relevant agencies is fully coordinated through a contact group established under the Food Wise 2025 High Level Implementation Committee, and </p>  <p>-  The Department will continue to feed into the central Contingency Framework being co-ordinated by the Department of the Taoiseach.</p></reply>

The Programme was funded through an EU allocation of &euro;42,266,603 and &euro;24,080,823 in Exchequer funding, bringing total funds to &euro;66,347,426.  The Programme ended in December 2015 and funding for the seafood sector is now provided through my Department&rsquo;s new &euro;240 million EMFF Operational Programme.</p>  <p>  My Department recently submitted the final claim under the EFF to the European Commission.  As this is the final claim, it will form part of the closure process for Ireland&rsquo;s EFF Programme, which will likely continue into 2017 at least.  Until that closure process is completed, I cannot provide the Deputy with a final figure on how much, if any, EFF funds will be unused at the end of the Programme.  Subject to confirmation and acceptance by the Commission of all claims from my Department, we are likely to be close to 100% drawdown of EU funds.

The Foal Levy is currently calculated with reference to SI 735 of 2011 which is the governing legislation.</p>  <p>  The Statutory scheme requires the owner of each thoroughbred foal born in Ireland, requiring registration, to register in the General Stud Book through the offices of Weatherbys Ireland GSB Limited and pay at registration time a levy to Horse Racing Ireland.  The actual levy payable is related to the generally applicable (advertised) nomination fee of the foal&rsquo;s sire and varies between &euro;35 (where the nomination fee is less than &euro;1,001) and &euro;650 (where the nomination fee is in excess of &euro;30,001).  Special deals do not apply in calculating the levy payable.  In an industry which, at its peak, saw 12,000 foals registered in a year, a levy based on examination of each individual contract/sales agreement would be impractical and would add to overall costs. </p>  <p>  Disbursements are made by decision of the Foal Levy Committee of HRI. Bodies such as Irish Equine Centre, the Irish Thoroughbred Breeders&rsquo; Association and Irish Thoroughbred Marketing are the principal recipients.  The Foal Levy Committee&rsquo;s recommendations are subject to approval by the Board of HRI and its allocations are published in the audited annual accounts of that body.</p>  <p>  The foal levy underwent a full and thorough review in 2011, including meetings with interested breeders and representative bodies. As a result the number of bands was increased from 6 to 11 to have smaller increments between bands.  Overall these changes have been well received particularly at the lower end of the market where the lowest levy is &euro;35 and the second levy is &euro;50.  The majority of foals registered fall into these two bands.  Compliance with the levy is extremely high with overall compliance in the last four years of 98.3%.</p></reply>

It is not within the gift of individual Member States to amend these rules. </p>  <p>  However at the request of Ireland and some other Member States, the EU Commission introduced a provision last year permitting payment of the levy in three annual instalments, without interest.  This was on the understanding that the full amount of the levy was paid to the Commission by the Member State in 2015.  Ireland was one of the few Member States to implement this scheme and make it available to our farmers. </p>  <p>  As part of the discussions in the run-up to a Council of Agriculture Ministers earlier in 2016, Ireland proposed a further deferral of the payment to 2017 and 2018, to ease the financial burden on liable farmers in 2016. I also raised the matter with Commissioner Phil Hogan directly.  However, the European Commission have unequivocally advised that the legal basis for the Regulations under-pinning the scheme are no longer in existence and therefore further amendments are not possible.  Our clear understanding is that the view of the Commission&rsquo;s legal services remains that there is no legal basis for any adjustment to the timelines provided for in the relevant regulations.</p></reply>

Given that she has just been appointed, it has not been possible for me to make any plans to meet with her, but I look forward to getting an opportunity to do so in due course.  However, at the meeting of Agriculture Ministers yesterday, I had the opportunity to meet Mr George Eustice, recently re-appointed as Minister of State at the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.</p><p>More generally in terms of the issues that will affect farming and the agri-food sector, and the implementation of the CAP, it is clear that the decision of the UK to leave the EU is one that creates considerable challenges.  The UK is by far our largest trading partner.  Last year we exported almost &euro;5.1 billion worth of agricultural products.  This included more than &euro;1.1 billion in beef products and almost &euro;970 million in dairy products.  Ireland is also the UK&rsquo;s largest destination for its food exports - worth &euro;3.8 billion last year.</p><p>This bilateral trade takes place on the basis of harmonised EU rules on animal and public health and labelling, without complex certification, quota limits or customs duties and tariffs.  And it is underpinned by the vital support of the CAP budget, to which the UK is a significant net contributor. </p><p>Given these linkages, and as the UK is a net food importer, both countries have a strong interest in maintaining a close agri-food trading relationship.  In addition, the resilience of the Irish agri-food sector is well recognised, and this, together with the strong commercial relationships built up over years of trading, will help us to negotiate our way though the challenges ahead. </p><p>It is important also to bear in mind that the precise implications of the referendum outcome will depend on the trade and other arrangements ultimately negotiated between the EU and the UK.  These negotiations may take up to two years, and perhaps longer, and over that period existing arrangements will continue to apply. </p><p>Nevertheless, my Department has engaged in detailed contingency planning for the possibility of this result, and has published a summary of the key actions we are taking to address the contingencies arising from the UK&rsquo;s decision. </p><p>The most immediate concerns for exporters centre on Euro-Sterling exchange rates.  It should be noted that the fall in the value of Sterling against the Euro, while significant, is not unprecedented.  Nevertheless, a sustained period of currency volatility could be of concern.  In that regard, the Central Bank of Ireland has pre-established contingency plans to deal with market volatility surrounding the referendum result.  The Bank will engage with the Department of Finance and individual financial institutions regarding potential risks.  Actions by ECB and other global actors will be monitored closely.</p><p>I have also asked the relevant agencies, including Bord Bia and Enterprise Ireland, to provide practical guidance to SMEs.  Last week Bord Bia announced a number of measures to support food and drink businesses.  These measures cover areas such as managing volatility impacts, providing consumer and market insight, deepening customer engagement and extending market reach, with the aim of helping companies maintain their competitiveness.  Similar support is also being provided by Enterprise Ireland.</p><p>Aside from currency fluctuations, the main areas in which potential impacts are foreseen are in relation to tariffs and trade, the EU budget (and its implications for CAP implementation), regulations and standards, and customs controls and certification, while complex issues also arise for the fisheries sector.</p><p>However, we must remember that our trading relationship with the UK is not altered in any way until the negotiation process that will dictate the terms and conditions of the UK&rsquo;s departure is completed.</p><p>In the meantime, and as part of our overall contingency planning, I have taken a number of measures to ensure a sensible, coherent approach is adopted, namely:</p><p>-I have established a dedicated unit in my Department to work on all of the issues that I have mentioned;</p><p>-I have convened a Consultative Committee of stakeholders, which has already met for the first time, to ensure a full exchange of information as the negotiations proceed;</p><p>-I am also ensuring that the response of the relevant agencies is fully coordinated through a contact group established under the Food Wise 2025 High Level Implementation Committee, and </p><p>-The Department will continue to feed into the central Contingency Framework being co-ordinated by the Department of the Taoiseach.</p></reply>

The recent packages of support measures from the Commission are welcome, but we should continue to deploy any and all available options that might help to mitigate the effects of these difficulties. Such options should include measures that will help to reduce production costs for farmers.</p>  <p>  According to Eurostat, fertiliser is the third most important expenditure item on EU farms, accounting for &euro;19.2bn in 2014.  Fertiliser prices have increased significantly in recent years, in part due to the protection provided by the imposition of duties on non-EU imports, while opportunities to manage price risk through hedging mechanisms are limited.</p>  <p>  I believe that appropriate action in this area could be of significant benefit to farmers at this very difficult time.  In addition to the ten-point package that Ireland proposed in the lead-up to the March Council of Agriculture Ministers, we asked the Commission to consider a temporary suspension of import tariffs on fertilisers. </p>  <p>  Other Member States made similar calls, and at the March Council Commissioner Hogan indicated his readiness to raise the matter with Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs, Taxation and Customs, Pierre Moscovici, and Internal Market Commissioner Elzbieta Bienkowska.  At the April Council in Luxembourg, Commissioner Hogan said that he was following up with his colleagues in an effort to secure their agreement to possible changes.</p>  <p>  I am continuing to pursue the matter with the Commission in consultation with my Member State counterparts.</p></reply>

One of my priorities is to support the provision of lower-cost, more flexible finance.</p><p>I recently met with the CEOs of the main banks and stressed the need for them to be flexible in the context of increased income volatility.  The banks told me that they recognise and are responding to the challenges facing farmers in this regard.  I also questioned the banks on the relatively high interest rates for SMEs in Ireland compared with those across Europe.</p><p>Access to finance was discussed at the Dairy Forum in June, with an exchange of views with the main banks now a part of the agenda at each meeting.  Before the meeting I formally launched the Dairy Forum&rsquo;s &rsquo;Financial Management Initiative&rsquo;, a programme of cash flow and financial management training and advice for dairy farmers.  I believe that equipping farmers with better financial planning skills is essential and I am encouraging all farmers to engage with this initiative.</p><p>Access to finance was also discussed by the Food Wise 2025 High Level Implementation Committee in June, and we heard from representatives of the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) and the Irish Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF).  Both are now active in the market and my Department, in cooperation with all the other relevant State bodies, will continue to explore additional funding mechanisms for farmers, the agri-food sector and for SMEs generally.</p><p>In this regard, my Department recently published a request for tender to procure an ex-ante assessment to assess any current failures in the access to finance market in Ireland.  This is a first step towards the potential introduction of Financial Instruments under the EAFRD Rural Development Programme and the EMFF Seafood Development Operational Programme.</p><p>In relation to the flexibility announced by the EU <i>Commission</i>in regard to State aid provisions as part of the response to price volatility, including the possibility of a measure on bridging liquidity gaps, I am working with all the financial institutions, particularly SBCI, to identify potential solutions to providing working capital finance for farmers with liquidity issues.</p></reply>

This is to be divided into two tranches, the first &euro;150m will be reserved for an EU-wide scheme compensating farmers who reduce their milk output over certain reference periods towards the end of 2016.</p>  <p>  For the other element of the package, &euro;350m is set aside for Member State initiatives with fixed allocations per MS.  Ireland will be allocated &euro;11m.  My firm view, which I expressed strongly at Council, is that we must have maximum flexibility at Member State level to use this funding as we wish and in a way which helps farmers while delivering maximum value for money.  There are many details yet to be worked out on both elements of the package and we are awaiting further details from the Commission. </p>  <p>  The outcome of yesterday&rsquo;s Council was a considerable success from Ireland&rsquo;s point of view.  Firstly the threat of the available funding being entirely conditional on supply control has not materialised.  Secondly there will be a significant degree of flexibility on the use of the remaining 70% of the package, though the detail has yet to be finalised.</p>  <p>  The third thing is that there is now agreement to allow Member States to pay advance payments on the BPS and the RDP in October this year.  This will allow advance payments of 70% in the basic payment and up to 85% for RDP schemes.  Advance payments help on-farm cashflow and have been requested by Ireland on a number of occasions.  In addition to these measures, there was also a strong political commitment from the Commission to extend the market support measures beyond the current time scales into February 2017.  Our focus now will turn to the implementation of the package and my department is in close contact with the Commission on next steps.</p></reply>

There are essentially two bans in place.  The Russian Federation imposed a temporary ban on importation of pigs, pork and reproductive material certified from the EU after 26 January 2014 in response to the discovery of two cases of African Swine Fever in wild boar in Lithuania. Efforts to make progress in lifting this ban are continuing.</p>  <p>  A more general ban on the importation of agrifood products was imposed by the Russian Federation in August 2014 on countries (including the EU) which had adopted sanctions against Russia in the context of the situation in Ukraine.  Although partially lifted (since 1 June 2016) in respect of imports of beef, poultry and vegetables intended for use in baby food manufacturing, the overall ban remains in place, and on 29 June 2016.  The Russian authorities announced a further extension, to 31 December 2017.</p>  <p>  In the context of the ongoing difficulties on EU agricultural markets, all Member States, including Ireland, have consistently urged the European Commission to intensify its contacts with the Russian authorities with a view to lifting these bans, particularly with a view to restoring the trade in live pigs, pork fat, lard and offal.  Commissioner Hogan again indicated at the Agri-Fish Council on 18 July that the Commission has been working hard on this issue, but has not been able to make the hoped-for progress to date.   While efforts to secure real engagement from the Russian authorities will continue, the broader task of securing alternative market outlets for EU food products will also be progressed.</p></reply>

I am conscious of the fact that prices have come under pressure over the last year and the difficulties that this is causing for producers.  Having said that, it must be noted that Irish prices have remained broadly in line with EU prices and I note there has been a slight increase recently, reflecting renewed market confidence in Europe and increased demand in China.  Recently, my Department distributed a &euro;1m direct aid package for pig farmers in Ireland. <i></i>This support originates from a package of measures proposed by the EU Commission in response to the significant price deterioration experienced by pig farmers in 2015, the impact of which has been exacerbated by the closure of the Russian market.Under the aid package agreed at EU level in September of last year, &euro;0.5m was allocated for the pig sector for Ireland.  The Government subsequently matched this funding to provide an overall aid package of &euro;1m.</p><p>At an EU level, I have welcomed important elements in a &euro;500 million aid package for the EU Agriculture sector but have called for maximum flexibility on how MS may utilise the funding.  The details of these packages have yet to be worked out between the Commission and Member States.</p><p>I also note that the European Commission has recently established a Meat Market Observatory to provide the EU meat sector with more transparency by means of disseminating market data and short-term analysis in a timely manner.  This was due to meet for the first time last week.  The tasks of the group are to take stock of market developments, and to highlight and assess the current market situation for the sake of economic operators and the Commission services, along the lines of the Milk Market Observatory.</p><p>My Department also supports Bord Bia&rsquo;s marketing and promotional activities, and the Pigmeat Quality Assurance scheme helps to consolidate the position of Irish pigmeat on the domestic market and to expand its presence on EU and third country markets.  Bord Bia plans to use additional funds to run a targeted Pork promotional campaign this coming Autumn and further campaigns are planned to promote ham and bacon.  Teagasc is also actively engaged in the provision of technical advice to improve the operational efficiency of pig farmers.</p><p>I have also included provision in the RDP for an on-farm capital investment scheme, TAMS II, with an overall budget of &euro;395 million across all sectors, with &euro;35.8 million allocated for 2016.  Amongst the areas identified for initial funding are investments on pig farms for energy, water meters and medicine dispensers.  Other elements of the RDP, such as targeted on farm animal health and welfare scheme will also be of benefit to the pig sector.</p><p>Finally, I am committed to ensuring that as many alternative markets as possible are open to the Irish Pigmeat sector.  In that regard I will continue to prioritise the opening of new markets such as Vietnam and the Philippines, which serve as valuable alternative markets to Russia for Irish pigmeat exports.  Indeed I will be leading a trade mission to Vietnam and China during the first week in September during which I will be prioritising the promotion of pigmeat in two of our main export markets.</p></reply>

I am very conscious of the fact that prices have come under pressure over the last year and the difficulties that this is causing for producers.  Given the strategic importance which the sector plays in our agri economy, a Pig Industry Stakeholder Group, chaired by Dr Sean Brady was established in my Department and membership was drawn from across the sector, including farmers and processors.  This Group&rsquo;s remit was to address these challenges facing the sector under themes such as biosecurity, animal welfare, quality assurance, antibiotic usage, animal health, salmonella control programme, marketing, feed, non-intensive sector and other production models.  This was a very comprehensive exercise stretching over many months which also included a public consultation phase during which submissions were received and presented to the Committee by many different stakeholders.  The Group completed its report in February and presented it to the High Level Implementation Committee overseeing the implementation of the Food Wise 2025 strategy.  This reflected the fact that the preparation of this report is one of the key recommendations under the Food Wise Strategy.</p>  <p>  This timely report afforded all industry stakeholders including farmers, processors and Government Agencies a chance to take a collective view of how best to address the challenges facing the industry in order to support its development in accordance with the Food Wise 2025 vision.  The focus now must turn to its implementation and my Department is working on a plan for its implementation in the context of the Food Wise 2025 strategy.  Given the comprehensive nature of the report, its support from stakeholders and its wide-ranging conclusions I believe that a focus on its implementation represents best use of available resources for all parties and most importantly will deliver the most meaningful outcome for the sector going forward.</p></reply>

These challenges are very much to the fore of the analysis that my Department has been conducting in the lead-up to, and in the period since, the referendum.  Areas that will be affected include the veterinary, trading and animal health arrangements between North and South.  There will also be very significant implications for the fishing fleet in both jurisdictions. <i></i>I met my Northern counterpart, Michelle McIlveen, MLA, Minister for Agriculture, the Environment and Rural Affairs, at the North South Plenary Ministerial meeting which took place in Dublin Castle on 5 July and we met again, along with our respective Secretary General - Permanent Secretary, on the margins of the Council of Agriculture Ministers on Monday 18 July. <i></i>I agreed with her that our officials should meet at the earliest opportunity to work through some of the potential issues involved.  A second meeting of senior officials will take place later this week, and I am committed to ensuring that our Departments continue to work well together in the coming months in the best interests of farmers and the wider industry.</p><p>It is important also to emphasise that the trading relationship remains unchanged, and that the precise impact of a UK exit will not be apparent until the post-exit relationship has been agreed.  In the meantime I look forward to ongoing dialogue in the context of the Government&rsquo;s co-operation with its counterparts in Northern Ireland and in the UK more generally.</p></reply>

Exports in 2015 recorded double digit growth to reach &euro;410 million.  In volume terms exports are likely to increase from 7 million cases in 2014 to 12 million cases by 2020 and 24 million cases by 2030.  Significant investment has taken place since 2011 in expansion of existing facilities and development of new distilleries.  However, release of additional capacity on to the market will take time as whiskey must, under EU and Irish law, be matured in wood for at least three years.  So the product of distillations in 2016 and 2017 will come on the market close to 2020.</p>  <p>  I am aware of the Compecon report by Dr. Pat Massey which concluded that the lack of a wholesale market in Irish Whiskey and the ageing requirement are barriers to expansion.</p>  <p>  The recommendation on developing a wholesale whiskey market to facilitate the development of Irish Whiskey brands by businesses which do not themselves have distilling capacity is interesting and is also suggested in the industry Vision for Irish Whiskey.  I would welcome initiatives to facilitate the development of such a market but do not have the power to compel individual distilling companies to set aside part of their production for a wholesale market.</p>  <p>  Establishing an un-aged Irish Whiskey category is, however, ruled out by Regulation (EC) No 110/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council, which applies both to product placed on the market in the Community and that produced in the Community for export.  The Regulation defines the Whiskey category in some detail, including a requirement that the final distillate be matured for at least three years in wooden casks.  Product which has not been matured for this period may not be described as Whiskey or retain the EU geographical indication status accorded to Irish Whiskey, which is one of the geographical indications included in a number of bilateral trade agreements between the EU and third countries.  At national level, the Irish Whiskey Act, 1980 requires that Irish Whiskey be matured in wooden casks for at least three years in warehouses in the State and/or Northern Ireland. </p>  <p>  I have asked my officials to explore with the industry and development agencies ways of developing and showcasing the portfolio of Irish Whiskey brands to promote awareness of Irish Whiskey in international markets and to contribute to the export and development goals of FoodWise 2025.</p></reply>

The Whitegate refinery is a fully privatised facility and its sale is a commercial matter between Phillips66 and a potential purchaser.</p>  <p>  The Government views the continued operation of the Whitegate refinery on a commercial basis as highly desirable from an energy security and economic perspective.  Security of supply remains a fundamental tenet of our energy policy and our overarching strategic energy security objectives are set out in the White Paper &ldquo;Ireland&rsquo;s Transition to a Low Carbon Energy Future&rdquo; published last December.</p>  <p>  Under the terms of the 2001 Sale and Purchase Agreement entered into when the State sold the refinery in 2001, a legal obligation existed on the owners to continue to operate the refinery until at least July 2016.  This obligation was a minimum legal requirement and is separate from the refinery licence.</p>  <p>  Phillips66 has provided broad general updates to my Department about the status of the sale.  However all commercial matters have been confidential between Phillips66 and interested parties; Phillips66 advise that the sales process is on-going.</p></reply>

Ireland aims to meet this target mainly through the increased use of sustainable biofuels, with electric vehicles also making a small contribution.  The Electric Vehicle Grant Scheme supports and incentivises, through grants of up to &euro;5,000, the deployment of electric vehicles (EVs) in Ireland.  These grants are in addition to the Vehicle Registration Tax reliefs of up to &euro;5,000 which apply to EVs.  The grant scheme commenced in 2011 and the purchase of  over 1,400 new EVs has been supported.

This is being achieved through private investment by commercial telecommunications companies and through a State intervention under the National Broadband Plan (NBP) in areas where commercial investment is not forthcoming.</p>  <p>  On 5 July 2016, the Government selected the Commercial Stimulus Model as the optimum ownership model for the network that will be part-funded by the Exchequer.  The Government considered two ownership models, having narrowed the options down last December, from five models. The two models are:</p>  <p>  - Commercial Stimulus where the private sector finances, designs, builds, owns and operates the network, with contractual obligations to the Department; and</p>  <p>  - Full Concession where the private sector finances, designs, builds and operates the network with contractual obligations to the Department.  In this model, those assets funded by the State are handed back to the State after 25 years; commercial assets that support the NBP infrastructure would however remain in private ownership.</p>  <p>  Both Models will deliver the same network, with the same service specifications and controls, for 25 years. In both models, the winning bidder(s) will be subject to stringent contract provisions to ensure that the network delivers quality, affordable high speed broadband to all parts of Ireland that cannot access services. </p>  <p>  The Department has completed detailed costings, down to every individual premises in the Intervention Area and, on that basis, has modelled the likely cost of each ownership model.  It would not be appropriate to publish the expected cost of building the network, the likely cost to the State, or the expected terminal value of the network, while a major public procurement process is underway.  I do not intend, therefore, to indicate the overall estimated Exchequer funding parameters, or projected costs or values of the network.  Ultimately, the costs will depend on the price that bidder(s) quote in the tender process.</p>  <p>  In choosing the Commercial Stimulus Model, the Government has had regard to the impact of the Full Concession Model where the entire project is likely to be on the Government&rsquo;s Balance sheet.  This would impact the general Government deficit by approximately &euro;1bn more than the Commercial Stimulus Model and would also reduce the available capital spend for other key investment projects by up to &euro;600m over the next six years.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s priority is to deliver this network as quickly as possible.  My Department has been advised that the Full Concession Model could take at least 6 months longer to negotiate because of the complexity of identifying assets and in particular assets owned by third parties.</p>  <p>  The Government has, therefore, chosen the Commercial Stimulus model as the optimum approach for the National Broadband Plan intervention.  The decision on ownership has allowed the procurement phase to move to the next stage, where three bidders have qualified and been invited to participate in formal dialogue with the Department.  The Dialogue process with bidders will commence this week.</p></reply>

The position remains as set out in that reply. (see below)</p>  <p>  On 5 July the Government selected the Commercial Stimulus Model as the optimum ownership model for the network that will be part-funded by the Exchequer.  The Government considered two ownership models, having narrowed the options down last December, from five models.  The two models are:</p>  <p>  - Commercial Stimulus (or &lsquo;Gap Funding&rsquo;) &ndash; the private sector finances, designs, builds, owns and operates the network, with contractual obligations to the Department;</p>  <p>  - Full Concession &ndash; the private sector finances, designs, builds and operates the network with contractual obligations to the Department.  Those assets funded by the State are handed back to the State after 25 years.

I do not intend therefore to indicate the overall estimated Exchequer funding parameters.  Ultimately, the costs will depend on the price that bidder(s) quote in the tender process.  I can however confirm the following based on the cost modelling completed to date:</p>  <p>  - The Full Concession Model is estimated to cost 50 &ndash; 70% more in nominal terms that the Commercial Stimulus Funding model;</p>  <p>  - In the Full Concession Model, the full cost of the project would be likely to go on the Government&rsquo;s Balance Sheet, and the commercial sector input would likely be regarded as Government debt;</p>  <p>  - Having the entire project on the Government&rsquo;s Balance sheet would impact the general Government deficit by approximately &euro;1bn more than the Commercial Stimulus Model.  This would also reduce the available capital spend for other key investment projects by up to &euro;600m over the next six years.</p>  <p>  In addition to the funding implications of the Full Concession Model, I am advised that this model could take at least 6 months longer to negotiate a contract, than with the Gap funding model.</p></reply>

The scheme aims to support and encourage community based partnerships to improve the energy efficiency of homes, businesses and community facilities in a local area.  To date the scheme has supported the upgrade of more than 12,000 homes and several hundred shared community facilities, from sports clubs to community centres and childcare facilities.</p><p>SEAI seeks to engage with all potential applicants to the Better Energy Communities scheme as early as possible in the process each year.  SEAI typically undertakes a number of workshops for applicants, offers on-site visits and advisory inspection support as well as extensive advice and support.</p><p>On June 23 2016, I announced that 38 projects were successful in this year&rsquo;s Better Energy Communities Scheme and that &euro;20 million in grant funding has been allocated to these projects.  This will provide for energy efficiency upgrades to more than 2,600 homes and almost 300 community and commercial facilities.  The total investment in energy efficiency, including funding from local communities themselves, is almost &euro;48 million, which will support an estimated 700 direct and indirect jobs right across the country.  Due to the nature of community projects, many individual projects cross county and Local Authority areas.  Details on each project, including the areas covered by the project are set out in the attached table and have been published on my Department&rsquo;s website at: <i>http://www.dcenr.gov.ie/energy/SiteCollectionDocuments/Energy-Efficiency/2016%20BEC%20Projects.pdf </i></p><p>In this year's scheme 14 Local Authorities were involved with project applications.  Of these applications, 9 were successful, with 5 unsuccessful. All applications to the Better Energy Communities Scheme are assessed in a competitive process operated by SEAI and neither I, nor my Department, have any function in relation to the evaluation or selection of projects.</p></reply>

Under S.I. 243 of 2012, the European Union (Energy Performance of Buildings) Regulations 2012, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) is designated as the Issuing Authority with responsibility for the registration of BER assessors, maintaining the registers of BER assessments, quality assurance, awareness raising and ongoing management of the BER scheme.</p>  <p>  The BER Assessment system is an energy label with accompanying advisory report for homes.  The rating is a simple A to G scale that reflects the level of energy consumption that would be typical of that home.  A-rated homes are the most energy efficient and will tend to have the lowest energy bills.  Every property offered for sale or rent in Ireland must have a BER and that BER must be included in any advertisements.  To date, more than 650,000 BER assessments have been registered with SEAI, meaning that around 40% of dwellings in Ireland have an associated BER assessment.</p>  <p>  Studies conducted by the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) have found that BER assessments can have a significant effect on the value of a property.  An ESRI study conducted on 36,000 properties offered for sale or rent, &ldquo;The Value of Domestic Building Energy Efficiency &ndash; Evidence from Ireland,&rdquo; found that relative to D-rated properties, otherwise comparable A-rated properties receive a sale price premium of 9.3%.A BER must be performed by an appropriately qualified BER assessor.  To qualify as an assessor, a person must successfully complete a training course for BER assessors, pass a BER examination, have the required insurance policies, and complete the SEAI registration process.  There are currently approximately 900 BER assessors registered with SEAI.</p>  <p>  To ensure the quality of the work performed by these assessors, SEAI aims to audit around 2% of all BER reports.  The audit process and associated timings are published and publicly available in SEAI&rsquo;s Quality Assurance System and Disciplinary Procedure.  SEAI also has procedures in place to deal with any complaints, disputes or appeals that may arise and copies of these procedures are available on SEAI&rsquo;s website.</p>  <p>  SEAI have more recently (May 2016) published new procedures to support the development of BER assessors.  These changes come into effect from 1st August and introduce such improvements as Mentoring Audits to assist BER assessors.  A new BER advisory report will also be introduced by the end of this year.  This new advisory report will provide improved information on the potential energy efficiency upgrades a householder can make.</p>  <p>  I believe that BER assessors have a key role to play as trusted advisors to homeowners and those renting property, by helping them make informed choices about the potential energy efficiency improvements they can make in their home.  Given the importance of this role, the amount of properties that have a BER assessment and the impact this assessment can have on the value of a property, it is vital that robust quality control procedures are in place to ensure the integrity, reputation and quality of the BER system.</p></reply>

This will require the share of fossil fuels to be of the order of 26-51% of total primary energy requirement.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government also sets out important objectives in the energy sector that build on this vision.

Provisional data from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland estimates that we had reached 9.2% of the overall 16% target at the end of 2015.  While good steady progress has been made, the 16% target remains challenging and will require the additional deployment of renewable energy in the electricity, heating and transport sectors between now and 2020.</font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">In order to achieve the overall binding 16% total energy target, the Government remains committed to meeting 40% of electricity demand from renewable sources, 12% renewables in the heating sector and 10% in transport by 2020.  The Government has adopted a range of policy support measures designed to meet these aims.</font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">In the electricity sector, the primary support mechanisms introduced for renewable electricity are the Alternative Energy Requirement schemes and the Renewable Energy Feed-In-Tariff (REFIT) schemes.  These schemes have proved successful at incentivising the development of the renewable electricity generation capacity necessary to meet our 40% renewable electricity target, and provisional figures show that in 2015 some 25.3% of electricity demand was met by renewable sources.</font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">In the heating sector, my Department is working on the introduction of a new Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) to support the deployment of renewable energy in the sector.  The primary aim of the RHI is to build on the progress already made in heating and to help reach our 12% target by 2020. In 2015 it is estimated that 6.8% of heat was derived from renewable sources.</font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">In the transport sector, Ireland aims to meet our renewable target mainly through the increased use of sustainable biofuels, with electric vehicles also making a small contribution.

The station is owned by the ESB and the White Paper recognises that key decisions on its future will have to be taken before 2020 as the station will reach the end of its operating life in its current configuration in 2025.</p>  <p>  In addition, the White Paper recognises that increasing &lsquo;cost of carbon&rsquo; charges on Green House Gas emissions will drive up the cost of carbon-intensive energy sources and lead firms and consumers to adopt low carbon fuels and energy efficient technologies.  It is anticipated therefore that the phasing out of higher carbon fuels will be achieved by a combination of sustainable policy measures and consumer reaction to the higher price of carbon intensive fuels.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government includes a commitment to establish a National Dialogue on Climate Change, which amongst its roles, will identify replacement low-carbon generation technology.  This builds on the commitment in the Energy White Paper to establish a National Energy Forum to maximise and maintain consensus on the broad policy measures set out in the White Paper required to ensure the transition to a low-carbon energy future.  </p>  <p>  It is my intention that the National Dialogue on Climate Change will encompass the role envisaged for the National Energy Forum but with a wider focus to include the examination of key infrastructural, land use, security of supply and economic issues that need to be addressed in our long-term transition to a low-carbon future.</p>  <p>  It is important that the National Dialogue on Climate Change reflects the views of all stakeholders including businesses, communities and citizens.  This will require careful consideration in terms of the membership of the dialogue, its format and how it engages with the wider public.  My Department is currently considering these matters and I hope to bring proposals to Government with a view to the first meeting of the National Dialogue on Climate Change being held later this year.</p></reply>

Taxis are permitted to use them because they are a public transport service available for on-street hire.</p>  <p>  Since the creation of bus lanes, there have been numerous requests to my Department to allow other classes of road users into the lanes.  These include multi-occupancy vehicles, electric vehicles, motorcyclists, animal ambulances and others, as well as hackneys and limousines. </p>  <p>  These requests have been rejected down the years as to allow additional categories of road users into bus lanes would undermine the efficiency of the lanes for the purpose for which they were originally intended.  It would also be difficult to allow any one of these many requests without allowing the others, thereby further undermining the working of the lanes as bus priority measures.  I therefore do not propose to extend the use of bus lanes to any other categories of road users.</p></reply>

Under EU law, we have reciprocal exchange of driving licences with all other EU Member States.  In the case of non-EU States, we may reach bilateral agreements on exchange of driving licences.  We have a number of such agreements in place.  Work in recent years has produced agreement with three of the Canadian provinces, and good progress is being made towards agreement with the remaining provinces.</p>  <p>  I am well aware of the difficulties for people returning to Ireland from countries with which we do not have reciprocal arrangements.  However, the implication that we should simply reach such agreements with those third countries is mistaken.  Driver licensing law exists so that we can be sure of the standard of driving reached by people allowed to drive on our roads.  Agreements on exchange of licences are made only after detailed study by the licensing authorities on both sides, so that each side can be sure that the two systems operate to compatible standards.  A commitment to explore an agreement with another jurisdiction does not automatically mean that an agreement will be possible.  On the Irish side, such work is undertaken by the Road Safety Authority.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may also wish to note that an Irish driving licence may be renewed up to 10 years after it has lapsed without the requirement to resit a driving test.</p></reply>

Motorists have a duty of care to other road users by complying with speed limits and other road traffic regulations.

The question of automated and connected vehicles will have to be looked at in the context of the EU as well as nationally, given the framework of relevant licensing, insurance, data protection, and other legislation at EU level as well as the existence of the single market.  Ireland is engaging with our European colleagues as the issues and challenges, including safety measures, are explored and addressed at EU level.  Many of these were highlighted in the Declaration of Amsterdam, which was endorsed by all Transport Ministers of the EU in April 2016.</p>  <p>  It is expected that the Commission's  Connected Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITS​) deployment platform will furnish EU Member States with various policy recommendations for the development of a roadmap for C-ITS and identify solutions for critical areas of concern in relation to such vehicles.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-07-19a.2337.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016071900112#WRAAA02875"><p>​I propose to take Questions Nos. 858, 860 and 864 together.</p>  <p>  Tourism continues to contribute significantly to Ireland's economic recovery.  2015 was a record year for Irish tourism when we recorded more than 8.6 million overseas visits contributing an estimated &euro;4.2 billion (excluding carrier receipts) to the Irish economy.  CSO figures for the first five months of 2016 show that there were over three million overseas visits to Ireland, an increase of 13.7% on the same period of 2015.</p>  <p>  Thankfully all of our main target markets are showing good growth levels with visits from North America up by over 18%, visits from Mainland Europe up by 11.5% and visits from Great Britain up by over 15%.  With regard to revenue, the most recent CSO Quarterly Tourism and Travel publication shows that spending in Ireland by overseas visitors (excluding carrier receipts) in the first three months of 2016 amounted to over &euro;693 million, an increase of 17.5% compared to the same period in 2015.</p>  <p>  The Quarterly National Household Survey figures indicate that employment in the &lsquo;Accommodation and Food Service Activities&rsquo; sector was 145,900 (seasonally adjusted) for the first quarter of 2016, compared with 135,400 in the same period last year, a rise of 7.8%.  This is having real economic benefits for towns and villages right across the country.</p>  <p>  Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s targets for 2016 are to grow overseas visit numbers by a further 4%, and grow the associated revenue by 5%.  Early figures for 2016 suggest that we are likely to exceed these amounts.  Obviously the recent EU Referendum decision may have implications on outbound tourism but the Great Britain market will remain of significant importance to Irish tourism and I believe that Ireland's excellent tourism offering  will ensure that we continue to perform strongly.  Tourism Ireland is closely monitoring the situation and is due to meet with tourism industry representatives later this week to plan ahead in this new market environment.  Amongst the longer-term tourism goals, as outlined in the Government's Tourism Policy Statement are that by 2025: revenue from overseas visitors will increase to &euro;5 billion, net of inflation supported by 10 million overseas visits to Ireland annually and I am confident that we will achieve these targets. </p>  <p>  In 2015, a Tourism Leadership Group was appointed to put in place a Tourism Action Plan containing key actions required in the period to 2018 in order to achieve the overall objectives in the Policy Statement.  The Tourism Action Plan was published in January and contains actions across a range of key issues including skills in the tourism industry; supply of visitor accommodation; overseas tourism marketing, and the contribution of Local Authorities to tourism development.  My Department is now working closely with the tourism agencies on the implementation of all of the 23 actions contained in the Plan.</p></reply>

The Transport Strategy is a statutory document and provides an evidence based approach toward transport planning and service delivery across all of the Greater Dublin Area, including County Kildare over the period to 2035.</p>  <p>  The Strategy outlines a range of recommended measures in relation to public transport provision in County Kildare including further improvements to the Kildare rail line and development of a core regional bus corridor along the M7 / N7 which will facilitate improved regional bus service access from County Kildare.  The NTA is now preparing an implementation plan to outline delivery of the Strategy's objectives over the next 6 years and I expect a public consultation on that plan will commence in due course.</p>  <p>  As regards short term priority measures for commuters in Kildare, the Phoenix Park Tunnel project which will cost approx. &euro;13 million will be completed in late 2016.  The project will see commuters on the Kildare to Dublin Heuston line have the option of direct trains to Connolly, Tara St, Pearse and Grand Canal Dock Stations from late 2016.  The new rail services will provide an attractive alternative for private motorists who currently commute into the city from Kildare along the busy N7 and N4 road corridors.</p>  <p>  In addition to the above, the NTA's Sustainable Transport Measures Grants (STMG) Programme provides funding to the seven local authorities in the GDA, including Kildare County Council, for the implementation of various sustainable projects of a small scale.  The Programme facilitates investment in the various cycling/walking, QBCs, safety, integration and traffic management projects throughout the region.</p>  <p>  Under the Programme funding of &euro;1.4m is being provided in 2016 to Kildare County Council.  This includes funding for the construction of a public transport hub on Naas Main Street, to encompass redesigned bus stopping areas, new bus shelter, real time passenger information signs, seating, planting, cycle stands, transport/tourism information panels, paving and street furniture improvements</p></reply>

The objective is to work to achieve an ambitious, high standard and balanced TTIP agreement that responds to both EU and US interests.  An agreement would be the world&rsquo;s largest bilateral trade and investment deal, and a successful conclusion is expected to benefit Ireland more than any other EU Member State.  Ireland&rsquo;s enterprises are particularly well placed to take up opportunities to trade more easily with the US.  Studies have shown that the benefits to Ireland will be proportionally greater than in the EU as a whole.  Ireland strongly supports these negotiations and is working to ensure that our interests are fully reflected in the texts of the negotiations.</p></reply>

The latest data available is for the first quarter of 2016, during which there were 136 IDA Ireland-sponsored site visits countrywide.  The breakdown is provided in the following table.  Figures for the second quarter will be available early next month.</p><p>It is important to note that data on site visits is not an accurate measure of the level of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) activity in a region or county.  That is partly because approximately 70% of all FDI investment won by IDA Ireland comes from its existing client base, rather than new companies. </p><p>The number of site visits to a particular county is also better viewed against the background of the wider progress IDA Ireland is making in generating new jobs across the country.  This can be seen in the Agency&rsquo;s record 2015 results, in which a total of 18,983 jobs were created with employment in IDA Ireland client companies rising to 187,056.  The Agency has also made regional development a cornerstone of its five-year strategy and is targeting a minimum increase in investment of 30%-40% in each individual region outside Dublin.</p><p><b>IDA Ireland Jobs Statistics 2015; Site Visits 2015 and Quarter 1 2016 by County</b><table><tr><th>County</th><th>No. of Companies</th><th>Total Jobs</th><th>New Jobs2015</th><th>Site Visits 2015</th><th>Site Visits Q1 2016</th></tr><tr><td>Carlow</td><td>7</td><td>768</td><td>19</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan </td><td>7</td><td>1,165</td><td>29</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>68</td><td>6,599</td><td>646</td><td>12</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>148</td><td>31,900</td><td>4,062</td><td>48</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>12</td><td>2,918</td><td>330</td><td>5</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>652</td><td>77,244</td><td>8,864</td><td>242</td><td>57</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>60</td><td>14,297</td><td>1,267</td><td>41</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>12</td><td>1,931</td><td>89</td><td>6</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>22</td><td>10,313</td><td>679</td><td>7</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny </td><td>5</td><td>650</td><td>9</td><td>10</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Laois</td><td>2</td><td>97</td><td>10</td><td>4</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim</td><td>4</td><td>423</td><td>16</td><td>8</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>52</td><td>8,849</td><td>1,018</td><td>40</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>Longford</td><td>5</td><td>686</td><td>46</td><td>2</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td>21</td><td>3,245</td><td>317</td><td>20</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td>18</td><td>3,981</td><td>159</td><td>3</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td>17</td><td>1,571</td><td>89</td><td>7</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan</td><td>5</td><td>146</td><td>52</td><td>2</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Offaly</td><td>10</td><td>902</td><td>58</td><td>8</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon</td><td>9</td><td>936</td><td>99</td><td>2</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td>22</td><td>2,029</td><td>132</td><td>15</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary</td><td>12</td><td>3,518</td><td>95</td><td>12</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>33</td><td>5,662</td><td>536</td><td>31</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath</td><td>16</td><td>2,529</td><td>212</td><td>28</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>17</td><td>2,486</td><td>101</td><td>4</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>18</td><td>2,211</td><td>49</td><td>7</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>1,254</td><td>187,056</td><td>18,983</td><td>565</td><td>136</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Significantly however, in the context of Brexit, UK exports, as a share of total exports, have reduced from 45% to 37% over the period 2005 to 2015 as EI clients have diversified their export base.  High Growth Markets (e.g. China, Brazil, etc.) have continued to increase in importance over the past 10 years and now account for 12% of total exports compared to 7% in 2005. </p><p>Despite the continued diversification of the Enterprise Ireland client export base, the UK&rsquo;s vote to leave the EU will present significant new challenges for Irish companies exporting to the UK.  In response, Enterprise Ireland has begun its plans to support clients exporting to the UK, including:</p><p>1.  <b>Information and Guidance:</b></p><p>Enterprise Ireland will run an information campaign including: practical guides, online information and webinars, an updated UK market access guide and regional seminars in Ireland and the UK. Further details are available at <i>www.enterprise-ireland.com/brexit.</i></p><p>2.  <b>UK Market Support:</b></p><p>Enterprise Ireland's UK team will support clients to identify key business opportunities in the short and medium terms.  They will also provide advice and support on responding to the implications of Brexit such as improving competitiveness and reducing supply chain costs.</p><p>3.  <b>Competitiveness and Market Development Supports:</b></p><p>Enterprise Ireland will intensify its work with clients, to improve their competitiveness in the market, through its management capability and development programmes.</p><p>4.  <b>Market Diversification Support:</b></p><p>Enterprise Ireland will intensify its strategy of supporting clients to diversify into new markets. As part of this strategy, Enterprise Ireland will intensify its International Trade and Investment events schedule for the rest of 2016 to include trade missions and events to Northern Europe, USA, China, India and other high growth markets.</p><p>5.  <b>International Sector Clustering Strategy:</b></p><p>Enterprise Ireland will expand its focus on promoting Irish sectoral cluster capabilities in key sectors to international buyers in growth markets including Northern Europe, USA and Asia Pacific.</p><p>Since the announcement of the vote of the UK to leave the EU, I have been in regular contact with key agencies, in particular Enterprise Ireland, and have met with other key business organisations, to gather intelligence on the implications of Brexit and to plan our responses.  In turn, Enterprise Ireland has been engaging intensively with its clients to ascertain the potential impact of Brexit on their operations and strategies.  The strategies of Enterprise Ireland and their clients will no doubt evolve to meet the challenges and opportunities that will arise.</p><p>Based on developments to date, I am satisfied that Enterprise Ireland is already fully engaged with its clients on the implications of Brexit.  As the situation evolves and specific challenges emerge, I will keep under review the resources required to address them.</p></reply>

The Authority is charged with statutory responsibilities in the following key areas:</p><p>- To regulate and promote the safety, health and welfare of people at work and those affected by work activities;</p><p>- To regulate and promote the safe manufacture, use, placing on the market, trade and transport of chemicals;</p><p>- To act as the surveillance authority in relation to relevant single European market legislation;</p><p>- To act as the national accreditation body.</p><p>The Health and Safety Authority&rsquo;s annual grant is broken down into pay and non-pay&ndash; it does not provide specific allocations for particular programme areas such as workplace health and safety regulation, chemicals regulation, and national accreditation or for safety initiatives including the organisation of information and awareness campaigns.</p><p>The Authority depends upon the annual exchequer allocation provided by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (DJEI) to fund the implementation of its programme of work.  Within that context, and informed by its current three year Statement of Strategy 2016-2018, the Authority prioritises initiatives in those areas where there is greatest risk and the greatest potential to maximise its efforts to achieve a continued downward trend in workplace deaths, accidents, injuries and ill health, and to increase the safe use of chemicals. </p><p>Health and Safety Authority Inspectors carry out inspections across all work sectors and work activities which come under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 (the 2005 Act) and the Chemicals Act 2008.  Most inspections are targeted at the high risk sectors such as construction, agriculture, forestry, manufacturing, mines, quarries, transport of dangerous goods by road, or the chemical sectors.  Other inspections can be part of a particular safety awareness campaign e.g. on manual handling, on slips, trips or falls or on compliance with the REACH Regulation.  The Authority produces a Programme of Work each year setting out its plan for all areas of its work, including inspection targets. The annual Programme of Work is submitted to the Minister for approval.</p><p>The number of workplace inspections carried out from 2011 to 2016 (14/07/16) is set out in the following table </p><p><b>Table 1 </b><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Number of workplace inspections and investigations </th></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>15,340</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>13,835</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>12,244</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>10,719</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>10,880</td></tr><tr><td>2016 (recorded as of 14 July)</td><td>5,917</td></tr></table></p><p>While the falling inspection rates between 2011 and 2014 in Table 2 above can be attributed to the loss of inspection staff, the programme of inspections has been increased by the Authority in 2016 and continues to be targeted at areas of highest risk.  The Authority&rsquo;s 2016 Programme of Work set a target of 11,165 inspections and investigations and its performance is currently on target.</p><p>The Authority has also invested significant resources in recent years in enabling enterprises to achieve compliance in the simplest, most cost-effective manner.  The Authority&rsquo;s BeSMART.ie risk assessment and management tool for small enterprises has been developed and expanded for the construction and agri-business sectors.  The Authority also ran safety awareness campaigns relating to farming, construction, vehicle safety and fishing safety, along with promoting the BeSMART safety management tool to small businesses.  It has also run campaigns to alert consumers to the potential dangers from detergent liquitabs. </p><p>In 2015 the Authority&rsquo;s exchequer Grant was increased by &euro;250,000 during the course of the year (following re-allocations made in light of the Department&rsquo;s 2015 mid-year expenditure review) to facilitate special safety initiatives aimed at Agriculture and Construction.</p><p>Since the Authority is allocated funding for pay and non-pay, it uses its non-pay allocation to cover a range of administrative ICT, accommodation, and other running costs, in addition to providing funding for information and awareness activities, including specific safety initiatives. Consequently, the funding provision for particular programmes, including specific safety initiatives, fluctuates from year to year as the Authority decides how to prioritise its non-pay funding in order to implement its programme of work. </p><p>In the current year (see Table 2 below) the  Non Pay budget decided by the Authority includes a reduction in the provision for &quot;safety initiatives&quot; in 2016 in light of other priorities of the Authority&rsquo;s overall programme of work for this year, including developments affecting office accommodation, a necessary business process review arising from the integration of INAB and the replacement of the current manual system used in the INAB accreditation process, as part of the development of a new Client Management System (a commitment in the Action Plan for Jobs, 2016) </p><p><b>Table 2</b></p><p><b>Amount of money spent on Health and Safety Initiatives 2011 to 2016</b><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Estimated Spend on Safety Initiatives (excl.

It will end limitations in access to public contracts, open-up services market, and offer predictable conditions for investors.  The agreement covers virtually every aspect of economic activity, and it is extremely important for Ireland.  It offers significant opportunities for growth in trade for with Canada.  The agreement opens up public procurement markets in the Canadian provinces giving Irish firms increased access to Canadian public sector purchasing.  Ireland also gains unlimited tariff free access for most of our important food exports.  Irish firms will also benefit from the recognition of product standards.  In addition, Ireland successfully campaigned for a low beef import quota from Canada to the EU thereby safeguarding our important EU market in this area.</p>  <p>  The EU Commission consulted the State and other EU governments on a regular and ongoing basis throughout the CETA negotiations.  The EU Commission also consulted the European Parliament.  All Member States advised and assisted the Commission in negotiating and concluding this agreement.  As in all free trade negotiations, Ireland ensured that our economic interests were both promoted and defended to the fullest extent possible to secure the best deal for us.</p>  <p>  At the EU Council of Trade Ministers on the 13th May 2016, the Council had an exchange of views on the EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) and the process towards signature and provisional application of the agreement.  The European Commission and Member States highlighted the high quality of the agreement reached with Canada and expressed the desire to work towards signature of the agreement at the October EU-Canada Summit.  At the meeting, I made Ireland&rsquo;s approach clear, that based on our assessment of its provisions, we viewed CETA as a mixed Agreement, in terms of EU and Member State competency.</p>  <p>  The Commission published its proposals for signature, conclusion and provisional application of the agreement on the 5th July 2016.  In view of the position taken by Ireland and other Member States I note that the Commission has now decided to submit CETA to the Council for decision as a mixed agreement.</p>  <p>  It will be a matter for the Council and the European Parliament to decide on the signature and provisional application of CETA.  Following a decision by the Council with the consent of the Parliament, it will be possible to provisionally apply CETA.  Its full entering into force will be subject to the conclusion by the EU, through a Council decision with the consent of the Parliament, and by all Member States through the relevant national ratification procedures.  This means that the Oireachtas will be part of the final decision to ratify the agreement.</p>  <p>  The provisional application of Free Trade Agreements is standard practice.  What is at issue is what should be within scope in such application.  We&rsquo;ve argued that only those areas directly within exclusive Commission competence should be covered by provisional application.  The Commission has already accepted that the CETA is a mixed agreement.</p></reply>

The total number of people employed in IDA Ireland-supported companies reached 187,056.  Not only is this an increase of over 27,000 jobs from 2012, it is also the highest in the Agency&rsquo;s history.</p><p>Since 2015 IDA Ireland has been working towards targets set out in their strategy &ldquo;Winning - Foreign Direct Investment 2015-2019&rdquo; including the creation of 80,000 new jobs and 900 new investments, which would bring total FDI employment in Ireland to 209,000 by 2019.  The Agency is also aiming to increase the level of investment by 30% to 40% in each region.</p><p>The Government&rsquo;s commitment to countrywide job creation is further illustrated by the Regional Action Plan for Jobs initiative.  This initiative saw eight plans published throughout 2015 and 2016, which identified a range of actions aimed at supporting each region to achieve its economic potential and raise employment levels.</p><p>These new regional initiatives are already producing results.<b></b>In 2015, IDA Ireland client companies created 18,983 jobs across a range of sectors, with every region posting net job gains.  Moreover, 53% of those jobs are outside of Dublin, compared to 49% in 2014.<div><b>Total Jobs in IDA Ireland Client Companies 2012-2015</b></div><table><tr><th><b>Region</b></th><th><b>County</b></th><th><b>2012</b></th><th><b>2013</b></th><th><b>2014</b></th><th><b>2015</b></th></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>Dublin</td><td>61,803</td><td>66,610</td><td>71,432</td><td>77,244</td></tr><tr><td>Mid-East</td><td>Kildare</td><td>10,416</td><td>10,275</td><td>10,222</td><td>10,313</td></tr><tr><td>Mid-East</td><td>Meath</td><td>1,463</td><td>1,555</td><td>1,552</td><td>1,571</td></tr><tr><td>Mid-East</td><td>Wicklow</td><td>2,397</td><td>2,413</td><td>2,340</td><td>2,211</td></tr><tr><td><b>Mid-East Total</b></td><td><b> </b></td><td><b>14,276</b></td><td><b>14,243</b></td><td><b>14,114</b></td><td><b>14,095</b></td></tr><tr><td>North-East</td><td>Cavan</td><td>1,128</td><td>1,135</td><td>1,136</td><td>1,165</td></tr><tr><td>North-East</td><td>Louth</td><td>1,881</td><td>2,568</td><td>3,029</td><td>3,245</td></tr><tr><td>North-East</td><td>Monaghan</td><td>348</td><td>365</td><td>275</td><td>146</td></tr><tr><td><b>North-East Total</b></td><td><b> </b></td><td><b>3,357</b></td><td><b>4,068</b></td><td><b>4,440</b></td><td><b>4,556</b></td></tr><tr><td>North-West</td><td>Donegal</td><td>2,223</td><td>2,382</td><td>2,607</td><td>2,918</td></tr><tr><td>North-West</td><td>Leitrim</td><td>714</td><td>447</td><td>411</td><td>423</td></tr><tr><td>North-West</td><td>Sligo</td><td>2,257</td><td>2,090</td><td>2,061</td><td>2,029</td></tr><tr><td><b>North-West Total</b></td><td><b> </b></td><td><b>5,194</b></td><td><b>4,919</b></td><td><b>5,079</b></td><td><b>5,370</b></td></tr><tr><td>Midlands</td><td>Laois</td><td>84</td><td>106</td><td>87</td><td>97</td></tr><tr><td>Midlands</td><td>Longford</td><td>696</td><td>701</td><td>650</td><td>686</td></tr><tr><td>Midlands</td><td>Offaly</td><td>901</td><td>896</td><td>890</td><td>902</td></tr><tr><td>Midlands</td><td>Westmeath</td><td>2,256</td><td>2,212</td><td>2,396</td><td>2,529</td></tr><tr><td><b>Midlands Total</b></td><td><b> </b></td><td><b>3,937</b></td><td><b>3,915</b></td><td><b>4,023</b></td><td><b>4,214</b></td></tr><tr><td>West</td><td>Galway</td><td>12,881</td><td>13,443</td><td>13,815</td><td>14,297</td></tr><tr><td>West</td><td>Mayo</td><td>3,537</td><td>3,728</td><td>3,932</td><td>3,981</td></tr><tr><td>West</td><td>Roscommon</td><td>884</td><td>911</td><td>867</td><td>936</td></tr><tr><td><b>West Total</b></td><td><b> </b></td><td><b>17,302</b></td><td><b>18,082</b></td><td><b>18,614</b></td><td><b>19,214</b></td></tr><tr><td>Mid-West</td><td>Clare</td><td>6,430</td><td>6,343</td><td>6,477</td><td>6,599</td></tr><tr><td>Mid-West</td><td>Limerick</td><td>7,176</td><td>7,458</td><td>7,939</td><td>8,849</td></tr><tr><td>Mid-West</td><td>Tipperary North Riding</td><td>294</td><td>306</td><td>298</td><td>318</td></tr><tr><td><b>Mid-West Total</b></td><td><b> </b></td><td><b>13,900</b></td><td><b>14,107</b></td><td><b>14,714</b></td><td><b>15,766</b></td></tr><tr><td>South-East</td><td>Carlow</td><td>645</td><td>735</td><td>749</td><td>768</td></tr><tr><td>South-East</td><td>Kilkenny</td><td>572</td><td>617</td><td>716</td><td>650</td></tr><tr><td>South-East</td><td>Tipperary South Riding</td><td>3,393</td><td>3,055</td><td>3,246</td><td>3,200</td></tr><tr><td>South-East</td><td>Waterford</td><td>5,112</td><td>5,183</td><td>5,248</td><td>5,662</td></tr><tr><td>South-East</td><td>Wexford</td><td>2,350</td><td>2,413</td><td>2,503</td><td>2,486</td></tr><tr><td><b>South-East Total</b></td><td><b> </b></td><td><b>12,072</b></td><td><b>12,003</b></td><td><b>12,462</b></td><td><b>12,766</b></td></tr><tr><td>South-West</td><td>Cork</td><td>26,333</td><td>27,456</td><td>28,471</td><td>31,900</td></tr><tr><td>South-West</td><td>Kerry</td><td>1,605</td><td>1,638</td><td>1,874</td><td>1,931</td></tr><tr><td><b>South-West Total</b></td><td><b> </b></td><td><b>27,938</b></td><td><b>29,094</b></td><td><b>30,345</b></td><td><b>33,831</b></td></tr><tr><td><b>Total</b></td><td><b>Total</b></td><td><b>159,779</b></td><td><b>167,041</b></td><td><b>175,223</b></td><td><b>187,056</b></td></tr></table></p></reply>

The report, which has been noted by Government, concentrates on the costs that are largely domestically determined such as labour, property, transport, energy, water, waste, communications, credit /financial, and business service.  It finds that Ireland&rsquo;s cost base has improved across a range of metrics over the last five years.  This has made Irish firms more competitive internationally and made Ireland a more attractive location for firms to base their operations in.</p>  <p>  Despite these improvements, Ireland remains a relatively high cost location for a range of key business inputs.  There is upward cost pressure evident in the market for commercial insurance.  The report is a timely reminder of the risks of complacency regarding our cost competitiveness.</p>  <p>  To protect the gains achieved to date, to sustain the recovery, and to ultimately spread the benefits of economic growth to all, we must continue to enhance all aspects of our cost competitiveness.  The policy implications of the Costs of Doing Business report and the associated reforms required to address Ireland&rsquo;s cost base, will be included in the Council&rsquo;s annual Competitiveness Challenge report which will be brought to Government and published later this year.</p>  <p>  Insurance costs are relevant to businesses of all sizes and in all sectors of the economy.  In general insurance costs account for a relatively low proportion of the overall enterprise cost base.  While insurance costs represent a minor component of enterprise operating costs, premium increases can have an impact on costs, particularly for SMEs and micro enterprises.  Under EU law, the ability of the Government to influence insurance pricing is limited.  While the provision and the pricing of insurance policies is a commercial matter for insurance companies, competitive and transparent markets are vital.</p>  <p>  While my Department has no role in the supervision or regulation of insurance, which is primarily a policy and supervisory matter for the Department of Finance and the Central Bank respectively, last year, the National Competitiveness Council (NCC) considered the commercial insurance market in Ireland as part of its 2015 Costs of Doing Business in Ireland 2015 report.  It subsequently set out a range of potential actions which could help facilitate enhanced cost competitiveness in the non-life commercial insurance market.  These were set out in its Competitiveness Challenge 2015 report.  The Council concluded that the absence of price data makes it very difficult to assess market conditions and competitiveness in the non-life insurance market.  The Council subsequently recommended that responsibility for improving insurance cost competitiveness of commercial insurance must be clearly assigned and accorded sufficient priority by policymakers and there is a need to comprehensively benchmark insurance costs and the drivers of costs in Ireland with costs in our key competitors.</p>  <p>  The Department of Finance is currently examining the factors which contribute to increasing costs of insurance.  This work is part of an overall review of policy in the insurance sector which that Department is carrying out in consultation with the Central Bank and other Departments, Agencies and external stakeholders.  My Department will continue to engage with the Department of Finance in their ongoing work.</p></reply>

This timeline met the transposition requirements laid down in Article 15 of the Directive.</p>  <p>  The EU Directive deals with health and safety at work and lays down the minimum safety requirements regarding the exposure of workers to risks arising from electromagnetic fields.

I understand the dispute concerned enhanced redundancy terms for a number of staff employed in the Community Development Projects.  This matter was not one of enforcing an employment right where a ruling relating to a breach would be enforceable.  It refers to an industrial relations dispute where better terms are sought.</p>  <p>  This dispute was referred to the Conciliation Service of the Labour Relations Commission in the first instance however no resolution was reached at conciliation and the dispute was subsequently referred to the Labour Court under Section 26(1) of the Industrial Relations Act 1990.  The Labour Court operates as an industrial relations tribunal, hearing both sides in a case and then issuing a Recommendation setting out its opinion on the dispute and the terms on which it should be settled.  In this case a hearing took place in April 2010 and the Labour Court issued a Recommendation in May 2010.  In its Recommendation the Court recommended redundancy terms of three weeks pay per year of service in addition to statutory terms, which is two weeks.</p>  <p>  A recommendation issued by the Labour Court under Section 26(1) of the Industrial Relation Act 1990 is not binding on the parties concerned.  However while the Recommendation is not binding on the parties, the parties are expected to give serious consideration to the Court's Recommendation.  Ultimately, however, where either party does not accept the Recommendation it may be considered that the dispute is not resolved and further negotiations may be needed to resolve the matter.  It this case it would appear that funding to pay enhanced redundancy was not available to the employers.</p>  <p>  The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation was never a party to this dispute and consequently the making of any payment by my Department would not arise.

Payments are made from the Social Insurance Fund, which is mostly funded from employee and employer PRSI contributions.  I understand that the Department of Social Protection is currently processing payments for workers who have been made redundant from the company.

Section 9 of the Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014 provides that the Commission is independent in the performance of its functions, including carrying out investigations of alleged breaches of the law.  As investigations and enforcement matters generally are part of the day-to-day operational work of the Authority, I, as Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, have no direct function in the matter.</p>  <p>  If the Deputy is aware of any alleged anti-competitive behaviour that is being practised (be it price-fixing or bid-rigging), I would urge him to forward details to the CCPC for their attention.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the CCPC investigates other infringements of competition law, not just hard-core cartel activities, which also may restrict competition.  The CCPC has investigated and successfully challenged (both directly and through the courts) a number of agreements on this basis.</p>  <p>  The CCPC was formally established in October 2014.  Following its establishment, and in view of the significant number of vacancies that existed at that point in time, the CCPC took the opportunity to review its organisational structure to ensure it would be structured effectively and to ensure it would utilise the extensive professional and technical expertise that existed amongst its staff.</p>  <p>  The CCPC is now well advanced into the process of hiring 25 additional staff to make up the numbers that have been depleted over the years and to resource new functions.</p>  <p>  Since the most recent recruitment process began the CCPC has filled 12 positions over the last two months.  The skill sets recruited include competition and enforcement experts.  Many of those recruited have commenced employment or are due to start shortly.  The rest of the vacancies are at various stages of the recruitment process, including backfilling for vacancies created where internal staff have been successful in the external competitions and for new vacancies that have arisen as a result of departures (including resignations and retirements).  The CCPC expects to have the remaining vacancies filled over the coming months.  Some of these vacancies are in the competition enforcement divisions.</p>  <p>  I understand from the CCPC that, in addition to a bid rigging cartel case that is currently before the courts, in 2016 the CCPC has already conducted 21 searches of companies suspected of anti-competitive practices.  During 2015 the CCPC received 74 allegations of competition law breaches (both civil and criminal) and opened two large scale investigations in respect of anti-competitive agreements, one of which involved searches at five premises in the bagged cement sector.  This is in addition to the opening of a cartel investigation into allegations of a criminal breach of competition law in the aviation sector and the closing of two additional investigations.  Since 2013, the CCPC has sent one file to the DPP in respect of suspected infringements of Section 4 of the Competition Act 2002.  The trial is set to take place in April 2017.</p>  <p>  I am confident that the CCPC will continue to carry out its statutory functions in the future.</p></reply>

It also includes situations where access to a website is granted, but the customer from abroad is prevented from accessing the product or service in question or being asked to pay with a debit or credit card from a certain country.</p>  <p>  Some forms of geo-blocking are justified.  However, many are not justified.  The proposed EU Regulation on geo-blocking aims to provide for more opportunities to customers: it addresses the problem of customers not being able to buy products and services from traders located in a different Member State, or being discriminated in accessing the best prices or sales conditions compared to nationals or residents.</p>  <p>  While the impact assessment accompanying the legislative proposal from the EU Commission does not put a figure on the likely scale of consumer detriment incurred by European consumers on foot of unjustified geo-blocking measures used by traders, survey data collected in 2014 shows that 19% of cross border online shoppers did experience restrictions at one stage or another when attempting to make a purchase.  Similarly, 2015 Eurostat figures show that 10% of cross border online shoppers were restricted in making a purchase based on their nationality or place of residence in the previous 12 months.</p>  <p>  More generally, the Digital Single Market (DSM) Strategy for Europe published by the EU Commission in 2015 states that the economic potential of the DSM for consumers and businesses is currently under-exploited.  The EU Commission estimated that consumer welfare gains from greater e-commerce activity in goods in an integrated DSM could reach over &euro;200 billion per annum with two-thirds of these gains coming from increased online choice.</p>  <p>  With regards to the EU Commission proposal on addressing unjustified geo-blocking, the Government fully supports any measure that enhances consumer welfare, without any disproportionate additional burden on business, in order to facilitate the achievement of a fully-functioning integrated Digital Single Market.</p></reply>

All efforts to estimate the harm of hidden cartels suffers from the problem that it is impossible to know the number of cartels in existence.  Academic research tells us that the cost overcharge that results from hidden cartels is in the range of 20 to 30% and they can endure for 8 years on average before detection.</p>  <p>  At the same time, anti-competitive agreements that are not hidden in the same manner also cause harm and the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) has often taken action in relation to these.  These can be no less damaging to consumers and indeed to the State as it attempts to obtain value for money in the provision of services provided by different professional groups to consumers, etc.</p>  <p>  To assist in exposing cartels, the CCPC has a Cartel Immunity Programme that it runs in conjunction with the DPP.</p>  <p>  I understand from the CCPC that, in addition to a bid rigging cartel case that is currently before the courts, in 2016 the CCPC has already conducted 21 searches of companies suspected of anti-competitive practices.

Government is addressing the implications for Ireland of the UK leaving the EU by actively taking forward the contingency plan to ensure that we respond appropriately.  The Government and my Department and its agencies are taking concrete actions to address potential challenges and deliver for Ireland on any potential upside that change inevitably presents.</p>  <p>  I instituted a Coordination Group consisting of the Chief Executive Officers of IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland and relevant enterprise, single market, and trade officials, to oversee the management of our immediate response and the messaging to businesses both overseas and domestically.  I will continue to chair this Group as part my Department&rsquo;s ongoing response as developments unfold.</p>  <p>  Both agencies have communicated directly with their clients, and, I am aware that there have been multiple contacts since then, between IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland and the enterprise base.</p>  <p>  In terms of FDI, IDA Ireland continues to market Ireland across the globe as the number one location for direct investment, confirming that we are open for business.</p>  <p>  I, together with the Minister for Finance and the Government, are actively considering all aspects arising from the UK referendum, conscious that the situation is evolving and remains uncertain in the short term.  UK tax issues are a matter for the UK administration and parliament.  Chancellor Hammond has indicated that the Autumn Statement will take place as usual.</p>  <p>  A competitive tax offering is one part of our attractive holistic offering.  Ireland&rsquo;s 12.5% corporate tax rate is underpinned by a competitive regime &ndash; our world class R&amp;D tax credit and our &lsquo;best in class&rsquo; OECD compliant Knowledge Development Box.  Our low rate applied to a broad base ensures sustainable economic growth while still maintaining tax revenues.</p>  <p>  A priority for Government is to protect and promote Ireland&rsquo;s interests to the greatest extent possible, working within the EU context.  Ireland&rsquo;s foreign direct investment policy, of which tax is one part, has attracted real and substantive operations to Ireland &ndash; the kind that brings real jobs.  We have an enviable track record.  Ireland&rsquo;s transparent and competitive tax regime and our membership of the EU continue to provide a certainty that is valued by business.  Ireland has an English speaking business environment, ease of doing business and access to talent and consistently performs well on key international indices.  Ireland has a certain, stable and competitive offering.  Ireland is, and will remain a member of the EU and Eurozone.</p></reply>

At an individual level the resources required to achieve a minimum essential standard of living is very dependent on family circumstances and thus the interaction of individual earnings with household income and State-provided supports such as Child Benefit, Family Income Supplement as well as supports available in relation to housing, education and health all contribute to an individual&rsquo;s standard of living.</p>  <p>  It is important that Ireland&rsquo;s statutory National Minimum Wage and the Living Wage concept are not conflated.  The Living Wage is a voluntary societal initiative centred on the social, business and economic case to ensure that, wherever it can be afforded, employers will pay a rate of pay that provides an income that is sufficient to meet an individual&rsquo;s basic needs, such as housing, food, clothing, transport and healthcare.  The Living Wage is voluntary and has no legislative basis and is therefore not a statutory entitlement.  It is different to the National Minimum Wage which is a statutory entitlement and has a legislative basis.</p>  <p>  The Low Pay Commission was established last year and its primary function is to, on an annual basis, examine and make recommendations on the national minimum wage, with a view to securing that the national minimum wage, where adjusted, is adjusted incrementally over time having had regard to changes in earnings, productivity, overall competitiveness and the likely impact any adjustment will have on employment and unemployment levels.  The Commission presented its first report in July 2015 in which it recommended an increase of 50 cents per hour to the minimum hourly rate bringing it to &euro;9.15.  That increase, which was accepted by Government, came into effect on 1st January last.</p>  <p>  The Commission is due to submit its second Report today. Any recommendation made by the Commission will be considered by Government in the context of Budget 2017.</p>  <p>  Issues relating to Public Sector employees and their terms and conditions of employment are a matter for my colleague, Pascal Donohoe TD, Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  Issues relating to the tendering of public contracts are also outside my remit and should be addressed to the Office of Public Procurement which operates as an office of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p></reply>

Achieving this ambitious target is premised on the creation of a range of employment and career opportunities across a broad spectrum of skills across all sectors of the economy, including manufacturing and services activities.  Supporting the creation by enterprises of sustainable and quality employment is the key focus of my Department, of the enterprise development agencies and the Local Enterprise Offices.  We are determined to ensure there are employment opportunities in this country for all our people.</p>  <p>  Enterprise 2025, the Government&rsquo;s long-term enterprise policy was launched in 2015.  It is an ambitious strategy, with the objective of delivering growth over the next decade that is sustainable, led by strong export performance, builds on our sectoral strengths, and that is underpinned by innovation, productivity, cost effectiveness and competitiveness.</p>  <p>  It is our aim to build resilience into our economy so that we do not suffer again as we have done in the past.  As a small open economy Ireland&rsquo;s success will be dependent on driving export led growth and growing the additional indirect jobs stimulated by the activities of exporting enterprises in the wider economy.  We will continuously monitor our employment growth patterns in terms of an export/non-export &lsquo;balance&rsquo; to avoid the mistakes of the past.</p>  <p>  The focus on job creation is a Government wide agenda.  As set out in the Programme for a Partnership Government, it involves:</p>  <p>  - achieving a leap forward in the capacity and the performance of enterprises based here/ and in attracting further investment.  We will put in place an extra &euro;500 million in capital funding to accelerate export led jobs growth across Ireland&rsquo;s regions;</p>  <p>  - focusing investments in areas where Ireland can differentiate itself internationally &ndash; specifically education and skills, creating attractive places to live and work throughout the country and supporting enterprise innovation; and</p>  <p>  - improving the environment for business in terms and maintaining a focus on protecting our national competitiveness from unsustainable cost growth.</p>  <p>  To deliver on this ambitious target, in the Programme for a Partnership Government we commit to maintaining the OECD endorsed Action Plan for Jobs (APJ) Process that will set out, on an annual basis, the best ideas for job creation within available resources.</p>  <p>  Building on this process, we are focused on ensuring that we can support new job creation in every region in the country over the next five years, through the implementation of the Regional Action Plans for Jobs.  A key objective of the plans is to have a further 10 to 15 per cent at work in each region by 2020.</p>  <p>  The Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN) reports to me and to the Minister for Education and Skills.  The EGFSN plays a key role in advising the Government on the current and future skills needs of the economy.  Recent EGFSN reports have anticipated future job opportunities arising from both expansion and replacement demand for a range of occupational roles.  These include ICT, data analytics, manufacturing, medical devices, pharmaceuticals, food and beverages.  Further opportunities are also anticipated in international sales and marketing, project management, freight transport, distribution and logistics, and in the hospitality sector.</p></reply>

The CCPC has been given the powers to enforce the regulations and will build on the considerable enforcement and investigative powers that its two predecessors (the Competition Authority and the National Consumer Agency) have built up rather than start afresh with a new body.  Contravention of the regulations will be an offence as will failure to comply with any contravention notice issued by the CCPC.  That body also has the power to publicly list all undertakings that have contravened either the regulations or failed to comply with the contravention notices: this will inform consumers on which undertakings are not abiding by the regulations.  It may also act on its own initiative or on the basis of information supplied to it.</p>  <p>  However, it must be pointed out that in enforcing any regulations, the basic tenets of fair procedure and natural and constitutional justice must be upheld.

Ireland&rsquo;s body of employment rights legislation protects all employees who are legally employed on an employer-employee basis, regardless of what title is given to them.  Therefore, once it is clear that a person is working under a contract of employment (written or verbal), on a full-time or part-time basis, that person has the same protection under employment law as other employees, including entitlement to the national minimum wage.</p>  <p>  All employers, including those in private homes, carry the same obligations in relation to compliance with employment law.  Where the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC), which is responsible for securing compliance with employment legislation, receives a complaint involving somebody described as an au pair, the WRC will investigate with a view to establishing whether a person has statutory entitlements under employment law.  Complaints involving au pairs are considered on a case-by-case basis, in the light of the facts of each case.</p>  <p>  The recent WRC decision regarding an individual working as an Au Pair does not constitute any change to existing employment law and any persons working under a contract of employment must continue to have the full protection of employment law.  I have no plans to review the status of au pairs with a view to deeming persons determined to be employees to be outside the scope of employment law.  My Department&rsquo;s remit in this area is primarily concerned with ensuring that those people found to be employees can enforce their rights, as provided for under employment rights legislation.</p>  <p>  Finally, under the National Minimum Wage Act 2000, certain reckonable components may be taken into account for all workers to determine an employee&rsquo;s average hourly rate.  In this context, if an employer provides an employee with full board and lodgings, or lodgings only or full board only, a monetary allowance can be included as reckonable pay (The term &lsquo;full board&rsquo; means an entitlement to meals during the day), as follows:</p>  <p>  - &euro;54.13 for board and lodgings per week, or &euro;7.73 per day;</p>  <p>  - &euro;32.14 for board only per week, or &euro;4.60 per day;</p>  <p>  - &euro;21.85 for lodgings only per week, or &euro;3.14 per day.</p>  <p>  The inclusion of this provision in the National Minimum Wage legislation was recommended by the Inter-Departmental Group on Implementation of a National Minimum Wage.  It was the view of the Inter-Departmental Group that the monetary value of the allowances for the purpose of the National Minimum Wage would not be set at market value but rather would be similar to the amount provided for in Employment Regulation Orders.</p>  <p>  The National Minimum Wage Act 2000 (National Minimum Hourly Rate of Pay) Order 2000 (SI No. 95/2000) provided for the amounts specified.</p>  <p>  As I indicated during the debate on the Au Pair Placement Bill 2016 during Private Members' Business last week, I am very conscious of the passage of time since the board and lodgings rates were set.  It is my intention therefore to ask the Low Pay Commission to review these rates as part of their next Work Programme.</p></reply>

Key targets in service of this overall goal are to achieve an increase of at least 25% in the number of start-ups in the region; a 25% improvement in the survival rate of new businesses; an increase in the number of IDA investments in the region by 30-40% up to 2019; and an increase of 300 to 500 in the numbers of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s<b></b>na Gaeltachta supported jobs in the North West.</p><p>Sectors targeted as part of the plan include traditionally strong sectors for the region like agrifood, manufacturing/engineering and tourism, including active promotion of the tourism potential of the Lakelands Region, which includes Cavan and Monaghan.</p><p>Areas targeted for future growth include digital payments, cleantech and creative services.</p><p>One of the expected outcomes of these targeted initiatives in the North East/ North West will be a reduction in the commercial vacancy rates.

From the inception of the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) Programme, services who chose to provide ECCE were required to sign a contract, or &lsquo;Grant Funding Agreement&rsquo;.</p>  <p>  The review of the DCYA Childcare Programme ECCE Grant Funding Agreement for the 2016/17 academic year was conducted by the Early Years Unit of my Department.  This was within the context of the significant expansion of the Programme, which is designed to make high quality and affordable childcare available to more children and families.</p>  <p>  To assist the Department during this review process and in order to gain important input from the childcare sector, officials from my Department met with representatives from Early Childhood Ireland (ECI) in June 2016.  These representatives included childcare providers from rural and urban settings.  At this meeting, ECI representatives were presented with a list of potential amendments to the ECCE Grant Funding Agreement, for discussion and feedback.  Officials from my Department also met with delegates from County Childcare Ireland (CCI), the representative body for the City/County Childcare Committees (CCCs), in June 2016.  Again, these delegates were presented with a list of potential amendments to the ECCE Grant Funding Agreement, along with an invitation for feedback.</p>  <p>  The finalised ECCE Grant Funding Agreement for 2016/17 was published on the DCYA website on the 4th of July 2016.  Notification of publication was communicated to all City/County Childcare Committees on the same day, for forwarding on to childcare providers.  Childcare providers had been notified that the contracting process for the 2016/17 ECCE Programme would be conducted online, on the Programmes Implementation Platform (PIP), and therefore the ECCE Grant Funding Agreement document was for information purposes only.</p>  <p>  The DCYA has issued regular notifications in relation to this year&rsquo;s online contracting process.  In this regard, childcare providers will, from the 29th of July 2016, be able to submit electronic or &lsquo;online&rsquo; acceptance of the ECCE 2016/17 Grant Funding Agreement so as to provide the new and expanded ECCE programme.</p></reply>

As the Deputy will be aware, the establishment of such an Agency would result in additional costs to the Exchequer.  In relation to an estimated annual running cost of &euro;500,000 of such an Au Pair Agency, this figure was based on a comparison with the Low Pay Commission model and information provided by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.</p><p>The report of the Interdepartmental Group (IDG) on Future Investment in Childcare, 2015, set out a range of evidence based policy options for the delivery of accessible, affordable, high quality childcare.  The Report found that au pairs or nannies comprise a small percentage of childcare arrangements.  The <i>'Growing Up in Ireland'</i>longitudinal study (2010 and 2013) indicated that one per-cent of nine-month-olds, and one per-cent of three-year-olds were cared for by Au Pairs/Nannies.  Further analysis showed that 0.6 per-cent of 9 year olds had their main care provided by an Au-pair/Nanny.  It would be very difficult to estimate the total number of households using Au Pairs from this data.</p><p>I referred to a survey conducted by the Migrant Rights Centre Ireland in 2015 on trends and working conditions for Au Pairs in Ireland.  That survey of 554 Au Pairs found that 48% of those who participated were Brazilian and 98% were women aged between 31 and 35 years.</p><p>Other research conducted by the Migrant Rights Centre Ireland on &lsquo;<i>Childcare in the Domestic Work Sector'</i>(May 2015) to which I referred was co-financed by the European Commission under the European Integration Fund and was supported by the Office for the promotion of Migrant Integration in the Department of Justice and Equality and Pobal.</p><p>The ruling of the Workplace Relations Commission to which I referred in my Second Stage speech related to a case of a Spanish woman working as an Au Pair who won a landmark case against an Irish host family to be treated as an employee in March of this year.  The woman, who wished to remain anonymous, took a case to the Workplace Relations Commission on a number of employment grounds.</p><p>The Workplace Relations Commission Adjudicator determined the person working as an Au Pair to be an employee and entitled to the National Minimum Wage and to the protections of the Organisation of Working Time Act (which sets out statutory rights for employees in respect of rest, maximum working time and holidays).</p><p>The Workplace Relations Commission ordered that the woman be compensated for money owed for work, rest, annual leave and public holidays which amounted to a sum of &euro;9,229.

Among the roles assigned to the Defence Forces is the provision of Aid to the Civil Power which, in practice, means to provide assistance and support to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when requested to do so.</p>  <p>  A Protocol is in existence between the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces concerning the emergency culling of animals by the Defence Forces.  The criteria in the Protocol stipulates that a request for the assistance of the Defence Forces for the emergency culling of animals will be made only in circumstances where the Department of Agriculture Food and the Marine has exhausted all possibilities for normal humane methods of culling.  Also in line with the protocol a request is submitted to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who will, if they require, request the assistance of the Defence Forces.</p>  <p>  Between the years 2011 to date in 2016 the Defence Forces have been deployed on one occasion to carry such an operation.  This entailed the culling of 5 heifers on 5th July 2016.  This operation was carried out in line with the Protocol and at the request of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It was initiated at the request of the Official Assignee in Bankruptcy who is responsible for the herd of cattle on the farm in question.  It proceeded in conjunction with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  On the rare occasions when the Protocol is invoked officials from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Maine are always present.</p>  <p>  Whilst there is no formalised training for the Defence Forces in the humane killing of animals, a number of factors are considered and incorporated into such an operation to ensure the most humane conduct of the culling.  These include the utilisation of hunting ammunition, the distance to the targets and simultaneous firing to prevent the remaining animals taking flight and thus minimising distress to the animals.</p></reply>

The Acts also provide that a disability pension may be granted in respect of permanent disablement due to a disease secondary to an injury (whether at home or abroad).  Illnesses of a psychiatric nature or similar conditions are generally classified as disease for purposes of the Army Pensions Acts.</p>  <p>  The specific provisions in the Army Pensions Acts covering disease attributable to or aggravated by overseas service with the United Nations were introduced in 1960 in the context of the additional risks and dangers associated with such service.  Similar provisions previously applied where the disease was attributable to home service but only during the 1922-24 period and the Emergency period (1939-45) because service conditions during each of these periods were regarded as exceptional.  There are no proposals to amend the Army Pensions Acts to allow for disability pensions applications in respect of disease contracted on home service.</p>  <p>  I should say that there are provisions under existing superannuation arrangements viz. the Defence Forces Pensions Schemes, for personnel who are compulsorily retired or discharged on medical grounds.  In addition to benefits under those Schemes and the Army Pensions Acts, the majority of members of the PDF are eligible for a range of benefits under the Social Welfare Acts, and under the Health Acts on the same basis as other members of the community.</p>  <p>  The Defence Forces, through their Personnel Support Services (PSS), and working closely with the HSE, have and continue to engage in education programmes for all members of the Defence Forces.  These programmes include:</p>  <p>  - Issuing an &ldquo;Information Guide on Mental Health and Well Being in the Defence Forces&rdquo;;</p>  <p>  - Providing access to &ldquo;Mental Fitness&rdquo; programmes through the Defence Forces Intranet;</p>  <p>  - Providing WRAP (Wellness Recovery Action Plan) training to all PSS personnel;</p>  <p>  - Conducting STORM (Skills Training on Risk Management in suicide and self harm mitigation) training with all overseas units;</p>  <p>  - Conducting Safe Talk training within the Defence Forces;</p>  <p>  - Providing CISM (Critical Incident Stress Management) training for all personnel;</p>  <p>  - Issuing and giving presentations on &ldquo;Defence Forces Guidelines on Suicide&rdquo;;</p>  <p>  - Running courses on &ldquo;Suicide and Self Harm Awareness&rdquo;; and</p>  <p>  - Providing ASIST (Applied Suicide Intervention Skills Training) in conjunction with the HSE.</p>  <p>  There is a PSS office in every major military installation, with one or more qualified Barrack PSS Officers.  The role of the Barrack PSS Office includes providing information, assistance and counselling on a range of matters including interpersonal problems, stress, bereavement, housing, education, taxation, social welfare and retirement.  As part of the PSS office, civilian social workers are also available to support Defence Forces personnel and their families.
