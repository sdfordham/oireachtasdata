If a person does not qualify for JB they may qualify for means tested jobseeker's allowance. In 2012 my Department spent over &euro;3.8 billion on the schemes and at the end of 2012 there were some 390,000 persons in receipt of payment under these schemes.</p><p>  Unlike other jobseekers, part-time fire fighters are entitled to a JB payment in respect of days that they are engaged in fire fighting or training.  They are, however, required to satisfy the statutory conditions for the receipt of a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment of being available for and genuinely seeking work. However, the requirement that they reside and work in proximity to the fire station of their brigade may, subject to the circumstances of an individual case, unreasonably restrict the location where they can accept work and limit their prospects of obtaining work. It is a matter for Deciding Officers to make a decision based on the circumstances of each case.</p><p>  The Department is currently examining the position of these workers vis-&agrave;-vis the jobseeker&rsquo;s schemes and the unusual employment circumstances of retained fire brigade personnel. This includes consideration of the availability for work criteria. As part of this process the Department is in discussions with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  However, final decisions have not been made with regard to potential changes to existing arrangements. I am aware that this issue is taking some time to conclude but it is complex and unique.  There is a need to strike a reasonable balance between the requirements of the fire brigade services of local authorities on the one hand and equity with the treatment of other job seekers on the other.  I have asked the Department to conclude its examination as a matter of urgency.</p></reply>

Under the legislative provisions governing rent supplement, the Department&rsquo;s relationship is with the tenant.  Rent supplement is specifically for the benefit of tenants to assist them with their accommodation needs and there is no direct relationship between the landlord and the Department.  However, rent supplement payments can, at the request of the tenant and agreement of the Department, be paid directly to the landlord.  The efficiency of the scheme would be significantly affected if all rent supplement payments were made directly to the landlord as the Department would potentially have to create a formal relationship with up to 88,000 additional clients, the landlords, for what should be only a short term need.</p><p>  On 27 March 2012, the Government approved, in principle, to transfer responsibility for the provision of rental assistance to persons with a long-term housing need from this Department to housing authorities using a new Housing Assistance Payment (HAP).  Among the main features of HAP is that landlords will be paid directly by the local authority.  The Department has recently introduced legislation to amend the household budget scheme which will support tenants in meeting their rental obligations to local authorities.  This amendment is a key stepping stone towards the transfer of responsibility for providing for the housing needs of long-term recipients of rent supplement to the housing authorities.  The Department of Environment, Community and Local Government has advised that it expects pilot testing of HAP to commence during the second half of 2013 and a general commencement of transfers will take place from January 2014.  The new arrangements will achieve a key Government commitment of removing barriers to employment and at the same time returning rent supplement to its original purpose of a short-term income support.</p></reply>

It is designed to remove the barriers to participation in second and third level education by enabling those in receipt of certain social welfare payments to continue to receive a payment while pursuing an approved full-time education course that leads to a higher qualification than that already held.  The BTEA scheme covers a large range of full-time courses of education in approved colleges, spanning basic foundation courses to third level courses across all disciplines.</p><p>  The numbers availing of BTEA and the associated cost of the scheme has risen dramatically in recent years.  Numbers for the current 2012/13 academic year are 25,886 which represents a 191% increase on the 2007/08 numbers.  It is estimated numbers pursuing BTEA in the 2013/14 academic year will be similar to this year.  Provisional expenditure figures indicate a cost of &euro;199.1m for BTEA in 2012 compared to the position in 2008 where expenditure stood at &euro;77.13m.  An estimate of expenditure of &euro;189.3m is provided in 2013.</p><p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, managing expenditure demands for 2013 and beyond poses difficult challenges and requires a critical analysis of all expenditure items.  As part of the recent Budgetary process, the Government considered the resources available to meet expenditure demands across the various schemes and services delivered by the Department in 2013.  Budget 2013 introduced the cessation of the &euro;300 cost of education allowance for new and existing BTEA participants from January 1st, 2013.  This applies to all courses commencing after this date.  Courses that commenced prior to Jan 1st 2013, who have not yet been paid the cost of education allowance may be paid the allowance once it relates to courses commenced prior to 1 January 2013.  The BTEA scheme remains an attractive scheme for social welfare recipients who wish to further their education.  A significant majority of those entering BTEA are in receipt of the maximum personal rate of payment of &euro;188 per week, which compares favourably with other State funded supports for those pursuing education.</p></reply>

The Government has provided &euro;48.8m for the scheme in 2013.   The rates for 2013, which are not intended to meet the full cost of school clothing and footwear but to provide assistance towards these costs, compare favourably with available prices. The rates of back to school clothing and footwear allowance had increased significantly since 2006 when viewed in the context of clothing and footwear price trends.  The October 2012 Consumer Price Index indicates that the overall cost of clothing and footwear has fallen by over 27% during the same period.  Approximately 187,000 families, with 340,000 children, were assisted under the scheme in 2012. It is expected that a similar number of families and children will benefit from the scheme in 2013.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-01-29a.24.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013012900053#WRA01800"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 135, 146 and 417 together.</p><p>  As part of the package of measures in Budget 2013 I announced, along with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Frances Fitzgerald, a &euro;14 million joint childcare initiative between our two departments.  This initiative demonstrates my determination to progress this issue despite the very serious financial situation and the particularly difficult budgetary situation this year.  The new scheme will provide approximately 6,000 afterschool childcare places for eligible clients of my Department.  It will be targeted to support those who engage in the activation process and who enter into employment.  The places will be limited to low income families with children aged 4 to 12 years in primary school. </p><p>  I believe that the availability of these childcare places is a very positive measure for lone parents. I secured the agreement for this scheme from Government, in conjunction with Minister Fitzgerald, to address the child care needs of lone parents as part of the reforms of the one-parent family payment (OFP) scheme.  In addition, I have postponed the commencement date of the reductions to the age of the youngest child for receipt of OFP from January 2013 to July 2013, to provide time for this scheme to be defined and for some of these additional after-school child care supports to be put in place.</p><p>  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs estimate that the cost of universal after-school childcare provision in Ireland would be in the region of &euro;1 billion per annum.  Given the current fiscal constraints this level of funding is not currently available.  The new scheme will build on the existing supports provided by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in the child care sector.  My Department is working closely with officials from Department of Children and Youth Affairs to fully define the scheme.  I expect that the scheme will commence with a pilot and be rolled out on a phased basis.</p></reply>

The payment continues to be paid in respect of children up to their 18th birthday who are in full-time education, or who have a physical or mental disability.  The estimated expenditure on child benefit in 2013 is around &euro;1.9 billion and it is currently paid to around 609,000 families in respect of some 1.16 million children.</p><p>  Budget 2013 provides for a reduction in child benefit rates to &euro;130 per child per month for the first, second and third child in a family and to &euro;140 per child per month for the fourth and subsequent children.  Unfortunately, it has not been possible to exempt income support to families from the general budgetary strategy, given the level of adjustments required. Although this Budget measure is primarily designed to reduce overall public expenditure with a view to restoring stability to the public finances, some of the savings from this measure have been redirected towards services targeted at low-income families and includes an Area Based Approach to Child Poverty; after school childcare and additional funding for school meals. While child benefit, as a universal payment, can be an important source of income for all families, especially during a time of recession and high unemployment, the social protection system also provides assistance to low income families with children through the payment of qualified child increases (QCIs) on primary social welfare payments and through the family income supplement (FIS) payment. Both of these provide a level of assistance which is directly or indirectly linked with a household&rsquo;s income situation. Budget 2013 maintains both the QCI rate and the FIS income limit thresholds.</p><p>  Achieving a better design of the overall system of child income supports raises complex issues about the effectiveness and efficiency of the full range of income supports currently provided to families and their children. In this context and in line with a commitment in the Programme for Government, I established in 2011 an Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare, which has been tasked with recommending cost-effective solutions as to how employment disincentives can be improved and better poverty outcomes achieved, particularly child poverty outcomes. The Advisory Group prioritised the area of family and child income supports and has completed its work on this area. Their report is currently receiving my consideration and will be published in the near future.</p><p>  I would draw the Deputies&rsquo; attention to the fact that while the Comprehensive Expenditure Review, 2012 to 2014, published in December, 2011, provided for a reduction of a further &euro;540 million in expenditure by my Department in 2013, the Government was able to reduce the net savings required for this year to &euro;390 million. This was &euro;150 million less than originally indicated.  This enabled the Government to ensure, for the second year in a row, that there was no reduction in primary weekly rates of payment.</p><p>  In 2013 the Department will spend &euro;20.257 billion on the wide range of schemes and services it operates. The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's Expenditure Report 2013 published by Government last December provides for additional new expenditure reduction measures of &euro;440 million to be achieved in 2014 in the Department of Social Protection budget.  Reducing overall expenditure in 2014 in line with this target will be very challenging. No decisions have been made at this stage as to how these targets will be met.  The Government will consider this having regard to all of its commitments. The Deputies can be assured that my colleagues and I will do our best to ensure that the burden of resolving the crisis does not fall disproportionately on those who depend on income supports from my Department.</p></reply>

The process of negotiation on the Recommendation is currently under way, and the Irish Presidency has indicated our intention to have the agreed Recommendation adopted at the Council of relevant ministers at the end of February, and by the European Council before the end of our Presidency.</p><p>  The main issues under discussion in the negotiations relate to the identification of the target group of young people, to the length of the period within which a guarantee would apply, the types of measure that would qualify as meeting the guarantee, and the question of flexibility for Member States with particularly high levels of youth unemployment and/or particularly difficult circumstances in relation to their public finances.  When an agreed Recommendation has been adopted, the Government will review existing policies related to youth unemployment and identify the measures that will be required for the implementation of the guarantee.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-01-29a.36.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013012900054#WRB00500"><p>The overall objective of the pension system in Ireland is to provide an adequate and sustainable basic standard of living through direct State supports and to encourage people (through generous tax reliefs) to make supplementary pension provision so that they may have an adequate income replacement rates when they retire from work. Secure and adequate finances are one of the fundamental components of a happy and active retirement. Compared to the rest of the population, Ireland&rsquo;s older people have the lowest poverty rates (at 0.9%)  and are least likely to be at risk of poverty. Significant reform of our pensions systems is necessary to safeguard future sustainability and adequacy.</p><p>  Recent figures indicate that only half of workers aged between 20 and 69 years have a private pension and this relatively low coverage is of major concern to the Government.  The sustainability of the pension system is a particular concern because of the demographic challenges Ireland faces, the associated increases in pension (and other age related) costs, and the deterioration in the public finances.  This means that, in the future, the task of financing increased pension spending will fall to a diminishing share of the population as demographic projections indicate the ratio of working age to pensioners will decrease from 5.3/1 at present to 2.1/1 by 2060.  Life expectancy in Ireland is also increasing &ndash; in the mid 1990s, life expectancy for males was 73 and for females 78.5.  In 2041, it will be 86.5 and 88.3 respectively.  Whilst this is very welcome development, it also presents very real and obvious public policy challenges. </p><p>  While the State pension is expected to provide sufficient retirement income for the lowest paid workers, many people retiring from work will have a significant income gap if they do not have supplementary private pension provision. It is a priority for the Government to increase supplementary pension coverage, particularly amongst the lower paid and those with gaps in their employment. The Programme for Government includes a commitment to reforming the pension system to progressively achieve universal coverage, with particular focus on lower-paid workers. A soft-mandatory approach such as that envisaged by an auto-enrolment scheme, using economies of scale to achieve greater cost efficiencies for the member, is a very proactive way in which we can increase supplementary pension coverage. However, it is recognised that introduction of such an initiative would be best supported by a more favourable economic environment than is currently the case.</p><p>  Recent discussions on the pensions system in Ireland and future pension policy identified the need for a short and focussed examination on the direction of long term policy to ensure a modern, sustainable, and adequate pension system taking into account the impact of the economic downturn.  In this regard, the OECD has been commissioned to review long term pension policy in Ireland and this will include consideration of an auto enrolment system.  It is expected that the report from the OECD will be finalised in the first quarter of this year.</p></reply>

During 2012, an average of 48,700 persons availed of these schemes.  These include JobBridge; the employment programmes, T&Uacute;S, the Rural Social Scheme, and Community Employment; and support for people setting up their own businesses by means of the Back to Work Enterprise Allowance and Short-term Enterprise Allowance.  The employment programmes in particular are targeted for those who are long-term unemployed.  For 2013, it is intended to increase employment and work experience places to 60,000.  I expect these additional places to be fully taken up during the year.  This will have a commensurate impact of reducing the Live Register in the short-term while persons avail of these programmes. </p><p>  A particular emphasis will be placed on an intensified approach to engaging with long-term unemployed in 2013.  Towards this end the Department intends, during 2013, to:</p><p> 1. Commence a project to profile all c 420,000 clients on the live register.  This will help the Department to prioritise the selection of clients for assistance and to allocate scarce places on training and activation schemes.</p><p> 2. Increase the number of its own staff assigned to case work/employment services duties.</p><p>  In addition, a major initiative planned for 2013 will be the streamlining of the existing Revenue Job Assist and Employer PRSI schemes into a single easy to administer scheme that offers an attractive incentive to employers recruiting people who are long-term unemployed.</p><p>  While there should be an impact in medium to long term in improving people&rsquo;s probability of exit from the Live Register as a result of these measures, the impact is not quantifiable. However, we do have some preliminary evaluation of the outcomes from the JobBridge Internship Scheme, which forms a significant component of the Pathways to Work approach. The findings of the interim evaluation of JobBridge, by Indecon found that 61% of interns who completed their internship secured employment within 5 months.  These progression rates compare favourably with European averages in this area and represent very significant progress in a short period of time.  It is expected that the progression outcomes in respect of those under 25 would be broadly in line with this 61% figure.</p></reply>

Processing times vary across schemes, depending on the differing qualification criteria.  As can be seen from the data in the table below, schemes that require a high level of documentary evidence from the customer, particularly in the case of illness-related schemes, can take longer to process. Similarly, means-tested payments can also require more detailed investigation and interaction with the applicant, thereby lengthening the decision making process.  Delays can also arise if information is required from social security organisations in other jurisdictions and where additional information has been requested from the applicant but remains outstanding.  For example, pension claims on hand for more than three months typically occur in the case of EU/bilateral pensions where information from other jurisdictions is awaited or, in the case of self-employed, there may be outstanding PRSI liabilities. This delay impacts on the award of household benefits in many cases as these secondary payments are linked to when the primary benefit is awarded.</p><p>As part of the Department&rsquo;s programme of service delivery modernisation, a range of initiatives aimed at streamlining the processing of claims, supported by modern technology, have been implemented in recent years. Operational processes, procedures and the organisation of work are continually reviewed to ensure that processing capability is maximised.  In addition, the staffing needs of the Department are regularly reviewed, having regard to workloads and the competing demands arising, to ensure that the best use is made of all available resources.  The Department will continue to source available staff to fill critical vacancies by way of redeployment, or transfer from within the Department and other Government Departments, taking account of the employment control framework (ECF) target, as determined by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. Since May, 2008 to end December, 2012, a total of 1,084 posts (1,111 people) have been filled across the Department through redeployment and transfer of staff.</p><p>The new Intreo service is currently being rolled-out and implemented on a phased basis. This new service integrates employment and income supports and provides for a streamlined and personalized service to clients in accessing job opportunities and availing of supports to enable them to get back to work at the earliest possible opportunity. The Intreo Centres also include a single integrated decision-making team that integrate and streamline the processes formerly undertaken by the different agencies now amalgamated into the Department.  Already clients are seeing the benefits of the integrated decisions process in terms of shorter decision times and in the reduced recourse to supplementary payments in offices where integrated decisions are in operation.</p><p>The Table below provides details of processing times for each quarter during 2013. It demonstrates the recent improvements that have been made in areas such as invalidity pension and family income supplement (FIS) areas.   FIS claims, both new and renewals received on or after the 5th November 2012 are currently being processed on receipt and it is intended to eliminate all backlogs by the end of March 2013.  The introduction of a new IT platform has also improved processing times for invalidity pension.</p><p>I wish to assure the Deputies that prompt processing of claims remains a priority for me. Each scheme area is continuously monitored and processing procedures reviewed to ensure that claims are paid to customer as quickly as possible.</p><p><b>Table: Claim processing times per Quarter - 2012:</b></p><p><table><tr><th></th><th></th><th></th><th></th><th><div>Average weeks to award </div></th></tr><tr><td>Scheme </td><td>Mar </td><td> June</td><td>Sept</td><td>Dec </td></tr><tr><td>State Pension (contributory) </td><td>6</td><td>5</td><td>7</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>State Pension (transition) </td><td>5</td><td>6</td><td>7</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>State pension (non-contributory) </td><td>11</td><td>12</td><td>12</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>Widow(er)&#8217;s Pension (contributory)  </td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Widow(er)&#8217;s Pension (non-con) pension &amp; one parent family payment (widow)</td><td>11</td><td>7</td><td>9</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>One Parent Family </td><td>17</td><td>15</td><td>13</td><td>14</td></tr><tr><td>Household Benefits</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Bereavement Grant </td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Invalidity Pension </td><td>31</td><td>32</td><td>33</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>Family Income Supplement  - New Claims</td><td>17</td><td>16</td><td>18</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>Disability Allowance</td><td>28*</td><td>17*</td><td>17*</td><td>17*</td></tr><tr><td>Carer&#8217;s Benefit</td><td>11</td><td>11</td><td>9</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>Carer&#8217;s Allowance</td><td>28*</td><td>28*</td><td>25*</td><td>25*</td></tr><tr><td>Jobseeker&#8217;s Benefit  </td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Jobseeker&#8217;s Allowance</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Illness Benefit  </td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Maternity Benefit </td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Child Benefit      - Domestic   </td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>4</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Domiciliary Care Allowance </td><td>6</td><td>7</td><td>6</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Back to Education Allowance</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Applicants for BTEA are already in receipt of another social welfare payment before a decision is made on their entitlement to the Allowance.  </td></tr></table></p><p>*Estimated for schemes which have recently been transferred to new IT platform</p></reply>

The Government has provided approximately &euro;718 million for the various SWA schemes in 2013.  I attach a tabular statement outlining the number of claims awarded for basic supplementary welfare allowance, rent supplement and mortgage interest supplement for each of the last three years. A breakdown of the number of rent supplement claims in payment on a county basis for each of the past four years is provided. I also attach details of the number of payments made under the exceptional needs payments and urgent needs payments schemes for 2011 and 2012. Statistics are not available on the length of time taken to process SWA applications, the number of applications received or their outcome.</p><p>Statistics from the Social Welfare Appeals Office advise that 5,445 SWA appeals were received in 2012. The average processing time was 17.6 weeks for appeals dealt with by way of summary decision and 22.9 weeks for those requiring an oral hearing. Prior to October 2011, supplementary welfare allowance appeals were submitted directly to appeals officers of the Health Services Executive (HSE).  A tabular statement detailing the outcome of SWA appeals decided by appeals officers for 2012 is attached.  The statistics presented in relation to appeals are not analysed under the various sub schemes within SWA as individual appeals can relate to more than one scheme area.</p><p>Reviews of exceptional needs payments and urgent needs payments are not appealed to the Chief Appeals Officer but are referred for review by another officer if the applicant is not satisfied with the outcome of their application. Statistics are not maintained on the number or the outcome of such reviews.</p><p>The provision of a prompt service is a major objective for the Department&rsquo;s staff administering the various elements of SWA. All decisions are decided as speedily as possible. This is tempered by the necessity to ensure that every case is fully examined and that all cases are dealt with in a consistent and fair manner. I am satisfied that the Department&rsquo;s staff dealing with applications or appeals in relation to SWA payments make every effort to ensure all transactions are processed in an efficient, fair and

These systems reliably deliver over 87 million payments yearly between them. Although developed independently, mechanisms exist on the major systems whereby significant changes made to customer or claim details are automatically notified to other relevant systems.   The Department is working towards consolidation on a single ICT &lsquo;platform&rsquo; - the Business Object Model implementation - BOMi.  This work is carried out as part of the Department&rsquo;s continuous Service Delivery Modernisation programme.</p><p>  As this programme progresses, all of the Department&rsquo;s client and claim related systems will be integrated on the BOMi platform, ensuring that all client and claim information is fully and automatically available across all of the Department&rsquo;s schemes and places of business.  Not only does the Department work with the information held by ourselves, we also recognise the value of working closely and collaboratively with other agencies to ensure that social welfare abuse is comprehensively detected and tackled.  Over the last number of years we have been engaged in data matching exercises with other Government Departments and public bodies for control purposes.  Data matching is viewed as an efficient and effective mechanism to target control related activity.  I am satisfied that the Department&rsquo;s systems communicate with each other and other bodies to share relevant information and this process will continue to be refined and expanded to meet control and other needs.</p></reply>

The total cost of the telephone allowance in 2013 is estimated at &#8364;48 million with 395,000 recipients.  My Department meets regularly with the energy and telecommunication providers to ensure the smooth operation of the household benefits scheme, and to pursue savings for the Department and better deals for our customers.  Those discussions are on-going. We continue to receive a discount from Electric Ireland; this discount was increased last year to &#8364;1.7 million. This is in addition to a previous &#8216;write off&#8217; of &#8364;1.1 million in relation to Public Services Obligation (PSO) rebate in 2009.  Last year a deal was concluded with Eircom which was estimated to generate &#8364;17 million in savings over a twelve month period.</p><p>  Following Budget 2013, the structure of the electricity and gas allowance has been changed from a unit based allowance to a cash credit of &#8364;35 per month.  This rate is currently aligned to the best average market rate currently available. The changed structure of the allowance is designed to encourage customers to achieve better savings through greater mobility between energy suppliers who can best meet their individual energy needs.</p><p>  As announced in Budget 2013, and having regard to the on-going budgetary constraints, the monthly telephone allowance for customers has been reduced from &#8364;22.60 to &#8364;9.50. By way of response, I welcome that Eircom are currently looking at developing special packages for vulnerable customers in response to this change. In addition, there are a wide variety of deals available from other operators within the market; by way of illustration it is now possible to get a standard pay-as-you-go brand name mobile telephone for as little as &#8364;19.99.</p><p>  Electricity and gas customers will mitigate the average loss per customer of &#8364;7.05 if they regularly shop around and ensure that they get the best value now in the market place from energy providers for their specific energy needs.  The Commission for Energy Regulation website   has information on how to switch electricity/gas supplier and the Commission for Communications Regulation website    has information on how to switch telecommunication and broadband supplier.</p></reply>

While initially identified with the Danish model of high levels of compensation, weak employment protection and a high spend on activation measures, flexicurity has come to be seen as a way of describing quite a wide range of combinations of policy measures.  There are in fact at least 16 combinations of flexibility and security found in EU member states that could be broadly deemed as some form of &#8216;flexicurity&#8217;.  Broadly speaking flexibility and security are defined along the following lines:   Flexibility refers to</p><p> - relevant transitions made during the working  life-cycle</p><p> - upward mobility and talent development</p><p> - flexible organizations with incentives enabling the adaptation to new production processes</p><p> - ease of combination between working and personal life.</p><p>Security <i>(understood beyond job security)</i>   refers to</p><p> - equipping people with the skills that allow them to make progress throughout their working lives and help them to find new jobs;</p><p> - adequate unemployment benefits to provide income support during periods of unemployment combined with employment supports to ease transitions back into employment </p><p> - training opportunities for all workers, in particular, the low-skilled and older workers.</p><p>  Recently, there has been a greater emphasis on the flexibility component of flexicurity in this time of crisis, with the view that flexibility was in itself the best way to create job opportunities and by extension, security.  In Ireland, we have, with the reforms to our activation system encapsulated in our Pathways to Work policy, defined our own Irish model of flexicurity.  These reforms, when combined with the Action Plan for Jobs, aim to deliver on both flexibility and security.  In particular, the rollout of the Intreo offices, throughout the country, is consistent with the flexicurity approach, linking the security of training and benefits with the flexibility of encouraging more intensive job search and transitioning between employments.  </p><p>  With regard to flexible and reliable contractual arrangements, (another tenet of flexicurity), there is a strong body of employment legislation in Ireland to ensure that workers&#8217; rights are fully protected under a range of various contract types.  Legislation has been introduced in recent years to protect employees who are engaged in more flexible working arrangements such as part time employment and fixed-term contracts.  With regard to the welfare code we provide a range of options including casual working, part time work incentive and family income supplement which facilitate flexible work arrangements.  A balance has been sought between, on the one hand, maintaining workers&#8217; security in terms of their conditions of employment while, on the other, having due regard to the flexibility required by employers in terms of organising work and/or work patterns and seeking to ensure that job creation is not inhibited through overly rigid regulation.  Within the body of legislation employers and employees have reasonable levels of freedom and flexibility to organise their work and their workplaces to take account of their particular needs and circumstances.</p></reply>

These places will be approved on a phased basis from the end of January to the end of the year, in line with the overall CE budget allocation. Schemes have been notified of the availability of these additional places and the application process. </p><p>  The allocation of the 2,000 CE places will be informed by the following criteria:</p><p> - The population of long-term unemployed persons in each regional Division of the Department, the number of claimants on Jobseekers Allowance, lone parents and disability claimants in receipt of a welfare payment for 52 weeks or more.</p><p> - Priority will be given to schemes and organisations who are involved in the delivery of community childcare services, social and healthcare services for people with a disability. This is in order to support the provision of these services and offer training qualifications and work experience to CE participants. An allocation of 500 of the additional places will be reserved for childcare support and 500 of the additional places for social and health-related services.</p><p> - Priority will be given to applicants who are involved in Drug Rehabilitation Services and who consider participation on CE to be a further step in this process. Additional CE places will be made available to respond to new proposals.</p><p> - There is scope to encourage innovation, new approaches and models of delivery from organisations who are experienced in addressing the needs of long-term unemployed. Approximately 100 places will be reserved for such proposals. However, this will be reviewed on the basis of the quality of applications received.</p><p> - The balance of places will be made available to schemes who can demonstrate a clear justification on the basis of quality of service and performance.</p><p> - For all applications, priority will be given to schemes and organisations who can demonstrate a track record in the development and progression of participants into employment.</p><p>  The supply of the additional 2,000 CE places will be based on the demand and capacity of CE sponsoring organisations both existing schemes and new applicants to deliver activities that benefit the jobseeker and add value to the local community in line with the criteria outlined above.  The standard CE eligibility criteria will apply to participants taking up these additional places.  Persons in continuous receipt of a CE-qualifying social welfare payment for at least 52 weeks are eligible to apply for participation on CE.  The duration on CE will be determined by the profile of the CE participant as is currently the case.  The Department is committed to the continuing improvement of CE to ensure value for money, progression of the job seeker and support for communities.</p></reply>

There is no automatic entitlement to a payment.  ENPs are payable at the discretion of the officers administering the scheme taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case in order to ensure that the payments target those most in need of assistance.  The Government has provided &euro;47.6m for the scheme in 2013.</p><p>  A review of the guidelines on exceptional needs payments was carried out by the Department by a working group made up of former community welfare service staff. One of the recommendations emanating from this review is to address the different approaches taken, in different areas, in relation to the payment of exceptional needs payments in respect of religious ceremonies, mainly Communions and Confirmations, and to ensure that the SWA scheme is responding to financial need and not occasions.  For 2013, the Department has recommended that payment of the allowance specifically in respect of religious ceremonies will cease. Applications can continue to be made under the scheme for assistance with child clothing.</p><p>  I have no plans to reverse this position as these measures will ensure that the ENP Scheme will continue to respond to specific need and not to the occasion.  It is expected that savings in the region of &euro;1.5 million will be achieved by this measure.

The Advisory Group&rsquo;s overall method of working is based on producing modular reports on the priority areas identified in the Terms of Reference.  Where possible, the aim is to provide recommendations that can be acted upon in time for the annual budget, estimates and legislative cycle and to allow the Government to best address its commitments under the EU-IMF Programme of Financial Support.  The Group has been considering the issue of social insurance coverage for the self-employed and will submit its report once its examination of the various questions has been completed.  </p><p>  One of the issues examined in the third Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund, as at 31 December 2010, published in 2012, was the long-term cost implications to the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) and the break-even contributions rates required to provide jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit to the self-employed and to provide invalidity pensions for self-employed workers. The report found that the effective annual rate of contribution, or the required contribution as a percentage of salary, needed to provide the core full-rate State pension (contributory), which is the benefit currently available to self-employed contributors, is approximately 15%.  This compares favourably with the 4% rate currently paid by the self-employed.  An incremental increase in contribution rates to 16% would be required if jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit, in addition to core State pension (contributory), is provided.  The average contribution rate required for the core State pension (contributory) plus jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit and the invalidity pension is estimated to be in the region of 17.3%.</p><p>  Any proposals to extend additional cover to the self-employed will have to be considered in a budgetary context, taking account of the finding of the Actuarial Review that the self-employed achieve very good value for money compared with the employed &ndash; when the comparison includes both employer and employee contributions in respect of the employed person.</p></reply>

However, the Department of Social Protection has an important role to play in assisting households in the immediate aftermath of emergency events such as the flooding of October 2011 and June 2012.  Generally, in response to flooding situations, departmental officials provide individuals with emergency payments to offset immediate needs e.g. assistance with the purchase of food, clothing, fuel and household goods.  Local staff are proactive in contacting households affected and in providing targeted supports to those in need as swiftly as possible.  Community Welfare Services operating in the areas affected extend their opening hours providing additional emergency service.  This service is supplemented by facilitating clients with individual appointments and making house calls.  </p><p>  A humanitarian aid scheme was approved by Government in response to flooding situations.  The Department has received sanction, up to a maximum allocation of &euro;10m, to provide for the activation of the scheme in any future cases affected by severe flooding thereby ensuring immediate supports.  The humanitarian aid scheme, which is means tested, is available to people whose homes were damaged in the flooding and who are not in a position to meet costs for essential needs, household items and in some instances structural repair as a result of the flooding damage. </p><p>  From October 2011 to 05 January 2013 some 1,370 payments were made at a cost of some &euro;1.188m.  Statistics are not available on the number of applications made.  The majority of the payments were made to householders resident in Dublin, Monaghan or Cork.  In Dublin, a total of 798 payments have been made at a cost of &euro;497,066.  Since 2009, there was a combined spend of in excess of &euro;21m when the spending of the various Government Departments and Agencies is added together in response to flooding events (DSP will spend in excess of &euro;5 million with a further &euro;16.4 million spent by the local authorities and over &euro;0.5 million by the Department of Agriculture and Food on fodder relief for farmers, making a total spend of over &euro;21 million).</p></reply>

This ensures that the taxpayer receives value for money and ensures that all potential suppliers are given the opportunity to put forward the most efficient, effective and competitive solutions for consideration and evaluation.  The award of public sector contracts with a significant financial value is subject to various EU Directives.  Because of the financial value of this particular service, the Department is required to publicly advertise for the procurement of cash services before entering into a new contract for the delivery of social welfare payments to customers around the country.</p><p>  The current contract with An Post expires on 31st December, 2013.  In anticipation of this, the Department is undertaking two public procurement competitions this year for the delivery of welfare payments.  The first request for tenders was publicly advertised on 20th December 2012.  The Tender is seeking over the counter cash services for social welfare customers who are currently in receipt of payments through the post office network.  The contract term will be for a period of two years, which may be reviewed annually, up to six years in aggregate.  The closing date for receipt of Tenders is 18th February 2012.  All Tenders received in response to this procurement competition will be evaluated on the basis of criteria outlined in the Request for Tender including the quality of their proposed approach for customer service, suitable logistical arrangements to ensure all customers are on time, in full; the quality of their proposed arrangements for the prevention of fraud; and the quality of their proposals for financial and contract management.  The outcome of this public procurement competition will give rise to a contract to ensure continuity in the delivery of cash payments to the Department&rsquo;s almost one million customers, whilst also putting in place arrangements to facilitate the transition from cash payments to electronic payments.</p><p>  Deputies will be reassured to know that any concerns regarding convenient access for customers to payment outlets and the standards of the services they can expect to receive in drawing their welfare payments have been specifically identified in the published Tender.  I anticipate that a contract will be awarded on foot of this procurement in Quarter 2 of 2013.   </p><p>  To supplement existing levels of payments made directly into customer accounts in financial institutions, the Department also advertised their intention to undertake a second procurement later this year.  This will support the progression over time from cash payments to increasing levels of electronic payments to customers.  The Department envisages a situation where all payments to our customers will be paid electronically.  This is in line with the Government policies and objectives such as better public services and to improve the efficiency of the national payments environment.  These objectives are aligned to the objectives of the National Payments Plan.  The second procurement to be undertaken for the provision of an ePayment solution, which will complement the existing Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) payments into financial institutions will be published before the end of June 2013.</p></reply>

Revised rent limits are in place since January 2012 and are applicable to all new rent supplement tenancies from this date and existing tenancies on review.  These limits were set after an analysis of the most up to date market data available.  The emphasis of the rent limit review was to ensure that maximum value for money was obtained whilst at the same time ensuring that people on rent supplement are not priced out of the market for good quality private rented accommodation.  The central aim was to ensure availability; the limits do not provide rent supplement tenants with access to all housing in all areas. </p><p>  Special provisions can be made in exceptional circumstances to exceed the rent limits including, for example, people with disabilities who require specially adapted accommodation or homeless persons.  Approximately 48,700 rent supplement claims were awarded during 2012, showing that accommodation can be secured within the new limits.  Information on the numbers who have secured alternative accommodation is not available.  Department officials dealing with rent supplement will continue to ensure that accommodation needs for recipients can be met.</p><p>  As part of the rent limit review, all major urban population centres were tested to ensure that rent supplement applicants can access temporary housing arrangements whilst seeking employment opportunities.  Ongoing analysis shows that for Dublin there are properties available within the maximum rent limits for rent supplement recipients.  Over 32,500 persons in receipt of rent supplement reside in Dublin. </p><p>  Traditionally, the Bray area was permitted the use of the County Dublin rent limits.  It was noted during analysis for the June 2010 Rent Limit Review that Dublin limits for the Bray area had become a significant distorting influence for the local market.  It was concluded that rents were out of line with the natural supply and demand points expected for the Bray area. Accordingly it was decided that the Bray area was to be excluded with separate limits set for this area.  Officials in the Department continue to examine the impact of the rent limits on those who claim rent supplement.  The next review of rent limits will take place before June 2013 and any changes to the existing limits will be considered as part of this review.</p></reply>

The introduction of a single payment could potentially be a key development in the pursuit of a more focused and purposeful activation agenda, which could be delivered through my Department&rsquo;s Intreo service.  The single payment would provide recipients with access to the supports or services they need to enable them take up employment or avail of education and training opportunities and thereby result in better overall outcomes.</p><p>  The single payment would also be an opportunity to address the current complexity of Ireland&rsquo;s social welfare system by streamlining a number of different payments for people of working age, thereby making it more transparent and accessible.  The development of supports and services is a necessary precondition for the introduction of a single payment and work is on-going on the development of these services.  Given the specific nature and purpose of carer&rsquo;s allowance, the Government has decided to exclude carer&rsquo;s allowance from any single payment proposals.  However, no other decisions have been made in relation to the introduction of a single payment.</p></reply>

My Department is not aware of any of the employees concerned having been made redundant to date.  In the event that any of the employees concerned are eventually made redundant they may be eligible for a statutory redundancy payment under the Redundancy Payments Acts 1967 to 2012.  In order to be eligible for a redundancy lump sum payment, an employee must:</p><p> - have at least two years continuous service;</p><p> - be in employment which is insurable under the Social Welfare Acts;</p><p> - be over the age of 16; and</p><p> - have been made redundant as a result of a genuine redundancy situation  meaning that the job no longer exists and he/she is not replaced.</p><p>  Under the scheme, an eligible employee is entitled to two weeks&rsquo; pay for every year of service, plus a bonus week, subject to a gross weekly salary ceiling of &euro;600.</p><p>  It is the employer&rsquo;s responsibility to pay statutory redundancy payments in the first instance.   Where an employer can prove to the satisfaction of the Department that it is unable to pay statutory redundancy to its eligible employees the Department will make lump sum payments directly to those employees.  Such payments raise a debt against the employer which the Department will seek to recover.</p><p>  The purpose of the insolvency payments scheme is to protect certain outstanding pay-related entitlements due to employees because of their employer being insolvent as defined by the rules of the scheme (for example, liquidation or receivership).  These entitlements include wages, holiday pay, sick pay, payment in lieu of minimum notice due under the Minimum Notice &amp; Terms of Employment Acts, 1973-2001, and certain pension contributions.  Various other statutory awards made by the Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT), Rights Commissioners, etc., are also covered by the scheme.  </p><p>  Some or all of the employees concerned may have entitlements under the insolvency payments scheme.  As yet the Department has received no applications under the scheme.  In the event of the business winding-up the Minister for Social Protection would be a preferential creditor in respect of any statutory redundancy lump sum payments made by the Department or payments under the insolvency payments scheme.</p></reply>

The interim results of the independent evaluation of JobBridge conducted by Indecon International Economic Consultants (published on www.welfare.ie   on 5 October, 2012) shows that 61% of JobBridge finishers progressed into employment with either their host organisation or another employer within 5 months of finishing their internship. These progression rates compare very favourably with European averages in this area.  </p><p>  One of the most positive features of JobBridge is that it has attracted interns across a wide range of levels of qualification.  Approximately 64% of interns are graduates, of whom 22 % hold a postgraduate qualification.  Of the 36% of interns who are not graduates, almost 21% of those hold a post-Leaving Certificate qualification.  The Deputy will appreciate that interns are a highly qualified addition to the workforce of host organisations and that the State has already made a significant investment in their training and education.  The Deputy should not underestimate the immense contribution made by interns to their host organisations.  As an internship scheme, JobBridge provides positive outcomes for the intern but also for the host organisation. </p><p>  The following are some of the benefits accruing to host organisations from the addition of interns to their workforce: the opportunity to assess potential employees; the benefit of the intern&rsquo;s labour, talents, skills and enthusiasm while working with the host organisation; enhancement of the performance of the host organisation by offering an internship to motivated individuals with enthusiasm and a passion for developing their careers; bringing in fresh talent, fresh ideas and new thinking; and access newly trained interns with recent skills sets or skilled workers that add real value to the host organisation.  As part of the terms and conditions of JobBridge, host organisations are obliged by the Department to provide interns with quality work experience, substantial opportunities to enhance the intern&rsquo;s skills and to appoint an individual member of staff as mentor to the intern for the duration of their internship.  </p><p>  Recent research indicates that over 90% of host organisations were satisfied with their internship experience and that 96% of host organisations would recommend JobBridge to other employers.  A high proportion of interns also consider that the scheme improves their chances of gaining employment.  In recent research, 89.3% of interns felt JobBridge had given them new skills.  In light of the successes highlighted by the above, I do not feel that there is a compelling argument for the Department to provide a training budget for JobBridge host organisations.  An independent evaluation of the Scheme is currently being finalised by Indecon International Economic Consultants.  It is anticipated that a final report will be published in the coming weeks.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-01-29a.117.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013012900055#WRC01100"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 162 and 166 together.</p><p>  I am acutely aware that any reduction in social welfare payments or benefits are difficult for those affected.  The overall concern of the Government in Budget 2013 was to protect the primary weekly social welfare rates.  To allow us to protect the core payments which people receive such as pensions, disability and carer&rsquo;s allowance, we  had to look very carefully at other additional payments such as the household benefits package.</p><p>  The household benefits package comprises the electricity/gas allowance, the telephone allowance and the free television licence.  The package is primarily available to older people, people with disabilities and carers.  Following Budget 2013, the structure of the electricity/gas allowance has changed and is now aligned with the best average market rate currently available from energy suppliers for an unchanged 150 units per month.  For those customers who receive a bill, this amount will appear as a cash credit of &euro;35 on their bill. Other customers will continue to receive a cash allowance as before. </p><p>  Between 2005 and 2011 the number in receipt of the electricity/gas allowance rose by 20% and there are now 405,000 recipients in receipt of an allowance.  The cost of the electricity and gas allowances has risen from &euro;110 million in 2005 to an estimated outturn of &euro;201 million in 2012, an increase of 83% over seven years.  In the current economic climate these increases are unsustainable.  This change to the electricity and gas elements of the household benefits package will bring significant savings, with estimated expenditure in 2013 of &euro;176 million, while aiming to encourage customers to achieve better savings through greater mobility.  </p><p>  The Affordable Energy Strategy drew attention to the fact that customers in receipt of household benefits were much less likely than other customers to switch energy supplier to obtain better value. Only 16% of social welfare customers have switched companies compared to 42% nationally.  The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), following discussions with officials from the Department, has been liaising with the National Consumer Agency with a view to ensuring that information is available for our customers to help with switching companies.  In August 2011 the CER published a paper which set out a framework for accreditation for price comparison websites (CER/11/144) following which a website www.bonkers.ie was accredited.  This website presents comparison data which can greatly assist those wishing to switch companies and achieve the best value.</p><p>  The number in receipt of the telephone allowance has also increased significantly in recent years, in line with increases in customers receiving qualifying payments, as well as the increases in those over 70.  Our demographics are such that this number will continue rising.  In 2005 there were 311,000 customers in receipt of telephone allowance; in 2012 there are 397,000, an increase of 28% over seven years.  The allocation for the telephone allowance scheme has been reduced by &euro;61 million in 2013.  As a result the monthly allowance has been reduced from &euro;22.60 to &euro;9.50. This is a cost saving measure.  In recent years, the nature of the telephone market has been transformed with deregulation, mobile services and bundled services including television, broadband and telephone.  There is a wide variety of deals available, for example, it is possible to get a standard pay-as-you-go brand name mobile telephone for as little as &euro;19.99 in large retailers.</p><p>  I am keenly aware of the impacts on the Department&rsquo;s customers. In this regard, it should be noted that Ireland&rsquo;s older population has the lowest rate of  consistent poverty  and, as a group compared to the rest of the population, are least likely to be at risk of poverty - pointing to the adequacy and importance of the State pension.  Between 2004 and 2010, consistent poverty for older people (those over 65) fell from 3.3% to 0.9%.  The at risk of poverty rate for people in that age group fell from 27.1% to 9.6% over the same period. In addition the fuel allowance scheme was protected in Budget 2013 and recipients will continue to receive this payment of &euro;20 per week as part of their weekly social welfare payment for the duration of the fuel season, which runs until April 2013.</p><p>  If a customer of the Department is experiencing difficulty, an exceptional needs payments may be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost which an applicant is unable to meet out of his or her own resources. There is no automatic entitlement to this payment.  Each application is determined by a community welfare officer based on the particular circumstances of the case.</p></reply>

The decision to increase State pension age was taken in the context of changing demographics and the fact that people are living longer and healthier lives.  The standardisation of State Pension age at age 66 is one of the measures planned which aims to improve the sustainability of the Irish pension system. As provided for in legislation, State pension age will further increase to age 67 in 2021 and to 68 in 2028.    State pension (transition) requires the person to retire from the workforce.  Standardising State pension at age 66 means that people can choose to work longer if they wish to increase their income in retirement. </p><p>  This pension was introduced in 1970 when it was known as the retirement pension. It was designed to bridge the gap between the standard social welfare pension age, which at that time was 70 years of age, and retirement age.  Overtime, the age for State pension contributory was reduced to 66 years.  In 2012, 22,430 claims were received for State Pension Transition with 12,559 SPT claims awarded in 2012<font color="#0000FF">. </font>  In 2012  a total of 2,485  customers transferred from illness benefit to State pension transition,  1,044 from job seekers benefit, 922 from jobseekers allowance, 439 from widows/widowers/surviving civil partners scheme, 200 from disability allowance and105 from invalidity pension. As these numbers indicate, a significant number of customers are already on another social welfare payment before State pension transition with numbers showing that around 12% are transferring directly from work. </p><p>  I consider it important that those who need to or wish to continue in employment after State pension age should, as far as is possible, be facilitated and supported.  Longer working can play an important role in ensuring that our pensions system is sustainable in the future and it can also be beneficial to the individual.  Recognising that State pensions are very valuable benefits, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over a working life thereby ensuring equity in the social welfare system.  Claimants with an income need may qualify, depending on their means, for another social welfare payment.</p></reply>

If a person does not qualify for JB they may qualify for means tested jobseeker's allowance.  In 2012 my Department spent over &euro;738 million on the scheme and at the end of 2012 there were some 85,000 persons in receipt of payment under the scheme.   Budget 2013 provided that the duration for which JB is paid will be reduced from 12 months to 9 months for recipients with 260 or more contributions paid and from 9 months to 6 months for recipients with less than 260 contributions paid. </p><p>  It is planned to introduce the measure from 3 April, 2013.  Existing claimants of over 6 months who are entitled to a full year of benefit will not be affected by this measure when it comes into effect &ndash; they will still get a full year of benefit.

Significant resources and efforts have been put into reducing backlogs and improving processing times for appellants, including the assignment of 15 additional Appeals Officers; improved business processes; a new operating model in the SWAO; increased capacity of the Medical Review and Assessment Service through the recruitment of 8 additional Medical Assessors in 2013.</p><p>  All of these measures taken together have reduced the waiting times for appellants by 10.2 weeks in 2012 and will further reduce waiting times in 2013.  The Chief Appeals Officer expects to finalise 6,000 more cases in 2013 than in 2012 (there were 33,129 appeals finalised in 2012). This will be achieved through the additional capacity generated as the newer Appeals Officers become experienced.  The matter of assigning additional Appeals Officers is kept under constant review but any consideration of extra assignments must be taken in the context of overall government policy on civil service numbers.</p></reply>

It also aims to increase engagement and incentivise employers to provide more jobs for people who are unemployed.  INTREO is the new integrated employment activation and supports service model delivering on the &lsquo;Pathways to Work&rsquo; policy.  The first ten Intreo offices have now opened and service performance has improved in all of these offices with claim processing times and waiting times for new claimants for group interviews and follow up one-to-one interviews reduced. For example most clients in Intreo offices are called to a group engagement within one week and have their claim assessed and determined within three working days.  Previously the lead time for group engagement was three months while claim assessment took up to three weeks.</p><p>  The most significant elements of the Pathways to Work approach are: profiling of clients to inform the approach taken to activation, and in particular to target those who are most likely to become long-term unemployed and to provide appropriate interventions at the earliest possible stage; early engagement with clients through group engagement sessions; one to one interviews with case managers; the agreement of a personal progression plan between the client and the Department setting how the steps to be taken by the client, with the support of the Department, in order to re-enter employment; the signing of a social contract &ndash; known as a Record of Mutual Commitments &ndash; between the Department and the client.  This sets out the client&rsquo;s rights with regard to the type and quality of services to be provided by the Department but also sets out the client&rsquo;s responsibility to engage with these services and actively seek employment.</p><p>  Progress under each of these headings is the profiling of all new claimants is now operational in all DSP offices.  Under the Pathways to Work programme, the Department had profiled 53,800 new claimants to the end of 2012; 68,600 clients had participated in group engagements by the end of December 2012; 158,000 one-to-one initial interviews were conducted by the end of December.  In addition a further 134,000 follow-up meetings held by the end of 2012; all new clients in Intreo offices now sign the social contract.</p><p>  Enhanced engagement with employers at local level is also part of the Intreo process and this is progressing well.  As the process is still in the very early stages of rollout and as it is operating in parallel with the National Employment Action Plan process, which it is replacing, it is difficult to separate out and assess its performance in terms of progression rates into employment.  In any event it will take some time for the impact of the new process to be felt in terms of employment progression rates.</p></reply>

The cost of the OFP scheme in 2012 was &euro;1.06 billion.  The reforms introduced in recent Budgets of the OFP scheme build on my Department&rsquo;s report Proposals for Supporting Lone Parents. While there are no current plans to introduce the Parental Allowance the reform of the scheme is ongoing.  Two significant changes are in the process of being introduced. The maximum age limit of the youngest child for receipt of the OFP is being reduced to 7 years by 2015 and the earnings disregard is being reduced on a phased basis to &euro;60 per week in 2016.  The Department is also examining a proposal to create a single social welfare payment that would cover all people of working age, including those who would currently be classified as unemployed, with a disability, or parenting alone. </p><p>  The single payment would be an opportunity to streamline a number of different payments for people of working age. A prerequisite to the introduction of the single payment is the enhancement of the range of supports and services that recipients of the single payment would require in order to progress into employment. However, no decisions have been made on whether to proceed with the single payment.  In addition to the reforms of OFP, I established an Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare in 2011, which has been tasked with recommending cost-effective options as to how employment disincentives can be improved and better poverty outcomes achieved. The Advisory Group prioritised the area of family and child income supports and has completed its work on this area. Their report is currently receiving my consideration and will be published in the near future.</p></reply>

This includes ensuring that applications are processed and that decisions on entitlement are made as quickly as possible. FIS claims, both new and renewals received on or after the 5th November 2012 are currently being processed on receipt.  On 2 November 2012 there was a backlog of approximately 7,390  new FIS applications and approximately 7,810  renewal applications awaiting processing and decision.  Today, there are currently approximately 6,760 new FIS applications still awaiting approval.  All the renewal applications have been processed. The backlog of new claims will be fully eliminated by the end of March 2013.</p><p>  An in-depth Business Process Improvement project was recently completed for the FIS scheme.  This project focused on optimising output, improving customer service and the elimination of backlogs.  The outcome of this review is a detailed plan outlining the process required to manage both the continuous weekly intake and backlog claims clearance. This plan sees the current weekly new claim and renewal intake processed by one team, while the backlog is ring-fenced and a focused team assigned to this work with a clear plan for its elimination.  The team including additional temporary resources for the elimination of backlog FIS claims has been in place since November 2012. Claims which are approved by the backlog team will be backdated to the date of claim and all arrears due will be paid.</p></reply>

For easy pay purposes, a person in receipt of certain scheme payments from the Department of Social Protection can choose to select the deduction at source facility in relation to their payment of local property tax.  The Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 provides that any deductions at source from social protection  scheme payments in relation to the local property tax will not breach the statutory minimum income guarantee embedded in the social welfare code, i.e. Supplementary Welfare Allowance (which is currently set at &euro;186 per week). </p><p>  The Department expects that this facility will be utilised in a reduced number of cases as the person must be a property owner and liable for the tax.  Most liable Social Protection customers will be able to avail of deferral arrangements as their income would not exceed the deferral thresholds of &euro;15,000, or &euro;25,000 in the case of a couple.  Other Social Protection customers in accommodation provided by local authorities and social housing organisations will not be liable for the property tax.  For those liable persons with other income sources the Department expects that these income sources would be prioritized in the first instance by both the customer and the Revenue Commissioners.  This will limit the number of Social Protection customers who are liable for the local property tax and where a deduction at source will apply.</p></reply>

I am pleased to advise the Deputy that the issue of placements and progression has been comprehensively addressed in the recent interim independent evaluation report compiled by Indecon Economic Consultants (published on 5<sup>th</sup> October 2012 and available on ).  The Report found that 21% of all placements to date have been in public sector organisations including 188 placements in Government Departments.  It is not feasible to list the duties of all such placements as you may appreciate within this response.  However, by way of example internships included working as part of a team with IT applications, general office administration, coordination of event organisation, planning and logistics, communication skills, research and policy development processes not to mention Digital Media development. </p><p>  The breadth of experience to be gained from these diverse opportunities is of invaluable benefit to participating interns.  This is further supported by the recent Indecon interim report on the scheme which found that 89% of interns stated that JobBridge allowed them to develop new skills.  These internships are clearly providing skills enhancement to participating interns.  This is further reflected in the Indecon analysis which found that 49% of all those who completed placements in the public sector (24% in the case of Government Departments) are currently in paid employment.</p><p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, given the current moratorium, Government Departments cannot offer full-time employment at the end of an internship period, in a way that Host Organisations in other sectors can.  This does not mean that Government Departments should be excluded from assisting the jobs strategy.  They are still providing significant and in some cases challenging job experience opportunities to persons in need of such opportunities and better prepare them for either ere-entry to the jobs market or a change in job direction.  I am delighted to advise that other reported benefits included that the scheme helps boost participant&#8217;s self-confidence, assists in identifying job opportunities suitable to their abilities, keeps them close to the job market, and helps participants to establish contacts/networks.  The Programme has had positive effects on subsequent employment chances for participants who in the absence of the Programme would not have secured employment.  The findings of the Indecon study recently completed suggest that the Programme has been an effective labour market intervention in achieving movement off the Live Register.</p></reply>

The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.  The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer.  Rent supplement is calculated to ensure that the person, after payment of rent, has an income equal to the basic supplementary welfare allowance rate, less a specified weekly minimum contribution which recipients are required to pay from their own resources.</p><p>  The &ldquo;top up&rdquo; payments referred to fall into two specific categories.  Where a person has an additional income above the rate of supplementary welfare allowance they are, in certain circumstances, allowed to top up their rent as they will still have sufficient income to meet their basic needs after paying their rent.  The second type of top up payment can occur where the application to the Department declares a rent lower than that actually being charged by the landlord.  There has been no evidence presented to the Department showing widespread or systemic &lsquo;false declarations&rsquo; of rent supplement through the use of illegal top-ups. </p><p>  Any instance of false declarations should be reported to the relevant Department representatives who have specific legislative powers to deal with such offences.  The Department, in June 2012, introduced powers of enquiry (Section 14 of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2012 refers) for staff to formally request and oblige landlords to provide information in respect of rent supplement tenants, principally to verify the agreed rent and existence of the tenancy.  This measure improves both the governance and oversight arrangements in place.</p></reply>

The Quarterly National Household Survey (QNHS) is used to provide the official estimates of employment while administrative data sources (P35L returns to Revenue Commissioners) are combined with the CSO business register to provide estimates of job creation and job destruction. The two sets of estimates are not directly comparable as QNHS provides estimates below for those employed at a point in time (i.e., Quarter 3) while estimates from administrative sources count each employment record in a given year as a job regardless of duration or nature of employment, (i.e. an employment record is counted as a one job whether the person worked  for one week or for one year or whether they worked on a part-time basis, say one hour a week or a full-time basis).</p><p>The QNHS is the official source of employment statistics in the State.  The most recent figures available for employment levels are for the third quarter of 2012. The following table 1 includes the estimated level of employment in the third quarter of each year from 2005 to 2012. These estimates show that employment initially grew peaking at 2,169,600 in the third quarter of 2007. From 2007 on the level of employment fell, with the greatest reductions recorded in 2009 and 2010.

Job destruction figures peaked at 512,000 when 2009 was compared with 2008 before dropping back sharply in 2010.  Job destruction figures for Manufacturing and Services show similar patterns with big peaks in the figures when 2009 is compared with 2008.  While job creation for services showed a similar pattern to the business economy as a whole with a small recovery, job creation figures for manufacturing showed a small decline.</p><p><b>Table 2 Job creation and job destruction figures for the business economy, manufacturing and the services sectors 2006 -2010</b></p><p><table><tr><th> -</th><th>2006</th><th>2007</th><th>2008</th><th>2009</th><th>2010</th></tr><tr><td>Business economy excluding activities of holding companies (NACE Rev. 2 Sectors B to N, excluding code 642)</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Job creation (Number)</td><td>353,614</td><td>375,167</td><td>217,819</td><td>168,725</td><td>184,176</td></tr><tr><td>Job destruction (Number)</td><td>198,209</td><td>228,356</td><td>349,745</td><td>511,855</td><td>290,785</td></tr><tr><td>Manufacturing(NACE Rev. 2 Sector C)</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Job creation (Number)</td><td>31,375</td><td>31,976</td><td>18,136</td><td>17,020</td><td>16,977</td></tr><tr><td>Job destruction (Number)</td><td>20,496</td><td>25,951</td><td>34,688</td><td>54,998</td><td>29,992</td></tr><tr><td>Business economy services excluding activities of holding companies(NACE Rev. 2 Sectors G to N, excluding code 642)</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Job creation (Number)</td><td>248,919</td><td>280,460</td><td>167,094</td><td>135,706</td><td>149,023</td></tr><tr><td>Job destruction (Number)</td><td>139,528</td><td>148,406</td><td>227,482</td><td>358,296</td><td>206,309</td></tr></table></p><p>Source: Job Churn statistics, Central Statistics Office</p><p>Detailed breakdowns are available at: <i>http://cso.ie/shorturl.aspx/102</i></p><p>Methodological notes are available at:<i>http://cso.ie/shorturl.aspx/101</i></p></reply>

Ireland&rsquo;s diplomatic relations with Burma/Myanmar are maintained by secondary accreditation via our Embassy in Vietnam, and through the Embassy of Burma/Myanmar in London. The Irish Ambassador presented his credentials yesterday and became the first Ambassador of Ireland accredited to Burma/Myanmar.  Following accreditation, the Ambassador met with both the President and Foreign Minister of Burma/Myanmar and discussed a range of issues, including the northern Kachin State.  </p><p>  In December 2012, violence in Kachin State escalated, exacerbating the humanitarian situation there.   The latest reports from the European Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO) and the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) state that at least 2000 people have been displaced since December in addition to the 75,000 people displaced since the conflict started in September 2011.</p><p>  Ireland remains engaged at both European Union and international levels in monitoring the situation in Burma/Myanmar, including events in Kachin State.  Human rights have been a priority of successive Irish governments and are a key dimension of our foreign policy.  Ireland, as an elected member of the Human Rights Council, will work closely with partners at the Council to ensure the continuation of international scrutiny of the human rights situation in Kachin and in Burma/Myanmar as a whole.  At the 67th session of the United Nations General Assembly Ireland along with our international partners expressed deep concern about the continuing armed conflict in Kachin; called upon the government and all parties to the armed conflict to take measures to protect the civilian population; and called for safe, timely, full and unhindered humanitarian access.</p><p>  Burma/Myanmar is in the process of undergoing an important and long-awaited transformation as the country re-engages with the International community. Ireland stands ready to share its experiences and to assist the process of democratisation in Burma/Myanmar. We want recent, positive, developments to bring lasting change for the people of Burma/Myanmar, including the people of Kachin State.</p></reply>

It also provides that representation of citizens shall be degressively proportional, with a minimum threshold of six members per Member State, and that no Member State shall be allocated more than ninety-six seats.   There is a need therefore to adjust the distribution of seats in the Parliament before the 2014 elections to take account of the accession of Croatia in 2013. </p><p>  Under Article 14.2, the composition of the European Parliament is decided by the European Council by unanimity on the initiative of the Parliament and with its consent. Therefore the right of initiative in relation to this issue is for the European Parliament. The Committee on Constitutional Affairs of the European Parliament (AFCO) had its first consideration of a draft report on 22 January 2013. AFCO will further consider the draft report over the coming weeks and a vote in the European Parliament is planned for the March plenary session. Only when Parliament has agreed on its proposal will the matter come to the European Council.  The Parliament must also give its consent to the decision reached by the European Council.</p></reply>

The tangible outcome from the conference was a commitment by 168 UN Member States, including Ireland, to strengthen preparedness and minimise vulnerability to disasters through the agreement of a ten-year action plan called the Hyogo Framework for Action 2005-2015. Ireland, through the participation of officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade contributed to the negotiations and outcome of the Conference. </p><p>  The Mid-Term Review of the Hyogo Framework for Action was facilitated by the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR) secretariat over a twelve-month period from 2010 &ndash; 2011. The Review process sought inputs from relevant stakeholders, including Ireland. It was guided by the 2009 Global Platform, which concluded that it should &quot;address strategic and fundamental matters concerning its implementation to 2015 and beyond&quot;. Through involvement in the 2009 Global Platform meetings and membership of the UNISDR donor support group over the 2009 &ndash; 2011 period, Ireland contributed to the mid-term review process of the Hyogo Framework. </p><p>  On the international front, the Rio+20 Summit in June 2012 was the first major event to demonstrate why disasters and reducing their risks are so fundamental to sustainable development. The outcome document `The Future We Want` specifically refers to the value of a post-2015 framework as part of the sustainable development agenda. UNISDR facilitated a number of consultation conferences in 2012 and established a series of on-line dialogues which will continue intermittently throughout the consultation period.  One clear message emerging from the first phase of consultations is the need for much stronger political commitment to tackle disaster risks, including more extreme events stemming from climate change.   2013 will be a critical year for the consultation process and in particular the Fourth Session of the Global Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction scheduled for 19-23 May 2013 in Geneva will be a pivotal event. Ireland will participate at this event. </p><p>  The Government recognises that poor people and countries are especially threatened by natural disasters and environmental hazards, including climate change. Ireland is therefore very supportive of global responses to disaster management and promotes the need to put in place a post-2015 framework for a more systematic approach to Disaster Risk Reduction in disaster-prone developing countries.  At a bilateral level the Government through Irish Aid provides financial support to programmes having disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation objectives in Ethiopia, Lesotho, Vietnam, Mozambique, Malawi, South Africa, Tanzania, Timor-Leste, Uganda and Zambia. At a multilateral level Irish Aid supports the work of a number of leading global environment and development agencies including the UNISDR and the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR). In addition, funding is provided to the Red Cross Movement and NGO partners recognising the important role these partners play in reducing risk and building local capacity to respond to disasters. Ireland has prioritised Climate Change Adaptation and Disaster Risk Reduction in our EU Presidency.</p></reply>

The additional resources required for 2013 are noted in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform Expenditure Report 2013.  The Employment Control Framework of 5,874 includes 100 additional posts approved by my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in the context of the introduction of Local Property Tax.  As noted in my reply to Question No 2063/13, the Revenue Commissioners advise me that they have established the nucleus of the Local Property Tax Branch in Ennis, where staff will become available for redeployment in the context of the Government's policy on shared services, specifically in the areas of payroll, banking and financial management.  The Commissioners are also deploying additional staff to this Branch by reconfiguring their District structure in the South West and relocating functions from Clare to Limerick.  I am satisfied that when Revenue receives the additional 100 staff which were sanctioned in 2013, they will be in a position to deploy their resources to ensure the successful implementation of Local Property Tax.</p><p>  In addition, Revenue is contracting for external service delivery of some data capture and call centre services for Local Property Tax.  Regarding recruitment as previously advised to the House in my reply to Question 3206/13, in recognition of the need to adequately resource Revenue and to address critical skills gaps, my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform recently granted Revenue sanction to fill critical vacancies up to the Employment Control Framework of 5,874.  The Revenue Commissioners are required, in the first instance, to refer to the public service resource panel to fill vacancies.  Where there are no redeployment staff available, or there are specific skills deficits, Revenue ha<i>s</i>   sanction to fill posts by recruitment or promotion.</p></reply>

The Revenue Commissioners have around 2,000 staff engaged on activities that are dedicated to target and confront non-compliance.  These activities include anti-smuggling, audit, assurance checks, debt management, investigations, prosecutions and anti-avoidance.  The Commissioners advise me that non-staff enforcement equipment expenditure on the purchase and supply of vehicles, maritime cutters, detector dogs, radio equipment, scanners etc for the years in question are shown in the table immediately below.</p><p>ANTI-SMUGGLING NON PAY COSTS 2005-2012</p><p><table><tr><th>YEAR</th><th>TOTAL</th></tr><tr><td>2005</td><td>2866,692</td></tr><tr><td>2006</td><td>2,689,461</td></tr><tr><td>2007</td><td>1,543,728</td></tr><tr><td>2008</td><td>4,173,134</td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>3,345,175</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>2,424,880</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>2,688,059</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>3,421,777</td></tr></table></p><p>With regard to the costs of staff employed on targeting non-compliance, I am advised that Revenue operates a number of programmes based on strategic priorities as set down in its Statement of Strategies that are applicable over given periods of time.

Special housing needs refers to the provision of housing and support for people who have a particular need in addition to a general housing need to enable them to live in the community.  This includes the elderly, people with disabilities, people who have been homeless and victims of domestic violence.  Where local authority owned properties are not exempted from LPT, it will be a matter for the local authorities themselves whether they will pass on the LPT liability to their tenants in the form of an increase in rent or whether they will absorb the liability without recourse to their tenants.  A voluntary housing association will be similarly liable for LPT on any residential properties that it owns unless the properties are used to accommodate people with special housing needs, provided the housing association operates as a charity and has been granted a tax exemption by the Revenue Commissioners.</p><p>  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they are currently liaising with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and with the voluntary social housing sector to establish how local authorities and voluntary housing associations, respectively, will provide the Revenue Commissioners with information in relation to their LPT liability and the timing and manner of the payment of this liability.</p></reply>

The transaction was a very positive outcome for the State on a number of levels.  It will enable us to reduce our indebtedness, it has had a positive impact on investor sentiment and it has also helped to underpin the value of our remaining banks investments.  The transaction also reflects positively on Bank of Ireland, as will any further such disposals by the State in the future.  Exit by the State over time from its bank investments is Government policy and the eventual separation of the State from the banking sector is an objective for which there is strong support across the political spectrum.</p><p>  As I have stated before, the sale was managed by officials in the Department&#8217;s Shareholder Management Unit, with many years' experience working in financial markets.  Having established at the outset that there was sufficient demand to secure an underwriting position from the investment banks, the date the CCNs were offered to the market was January 9th, 2013 the day the book build process began.  In response to your question on the optimum period of marketing for the CCNs, it is important to recognise that Bank of Ireland had been active in the market in both November and December raising &#8364;1.0bn through the issuance of an Asset Covered Securities (ACS) bond and &#8364;250m of subordinated debt.  This meant that investors were fully up to speed with the bank&#8217;s investment proposition by the time the State looked to execute its own transaction.</p><p>  On the issue of the involvement of the former head of the Shareholder Management Unit, the officer went on holidays to Australia on 12 December, 2012 and did not return to the Department until January 14th, 2013 at which time he tendered his resignation and in accordance with normal practice will not take up duty in the banks for another two months.  Hence there is effectively a <i>cordon sanitaire</i>   in operation for three months in this instance.  Finally I have been informed by the Bank that they are not in a position to provide the costs incurred in the recent disposal of the CCNs as it is commercially sensitive.</p></reply>

I have a limited role in this function.  The sales prices for various portfolios and individual loans are a matter of confidentiality between the parties.  It is normal course of practice that sales processes are conducted under appropriate confidentiality constraints in order to protect the interests of all parties. </p><p>  It is the responsibility of the Board of Directors of each institution to ensure that adequate and appropriate disclosures are provided regarding financial position and performance.  Therefore, such disclosures are provided through the financial statements of each institution in the context of the needs of those users and the particular business activities and risk exposures of the Institutions.  To this end, the institutions provide detailed disclosures in their Annual Reports, trading statements, interim management reports, press releases and Pillar III regulatory return disclosures.  The Institutions have also, where applicable as part of their investor relations programmes and Stock exchange requirements, produced detailed loan sale disclosures to which the deputy may wish to refer. </p><p>  In particular, as relates to NAMA, the disclosure of additional information other than what is publically available would contravene Section 99 and 202 of the NAMA Act and adversely affect the competitive process and the agency's objective of achieving the best outcome for the taxpayer.</p><p>  Deleveraging of the Banking system has progressed well.  Deleveraging of &euro;53.1bn has been achieved by Allied Irish Banks (AIB), Bank of Ireland (BOI) and Permanent TSB from 31 December 2010 to 30 November 2012.  Individual losses on loans have not been disclosed by the banks due to commercial sensitivities and confidentiality of information, however the Pillar Banks where disposals have been concentrated, have disclosed that overall cumulative discounts incurred have been within PCAR assumed discounts.  From a capital perspective, the loss incurred on the divestment of these assets is broadly offset by a reduction in the level of risk weighted assets. </p><p>  The on-going progress in deleveraging and deposit gathering activities has seen BOI make further progress towards improving its Loan to Deposit (LDR) ratio, reducing from 136% at June 2012 to less than 130% in November 2012.  Similarly, AIB's LDR reduced to less than 120% at the end of October (including loans held for sale) from 125% at end of June.</p></reply>

I have been informed that the vast majority of asset and loan disposals are transacted with independent third parties.  Any sale that does involve a bid from a connected party to the original borrower or to party with an existing equity interest is subject to elevated and multi-faceted governance approval processes.  In all cases, the clear objective is to achieve the highest possible recovery. </p></reply>

This consisted of almost 2.3 million certificates.  These certificates are issued as a priority to employers to ensure that they have the correct tax credit details upon which to base tax deductions from the first pay dates in the new year.   I am further informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, according to their records, all employer copies of tax credit certificates for 2013 have issued and they are not aware of, nor have they been informed of, any problems encountered by employers in obtaining details of the correct tax credits for their employees for this year.  The Deputy should be aware that the vast bulk of employee certificates are issued to employers electronically via ROS, which is Revenue's Online Service.</p><p>  Where an employer has not received new tax credit certificates for 2013 for their employees, the PAYE &amp; USC Regulations provide that they should base the PAYE and USC deductions on the specific tax credits and the tax and USC rate bands that operated for each employee during the previous year, in this case for 2012, and that they should continue to do so until they obtain the 2013 tax certificates.  If the Deputy has the case of a specific employer in mind, the Revenue Commissioners advise me that if details are supplied they will have the matter looked into immediately.</p></reply>

However, I have received a number of submissions from, and on behalf of, private coach operators seeking to have this relief extended to them. I will consider these proposals and the level of the rebate in the context of the Finance Bill. It is worth noting that one of key arguments for introducing a rebate for the haulage industry is the fact that a large quantity of fuel purchased by this industry is purchased abroad thus generating no tax revenue for the State.  A rebate should encourage hauliers to start purchasing their fuel in Ireland thus offsetting some of the costs involved. Such an argument does not exist for the most part for the coach industry. </p><p>  The fuel rebate scheme proposed is governed by the terms of Council Directive 2003/96/EC of 27 October 2003 which limits its application to auto diesel used in defined categories of road vehicles.  On the matter of the derogation that has ended, it is assumed that the Deputy is referring to the derogation that allowed for the application of a reduced rate of mineral oil tax to fuel used for the purposes of certain road passenger services.  I can confirm that the rebate applied to services operated by both private and public operators and was abolished in 2008.  I will be informing the European Commission of the rebate measure once it is introduced.</p></reply>

It is at these review missions that discussions take place with regard to programme commitments which translate into the Programme documents which are updated and agreed after every mission.   The review missions, the 9th of which begins today, involve a large number of technical meetings which are attended by officials from my Department, the Department of Public Expenditure &amp; Reform and when appropriate from other Departments, the Central Bank and the NTMA. A wide range of topics are covered at these meetings, including financial reforms, structural reforms, economic developments and the progress of the Programme itself.   </p><p>  Following each review mission the external partners and the Irish authorities agree updated programme documents, specifically the Memorandum of Understanding on Specific Economic Policy Conditionality, the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies and the Technical Memorandum of Understanding. The programme documents outline the policies discussed with our external partners and detail the commitments which we have agreed to. Once the documents are finalised, the Letters of Intent are signed jointly by the Minister for Finance and the Governor of the Central Bank and are issued to the EU and the IMF, along with the accompanying programme documents.  The Programme documents then go through an EU and IMF approval procedure and once approved these documents are laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and placed on the Department of Finance website following their transmission.</p></reply>

This independence is enshrined in the EU Treaties.  The ECB has stated that Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) will be considered for future cases of EFSF/ESM macroeconomic adjustment programmes or precautionary programmes. They may also be considered for Member States currently under a macroeconomic adjustment programme when they are regaining bond market access. </p><p>  The ECB has also stated that a necessary condition for OMT is strict and effective conditionality attached to an appropriate European Financial Stability Facility/European Stability Mechanism (EFSF/ESM) programme. Such programmes can take the form of a full EFSF/ESM macroeconomic adjustment programme or a precautionary programme (Enhanced Conditions Credit Line), provided that they include the possibility of EFSF/ESM primary market purchases. The ECB will seek the involvement of the IMF for the design of the country-specific conditionality and the monitoring of such a programme. </p><p>  The ECB notes that its Governing Council will consider OMT to the extent that they are warranted from a monetary policy perspective as long as programme conditionality is fully respected, and terminate them once their objectives are achieved or when there is non-compliance with the macroeconomic adjustment or precautionary programme. The ECB&rsquo;s Governing Council will decide on the start, continuation and suspension of OMT, following a thorough assessment, in full discretion and acting in accordance with its monetary policy mandate.  I believe the ECB&rsquo;s announcement regarding its OMT programme is a significant development and is viewed as such by the financial markets. </p></reply>

I am also advised by the Commissioners that the legislative provision which allows a deduction for interest on borrowings used for the purchase, improvement or repair of rental property outside the State (section 71(4) of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (TCA 1997)) was introduced by Finance Act 1974, and provides a similar deduction in respect of interest for the owners of such property as applies in respect of owners of rental property in the State (section 97(2)(e) TCA1997).</p><p>  Rental income received by a property owner who is resident or ordinarily resident in the State from property outside the State is taxable here under the provisions of the TCA1997. As such, taxable rents from property outside the State form part of the property-owner&rsquo;s total taxable income and are subject to tax here at the applicable rates in force when the charge to tax arises, currently 20% and 41% for income tax and 25% for corporation tax. They are also subject to the Universal Social Charge in the hands of an individual.</p><p>  Discontinuing the existing interest deduction for properties outside the State could fall foul of EU law on grounds of discrimination in that different tax treatments would apply here for some residents of the State as compared with other residents of the State. In addition, it would likely fall foul of EU law in terms of restricting the free movement of capital within the Union. In those circumstances, discontinuing the interest deduction for foreign rental property could not be contemplated without a similar abolition of the deduction for all rental property owners. Such a move would have broader economic impacts, for example, by acting as a disincentive to potential investors in the Irish residential property market at a time when stabilisation and normalisation of the market is desirable.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-01-29a.315.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013012900059#WRG03900"><p>At the outset, it should be noted that the issue of flood cover and its unavailability is one which I am familiar with. I am also very conscious of the difficulties that the absence of such cover can causes to householders.  The Deputy will be aware, that the issue of provision of new flood cover or the renewal of existing flood cover is a commercial matter for insurance companies, which has to be based on a proper assessment of the risks they are accepting.  These are often considered on a case by case basis and it is important to be clear that neither the Government nor the Central Bank has any influence over this matter.  Consequently I am not in a position to direct insurance companies to provide flood cover to specific individuals.</p><p>  However, I appreciate the issue the Deputy has raised and believe that there are a number of avenues that can be explored in order to try and resolve this matter satisfactorily. Firstly, individuals can contact the Irish Insurance Federation which operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to insurance. Their service can be contacted at (01) 676 1914 or by email at <i><font color="#0000FF">iis@iif.ie</font></i><font color="#0000FF">.  </font>Furthermore, if there is not a satisfactory outcome as a result of this approach, then there is the option of referring the matter to the Financial Services Ombudsman who deals independently with unresolved complaints from consumers about their individual dealings with all financial service providers.  The Office can be contacted at <i><font color="#0000FF"></font></i>   and is a free service to the complainant. </p><p>  It should be noted that the Office of Public Works is committed to doing all it can to alleviate the impact of flooding through the provision of defences and by taking steps to manage and reduce flood risk in the future through a strategic and sustainable approach under the National Catchment Flood Risk Assessment &amp; Management (CFRAM) Programme. This commitment is underpinned by a very significant capital works investment programme which, along with expenditure on maintenance of arterial drainage schemes, will see up to 250 million euro being spent on flood relief measures over the next five years. </p><p>  In addition because of the difficulties currently being experienced by householders in certain areas in accessing flood insurance, the OPW has had a number of meetings with the Irish Insurance Federation (IIF).  The discussions are aimed with a view to reaching agreement on a sustainable system of information sharing in relation to completed flood alleviation schemes and works undertaken by the OPW or, in certain instances, by local authorities with OPW funding, and where the standard of protection afforded by these works could be verified. This should lead to flood cover being available to those in areas where remedial works have been satisfactorily completed. </p></reply>

The Thornhill Group recommended that the Local Property Tax paid in respect of a rented property should be deductible for income tax or corporation tax purposes, in a similar manner to commercial rates.  This is not provided for in the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012; it is the intention of the Government to introduce such a provision on a phased basis but the manner in which this will happen has not been decided.

To make the change suggested by the Deputy, that is to treat the generation of rental income as a trading business, would require a legislative change to effectively reclassify rental income as trading income for tax purposes. A major consequence of such a move would be the removal of the current ring-fence on rental losses which restricts the set-off of such losses solely to rental profits of future years.

For the purpose of this reply, I am treating the reference to &ldquo;formal businesses&rdquo; as being a reference to trading businesses.

Unlike in the case of a trading business, where the law provides that taxable income is closely aligned to the accounting profit (subject to certain explicit prohibitions), for landlords, whether individuals or companies, the taxable amount is the gross rent as reduced by a very limited number of specified deductions set out in section 97 (2) TCA 1997. While those specified deductions have generally included interest on borrowed money to purchase, improve or repair the rented premises, that entitlement has been removed or restricted on a number of occasions. An example was the interest restriction imposed between 1998 and 2002 in respect of certain rented residential property borrowings (following the Bacon reports).</p></reply>

The NTMA is responsible for the State Savings schemes which includes Savings Certificates, Savings Bonds, Prize Bonds, the National Solidarity Bond, Instalment Savings and Deposit Accounts such as the Ordinary Deposit Account and the Deposit Account Plus. The NTMA keeps the suite of State Savings products and the interest rates paid on them under constant review to ensure that the products remain competitive and attractive to retail investors, while balancing the funding requirements and financing costs of the State. </p><p>  In December 2012, my Department received a submission from the NTMA, for my approval, to reduce the interest rates on State Savings products, thereby lowering the cost of funding for the State for new funds. I approved the new rates proposed in the light of trends in interest rates in the domestic market generally and of the need to maintain market share in the retail investment sector given the important contribution made by retail investors in the State Savings products to the funding of the National Debt.</p></reply>

This began with EU 2020, the EU&rsquo;s growth strategy for the decade which aims to make the EU a smart, sustainable and inclusive economy. This was followed by the European Semester to which was added the Euro Plus Pact and the so-called &lsquo;six-pack&rsquo; which came into effect on 13 December 2011. The &lsquo;six-pack&rsquo; is the name given to a legislative package, comprising of five regulations and one directive, designed to reform and strengthen the Stability and Growth Pact and to introduce new macroeconomic surveillance.  The proposed &lsquo;two-pack&rsquo; is a further step in this process and is, to a great extent, a natural extension of the measures contained in the &lsquo;six-pack&rsquo;.  It is applicable to euro area member states only.  The first piece of proposed legislation in the two-pack is in relation to &lsquo;the monitoring and assessment of draft budgetary plans and on ensuring the correction of excessive deficits&rsquo;.  The second proposed regulation under the two-pack, is on the strengthening of economic and budgetary surveillance, and sets out explicit rules for enhanced surveillance.</p><p>  As part of this proposed regulation, a post-programme surveillance process will be put in place and maintained for a Member State until the balance outstanding under EU-sourced financial assistance falls below 25% of the total. This covers all EU funding sources, including bilateral loans.  Under the terms of this draft regulation, which is now close to being finalised, the Commission shall conduct, in liaison with the ECB, regular review missions in the Member State under post-programme surveillance to assess its economic, fiscal and financial situation. </p><p>  The reports generated following such missions shall be considered by the European Council, and the Council, acting by qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, may recommend to the Member State to adopt corrective measures.</p></reply>

The interest Greece will pay on its EFSF loans (it has no loans from the EFSM) will be deferred for 10 years, but will continue to accrue and that accrual will itself be subject to interest. It is important to note that the concessions that have been agreed are specific to Greece and are accompanied by significant additional conditionality. In Ireland on the other hand we have entered the final year of our programme. As such our focus is on making a successful exit from the programme and a return to sustainable market based funding. </p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s needs, as a country exiting a programme, are very different to those of Greece. We are however examining the Greek package to see if aspects of it offer any possible benefit to Ireland, particularly in the context of our programme exit.  In this context, the Deputy will be aware of the recent decision by the Eurogroup and ECOFIN to consider  a request for an extension of maturities for the EFSF and EFSM funding for Ireland and Portugal.

The tax office will then notify the financial institution where the account is held that the individual qualifies for the automatic exemption.

The provisions were commenced for credit unions on 24 September 2012 and require Central Bank regulations and a code of practice to be in place before being fully implemented.  The Central Bank has informed me that the Fitness and Probity regime for credit unions is undergoing consultation and is set out in Consultation Paper No. 62 which is available on the Central Bank's website at <i>www.centralbank.ie/regulation/poldocs/consultation-papers/documents/cp62%20fitness%20and%20probity%20regime%20for%20credit%20unions/cp%2062-%20fitness%20and%20probity%20regime%20for%20credit%20unions.pdf</i>.  The final date for submissions on this consultation is 1 March 2013.   It is proposed that the Fitness and Probity regime for credit unions will commence from 1 July 2013, with phasing and transitional arrangements applying to the implementation of the regime.  In applying a Fitness and Probity regime to credit unions, the Central Bank&#8217;s aim is to improve governance standards at board and management level within the credit union sector by ensuring that individuals who exercise significant influence and control in a credit union are capable, competent and financially sound individuals with the appropriate skills, experience, knowledge and integrity to manage and govern the credit union for the benefit of all stakeholders.</p><p>  The Central Bank has issued non-statutory guidelines in relation to the current fitness and probity regime for regulated financial service providers.  These guidelines set out the approach to be taken where the holder of a controlled function (CF) has been declared bankrupt or is subject to a judgment debt.  Such a person must be in a position to demonstrate that his or her ability to perform the CF is not adversely affected to a material degree by that matter.  A regulated financial service provider must assess whether an issue is material to a particular CF or pre-approval controlled function.  The Central Bank has set out a number of matters which should be considered in such an assessment, including the seriousness of the matter and its relevance to the duties to be performed.  It is anticipated by the Central Bank that the guidance provided to credit unions on implementation of the Fitness and Probity regime for credit unions will be consistent with the approach in the existing Fitness and Probity regime.</p></reply>

I share the concerns expressed by the elected representatives with regard to the loss of revenue arising from these illegal activities.  With regard to action to deal with the illicit trade, I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they are mindful of the unfair competitive advantage gained by those businesses that do not fulfil their tax obligations.  Revenue&rsquo;s tax and duty compliance programmes are under constant review to ensure they are focussed on the areas of greatest risk, including risks from the shadow economy.  Revenue tackles the problem of the shadow economy through a range of compliance and audit interventions including targeted special projects.  A variety of methodologies are used by Revenue to identify those who are operating in the shadow economy including covert surveillance, cold calls to businesses and venues as well as pre-arranged aspect queries on specific items.  In addition, joint operations are conducted with the Department of Social Protection using Joint Investigation Units and there is a strong focus on cash businesses, given its potential high-risk nature.</p><p>  I am confident that the Revenue Commissioners are pursuing a programme that is dealing in a very determined way with tax evasion in all its forms.  In 2012, Revenue carried out more than 537,000 compliance interventions, yielding more than &euro;492 million.  For the period January to August 2012, specific Shadow Economy Projects carried out by Revenue show that in the cash business, white-collar cash, construction and rental sectors, a total of 1,963 audits were undertaken, with a yield in excess of &euro;62 million.  Considerable success has been achieved in combating the illegal trade in tobacco products.  In 2012, Revenue&rsquo;s Customs Service seized a total of 95.6 million cigarettes from 8,105 seizures.  A further 5,276 kg of other tobacco products were taken in 2012 from 1,395 seizures.</p><p>  In addition to the ongoing enforcement action against the illegal fuel trade, steps are being taken to ensure enhanced control and supervision at all stages of the fuel supply chain.  Key actions include a strengthening of the licensing arrangements for businesses selling auto-fuel, and of the enforcement of licensing requirements.  As well as these important licensing changes, a requirement operates from 1 January 2013 for all fuel traders to make electronic monthly returns to Revenue on their fuel transactions.  This will facilitate Revenue in detecting unusual or anomalous patterns of activity.  Given the links of organised criminality with the illegal fuel trade, Revenue works closely with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in combating it.  Searches undertaken as part of intelligence-led operations have resulted in a considerable number of seizures of diesel and the closure of laundering plants, particularly in Border counties.</p><p>  The Revenue Commissioners advise that in 2012, 11 oil laundries were detected and shut down and 199,000 litres of oil were seized along with 28 vehicles and five trailers.  There were ten arrests in the course of these operations.  In the period January to November 2012, 56 premises were closed.  Finally, I am further advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they hold regular meetings with trade and representative bodies through The Hidden Economy Monitoring Group where the risks posed by shadow economy activities are discussed.  The Deputy should also note that changes are frequently made in tax legislation aimed at counteracting shadow economy activity.  Two examples from 2012 include the introduction of the electronic Relevant Contracts Tax regime and an enhanced penalty regime for employers who fail to operate PAYE regulations fully.</p></reply>

It is expected to generate &euro;65 million a year and will have to repay the &euro;890 million advanced to date by the Exchequer to the ICF and on which a commercial rate of interest is applied.  The timeframe for its application is expected to be in the region of 15 years.  It should be noted that a number of variables may impact on this time period, the most important of which is an increase in the volume of non-life insurance products sold in the future.  A higher figure for this would lead to a larger annual amount being generated by the 2% levy.  The ICF levy should not be confused with a 3% stamp duty on non-life insurance premiums introduced in 1982, which is often referred to as an insurance levy.  This Stamp Duty forms a part of general stamp duty receipts and is paid into the Central Fund along with other tax receipts.  The ICF levy has only been applied once before to meet the liabilities of an insolvent insurer when it was introduced on 1 January 1984 following the collapse of PMPA.  The levy was paid by all non-life insurers at a rate of 2% until 31 December 1991.  The rate was reduced to 1% from 1 January 1992 to 31 December 1992 and ceased to apply from 1 January 1993 as it was felt that sufficient funds had been collected to enable the successful completion of the administration of the former PMPA.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-01-29a.372.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013012900061#WRJ01500"><p>As at 31 December 2012, the nominal liability of EU-IMF Programme loans amounted to &euro;56.4 billion.  Of this, loans from EU sources, including the bilaterals, amounted to &euro;37.4 billion and loans from the IMF amounted to &euro;19 billion.  After adjustment for below-par issuance, deduction of a prepaid margin of &euro;530 million, and the effect of foreign exchange transactions, the amount received by the Exchequer as at 31 December 2012 was &euro;55.7 billion.  I am advised by the NTMA that the position on the interest rates for our programme loans is as follows:  In terms of the EFSF, &euro;6.7 billion of Ireland&rsquo;s EFSF loans are at fixed interest rates which were based on a matched EFSF bond/loan structure.  As a result of changes to the EFSF&rsquo;s structure which removed the direct link between specific bond issues and programme countries, the balance of Ireland&rsquo;s disbursed EFSF loans, currently &euro;5.5 billion, is part of a pooled system whereby all programme countries pay the same interest rate.  The pooled interest rate is calculated daily and is based on the EFSF&rsquo;s cost of funds in managing the pool.  This can be characterised as the weighted average cost of its bond and bill issuance.  As at 31 December 2012 the blended interest rate on Ireland&rsquo;s EFSF loans was 2.82%.</p><p>  Exceptionally, Ireland has one EFSF loan tranche of &euro;1.27 billion which is considered to be part of the pool but has a fixed interest rate until February 2015, at which point it will roll at the pooled interest rate.  The effective interest rate on Ireland&rsquo;s EFSM loans is based on the EFSM&rsquo;s cost of funds when it issues bonds.  Such issuance is matched against the loans.  Some of its matched issuance can be spread across both Ireland and Portugal.  As at 31 December 2012 the blended interest rate on Ireland&rsquo;s EFSM loans was 3.10%.  The interest rate on the United Kingdom&rsquo;s bilateral loan to Ireland is fixed and is based on the weighted gross redemption yield on all UK Debt Management Office gilt issuances to the market in the six-month period up to the date of the disbursement of each portion of the loan, plus a service fee of 18 basis points.  As at 31 December 2012 the blended interest rate on Ireland&rsquo;s UK loans was 2.70%.  The interest rate on both bilateral loans from the Kingdom of Sweden and the Kingdom of Denmark is floating and is based on the three-month Euribor plus a margin of 100 basis points.  As at 31 December 2012 the blended interest rate on these loans was 1.23%.</p><p>  The interest rate on the IMF Extended Fund Facility is tied to the IMF&rsquo;s market-related interest rate, known as the basic rate of charge.  As the IMF loan is provided in Special Drawing Rights, which is composed of a basket of four currencies (USD, EUR, GBP, JPY), the interest rate is constructed from three-month Eurepo, US and UK Treasury Bills and Japanese Government Discount Notes rates plus a margin of 100 basis points.  Borrowings of up to three times a country&rsquo;s IMF quota are subject to the basic rate of charge.  Borrowings above three times quota attract a surcharge of 200 basis points which is in addition to the 100 basis points margin which forms part of the basic rate of charge.  This surcharge rises to 300 basis points three years after the loan size exceeds three times the quota.  As at 31 December 2012 the overall blended euro equivalent interest rate on Ireland&rsquo;s IMF loan was 4.16%.  The Deputy should note that the mixture of floating and fixed interest rates across facilities and, in the case of the EFSF within a facility, makes it difficult to compare one facility directly against another as they contain different interest rate risk profiles and maturities.  In addition, the floating interest rates quoted are at a point in time and are, therefore, subject to change depending on movements in market rates.  Subject to these caveats, the NTMA has estimated that the all-in fixed euro equivalent cost of loans received under the EU-IMF programme was 3.36% at the end of December 2012.</p></reply>

Previously, self-assessed individuals were able to claim the tax relief due on these donations while charities claimed the relief in respect of donations made by PAYE workers.  In the recent Budget I announced measures to simplify the scheme of donations to approved bodies. One of these will mean that tax relief in all cases will now be refunded directly to the charity. Therefore, self-assessed individuals will no longer have the benefit of tax relief in respect of their donations. </p><p>  In addition, and as recommended by the Forum on Philanthropy and Fundraising, I have imposed a maximum limit of &euro;1 million per annum on individual donations which can be tax relieved. There was no limit on the donations scheme prior to this. Any tax relief due will be paid to the charity on a &lsquo;grossed-up&rsquo; basis as has always been the case in respect of donations from individuals within the PAYE collection system. This means that the tax relief due is calculated with reference to the amount a donor would have had to have earned in order to be left with the amount donated after income tax. In the new regime, a blended rate of relief of 31% will apply regardless of the marginal tax rate paid by the donor. Therefore, a donation of &euro;1 million to a single charity from a self-assessed (and PAYE) taxpayer will result in a tax refund of &euro;449,275 to the charity, provided the individual has paid sufficient Income Tax. </p><p>  Prior to these amendments the donor would have received a refund of &euro;410,000 on a donation of &euro;1 million. However, this relief would have been subject to the high earners&rsquo; restriction which imposes a maximum relief amount that could be claimed of &euro;80,000 or 20% of adjusted income in any one tax year. Depending on the income of the donor it is possible that the full relief amount could have been claimed in a single tax year. Where the individuals&rsquo; income was not sufficient to absorb all of the relief due, any unclaimed amount could be carried forward and claimed in subsequent years. It is worth noting that notwithstanding the application of the high earners&rsquo; restriction, prior to the changes I announced, there was no limit on the amount of donation that could attract tax relief.</p><p>  One of the aims of the donations scheme is to encourage philanthropy amongst those with high incomes, although some surveys show that tax relief is not the only factor that donors take into account when making a donation. However, I would like to assure the Deputy that the scheme operates to ensure that no benefit can accrue to the donor in respect of their donations.</p></reply>

In that regard, the Rent Tax Credit leaflet and Form Rent 1, which is used by tenants to claim tax relief on rent, contain information on the tenant&rsquo;s obligation to deduct tax in certain circumstances. </p><p>  The Commissioners have also indicated to me that where a tenant, who would have been required to deduct tax, has acted in good faith and was genuinely unaware of his or her obligation or of the residence status of the landlord, Revenue take a practical approach and generally only seek to apply the legislation prospectively from a current date.</p></reply>

Where a property is owned by more than one person, joint owners are to be jointly and severally liable for the payment of the tax. This means that Revenue can pursue one person for the full liability and payment by that person discharges the tax liability of all joint owners.  For the purposes of completing a local property tax return, joint owners are required to agree a valuation for the property.  A single return should be submitted on behalf of the joint owners.  If the local property tax is not paid, the Revenue Commissioners can proceed to collect the tax from any of the owners.  </p><p>  If the Deputy is referring to formal Local Authority shared ownership schemes, the position is that details of the arrangements for payment of Local Property Tax in respect of local authority housing have yet to be finalised and my understanding is that there are a range of different arrangements which may need to be catered for.

This package was agreed in the context of the statement by Euro Area Heads of State or Government that the scale of the Greek problem is so large that it requires special attention.   In this regard, on November 26th euro zone Finance Ministers agreed to partly reschedule Greece's debt, and offered several other measures to alleviate the country&rsquo;s financial burden. Taken together, these actions are expected to cut Greece's debt by up to 20 percentage points of GDP by 2020. This will bring its debt to GDP level to 124% in 2020, and a debt to GDP level of below 110% is targeted for 2022.</p><p>  One of the measures agreed, the Securities Market Programme (SMP) measure, will see Member States pass on to Greece's segregated account, an amount equivalent to the income on the SMP portfolio accruing to their national central bank as from budget year 2013.  Member States under a full financial assistance programme are not required to participate in this scheme for the period in which they receive financial assistance.  It is important to note that the SMP measure involves a transfer of an accounting profit, but does not involve any retirement of debt by Greece.  It is also important to note that the concessions that have been agreed are specific to Greece and are accompanied by significant additional conditionality. </p><p>  In Ireland, on the other hand, we have entered the final year of our programme and our focus is on making a successful exit from the programme. In line with the EU Heads of State or Government commitments in June, discussions are also underway to further improve the sustainability of Ireland&rsquo;s programme. These discussions include our continuing interaction with the EU, the ECB and the IMF (the Troika) on exiting the programme and issues related to our banking debt, including the restructuring of the promissory note.</p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s needs, as a country exiting a programme, are very different to those of Greece. We are, however, examining the Greek package to see if aspects of it offer any possible benefit to Ireland, particularly in the context of our programme exit.  We will also be engaging on this issue with the Troika officials as part of the 9th review mission which started earlier today. The decision on the measures, if any, to be sought will be taken on the basis of this examination.</p></reply>

In the case of Residential Mortgages in the Republic of Ireland, this happens after the property has been repossessed / sold and all other means of recovering any residual amount owing have been exhausted. As an additional disclosure to its Interim accounts, the Group now advises that it recorded an accounting write off amounting to &euro;2.3 million of its impairment provisions in respect of Residential Mortgages in the Republic of Ireland in the six months ended 30 June 2012.&rdquo;</i></p><p><b>AIB</b></p><p>I have been informed by AIB that it makes detailed disclosures in respect of its mortgage portfolio on a semi-annual basis as part of its regulatory reporting requirements.

Taking these on board, each school will have the flexibility to develop their junior cycle programme to meet the needs of their students.  One of the 8 principles in the Framework is "Inclusive Education". This will require that "The educational experience is inclusive of all students and contributes to equality of opportunity, participation and outcomes for all".  A number of the Statements of Learning  are relevant to anti-racism and these will focus on what students should know, understand, value and be able to do at the end of junior cycle, having fully engaged with and participated in the junior cycle programme of their school. </p><p>  Through the Statements of Learning the student  will &quot;appreciate and respect how diverse values, beliefs and traditions have contributed to the communities and culture in which she/he lives&quot;;  and will  &quot;value what it means to be an active citizen, with rights and responsibilities in local and wider contexts&quot;.

The continued allocation of the concessionary post is dependent on the teachers concerned remaining on the staff of the school and the appropriate enrolment figures being maintained.</p><p>  In regard to other supports, schools may require capital investment.

Pilot surveys on primary school patronage were conducted late last year in five areas: Arklow, Castlebar, Tramore, Trim and Whitehall (including Kilmore West &amp; Beaumont).  A report on the pilot surveys is available on my Department's website.  The surveys are being conducted mainly through an on-line facility while paper survey forms are also available for parents in the areas concerned.  The current surveys commenced on January 14th and will run to February 8th and during this time a free phone help line is available.  The surveys are open to parents or guardians of all children aged 0 to 12 years old in those areas.</p><p>  Information leaflets have been circulated to all primary schools in the relevant areas and also to pre-school organisations.  A comprehensive information campaign is being undertaken in each of the areas including a leaflet drop to every household giving details of the surveys, and there is advertising on local radio and newspapers to raise parental awareness of the surveys.  A detailed analysis of parental preferences submitted to the surveys will be conducted after the closing date.  The survey process is being overseen by the independent New Schools Establishment Group (NSEG).  The Department will publish detailed reports on the survey outcomes.  These reports will be sent to Catholic patrons for their response in consultation with each local community.</p></reply>

In formulating an enrolment policy a school must, however, ensure it is lawful and applied fairly to all applicants.</p><p>  Section 29 of the Education Act 1998, provides parents with an appeal process where a board of management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the Board refuses enrolment to a student. Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to either the relevant Vocational Educational Committee or to the Secretary General of my Department.  The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child.  The Board can be contacted at National Educational Welfare Board, National Headquarters, 16-22 Green Street, Dublin 7 or by telephone at 01-8738700.</p></reply>

Substance abuse prevention education is implemented as part of the SPHE curricula. SPHE is mandatory in all primary and post-primary schools up to Junior Certificate level. A full time support service offers professional development to teachers and advice to schools. The second level support service is operated jointly with the Health Sector.</p><p>  The substance use module of the SPHE curriculum focuses on the issues relating to the use and misuse of a range of substances. While most young people are aware of the implications and consequences of misusing substances, including alcohol, the SPHE curriculum actively seeks to promote healthy and responsible choices by students in relation to their lives.  The Framework for Junior Cycle, published in October 2012, is underpinned by 8 principles one of which is &quot;Wellbeing&quot;.  Through Wellbeing &quot;the student experience contributes directly to their physical, mental, emotional and social wellbeing and resilience. Learning takes place in a climate focused on collective wellbeing of school, community and society&quot;. In addition the Framework contains 24 Statements of Learning which students should experience.  The Principles plus 24 statements will provide the basis for school planning and evaluation. One of these statements aims to ensure that the student &quot;takes action to safeguard and promote his/her wellbeing and that of others&quot;.</p><p>  In addition, there are six key skills required for successful learning by students across the curriculum and for learning beyond school. These key skills are linked to the skills required at senior cycle and those already developed for early childhood and primary education.  One of the six key skills of Junior Cycle is &quot;Staying Well&quot;.  While education has a role to play in addressing the problem of alcohol misuse, behavioural change will not happen without the support and co-operation of parents, industry and society as a whole. Parents have a responsibility to help children and young people to adopt sensible and responsible attitudes and behaviours in relation to alcohol and drug abuse.</p></reply>

An appeal by the school to the independent review body in 2006 confirmed that the level of disadvantage did not warrant the school's inclusion.</p><p>  As announced in the 2012 Budget, five scholarship schemes for higher education were replaced with a new single scheme of bursaries based solely on merit and financial need.  There are no language requirements associated with the bursaries. This change has been made in order to make the best use of the limited funds we have available for bursaries so as to focus on the best performing students in the cohort of those who are most in need of financial help.</p></reply>

Under Section 24 of the Educational Welfare Act 2000, where the board of management of a school is of the opinion that a student should be expelled from a school, it shall - before expelling the student - notify the education welfare officer to whom functions under this Act have been assigned.  On receipt of the notification concerned, the education welfare officer shall make all reasonable efforts to ensure that provision is made for the continued education of the student.</p><p>  The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which may be able to assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child. The NEWB may be able to offer assistance and advice on securing a school placement within the pupil's area. The contact details for the NEWB are NEWB 16-22 Green Street Dublin 7  01-8738700.  Section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 provides for an appeal by a parent or guardian to the Secretary General of this Department, or - in the case of a Vocational Educational Committee (VEC) school - to the VEC in the first instance, where a Board of Management of a school, or a person acting on behalf of the Board, refuses to enrol a student in a school, expels a student or suspends a student for 20 or more days in any school year. My Department has no authority to compel a school to admit a pupil, except in the case of an appeal under section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 being upheld.  Educational provision by means of Home Tuition can only be considered as a temporary educational arrangement, and all efforts must continue to find a school place. The roles of the NEWB and the roles of the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) are also relevant in this context.</p></reply>

Once they are agreed, providers can then submit programmes of education and training for validation. Information on these processes can be found on FETAC's website, <i>www.fetac.ie. </i> It should be noted that FETAC was amalgamated with HETAC and the NQAI in November 2012 to form a new body called Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI). QQI is currently in the process of establishing its own revised procedures and, once adopted, they will appear on their website, <i>www.qqi.ie.</i></p><p>  F&Aacute;S do not accredit Colleges or Contractors. I am informed, however, that when F&Aacute;S Training Services procure training, contractors must become pre-qualified on the FAS Contract Training Tender List (CTTL). To become pre-qualified it is not currently necessary to be a registered FETAC provider. Once on the F&Aacute;S Contract Training Tender List, the contractor is invited on a rotational basis to partake in mini regional tenders for provision of training courses.  In addition, when F&Aacute;S competitively funds training programmes, such as the Momentum Programme, contractors have to become pre-qualified, as outlined above, but with one key difference in that they have to be accredited by either an awarding body on the Framework of Qualifications or by an awarding body aligned to the Framework. Again there is a second stage tendering competition in this scenario.  Education and Training providers should liaise directly with FAS with regard to their eligibility for tendering for training in this regard.</p></reply>

The impact of the moratorium is therefore limited to the Director of Adult Education, Assistant Principal and Special Duties posts of responsibility.  Vacancies at this level arise due to retirements in the specific grades and typically also from the knock on effect of filling Principal and Deputy Principal posts.  Limited alleviation was introduced for schools that are acutely affected by the impact of the moratorium at Assistant Principal level.  This alleviation is mainly focused on post-primary schools.</p><p>The detailed information requested by the Deputy would take some time to compile by staff in my Department.  I do not therefore propose to divert them from their work on the staffing allocations for the 2013/14 school year.  Instead I am providing you with the summary information on the overall impact of the moratorium since it was first introduced in March 2009.  At that time about 53% of teachers had posts of responsibility.  This has since reduced to about 39%.  The following tables give some more detail on the overall position since the moratorium was introduced.</p><p><bu>Level of Reduction in Posts of Responsibility</bu></p><p><table><tr><th><div><b>Post type</b></div></th><th><div><b>Post Primary</b></div></th><th><div><b>Primary</b></div></th></tr><tr><td>Assistant Principal <br /><br /><b></b></td><td><div>-2,150</div></td><td><div>-751</div></td></tr><tr><td>Special Duties <br /><br /></td><td><div>-1,900 </div></td><td><div>-2,276</div></td></tr><tr><td><b>Total </b><br /><br /><b></b></td><td><div>        -4,050 </div></td><td><div>   -3,027</div></td></tr></table></p><p><bu>Alleviation.</bu></p><p><table><tr><th><div><b>Post type</b></div></th><th><div><b>Post Primary</b><b></b></div></th><th><div><b>Primary</b></div></th></tr><tr><td><div>Director of Adult Education  </div></td><td><div>30</div></td><td><div>N/A</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Programme Co-ordinator (AP post)  </div></td><td><div>90</div></td><td><div>N/A</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Assistant Principal </div></td><td><div>307</div></td><td><div>38</div></td></tr><tr><td><div><b>Total </b></div><br /><b></b></td><td><div>427 </div></td><td><div>38</div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

The Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places.

In formulating an enrolment policy a school must, however, ensure it is lawful and applied fairly to all applicants.</p><p>  Section 15(g) of the Education Act  1998, provides that a board shall use the resources provided to the school from monies provided by the Oireachtas to make reasonable provision and accommodation for students with a disability or other special educational needs, including, where necessary, alteration of building and provision of appropriate equipment.  Section 29 of the Education Act, provides parents with an appeal process where a board of management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the Board refuses enrolment to a student or suspends a student for 20 or more days in any school year.  My Department has no authority to compel a school to admit a pupil, except in the case of an appeal under section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 being upheld.</p><p>  Appeals application forms and details of procedures for taking a Section 29 appeal are available from my Departments website, www.education.ie  or directly from Section 29 appeals administration unit at Section 29 Appeals Section Friars Mill Road, Mullingar, Co.

In particular, its network of Special Education Needs Organisers (SENOs) co-ordinates special needs education provision at local level and arranges for the delivery of special educational services.  The SENOs act as single points of contact for parents of students with special educational needs.  A specific function of the SENO is to identify appropriate educational placements for children with special educational needs. SENOs are a valuable source of support to parents who are actively sourcing a placement for their children.  All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents can contact SENOs directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.</p></reply>

Civil servants who hold positions which are &#8220;designated positions&#8221; for the purposes of the Ethics Acts are prohibited, within twelve months of resigning or retiring from the service, from accepting an offer of appointment from an employer outside the Civil Service or an engagement in a particular consultancy project, without first obtaining approval from the Outside Appointments Board - in the case of officers at and above Assistant Secretary level or the appropriate Secretary-General / Head of Office otherwise.  This would apply where the nature and terms of such appointment or engagement could lead to a conflict of interest.</p><p>  Applications are considered by the Outside Appointments Board on the basis of determining whether or not a clear conflict of interest exists.  The Board can either approve the take up of an appointment, the acceptance of an engagement, attach conditions or recommend against the appointment.  The composition, operation and reporting arrangements for the Board are set out in section 21 of the Code.  Officers must also continue to observe the restrictions imposed by the Official Secrets Act 1963. Departments and Offices are required under the Code to monitor the acceptance of outside appointments by civil servants and former civil servants.</p><p>  Significant progress has been made in developing my proposals for the regulation of lobbying in relation to the commitment included in the Programme for Government referred to in the Deputy&#8217;s question.  The consultation process undertaken on this commitment was based on the OECD Principles for Transparency and Integrity in lobbying which recommend that it may be necessary to impose a &#8216;cooling-off&#8217; period that temporarily restricts former public officials from lobbying their past organisations.</p><p>  My proposals in this area - which draw on the Outside Appointments Board model applying to senior civil servants - will be published following consideration by Government as part of the General Scheme of a Regulation of Lobbying Bill.  The relevant OECD principles also highlight the requirement for countries to consider establishing restrictions for public officials leaving office to address other potential conflict of interest situations that could arise.  It is planned that these other elements of the Programme for Government commitment which also arise from the recommendations contained in the final report of the Mahon Tribunal will be addressed through the proposed reform of the legislative framework for ethics which is currently under way.</p></reply>

The standardised contracts were introduced as a significant reform measure in the construction area in 2007 on foot of a Government decision in 2004 to deal with significant cost overruns on public works projects.  The main objectives of this reform initiative are cost certainty at tender stage; better value for money; and more efficient delivery of public works projects.  </p><p>  A commitment was given to the Construction Industry Federation (CIF) in 2006 by the Minister for Finance at that time that a review would be conducted by the Government Contracts Committee for Construction (GCCC) at an appropriate time when adequate experience had been obtained in the use of the new contracts by contracting authorities. Consideration was given to a review in 2010 but at the time it was agreed that insufficient numbers of contracts had reached final account stage to provide material for a review.  I am satisfied that sufficient projects have now reached agreed final account stage to conduct a review of the performance of the contracts.  The CIF&rsquo;s most recent request for a review is currently being considered.  The arrangements about which the Deputy is enquiring will be decided shortly.</p></reply>

The Programme is subject to a quarterly review mission with the three external partners, the EU, the ECB and the IMF (the Troika).  It is at these review missions that discussions take place with regard to programme commitments which translate into the Programme documents which are updated and agreed after every mission.  The review missions, the 9th of which begins today, involve a large number of technical meetings which are attended by my Department, the Department of Finance and, when appropriate, other Departments, the Central Bank and the NTMA. A wide range of topics are covered at these meetings, including financial reforms, structural reforms, economic developments and the progress of the Programme itself.   </p><p>  Following each review mission the external partners and the Irish authorities agree updated programme documents, specifically the Memorandum of Understanding on Specific Economic Policy Conditionality, the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies and the Technical Memorandum of Understanding. The programme documents outline the policies discussed with our external partners and detail the commitments which we have agreed to. Once the documents are finalised, the Letters of Intent are signed jointly by the Minister for Finance and the Governor of the Central Bank and are issued to the EU and the IMF, along with the accompanying programme documents.  The Programme documents then go through an EU and IMF approval procedure and once approved these documents are laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and placed on the Department of Finance website following their transmission.</p><p>  I have not had the need to write separately to the Troika on the policies being implemented because of the processes which we have in place, as outlined above.  There are, of course continuing contacts at official level, relating to technical and implementation issues.</p></reply>

Upon the dissolution of the body corporate, such property becomes State property.   This function transferred in July 2011 to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform under the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act, 2011 and S.I. No. 418/2011 &mdash; Finance (Transfer of Departmental Administration and Ministerial Functions) Order 2011.  The effect of Section 28 is that the Minister does not hold the assets of dissolved companies as beneficial owner. He holds them in trust. The title which the Minister acquires under this Section has been described as a defeasible title since, if the dissolved company is restored to the Register of Companies within twenty years of the date of its dissolution, its property is automatically restored to it. The State Property Act also includes, in Section 31, a power for the Minister to waive the interest acquired under Section 28 of the Act.  </p><p>  It is understood that the property which is the subject of the current question was held within a company which was struck off the Register of Companies in September, 1972 for failure to file annual returns with the Companies Office. The beneficial owner of the property applied to the Department of Finance for a waiver of the interest acquired by the Minister for Finance under the provisions of the State Property Act and that waiver, in respect of which the consideration was &pound;160, was completed in October, 1986, approximately 14 years after the dissolution of the company. The effect of the waiver, which was not a sale by the State, would have been to allow the beneficial owner to complete the process of assembling a satisfactory title. The waiver itself would have formed only a limited element in the establishment of that title and the transaction was a normal exercise of Departmental functions.  The price which the beneficial owner may have secured in a subsequent sale was not a matter for consideration in the context of the waiver. </p></reply>

Its sole function is to adjudicate on disputes on individual employment rights and as such its function in this matter is completed. I understand that the Tribunal received a claim from your constituent on 23rd June 2010 under the Unfair Dismissal Acts 1977 to 2007. The matter was heard by the Tribunal on 28th May 2012.  The Tribunal found that the claimant was unfairly dismissed and that the appropriate redress was compensation.  The decision of the Tribunal was conveyed by registered post to the parties concerned on 20th September 2012.</p><p>  If an employer fails to implement a determination of the Employment Appeals Tribunal in relation to a claim for redress within 6 weeks from the date on which the determination is communicated to the parties, I as Minister may, if it is considered appropriate having regard to all the circumstances, institute proceeding in the Circuit Court on behalf of the employee against the employer for redress under the Act.  The National Employment Rights Authority (NERA) acts on behalf of the Minister in processing requests in this regard. However, in this case as the employer involved went into receivership with effect from 24th February 2012 it is more appropriate in that circumstance that the claim for payment of the award is made to the Minister for Social Protection under the Insolvency Payments Scheme.</p><p>  An application for payment of the award should be made to the insolvent employer&#8217;s representative, in this case the receiver, Mr. Kieran Wallace of KPMG, 1 Stokes Place, Stephen Green, Dublin 2.  The form EIP3 can be used to make an application to the fund which is managed by the Department of Social Protection.  The Receiver may choose to use the on-line facility available at   .   The claimant would need to make contact with Mr. Wallace to agree the best way of forwarding the determination for submission for payment.</p><p>  There are statutory limitations and conditions with regard to the payment of such awards under the Insolvency Payments Scheme, and further details of these may be sought from the Department of Social Protection at:  <font color="#2F2F2F">Insolvency Payments Section, </font><font color="#2F2F2F">Floor 3, Department of Social Protection, </font><font color="#2F2F2F">Block C, Earlsfort Centre, </font><font color="#2F2F2F">Lower Hatch Street, Dublin 2.</font><font color="#2F2F2F">Telephone:(01) 6734501, (01) 6734502, (01) 6734503, (01) 6734504, (01) 6734505, (01) 6734506, (01) 6734507, (01) 6734508.</font></p></reply>

The total site is an approximate area of 11 acres and consists of several office and laboratory type buildings and a green space.  Dublin City University (DCU), which has its main campus very close to the Glasnevin site, expressed an interest in acquiring the site to accommodate a Green Way Innovation Campus. The University developed a long-term plan detailing the development of the site as an innovation campus, including job creation targets in respect of new start-up ventures to be accommodated on the site.  The remaining part of the site, comprising approximately two acres, was assigned to the Department of Education and Skills, which plans to build an &ldquo;Educate Together&rdquo; national school to serve the local area.  </p><p>  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform approved the transfer of both sites in January 2012 and this was subsequently approved by the EI Board in June 2012. The transfer to DCU is under a long-term lease with agreed metrics/targets to be achieved within 10 years of signing the lease. These targets will be monitored by EI and my Department.  My Department is supportive of the initiative by DCU to develop an internationally-recognised &ldquo;Innovation Campus&rdquo; on the site, with a particular focus on research-active Cleantech firms.  The campus is an important element within &ldquo;The Green Way&rdquo; Cleantech cluster and it is envisaged that it will support high-value employment in indigenous and multinational companies focussed on eco-innovation.  The partners in &ldquo;The Green Way&rdquo; cluster include Dublin City Council, Fingal County Council, Dublin City University, Dublin Institute of Technology, the Dublin Airport Authority, North Dublin Chamber and Ballymun Regeneration Ltd.</p></reply>

In the light of the further information provided by the Association, funding in the amount of &euro;46,865 was approved to support the marketing project.

Details of the amount of grants paid to each individual company in each of the years in question are set out in the attached tabular statement. As papers supporting grant payments made in 2012 are as yet unaudited, it is not possible to provide details of grant payments made in 2012 at this stage.</p><p>County Laois, along with Counties Longford, Offaly, Westmeath and Roscommon, forms part of IDA Ireland&rsquo;s Midlands Region. The locations of emphasis in the Region are the Gateway Towns of Athlone, Tullamore and Mullingar.  In addition, IDA Ireland actively promotes the County towns of Portlaoise, Longford and Roscommon.</p><p>Laois has traditionally been a centre of manufacturing for foreign direct investment (FDI).  However, over recent years, it has proved challenging to maintain and attract overseas manufacturing companies into the County as much of this global investment is going to low cost destinations such as Eastern and Central Europe and China.  As a result of this locational shift in global manufacturing, Laois has seen a number of closures within the multinational sector.  In order to address this decline, and as part of the transition and re-positioning of the County to a more knowledge based economy, IDA Ireland is marketing Portlaoise as a key location for investment in the Globally Traded Services sector.  To support this strategy, IDA Ireland is working closely with educational institutions in the Region to develop the skill sets necessary to attract high value added employment to the county.</p><p>IDA Ireland has indicated that it has invested in the physical infrastructure required to attract FDI to County Laois. &euro;3.2m has been invested in a quality flagship Business Park in Portlaoise which is now an integral part of the agency&rsquo;s international marketing programme.  The Park has a modern 17,000 sq ft advance office building as well as all the necessary infrastructure, including ducting for broadband, which is being marketed to potential inward investors.  I am informed by IDA Ireland that while marketing Laois has proved challenging in the current global market and in common with many other regional locations, recent infrastructural enhancements have significantly strengthened the marketability of Portlaoise Town, which bodes well for securing new FDI investment.</p><p><b>Table showing grant payments to IDA client companies in County Laois in each of the years 2002 to 2011</b></p><p><table><tr><th>Company Name</th><th><div>Tretorn Sport Limited</div></th><th><div>DIS enbi Seals<br />Ireland Limited</div></th><th><div>Aubren Limited</div></th><th><div>Kenetics Ireland</div></th></tr><tr><td>2002</td><td><div>&#8364;79,012.00</div></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2003</td><td><div>&#8364;90,792.00</div></td><td><div>&#8364;58,280.00</div></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2004</td><td></td><td><div>&#8364;5,527.00</div></td><td><div>&#8364;91,416.00</div></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2005</td><td></td><td><div>&#8364;2,636.00</div></td><td></td><td><div>&#8364;110,945.00</div></td></tr><tr><td>2006</td><td></td><td><div>&#8364;11,250.00</div></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2007</td><td></td><td></td><td><div>&#8364;45,708.00</div></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2008</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td></td><td><div>&#8364;39,000.00</div></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td></td><td><div>&#8364;249,754.00</div></td><td><div>&#8364;24,570.00</div></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td></td><td><div>&#8364;21,182.00</div></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td><div>&#8364;169,804.00</div></td><td><div>&#8364;387,629.00</div></td><td><div>&#8364;161,694.00</div></td><td><div>&#8364;110,945.00</div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

The purpose of the Directive is to combat late payment in commercial transactions, in order to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market, thereby fostering the competitiveness of undertakings and in particular of SMEs.

The public consultation process was open for submissions over a six week period from: 09 August 2012 to 17 September 2012.  During this period five submissions were received, all of which came from industry or business representative groups. My Department provided a summary of submissions received and a response to the issues raised to all stakeholders in November 2012.  A number of the suggestions made during the consultation process cannot be addressed directly by the transposition of the Late Payments Directive as they relate to matters which fall outside the direct scope of the Directive.  My Department will, however, address these through the work on Action Plan for Jobs 2013.</p></reply>

The Forum consists of key stakeholders from the region who are responsible for implementing the actions set out in that Plan. These stakeholders are representatives from the following agencies/bodies: IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, Forfas, FAS/Solas, South East Regional Authority, Waterford City Council, Wexford County Council, Kilkenny County Council, Carlow County Council, the County/City Enterprise Boards in Waterford, Wexford and North &amp; South Tipperary, Teagasc, Failte Ireland, Higher Education Authority, and Waterford and Carlow Institutes of Technology. </p><p>  Since the setting up of the Action Plan, there have been a number of positive developments in the region. Key amongst these are 280 Enterprise Ireland-supported jobs created by the Eishtec Call Centre in Waterford city, and the awarding of  a 5 year &euro;300 million contract to Dawn Meats to process up to 18,000 tonnes of Irish beef annually for McDonald&rsquo;s. The deal has led Dawn Meats to invest &euro;14.5 million in a new purpose built, state of the art, beef processing facility in Carroll&rsquo;s Cross, Co Waterford, creating 65 new jobs. Additionally, I have, in conjunction with IDA Ireland, launched a new online marketing tool called &ldquo;Connect and Invest&rdquo; in September 2012 which focuses on Waterford and the South East Region.  &ldquo;Connect and Invest Waterford&rdquo; is a digital based and interactive marketing experience designed for use on tablets, smart phones and PCs. Information on location, education, lifestyle and existing IDA Ireland and indigenous companies is provided through rich imagery, video and text and will be continuously updated.  This website will enhance the ability of IDA Ireland Executives to showcase the Waterford&rsquo;s unique attributes in face-to-face client meetings. </p><p>  A significant number of site visits were made by multinational companies to Waterford in 2012. The number of visits last year was higher than those to one of the three other counties mentioned in the supporting information supplied and comparable to one of the others. However, you will appreciate that, while IDA makes every effort to encourage companies to visit specific locations, the decision to visit a particular county or region is a matter for the individual company concerned.</p></reply>

Arising from these site visits there were a total of 4 company announcements in 2011 with the potential to create 250 jobs together with a &euro;25m investment in R&amp;D.  Details of the number of site visits in each year and the company announcements in respect of each county are set out in the attached tabular statement.</p><p>The challenge facing IDA is to continue to win top quality investment for Ireland in a very difficult market place.  International competition for FDI has become extremely intense and continues to increase.  The Agency has indicated that, in seeking to achieve balanced regional development and the broader goal of securing new FDI projects for Ireland in a very competitive global environment, the concept of scale is crucial.  Leading global corporations require a significant population pool, access to qualified talent, world class physical and digital infrastructure as well as the availability of sophisticated professional and business support services.  Ireland has only one such Region, the Greater Dublin area.  In its efforts to achieve balanced regional economic development, IDA prioritises the marketing of its Gateway locations within each Region as the locations of critical mass and highlights the opportunities provided by other locations on an opportunistic basis, which are within commuting distances of these Gateways.</p><p>Both Longford and Westmeath form part of IDA&rsquo;s Midland Region, together with Counties Laois, Offaly and Roscommon. In that region IDA priorities the marketing of the linked gateway of Athlone/ Tullamore/ Mullingar.  In addition, the Agency promotes Longford, Portlaoise and Roscommon as part of its wider marketing efforts and in response to specific client requests.  When arranging itineraries for potential investors, the normal practice for IDA is to show the company three or four locations within a Region that can meet its requirements and, in certain cases, other locations are visited on an opportunistic basis.  In selecting locations to market to client companies, IDA Ireland endeavours to include locations which have been affected by closures/job losses.  Whilst IDA Ireland seeks to influence the selection of a location, the final decision on where to locate is taken in all cases by the investor.</p><p>At present in the Midlands Region there are 44 IDA client companies employing over 5,000 people in total, of which more than half are located in Longford and Westmeath. There are 24 IDA client companies located in Longford and Westmeath and employing 2,884.  With the improved infrastructure that is now in place, a significant number of people commute within the Midlands Region and a project win in one Midlands location has a positive impact on the other surrounding areas.  In view of the concerns that have been expressed to me by Deputies on all sides of the house about the lack of site visits to certain regional locations, I propose to discuss this problem with IDA in the coming weeks.</p><p><b>Table showing the number of IDA sponsored site visits to counties Longford and Westmeath in each of the years 2010 to 2012</b></p><p><table><tr><th><div>-</div></th><th><div>Longford</div></th><th><div>Westmeath</div></th></tr><tr><td><div>2010</div></td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>22</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2011</div></td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>15</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2012</div></td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>7</div></td></tr></table></p><p><b>Table showing the number of investment announcements arising from site visits in County Westmeath</b></p><p><table><tr><th><div>Company</div></th><th><div>Location</div></th><th><div>Site Visit</div></th><th><div>Announced</div></th><th><div>Potential Jobs</div></th></tr><tr><td>AMS</td><td>Athlone</td><td>2010</td><td><div>2011</div></td><td><div>50</div></td></tr><tr><td>NPD</td><td>Athlone</td><td>2010</td><td><div>2011</div></td><td><div>100</div></td></tr><tr><td>Ericsson</td><td>Athlone</td><td>Existing<br />Client</td><td><div>2011</div></td><td><div>100</div></td></tr><tr><td>Covidien</td><td>Athlone</td><td>Existing<br />Client</td><td><div>2011</div></td><td>&#8364;25m investment in R&amp;D</td></tr></table></p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-01-29a.663.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013012900066#WRO03500"><p>The Government is committed to the reform of the State&#8217;s Workplace Relations Services. The Reform Programme, which I am progressing, will replace the current outdated system, which has developed in an ad hoc manner over the last sixty years, with a new two tier structure that will deliver a world-class Workplace Relations Service.  </p><p>  I am happy to report that substantial progress has been made to date and a number of important priority actions have been successfully delivered within the target timescale. These include:</p><p> - Two public consultation processes have been completed and two policy papers published (<i>Blueprint to Deliver a World-Class Workplace Relations Service</i> (<i>Blueprint</i>) in April, 2012 and <i>Legislating for a World-Class Workplace Relations Service </i>  in July, 2012).</p><p> - A new single contact portal called &#8220;Workplace Relations Customer Services&#8221; has replaced the five separate entry points resulting in complaints being acknowledged and employers notified of complaints in a much speedier fashion.</p><p> - There are now no backlogs for Rights Commissioner hearings.</p><p> - A Single Complaint Form that deals with over 100 first instance complaints has replaced the 30 forms previously in use. It will shortly be possible to submit this form online.</p><p> - A new workplace relations interim website is in place and design of the final site is at an advanced stage.</p><p> - A pilot Early Resolution Service is now seeking to resolve disputes at an early stage without the need for adjudication.</p><p> - A major Business Process Review is at an advanced stage. This will identify the procedures, processes and systems which will underpin the new structures.</p><p> - Responsibility for the Equality Tribunal (but not including the policy functions of the Minister for Justice and Equality concerning equality) was transferred from the Minister for Justice and Equality to myself with effect from 1 January, 2013.</p><p>  My intention is to continue to progress the reform programme. The next major step is to establish a two-tier Workplace Relations structure. This will involve two statutorily independent bodies replacing the current five. We will have a new single body of first instance to be called the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) and a separate appeals body, which will effectively be an expanded Labour Court. The WRC will replace the LRC, NERA, the Equality Tribunal and undertake the first instance functions of the EAT. The Labour Court will take on the appellate functions of the EAT.</p><p>  While considerable progress has been achieved to date on an administrative basis, completing the proposed reform requires the enactment of detailed legislation. This is necessary in order to provide the statutory basis for the new structures and processes.  A significant amount of work has been completed on the preparation of the Workplace Relations Bill which will give statutory effect to the Reform proposals.  In July 2012, I published a policy document &#8211; <i>Legislating for a World Class Workplace Relations Service</i>   - which was submitted to the Oireachtas Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation in order to give the Committee an early opportunity to shape the legislation.  I had a constructive dialogue with the Committee on the basis of this document.</p><p>  Enactment of the Bill will necessitate amendments to 22 primary acts, 12 specified parts or sections of acts and 71 statutory instruments.  The Scheme of the Workplace Relations Bill was approved by Government, in July 2012, for priority drafting. The Cabinet also approved the inclusion of the Workplace Relations Bill on the Government's A-list of legislation planned for the Spring 2013 Legislative Programme. I am committed to enactment of the legislation at an early date, with a view to having the proposed new structures in place in 2013.</p><p>  Pending the enactment of the legislation, I intend to continue to progress the reform and bring about further enhancements for users of the services on an administrative basis in the coming months. These include:</p><p> - Establish a Single Hearings Management and Scheduling Unit.</p><p> - Establish a Single/Shared Corporate Services Unit for the Workplace Relations Bodies.</p><p> - Provide a version of Workplace Relations Complaint Form that can be submitted online (e-Complaint Form).</p><p> - Enhance Adjudication Arrangements and reduction of backlogs in the Equality Tribunal.</p><p> - Develop and deliver an accredited training programme for Adjudicators.</p><p> - Implement new business processes in the Workplace Relations Bodies.</p><p> - Implement a Code of Practice and Conduct for adjudicators.</p><p> - Introduce standard templates for Rights Commissioners&#8217; decisions/Equality Tribunal and EAT Determinations.</p><p> - Review and revise, as necessary, existing statutory instruments (SIs). </p><p> - Rationalise hearings venues.</p><p> - Develop a Single Determinations Database.</p><p> - Put in place a Single Complaints Management System.</p><p>  I am determined to progress the next phase of the reform and the enactment of the legislation with the same determination and priority that has delivered excellent results to date.</p></reply>

The merger of the two bodies is aimed at ensuring improved co-ordination of the two policy areas. Enforcing both competition and consumer laws will give the newly merged body synergies and efficiencies in carrying out its functions. This will have benefits for consumers due to the existence of a stronger and more co-ordinated body dealing with consumer and competition issues. </p></reply>

As part of the package of measures in Budget 2013 I announced, along with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Frances Fitzgerald, a &euro;14 million joint childcare initiative between our Departments.  This initiative demonstrates my determination to progress this issue despite the difficult financial and budgetary situation. The new scheme will provide approximately 6,000 afterschool childcare places for eligible clients of my Department. It will be targeted to support those who engage in the activation process and who enter into employment. The places will be limited to low income families with children aged 4 to 12 years. </p><p>  I believe that the availability of these childcare places is a very positive measure for lone parents. I secured the agreement for this scheme from Government, in conjunction with Minister Fitzgerald, to address the child care needs of lone parents as part of the reforms of the OFP scheme.  In addition, I have postponed the commencement date of the reductions to the age of the youngest child for receipt of OFP from January 2013 to July 2013, to provide time for some of these additional after-school child care supports to be put in place.  The new scheme will build on the existing supports provided by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in the child care sector.  My Department is working closely with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs to fully define the scheme. I expect that the scheme will commence with a pilot and be rolled out on a phased basis.</p></reply>

There is no automatic entitlement to a payment under this scheme.  ENPs are payable at the discretion of the officers administering the scheme taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case in order to ensure that the payments target those most in need of assistance.

EU nationals who are entitled to work here pay PRSI contributions on the same basis as other employees and, if they satisfy the qualifying conditions, they may receive contributory benefits on the same basis as Irish and other EU citizens.</p><p>  Social assistance schemes such as those referred to by the Deputy are subject to the habitual residence condition.  The requirement to be habitually resident in Ireland was introduced as a qualifying condition for certain social assistance schemes and child benefit with effect from 1 May 2004.  The effect of the condition is that a person whose habitual residence is elsewhere would not normally be entitled to social welfare assistance or child benefit payments on arrival in Ireland.</p><p>  The determination of a person&rsquo;s habitual residence takes accounts of five factors which are set out in legislation, as follows:</p><p> (a) the length and continuity of residence in the State or in any other particular country;</p><p> (b) the length and purpose of any absence from the State;</p><p> (c) the nature and pattern of the person&rsquo;s employment;</p><p> (d) the person&rsquo;s main centre of interest, and</p><p> (e) the future intentions of the person concerned as they appear from all the circumstances.</p><p>  These five factors have been derived from European Court of Justice case law.  A deciding officer will assess a person&rsquo;s situation having regard to the factors outlined and if he is not satisfied that the person is habitually resident in Ireland they will not qualify for a payment.</p></reply>

The Programme is subject to a quarterly review mission with the three external partners, the EU, the ECB and the IMF (the Troika).  It is at these review missions that discussions take place with regard to programme commitments which translate into the Programme documents which are updated and agreed after every mission.  The review missions, the ninth of which begins today, involve a large number of technical meetings which are attended by officials from the Department of Finance, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and when appropriate from other Departments (including the Department of Social Protection), the Central Bank and the NTMA. </p><p>  Following each review mission the external partners and the Irish authorities agree updated programme documents, specifically the Memorandum of Understanding on Specific Economic Policy Conditionality, the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies and the Technical Memorandum of Understanding.  The programme documents outline the policies discussed with our external partners and detail the commitments which we have agreed to.  Once the documents are finalised, the Letters of Intent are signed jointly by the Minister for Finance and the Governor of the Central Bank and are issued to the EU and the IMF, along with the accompanying programme documents.  The Programme documents then go through an EU and IMF approval procedure and once approved these documents are laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and placed on the Department of Finance website following their transmission.</p><p>  There are also continuing contacts at official level, relating to technical and implementation issues.  I have not written to the Troika in relation to any specific policy which is being implemented in order to meet the expenditure ceilings for my Department.</p></reply>

The SWA scheme is the &lsquo;safety net&rsquo; within the overall social welfare system in that it provides a basic income support payment to eligible people in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs and those of their dependants. The main purpose of the SWA scheme is to provide immediate and flexible assistance for those in need who do not qualify for payment under other State schemes. However, at any time, SWA cannot be viewed as a temporary or interim means of income support available independently of the habitual residence condition.  Having regard to all of the circumstances in this case, the person concerned was refused SWA as he did not satisfy the conditions relating to habitual residence. This decision was upheld by the independent Appeals Office.</p></reply>

Ordinary employees who have access to the full range of social insurance benefits pay Class A PRSI at the rate of 4%.  In addition, their employers make a PRSI contribution of 10.75% in respect of their employees, resulting in the payment of a combined 14.75% rate per employee under full-rate PRSI Class A.  (For employees earning less than &euro;356 per week, the rate of employer&rsquo;s PRSI is 4.25%).  </p><p>  In 2011 I established the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare to meet the commitment made in the Programme for Government.  The Advisory Group is charged with, inter alia, examining and reporting on issues involved in providing social insurance cover for self-employed persons in order to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable.  The Advisory Group&rsquo;s overall method of working is based on producing modular reports on the priority areas identified in the Terms of Reference.  Where possible, the aim is to provide recommendations that can be acted upon in time for the annual budget, estimates and legislative cycle and to allow the Government to best address its commitments under the EU-IMF Programme of Financial Support.  The Group has been considering the issue of social insurance coverage for the self-employed and will submit its report once its examination of the various questions has been completed.  </p><p>  The third Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund, as at 31 December 2010, was completed by consultants KPMG in June 2012 and laid before each House of the Oireachtas on 24 August 2012.   The Review covers a 55 year period from 2011&ndash;2066 and builds on the findings of the 2000 and 2005 Actuarial Reviews of the Fund.</p><p>  One of the issues examined in the 2010 Review was the long-term cost implications to the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) and the break-even contributions rates required to provide invalidity pensions to the self-employed and to provide jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit for self-employed workers.  The report found that the effective annual rate of contribution, or the required contribution as a percentage of salary, needed to provide the core full-rate State pension (contributory), which is the benefit currently available to self-employed contributors, is approximately 15%.  This compares favourably with the 4% rate currently paid by the self-employed.  An incremental increase in contribution rates from approximately 15% to 16% would be required if jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit in addition to core State pension (contributory) is provided.  The average contribution rate required for the core State pension (contributory) plus jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit and the invalidity pension is estimated to be in the region of 17.3%.</p><p>  Any proposals to revise the social insurance system for self-employed persons by extending social insurance entitlements will have to be considered in a budgetary context, taking account of the finding of the Actuarial Review that the self-employed achieve very good value for money compared with the employed &ndash; when the comparison includes both employer and employee contributions in respect of the employed person.  </p><p>  Self-employed workers may access social welfare payments supports by establishing entitlement to assistance-based payments such as jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and disability allowance.  In the case of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance they can apply for the means-tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.  In general, their means will take account of the level of earnings in the last twelve months in determining their expected income for the following year and, in the current climate, account is taken of the downward trend in the economy.  As in the case of a non-self-employed claimant for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance or disability allowance, the means of husband/wife, civil partner or co-habitant will be taken into account in deciding on entitlement to a payment.</p></reply>

In addition to carer&rsquo;s allowance or carer&rsquo;s benefit, carers receive additional support in the form of free travel and household benefits (for those who live with the person for whom they care) and the annual respite care grant in respect of each person for whom they care.  If a person is getting certain qualifying social welfare payments and also providing full time care and attention to another person, they can keep their main social welfare payment and get the half-rate carer's allowance as well.  They can also receive an extra half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance if they care for more than one person.  </p><p>  The reason these payments fall under the remit of my Department is that they are income supports for carers who are unable to work while they are caring.  They are not intended to cover the cost of care which is a matter for the Department of Health and the HSE.  They are also not intended to cover the income needs of the care recipient, who, in most cases, will be in receipt of a payment from the Department in their own right, such as a State pension or a disability payment.  For operational reasons, including the links with other payments, such as domiciliary care allowance and a range of schemes for those applying for half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance, it would not be appropriate to transfer the control of the carer&rsquo;s allowance payment to the Department of Health.  </p><p>  Expenditure on carers has increased significantly in recent years.  The estimated expenditure on carers in 2012 was over &euro;771 million:  &euro;509 million on carer&rsquo;s allowance, &euro;24 million on carer&rsquo;s benefit, &euro;135 million on the respite care grant and &euro;103 on domiciliary care allowance.  This represents an increase of almost &euro;20 million on expenditure in 2011.  There are over 52,000 people in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance.  Of these, over 23,000 are getting half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance in addition to another social welfare payment at an annual cost of some &euro;90 million.  There are over 1,600 people in receipt of carer&rsquo;s benefit and more than 70,000 people are in receipt of the annual respite care grant.</p></reply>

There were 71,000 young unemployed, on average, in the first nine months of 2012, made up of 20,000 aged 15-19 and 51,000 aged 20-24. Overall, the under-25 age group had an unemployment rate of 31% (41% for 15-19 year-olds and 29% for 20-24 year-olds). This compares to an unemployment rate of 13.8% for prime age workers (ages 25&#8211;54). Of particular concern is the continued increase in the share of youth unemployed who are out of work for more than one year. They now account for 41% of all youth unemployment.</p><p>  In the first instance, the Government&#8217;s primary strategy to tackle youth unemployment is to create the environment for a strong economic recovery by promoting competitiveness and productivity. Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth. Past experience suggests that youth unemployment, which tends to rise relatively rapidly in a downturn, can be expected to fall relatively rapidly during the recovery.  In addition to promoting economic recovery, the Government recognises the need for interim measures to support the young unemployed and keep young jobseekers close to the labour market. There are five main approaches being taken to tackle youth unemployment: education, training, job search assistance/guidance, work experience, and encouraging job creation.  These actions range across a number of Departments and Agencies.</p><p>  In terms of <b>education</b>, the Youthreach programme provides integrated education, training and work experience for unemployed early school leavers without any qualifications or vocational training who are between 15 and 20 years of age.  There are almost 6,000 places available nationwide under the Youthreach umbrella.  </p><p>The Vocational Training Opportunities Scheme (VTOS) scheme, operated through VECs, provides a range of courses to meet the education and training needs of unemployed people over 21 years of age (particularly early school leavers). The most recent data indicate that there are almost 1,000 participants on VTOS who are under 25 years of age.</p><p>  The Back to Education Allowance scheme run by my Department provides income maintenance, along with a contribution to education costs, for unemployed people returning to further or higher education. Over 6,500 young people participated in the BTEA in the last academic year.</p><p>  Approximately 12,000 persons aged under 25 completed a <b>training</b> course with F&Aacute;S in 2012 (excluding apprenticeships and evening courses). Training allowances on eligible courses exceed what a young person would receive in jobseekers&#8217; payments, providing an incentive to take up training programmes.</p><p>  In addition, in 2013 MOMENTUM, a scheme for education and training interventions, is part of the Government&#8217;s Action Plan for Jobs initiative and is currently being rolled out by the Department of Education.  MOMENTUM will support the provision of free education and training projects to allow 6,500 jobseekers (who are unemployed for 12 months or more) to gain skills and to access work opportunities in identified growing sectors. MOMENTUM will provide eligible jobseekers with</p><p> - Access to a range of quality education and training projects </p><p> - Links to identified job vacancies and employers</p><p> - Work placement and support</p><p> - Relevant industry and National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ ) Certification.</p><p>  Under the scheme, Labour Market Education and Training Fund (LMETF) funding is being utilised to provide education and training solutions nationwide to the needs of both unemployed individuals and employers within the context of four themes. The first three themes are based on 'clusters of occupations'. These have been chosen because there is evidence available which shows that these skills are associated with relatively good employment opportunities. Theme 4 is dedicated to under 25s and will provide a solid foundation for them to gain employment and/or continue in further education and training that will progress them into employment.</p><p>  In terms of <b>job search assistance</b>, some 25,500 young people registered with Employment Services in 2012, representing 36% of all registrants.  Registering with Employment Services gives job-seekers access to guidance interviews, job search assistance, and training courses, as well as self-service job-seeking options.</p><p>  Under the National Employment Action Plan (EAP) persons between the ages of 18 and 65 years who are approaching 3 months on the Live Register are identified by the Department of Social Protection and referred to Employment Services for interview with the aim of assisting them to enter/re-enter the labour market.  In 2012, there were some 33,000 referrals of under 25s to the EAP, affecting approximately 26,000 individual jobseekers (those who do not attend initially are referred again). Of those referred, 68% of clients had signed off the Live Register by the end of the year.<font color="#FF0000"> </font>The EAP process is being changed on a progressive basis across the country to one where referral will take place immediately on becoming unemployed for those identified, through profiling, as being at greatest risk of remaining unemployed for long periods.</p><p>  There are a number of schemes/programmes available that are focussed on <b>work experience.</b>  The most relevant for young people are JobBridge (the National Internship Scheme), and its predecessor the Work Placement Programme. Over 1,500 young people are currently participating on these schemes. The total number of placements of young people on JobBridge during 2012 was 2,700.</p><p>  The findings of the interim evaluation of JobBridge, The National Internship Scheme by Indecon International Economic Consultants (published &#8211; 5th October 2012) found that 61% of finishers secured employment within five months of completing their internship. These progression rates compare favourably with European averages in this area and represent very significant progress in a short period of time.  It is expected that the progression outcomes in respect of those &#8216;under 25&#8217; would be broadly in line with the 61% figure.</p><p>  A further breakdown of progression into employment by age category will be provided in the final Evaluation Report. In addition to the above this evaluation will assess the design, delivery and impact of the JobBridge Scheme and present recommendations on how the Scheme might be improved. It is at this stage that further consideration will be given to amending the terms and conditions of the Scheme.</p><p>  Young people will also continue to benefit from the reduced rate of employer&#8217;s PRSI, the purpose of which is to support job creation, as well as from the impact of Revenue Job Assist and the Employers PRSI Incentive Scheme.</p><p>  In terms of targets for reducing youth unemployment, the Pathways to Work initiative has specific targets for increasing the number of people who are long-term unemployed moving into employment and reducing the average length of time spent on the Live Register.  As two out of five young unemployed are long-term unemployed, these targets are pertinent to young people.</p><p>  Finally the European Commission has proposed a European-wide approach to a &#8220;youth guarantee&#8221; that is currently being discussed during Ireland's Presidency of the EU Council. The Commission&#8217;s proposals were published in December, and achieving political agreement on these proposals in the Council will be a major objective of Ireland&#8217;s Presidency in the first half of 2013.</p></reply>

Past experience suggests that, without such measures, long-term unemployment may fall more slowly than overall unemployment when strong economic growth returns.</p><p>  Given the scale of the unemployment crisis, the key objective of labour market policy and of the NEAP (National Employment Action Plan) is to keep those on the Live Register close to the labour market and prevent the drift into long-term unemployment. Persons from the Live Register availing of activation measures will get an opportunity to engage in employment, training and work experience and so be in a position to avail of employment opportunities as the economy improves. As such, the policy objective is to prioritise scarce resources on those on the Live Register so as to increase their chances of leaving it thereby ensuring a reduction in Exchequer costs over time.</p><p>  In this context, the major elements of the Government&#8217;s response are set out in the <b>Pathways to Work </b>policy which is aimed at ensuring that as many as possible of the job vacancies that are created are filled by people from the Live Register, with a particular focus on those who are long term unemployed or at risk of long-term unemployment.  </p><p><b>Pathways to Work</b></p><p>  The Pathways to Work policy and the establishment of the new integrated INTREO service will transform the nature and level of engagement between our employment and income support services and the unemployed.  The policy is underpinned by five core strands which reflect the new integrated employment and income support services which are currently being established.  Each of these strands places the customer at the centre of all the service&#8217;s activities, recognising their individual and specific needs.  The strands provide for:</p><p> - Transforming and reforming the employment and income support services institutions to deliver better services to the unemployed through an integrated approach.</p><p> - More regular and on-going engagement with people who are unemployed through active case management and profiling. There were almost 130,000 referrals of unemployed welfare recipients to the employment service in 2012.</p><p> - Greater targeting of activation places and opportunities by providing for over 85,000 places on initiatives such as Job Bridge &#8211; the National Internship Scheme, T&uacute;s, the Rural Social Scheme and the Jobs Initiative.</p><p> - Incentivising the take up of opportunities by the unemployed.</p><p> - Creating and enhancing relations with employers through incentivising the provision of opportunities for people who are unemployed.  A major initiative planned for 2013 will be the streamlining of the existing Revenue Job Assist and Employer PRSI schemes into a single easy to administer scheme that offers an attractive incentive to employers recruiting people who are long-term unemployed.</p><p>  The Pathways to Work policy sets very ambitious targets for the long-term unemployed to be achieved over the next three years:</p><p> - To ensure that 75,000 of those long term unemployed in 2012 will move into employment by 2015.</p><p> - To reduce the average time spent on the live register from 21 months to less than 12 months.</p><p> - To ensure that employers have access to and are offered suitable candidate to fill full time vacancies and that the proportion of vacancies filled by the Department&#8217;s employment services from the Live Register is at least to 40% by 2015.</p><p> - To ensure that each person in receipt of a jobseeker payment fulfils their personal responsibility to engage fully with the employment and training supports provided by the State as a pre-condition for recipe of their welfare payments.</p><p>  In addition to the new initiatives announced under the Pathways to Work programme, the Department also manages a number of schemes providing temporary employment for the long-term unemployed on works and services of value to the community. There are currently 26,000 people participating on Community Employment and T&uacute;s. As part of Budget 2013, the Government approved 10,000 new places across CE, T&Uacute;S, JobBridge and a new social employment scheme with the Local Authorities.  The Department also supports long-term unemployed people who create jobs through self-employment. Currently, about 12,000 people are being supported under the Back to Work Allowance scheme and the Short-term Enterprise Allowance scheme.</p><p><b>Education &amp; Training</b></p><p>  The Government has also taken various initiatives to allow those who are out of work to up-skill through the education and training system. The most prominent schemes in this regard are the Back to Education Allowance and the Springboard Initiative. There are almost 26,000 participants on the Back to Education Allowance scheme in the current academic year. Springboard offers a choice of free courses in higher education from certificate, to degree, to post-graduate level. All courses lead to qualifications in enterprise sectors which are growing and need skilled personnel. Participants on Springboard courses retain their social welfare payments.  Sixty-per cent of Springboard participants have been unemployed for more than twelve months and one third of those for more than 24 months. Over 3,500 people graduated from the first round of Springboard programmes, which were put in place in 2011, and an additional 6,000 places were made available for this academic year.</p><p>  The State is also providing a wide range of vocational training options outside of the mainstream education system that are closely aligned to the needs of the labour market. Specific Skills Training courses are employment-led and lead to qualifications that offer learners both generic and advanced skills. The expected outcomes are progression to employment in the occupational field or to further and higher education/training and the achievement of certification from levels 5 &#8211; 7 in the National Qualifications Framework.  The training system also provides Apprenticeships and Traineeships which entail significant skill requirements best acquired through a combination of alternating periods of on and off-the-job training.  There were some 27,000 participants on these three FAS programmes in 2011. The Government is prioritising places on training courses for those who have been on the Live Register for 12 months or more.</p><p>  In addition to these programmes, MOMENTUM, a scheme for education and training interventions specifically for the long-term unemployed, is currently being rolled out by the Department of Education.  MOMENTUM will support the provision of free education and training projects to allow 6,500 long-term unemployed to gain skills and to access work opportunities in identified growing sectors. MOMENTUM will provide the long-term unemployed with</p><p>-  Access to a range of quality education and training projects</p><p>-  Links to identified job vacancies and employers</p><p>-  Work placement and support</p><p>-  Relevant industry and National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ ) Certification.</p><p>  Under the scheme, Labour Market Education and Training Fund (LMETF) funding is being utilised to provide education and training solutions nationwide to the needs of both long-term unemployed and employers within the context of four themes. The first three themes are based on 'clusters of occupations'. These have been chosen because there is evidence available which shows that these skills are associated with relatively good employment opportunities. Theme 4 is dedicated to under 25s and will provide a solid foundation for them to gain employment and/or continue in further education and training that will progress them into employment</p><p><b>Policy Impact:</b></p><p>  The additional places being provided on a range of employment and education measures in 2013 will have a direct impact in providing opportunities for people who are currently long-term unemployed.  While there should be an impact in medium to long term in improving people&#8217;s probability of sustainable exit from the Live Register as a result of these measures, the impact is not quantifiable. However, we do have some preliminary evaluation of a significant component of Pathways to Work - the JobBridge Internship Scheme. The findings of the interim evaluation of JobBridge, the National Internship Scheme by Indecon International Economic Consultants, published in October 2012, found that 61% of finishers secured employment within five months of completing their internship. These progression rates compare favourably with European averages in this area and represent very significant progress in a short period of time.  Long-term unemployed made up 38% of participants covered by the evaluation.</p><p>  More generally, while it is clear that long-term unemployment remains stubbornly high, there has been a noticeable reduction in the inflow into long-term duration on the live register in the recent past. For example, the number of people unemployed for between one and two years fell from almost 80,000 in early 2011 to 55,000 at the end of 2012.However, many of those who became unemployed at the height of the jobs crisis in 2009 have found it particularly difficult to find employment. They are now a target priority group for activation measures.</p></reply>

Expenditure in 2013 is expected to be over &euro;189 million, compared to over &euro;77m in 2008.  Approximately 58% of people on BTEA are male and 42% are female.</p><p>  A number of measures in relation to the scheme were introduced in Budget 2013.  These were:</p><p> - the discontinuation of the up-rating of payments where a person was on a means reduced rate of a qualifying payment;</p><p> - reducing for new participants the up-rating from &euro;188 per week to &euro;160 where a person was on a reduced, age related rate of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance; and</p><p> - the discontinuation of the cost of education allowance.</p><p>  The first two measures I have outlined above apply to new entrants to the scheme from January and will not affect recipients who were in receipt of BTEA in 2012 or previous years.</p><p>  The BTEA scheme remains an attractive scheme for social welfare recipients who wish to further their education. A significant majority of those entering the scheme are in receipt of the maximum personal rate of payment of &euro;188 per week, in addition increases for qualified adults and children may also be payable.  This compares very favourably with other State funded supports for those pursuing education.   My Department is currently finalising a Social Impact Assessment of the main taxation and welfare changes announced in Budget 2013. This SIA will include an analysis of the distributive and poverty impacts of these changes on different family types as well as the impact on at risk of poverty levels.  I will be examining the analysis when it is finalised and I will give consideration to its publication at that stage.</p></reply>

The Department is not aware of any of the employees concerned having been made redundant to date.  Jobseeker's benefit is a weekly payment to people out of work and covered by social insurance.  To qualify for jobseeker's benefit a person must:</p><p> - be unemployed;</p><p> - be under 66 years of age;</p><p> - have enough social insurance contributions;</p><p> - be capable of work;</p><p> - be available for and genuinely seeking work; and</p><p> - have had a substantial loss of employment and as a result be unemployed for at least 3 days out of any 6.</p><p>  If a person does not qualify for jobseeker's benefit they may qualify for means tested jobseeker's allowance.  Where people are in a lay-off situation they may be regarded as unemployed and as having suffered a substantial loss of employment.  Subject to the general scheme criteria, workers would usually be entitled to claim jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit or allowance in such circumstances.</p><p>  Where an employee has been put in a lay-off situation or put on short-time working hours, or a mixture of both, either for four consecutive weeks or for a broken series of six weeks where all six weeks occur within a 13 week period, he/she can serve written notice to his/her employer stating his/her intention to claim a redundancy lump sum payment.  In these situations, an employer can, within seven days from the date of notice from the employee, give a counter notice by offering the employee not less than thirteen weeks unbroken employment commencing within 4 weeks of the employee serving notice.</p><p>  In the event that any of the employees concerned are eventually made redundant they may be eligible for a statutory redundancy payment under the Redundancy Payments Acts 1967 to 2012.   In order to be eligible for a statutory redundancy lump sum payment, an employee must:</p><p> - have at least two years continuous service;</p><p> - be in employment which is insurable under the Social Welfare Acts;</p><p> - be over the age of 16; and</p><p> - have been made redundant as a result of a genuine redundancy situation  meaning that the job no longer exists and he/she is not replaced.</p><p>  Under the scheme, an eligible employee is entitled to two weeks' pay for every year of service, plus a bonus week, subject to a gross weekly salary ceiling of &euro;600.</p><p>  It is the employer&rsquo;s responsibility to pay statutory redundancy payments in the first instance.  Where an employer can prove to the satisfaction of the Department that it is unable to pay statutory redundancy to its eligible employees the Department will make lump sum payments directly to those employees.  Such payments raise a debt against the employer which the Department will seek to recover.</p></reply>

Working part-time</p><p>2. Willing to work additional hours</p><p>3. Available to work additional hours.</p><p>  There has been a significant rise in the numbers classified as underemployed in recent years, with the latest figures showing almost 148,000 people, 1 in 3 part-time workers being classified as such by the CSO. The main factor driving this rise in underemployment is the same factor that has been the main cause of the unemployment problem, namely weak labour demand. Similarly, the approach to reducing underemployment is the same as reducing unemployment. In the first instance, the Government&#8217;s primary strategy to tackle both unemployment and underemployment is to create the environment for a strong economy recovery by promoting competitiveness and productivity through the <b><i>Action Plan for Jobs</i></b>. Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth.</p><p>  In addition to promoting economic recovery, the Government recognises the need for interim measures until labour demand recovers. These intervention measures involve both activation measures and income support. In many cases the activation measures contained in Pathways to Work and outlined in response to parliamentary questions on tackling long-term unemployment are also of relevance to tackling underemployment. The activation measures of particular relevance to counteracting underemployment are those that incentivise employers to give full-time jobs to persons who are currently on the Live Register (including the underemployed) &#8211; most notably the Employers PRSI Incentive and the Revenue Job Assist Scheme (which is the responsibility of the Revenue Commissioners).</p><p>  Additionally, the Part-Time Job Incentive (PTJI) Scheme is intended as a stepping stone to full-time work partly in recognition of the reality of underemployment. It allows certain long-term unemployed people to take up part-time work and get a special weekly allowance instead of their jobseeker&#8217;s payment. Recipients of the Part-Time Job Incentive Scheme must be available for and seeking full-time work while getting the payment.</p><p>  Finally, the Department provides income support via Jobseekers Benefit/Jobseekers Allowance to the underemployed to supplement their earned income, provided a person is working no more than 3 days a week. In addition, jobseekers payments paid in conjunction with such periods of casual employment may now count towards satisfying the 6 month qualifying period for access to the JobBridge Internship programme.</p></reply>

The aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer. There are approximately 88,000 persons in receipt of rent supplement for which the Government has provided a sum of &euro;403 million for 2013.  Approximately 48,700 rent supplement claims were awarded during 2012 throughout the country, proving that private landlords are accommodating people under the scheme and that recipients are sourcing accommodation in their localities.</p><p>  The timescale for determining individual applications for rent supplement is dependent, among other things, on the availability of the required information, such as details of the applicant&rsquo;s income, bank statements, information from landlords, etc. In addition, some aspects of the applications are inevitably time consuming and delays can occur where further investigations or third party evidence is required.  Delays can also arise if the applicant is slow to respond to requests for additional information. The Department&rsquo;s units responsible for rent supplement applications in the Kildare area generally process them within 2 days of receipt where all the necessary information has been supplied.</p><p>  If the Deputy has a concern in relation to processing times in a particular area or in respect of an individual, she should provide this detail to the Department for follow up.

It must also be noted that the employer in this situation is the sponsoring organisation and not F&Aacute;S (or the Department of Social Protection, which now have responsibility for CE).  </p><p>  The annual cost of introducing a defined contribution scheme for CE Supervisors was estimated at &euro;3.75m in 2008. Therefore, in line with good accrual accounting practice, a one-year provision for the pension claim was made in the F&Aacute;S accounts should the debt materialise. This was prior to discussions with the Department of Finance, the Department of Enterprise, Trade &amp; Employment and the CE Supervisors&rsquo; Union Representatives. No subsequent provisions were made following these discussions.  </p><p>  The method of accounting used in F&Aacute;S is the Accrual Accounting method which recognises potential economic events regardless of when the actual cash transaction occurs. This meant that the accrual of &euro;3.75m in 2008 for CE supervisor pensions was simply a provision for an event that may occur (i.e. no actual cash was transacted). After transfer of responsibility for the Community Employment programme to the Department of Social Protection in October 2010 this accrual had to be reversed as the Department of Social Protection works under the Cash Accounting method. This was carried out in the 2011 accounts for CE, as recorded in the published document.</p></reply>

SWA may be payable to customers awaiting the outcome of a claim or an appeal for a primary social welfare or Health Service Executive payment. The practice  is that payments issued under the SWA scheme are fully recouped, where possible, from the primary social welfare scheme on award.  Scheme conditions, such as payment waiting days, may affect full recovery in some instances.  Due to the nature of the scheme and the high level of customer churn, it is not possible to provide the statistics requested by the Deputy. The compilation of these figures would require individual tracking of each customer&rsquo;s claim for a specified period.</p><p>  I can, however, assure the Deputy that the Department has introduced a number of measures which, when combined, will reduce the recourse to SWA. These include the transfer of the Community Welfare Service from the Health Service Executive to the Department on 1st October 2011 with the purpose of providing a streamlined, consistent and enhanced service to the customer. The process of integration is on-going and progress has already been made with a new unified service, Intreo, now in the process of being delivered across all local offices.  A significant feature of the new Intreo service is an integrated decisions team comprising deciding officers, community welfare service staff and investigators which has enabled decisions on primary payments for jobseekers to be made within a short time and has resulted in reduced recourse to a SWA payment.</p><p>  Significant efforts are also being made in the processing of illness related schemes with additional temporary staff having being assigned to the area, the recent completion of a major service delivery modernisation project and an in-depth business process improvement project having commenced with the aim of eliminating backlogs and improving customer service.  Significant resources and efforts have also been put into reducing volumes and improving processing times for appellants to the Social Welfare Appeals Office, including the assignment of 15 additional Appeals Officers.</p></reply>

The package is primarily available to older people, people with disabilities and carers.  The allocation for the telephone allowance scheme has been reduced in 2013 as a cost saving measure. The estimated expenditure outturn on the telephone allowance in 2012 is &euro;113 million compared with projected expenditure for 2013 of &euro;48 million. As a result the monthly allowance will fall from &euro;22.60 to &euro;9.50, a reduction of 58%.</p><p>  The number in receipt of telephone allowance has increased significantly in recent years, in line with increases in customers receiving qualifying payments, as well as the increases in those aged over 70.  In 2005 there were 311,000 customers in receipt of telephone allowance; in 2012 there were 397,000, an increase of 28% over seven years.  Over the last three years the numbers have increased on average by 9,000 per year.  At the same time the market has been transformed with deregulation, mobile services and bundled services including television, broadband and telephone.  It makes the former notion of an allowance covering handset rental, standing charges and a number of calls somewhat outdated.  There is a wide variety of deals available.  For example, it is possible to get a standard pay-as-you-go brand name mobile telephone for as little as &euro;19.99.</p><p>  I am aware that any reduction in social welfare payments or benefits is difficult.  However, to allow the Government to protect the core payments which people receive such as pensions, disability payments and carer&rsquo;s allowance, we had to look very carefully at other additional payments such as the household benefits package.</p></reply>

I am happy that the actions they are taking will achieve this.</p><p>  Following the completion of a major modernisation project, an in-depth business process improvement (BPI) project was completed for the carer&rsquo;s allowance scheme.  This project focused on optimising output and customer service and the reduction of backlogs. This has resulted in a significant increase in the number of new claims processed in recent months where claims processed have substantially exceeded claim intake.

No body under the aegis of the Department has been amalgamated or abolished in 2012.  The Public Service Reform Programme provides for a critical review of the Pensions Board with a view to integrating the regulatory functions of the Pensions Board with the Financial Regulator.  The Public Service Reform Programme also provides for a critical review of the Pensions Ombudsman with a view to a merger with the Financial Services Ombudsman.  The Critical Review Group, established to carry out the reviews announced under the Public Service Reform Programme, is finalising a draft report with recommendations.  The report will identify any potential savings arising from such an amalgamation.  I expect to receive the final report from the Group in the very near future.  Following receipt of this report, decisions in relation to reform, including legislation changes required, if any, will be taken.</p></reply>

In this particular case, I understand that a review process was underway when the claimant advised the Department in June, 2012 that she required her payment to be made into a bank account as she was going abroad to care for an ill relative.  The review undertaken and the termination of her claim was not connected with her need to care for the ill relative abroad: her payment was suspended in July because she failed to reply to the Department&rsquo;s correspondence.</p><p>  The person concerned was interviewed at home by a Social Welfare Inspector in September, 2012 and was requested to provide certain documentation in support of her continued entitlement. This was not provided and she was written to again in November and advised that failure to supply all the information sought would cause the termination of her claim. As all the documentation requested was not received, the customer was advised in December, 2012 of the decision to terminate her payment.  She was also advised of the right to appeal this decision.</p></reply>

Approximately half of these persons (53,000) stated that they previously worked in a trade, over 10,000 previously worked as plant and machinery operatives, and some 1,500 previously worked as architects, town planners or surveyors.  The remainder have no stated occupation within construction.  </p><p>  The Pathways to Work policy and the establishment of the new integrated National Employment and Entitlement Service (Intreo) service will transform the nature and level of engagement between our employment and income support services and the unemployed.  The Pathways to Work approach involves more regular and on-going engagement with people who are unemployed through active case management and profiling. These policies apply to former construction workers in the same way as for other unemployed workers.</p><p>  There are various initiatives to allow those who are out of work to up-skill through the education and training system. The most prominent schemes in this regard are the range of training programmes provided by F&Aacute;S, the Back to Education Allowance, the Springboard Initiative and MOMENTUM.  Some 24,000 people commenced full-time F&Aacute;S courses for unemployed adults in 2012, and a further 21,000 undertook F&Aacute;S evening courses. F&Aacute;S offers a wide range of training programmes in the areas of energy efficiency and sustainable sources of energy that are of potential relevance to former construction workers. These include oil-fired appliance servicing; domestic gas installation; domestic solar hot water systems; domestic thermal insulation; air tightness testing and measurement; insulation; passive house building envelope; passive house construction; heat recovery mechanical systems and overhead line worker.  F&Aacute;S also offers training in traditional stone building following an increase in demand from householders and local authorities for persons qualified in these traditional skills. </p><p>  F&Aacute;S is increasing its training provision in sustainable technologies in response to an anticipated increase in demand for these types of skills. New courses include intelligent building control systems; small scale wind systems implementation; micro solar photo voltaic systems; large scale wind turbine technician; and sustainable waste management.  In recent years, following the collapse of the construction industry, almost 7,000 of a population of roughly 28,000 apprentices were made redundant. Under the Redundant Apprentice Placement scheme, F&Aacute;S places redundant apprentices with reputable employers to enable them to complete the on-the-job components (phases 3, 5, and 7) of their apprenticeship and thus qualify for the National Craft Award.  For the year 2012/13, there were 25,800 participants on the Back to Education Allowance scheme.  </p><p>  Springboard offers a choice of free courses in higher education from certificate, to degree, to post-graduate level. Some 6,000 places are available for this academic year.  Sixty-per cent of Springboard participants have been unemployed for more than twelve months and one third of those for more than 24 months. At just under 20% of the total, people previously employed in the construction sector accounted for the largest single group of participants on the first series of Springboard courses launched in 2011.</p><p>  MOMENTUM, a scheme for education and training interventions, is part of the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Jobs initiative and is currently being rolled out by the Department of Education and Science through F&Aacute;S.  MOMENTUM will support the provision of free education and training projects to allow 6,500 jobseekers (who are unemployed for 12 months or more) to gain skills and to access work opportunities in identified growing sectors. MOMENTUM will provide eligible jobseekers with</p><p> - Access to a range of quality education and training projects </p><p>  - Links to identified job vacancies and employers</p><p>  - Work placement and support</p><p>  - Relevant industry and National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ ) Certification.</p><p>  Under the scheme, Labour Market Education and Training Fund (LMETF) funding is being utilised to provide education and training solutions nationwide to the needs of both unemployed individuals and employers within the context of four themes. The first three themes are based on 'clusters of occupations'. These have been chosen because there is evidence available which shows that these skills are associated with relatively good employment opportunities.</p></reply>

Overpayments are generally defined as money obtained contrary to or in excess of a valid decision.  Most overpayments arise as a result of a revised decision regarding entitlement. Deciding officers decide the effective date of a revised decision having regard to the new facts or new evidence and the circumstances of the case. An overpayment is assessed for the period that a client was not entitled to a payment and the recovery of the overpayment is followed up by the relevant section of the Department.</p><p>The Department has comprehensive control strategies in place across the various scheme areas which are designed to control fraud and abuse and minimise overpayments.  Where overpayments do occur, it is the Department&rsquo;s policy is to actively pursue the recovery of debt in order to maximise recovery levels, with due regard to value for money.  Current measures to control fraud and abuse and minimise overpayments include desk reviews of claim papers, home visits, the issue of mail-shots to selected customers, database checking, and medical reviews in the case of illness payments.</p><p>Controls are exercised at both the initial claim stage and at subsequent stages during the claim life cycle. Claims are reviewed on a regular and targeted basis. Means tested payments are reviewed at certain intervals or when there are indications of changes in circumstances. Those in receipt of illness payments are called for a medical examination by the Department's medical assessors. Customers in receipt of unemployment payments are checked on an on-going basis to verify continued compliance with such requirements as being available for and genuinely seeking employment.  In general, the main causes of overpayments recorded are means/income not disclosed and concurrently working and claiming.  The value of overpayments recorded from 2007 to 2011 are set out below.</p><p><table><tr><th><div>Scheme</div></th><th><div>&#8364;m's 2007</div></th><th><div>&#8364;m's 2008</div></th><th><div>&#8364;m's 2009</div></th><th><div>&#8364;m's 2010</div></th><th><div>&#8364;m's 2011</div></th></tr><tr><td>Illness Benefit</td><td><div>&#8364;2.41</div></td><td><div>&#8364;3.28</div></td><td><div>&#8364;3.79</div></td><td><div>&#8364;4.09</div></td><td><div>&#8364;3.99</div></td></tr><tr><td>Jobseekers Benefit</td><td><div>&#8364;7.16</div></td><td><div>&#8364;8.03</div></td><td><div>&#8364;7.02</div></td><td><div>&#8364;6.71</div></td><td><div>&#8364;5.86</div></td></tr><tr><td>State Pension Contributory</td><td><div>&#8364;3.54</div></td><td><div>&#8364;3.48</div></td><td><div>&#8364;5.02</div></td><td><div>&#8364;10.16</div></td><td><div>&#8364;6.73</div></td></tr><tr><td>Carers Allowance</td><td><div>&#8364;0.38</div></td><td><div>&#8364;2.05</div></td><td><div>&#8364;4.37</div></td><td><div>&#8364;3.91</div></td><td><div>&#8364;3.06</div></td></tr><tr><td>Child Benefit</td><td><div>&#8364;2.49</div></td><td><div>&#8364;3.23</div></td><td><div>&#8364;5.98</div></td><td><div>&#8364;7.01</div></td><td><div>&#8364;4.85</div></td></tr><tr><td>Jobseekers Allowance</td><td><div>&#8364;10.40</div></td><td><div>&#8364;8.91</div></td><td><div>&#8364;7.57</div></td><td><div>&#8364;12.01</div></td><td><div>&#8364;16.61</div></td></tr><tr><td>One Parent Family Payment</td><td><div>&#8364;4.66</div></td><td><div>&#8364;8.63</div></td><td><div>&#8364;9.55</div></td><td><div>&#8364;8.01</div></td><td><div>&#8364;11.77</div></td></tr><tr><td>State Pension Non Contributory</td><td><div>&#8364;7.44</div></td><td><div>&#8364;7.84</div></td><td><div>&#8364;11.70</div></td><td><div>&#8364;12.09</div></td><td><div>&#8364;12.79</div></td></tr><tr><td>Other Schemes</td><td><div>&#8364;12.04</div></td><td><div>&#8364;10.13</div></td><td><div>&#8364;11.81</div></td><td><div>&#8364;19.43</div></td><td><div>&#8364;26.69</div></td></tr><tr><td>TOTALS</td><td><div>&#8364;50.52</div></td><td><div>&#8364;55.58</div></td><td><div>&#8364;66.81</div></td><td><div>&#8364;83.42</div></td><td><div>&#8364;92.35</div></td></tr></table></p><p>The Department is not in a position to publicly comment on overpayments recorded in 2012 as these figures form part of the statutory accounts of the Department and are currently the subject of an audit by the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p></reply>

As part of the budget measures to provide 10,000 additional work placement, internship and training programmes places, a further 2,500 placements will be made available under T&uacute;s over the coming months.  As a new initiative, T&uacute;s continues to be monitored and developed by my Department.  While the Department has no firm proposal to conduct a review of the effectiveness of this initiative as yet, it is likely that an evaluation of the initiative will be undertaken beginning later in 2013.

The aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer.  There are approximately 88,000 persons in receipt of rent supplement for which the Government has provided a sum of &euro;403 million for 2013.  Revised rent limits are in place since January 2012 and are applicable to all new rent supplement tenancies from this date and existing tenancies on review.  These limits were set after an analysis of the most up to date market data available.  The emphasis of the rent limit review was to ensure that maximum value for money was obtained whilst at the same time ensuring that people on rent supplement are not priced out of the market for private rented accommodation.  Approximately 48,700 rent supplement claims were awarded during 2012, showing that accommodation can be secured within the new limits. </p><p>  As part of the rent limit review, all major urban population centres were tested to ensure that rent supplement applicants can access temporary housing arrangements whilst seeking employment opportunities.  On-going analysis shows that for the eastern counties of Dublin, Meath, Kildare and Wicklow there are properties available within the maximum rent limits for rent supplement recipients.  Over 41,500 persons in receipt of rent supplement, representing almost half of the customer base, reside in these counties. Officials in the Department continue to examine the impact of the rent limits on those who claim rent supplement and continue to ensure that accommodation needs for recipients can be met. The next review of rent limits will take place before June 2013 and any changes to the existing limits will be considered as part of this review.  </p><p>  On 27 March 2012, the Government approved, in principle, to transfer responsibility for the provision of rental assistance to persons with a long-term housing need from this Department to housing authorities using a new Housing Assistance Payment (HAP).  The Department has been advised that pilot testing of HAP will commence in selected counties during the second half of 2013 and a general roll out of HAP from early January 2014.  This initiative, along with the on-going rental accommodation scheme, should reduce the numbers of persons who are in receipt of long term rent supplement as they are transferred to local authority housing sponsored solutions.</p></reply>

Addressing the demographic challenges of more people living longer and the impact on the cost of pensions lies behind the current pension reform measures.  It is a fundamental principle of our social insurance system that those qualifying for benefits must satisfy a range of contribution and other conditions.  The recent State pension reform measures, outlined below, support the direct link between contributions made and the rate of pension received which underpins State pension policy.  Aligning the rate of pension with the contribution made by the person ensures that those who contribute more during a working life benefit more in retirement. </p><p>  Recent State pension reform measures are as follows:</p><p>-  As provided for in legislation in 1997, the number of paid contributions required for State pension increased from 260 paid contributions to 520 paid contributions with effect from April 2012.</p><p>-  As provided for in legislation in 2011, State pension transition will cease from 2014, standardising  pension age at 66. </p><p>-  As provided for in legislation in 2011, State pension age will be increased to 67 in 2021 and 68 in 2028.  </p><p>-  New rate bands for State pension were introduced in September 2012, aligning rate of pension paid with contributions paid.  The new rates are available at .</p><p>-  A further planned change in 2020 is a move to a &#8216;total contributions approach&#8217;.  This will be adopted to replace the current averaging system.  The level of pension paid will be directly proportionate to the number of social insurance contributions made by a person over his or her working life.  This will remove the current anomaly whereby some people qualify for higher pension payments even though they have fewer contributions (but a higher average) than others who do not qualify, or qualify for a lower pension, due to the average contributions test.  It is also planned to cap the number of credits that an individual can avail of to 10 years.

The Homemaker scheme comprises a period of disregard when calculating eligibility for a State pension so time taken out of the work, for those who qualify for the scheme, can be disregarded when assessment is being made for State pension.  The scheme was introduced in and took effect from 1994 and allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age or incapacitated adults to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes.  It impacts on women in particular as it assists them to qualify for a State pension (contributory) by recognising periods spent caring for children or incapacitated persons.  </p><p>  The homemaker disregard will not, of itself, qualify a person for a pension.  Eligibility for the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme is conditional on firstly meeting the standard qualifying conditions for State pension, which require a person to enter insurance ten years before pension age, pay a minimum of 520 contributions at the correct rate and achieve a yearly average of at least 10 contributions on their record from the time they enter insurance until they reach pension age, must also be satisfied.  </p><p>  The State pension is a very valuable benefit and is the bedrock of the Irish pension system.  Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  The Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund published in 2012 examines the extent to which individuals receive value for money from the Fund in respect of their own and their employer&rsquo;s contributions.   The Review finds that those with short contribution histories fare better than those with full contribution histories and also that the Fund provides better value to female rather than male contributors. </p></reply>

The Department has comprehensive control strategies in place across its various scheme areas which are designed to control fraud and abuse and to minimise overpayments.  Where overpayments do occur, it is the Department&rsquo;s policy is to actively pursue the recovery of debt in order to maximise overall recovery levels, with due regard to value for money.  The number and value of overpayments across the various social welfare payments in 2010 and 2011 are as follows:</p><p><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Number of cases </th><th>Value of overpayment</th></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>52,600</td><td>&#8364;83.4m</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>63,330 </td><td>&#8364;92.4m</td></tr></table></p><p>Overpayments raised by the Department are categorised as &lsquo;Fraud&rsquo;, &lsquo;Non-Fraud&rsquo; or &lsquo;Estate&rsquo; cases.   Estate cases arise where undisclosed means by customers (usually pensioners) come to light after their deaths.  Non-fraud cases are primarily due to customer or third party error, with some due to departmental error.   Fraud cases arise mainly on foot of false declarations by customers concerning their employment, income and/or family status.  The 2011 overpayments raised were categorised as follows:</p><p><table><tr><th> -</th><th><div>Suspected Fraud</div></th><th><div>Customer Error</div></th><th><div>Departmental Error</div></th><th><div>Estate</div></th><th><div>Total</div></th></tr><tr><td><div>2011 overpayments</div></td><td><div>&#8364;34.9m</div></td><td><div>&#8364;40.5m</div></td><td><div>&#8364;5.5m</div></td><td><div>&#8364;11.5m</div></td><td><div>&#8364;92.4m</div></td></tr></table></p><p>The Department is not in a position to publicly report on overpayments recorded in 2012 as these figures form part of the statutory accounts of the Department and are currently subject to audit by the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p></reply>

The simplification and reduction of application forms complements the introduction of more streamlined processes.  The key principles underpinning the design of the Department&#8217;s application forms are the use of clear and simple language, with consistent layout and presentation across both online and paper forms.  All primary application forms are designed to facilitate the use of scanning and automated processing.  This ensures that the application is processed as efficiently as possible and that customers receive their entitlement in a timely manner.  Primary application forms are regularly reviewed to ensure they request only the information required to establish the customer&#8217;s entitlement, in a clear and easy to understand manner.</p><p>  Staff in the Department&#8217;s local and branch offices and Intreo centres provide information and guidance to customers on the completion of application forms when required.  In addition, the Citizens Information Board, through its network of offices around the State provides information, advice and advocacy services to members of the public on a wide range of public and social services, including assistance in completing application forms.  All primary application forms are also available on the Department's website, .  Applications for a number of schemes, i.e. child benefit, State pension (contributory), widow(er)&#8217;s or surviving civil partner&#8217;s contributory pension, household benefits and, in certain cases, jobseeker&#8217;s payments, can be completed and submitted online.  </p><p>  The objective is to enable people to access services at a time and place that best suits their needs.  The use of online application forms reduces the administrative burden for the customer and facilitates efficient processing of claims by the Department.   I am satisfied that the ongoing initiatives underway in the Department,  the improvements to processes and procedures supported by the redesign of application forms, and the Department&#8217;s use of modern technology will continue to deliver an improved and efficient service to customers.</p></reply>

The Gate 3 Direction to System Operators (CER/08/260) published in December 2008 set out the list of projects to receive grid connection offers.  As explained in the Direction, Gate 3 was designed to ensure the 40% target for renewable electricity (RES-E) by 2020 could be achieved and this was based on an assumption that 5800MW of renewable generation would be required.  Gate 3 followed Gate 1 and Gate 2 and provided for additional grid connection offers totalling almost 4000MW.  Since then, due to changes in economic conditions, SEAI estimated for the First Progress Report on the National Renewable Energy Action Plan (NREAP) that the amount of MW needed to meet 40% RES-E has fallen to approximately 4000MW.</p><p>  Gate 3 grid connection offers were issued between December 2009 and mid-2011. All offers have now issued and to date, there has been approximately 10% take up.  The low take-up to date is primarily due to a delay in technical market decisions from the All Island SEM Committee. I am concerned about this delay and its potential impact on meeting our renewable energy targets.  I understand that the key decisions will be made shortly by the SEM committee.  This should bring clarity to the situation in relation to the take up rate of Gate 3 connection offers and which projects intend to proceed to build. I expect that the outcome will be that there is still sufficient capacity in Gate 3 to ensure that our 40% RES-E target can be met.  The matter will, however, be kept under ongoing review.</p><p>  The implementation of Gate 3 requires a significant amount of grid build and grid upgrade, which will be challenging to achieve in the period to 2020. EirGrid&rsquo;s Grid 25 implementation plans are designed around building the necessary grid and upgrading the grid as necessary, in order to build the necessary grid to underpin the Gate 3 grid connection offers and to deliver on our 2020 targets.  Any decision on a potential future Gate will have to be considered in the context of the SEM committee processes already underway.</p><p>  In terms of the cost of grid connections, costs will vary by project connecting, in line with the &ldquo;shallow connection&rdquo; principle.  The National Renewable Energy Action Plan (NREAP) available on my Department&rsquo;s website www.dcenr.gov.ie explains the processes that are in place.  The rules outlining cost sharing and bearing of network technical adaptations are published by EirGrid and approved by the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER.) The capital costs of connection and technical adaptation are divided between producers, transmission and distribution system operators using a methodology based on a version of the &ldquo;shallow connection&rdquo; principle.  This means that the costs of the immediate connection assets to the network are borne by the connecting producer while the costs of additional reinforcement of the surrounding base network are recovered through a tariff imposed on all users of the system.  This costing mechanism has evolved from a number of CER decisions over a number of years.  The relevant rules outlined are based on objective, transparent and non-discriminatory criteria.  The DSO (ESB Network) document &lsquo;Standard Prices for Generators 2010&rsquo; provides details and descriptions of standard connection building blocks and may be viewed at:</p></reply>

In terms of telecommunications policy, my Department plays a key role in providing a supportive legislative and regulatory environment within which competition can flourish and private sector investment can take place.</p><p>  The telecommunications market in Ireland has been fully liberalised since 1999 and, since then, has seen the steady growth and development of vibrant well-regulated competition in the provision of the full range of telecommunications products and services. The Government is not a player in this market and can only intervene in cases of clear market failure.  It has, in the past, undertaken, following EU State aid clearance, a number of initiatives to bring broadband to those parts of the country where operators have been unable to offer services on a commercial basis.  State investment in the Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs) and the National Broadband Scheme (NBS) are examples of such interventions.</p><p>  With basic broadband services widely available across Ireland, the focus is now on accelerating the roll out of high speed services.  The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August last, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed services of at least 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses, including those located in Gaeltacht areas.  During the preparation of the National Broadband Plan, the commercial market operators indicated that they expect to provide 70Mbps to 100Mbps services to 50% of the population by 2015.  The areas to be provided with those services will be determined by the commercial market operators.</p><p>  My Department is making preparations to commence a formal national mapping exercise to determine the exact position in relation to commercial service providers&rsquo; existing and planned broadband services throughout the country.  This exercise will identify where the market is expected to succeed and fail in the delivery of high speed broadband over the coming years and will therefore inform the level of Government interaction that may be required and the areas that need to be targeted.</p><p>  It will also form a critical input to an EU State Aids application in respect of any intervention.  I would reiterate that the Government remains committed to ensuring that all parts of Ireland, including Gaeltacht areas, will have at least 30Mbps connectivity, through public or private sector investment as outlined in the National Broadband Plan.  In specific regard to &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, my Department had had no request on this issue from the agency but would be happy to meet &Uacute;dar&aacute;s officials to discuss its concerns.  Contact will be made to set up such a meeting.</p></reply>

The National Renewable Energy Action Plan sets out the planned trajectory for achieving the target across the electricity, heat and transport sectors with 40% needed in electricity, 10% in transport and 12% in heat to meet Ireland&rsquo;s overall 16% commitment.</p><p>  Renewable energy is being supported by a variety of policy initiatives.  Renewable electricity is now the largest contributor to renewable energy consumption and is expected to contribute most to our 2020 target.  The largest contribution in the electricity sector is expected to be made through generation from wind technologies, followed by biomass technologies.  For the support of commercial renewable generation, my Department administers a renewable energy support mechanism known as the Renewable Energy Feed in Tariff (REFIT).  The terms and conditions of REFIT are available on the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources&rsquo; website.</p><p>  The feed in tariff or REFIT scheme underpins investment in renewable energy to meet Ireland&rsquo;s legally binding renewable target, by providing sufficient certainty to developers to finance projects through guarantee of a minimum price for wind exported to the grid over a 15 year period.  Research by the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI), shows that wind acts as a hedge against high fossil fuel prices.</p></reply>

The Irish oil industry is fully privatised, liberalised and deregulated and there is free entry to the market.  Increases in oil prices arise primarily from increases in the international commodity prices over which Ireland has no control.  For example, the spot price of a barrel of Brent Crude Oil has risen from a low of US$90 in June 2012 to US$111 in January 2013.  This has inevitably resulted in an increase in retail oil prices.  Upward trends in global oil prices underscores the Government&rsquo;s commitment to delivering national energy efficiency and renewable energy objectives, which are aimed at moving the economy away from reliance on imported, carbon intensive fossil fuels such as oil.</p><p>  The electrification of transport offers huge potential for Ireland, not just in terms of energy efficiency but also because of the ability to use cheaper electricity, an increasing amount of which will be sourced from renewable resources as we progressively deliver on our ambitious target of 40% renewable generation by 2020.  In addition, the Biofuel Obligation Scheme incentivises and enables the sustainable growth of an Irish biofuels market affording opportunities for indigenous biofuel producers and allowing for the displacement of traditional oil products in the transport sector.  The Statutory Biofuel Obligation Scheme was introduced in July 2010 and currently requires that the amount of biofuel brought to the market is not less than 4.166% of the relevant disposal of petroleum road transport fuels.  The scheme ensured that 144.5 million litres of biofuel were brought to the Irish market in 2011.</p><p>  I am very aware that many households are experiencing financial hardship due to the current economic difficulties.  As such, the Government is taking a range of actions to address the challenge of affordable energy for vulnerable households.  Over the last ten years &euro;2 billion has been distributed in energy supports under the National Fuel Scheme and the Household Benefits Package administered by the Department of Social Protection.  In addition, &euro;100 million has been spent, from my own Department&rsquo;s Vote, on energy efficiency improvements in vulnerable homes.  Permanent improvements to the thermal efficiency of houses are the most cost-effective means of addressing energy poverty.</p><p>  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) administers on behalf of my Department, the Better Energy Warmer Homes Scheme, which is free-of-charge to eligible applicants.  With over 93,000 homes refurbished to date, 2013 will see approximately 10,000 low-income households benefit from energy efficiency upgrades.  I have allocated approximately &euro;20 million to the Warmer Homes Scheme in 2013.</p><p>  More generally, the Government&rsquo;s Strategy for Affordable Energy in Ireland was launched by me in November 2011.  The Strategy sets out our plans for enhancing the affordability of energy for low-income households.  The strategy includes 48 actions that will be implemented over the life of the Strategy.  Delivery on these commitments will progressively reduce our dependence on imported fossil fuels such as oil, while supporting energy competitiveness and security.</p></reply>

A transition team has been established to give effect to the transfer of the DHDA to DCC and administrative arrangements are being put in place, pending legislation being completed.  This merger is expected to yield short term savings of approximately &euro;400k, which amounts to over 20% of the Exchequer current subvention.</p><p>  In addition, the Government also announced further proposed mergers, which include provision for the Ordnance Survey of Ireland, which is also under the aegis of my Department, to merge with the Valuation Office and Property Registration Authority.  The lead Department in relation to this rationalisation is the Department of Justice and Equality. The merger potentially provides an opportunity for more efficient and cost-effective delivery of land and property administration services.  Savings are likely to be achievable in the areas of common back office functions such as HR, conventional (non-specialised) IT systems, Financial Management and Corporate Services.  There may also be potential savings in the areas of accommodation and software licences.  There is also provision for the back-office administrative functions of the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg) to be merged with the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI).  I would advise the Deputy that neither BAI nor ComReg is Exchequer funded and as a result any savings achieved would not directly impact on the Exchequer.</p></reply>

The scheme of performance related payments referred to by the Deputy dates from when the CER was set up in 1999, and was subject to the approval of the then Department of Public Enterprise and the Department of Finance at that time.</p><p>  The reduction in the pay of civil servants in December 2009, introduced as part of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act, 2009, included the termination of the scheme of performance-related awards previously applicable to Deputy Secretary and Assistant Secretary grades.  Accordingly, the scheme of performance-related awards was terminated in the CER for similar grades at Director level in 2010.  CER Commissioners never received performance related payments.  Staff of CER have been subject to reductions in pay in accordance with the FEMPI No 2 Act.</p><p>  CER has continued to operate a performance related pay scheme for staff below the level of Director.  The responsibility for conditions of employment of staff other than Chief Executives, is a matter for senior management and Boards (or in this case the Commissioners) of the State Company or organisation concerned.  I would expect that their decisions in this regard would take into account general government policy on pay determination.  I have requested the Commission to reply directly to you on the matters raised in your question with particular reference to the specific categories of information you have requested.  I am also aware that this matter was raised at the recent meeting of the Public Accounts Committee with the CER and that the CER is in the process of providing further detail to the Committee, in line with its request.</p></reply>

During the preparation of the National Broadband Plan, the commercial market operators indicated that they expect to provide 70Mbps to 100Mbps services to 50% of the population by 2015.  The areas to be provided with those services will be determined by the commercial market operators.</p><p>  My Department is making preparations to commence a formal national mapping exercise to determine the exact position in relation to commercial service providers&rsquo; existing and planned broadband services throughout the country.  It will also identify where the market is expected to succeed and fail in the delivery of high speed broadband over the coming years and will therefore inform the level of Government intervention that may be required.  It will also form a critical input to an EU State Aids application in respect of any intervention.  Until that process is complete, the precise areas of the country which will require State intervention to deliver on the commitments in the Plan will not be known.  I would reiterate however, that the Government remains committed to ensuring that all parts of Ireland, including Kilcoole, County Wicklow, will have at least 30Mbps connectivity.</p></reply>

Under the Act, an owner of a residential property on the liability date was liable to pay the Household Charge, unless otherwise exempted or entitled to claim a waiver. It is a matter for an owner of a residential property to determine liability and pay the Charge. The Local Government Management Agency is administering the Household Charge system on a shared service/agency basis for all county and city councils.</p><p>  A liable person is entitled to a waiver from payment of the Household Charge in two circumstances. If a person is entitled to receipt of mortgage interest supplement towards the amount of mortgage interest payable by him or her in respect of that property, he or she is entitled to a waiver. A person who owns a property situated in a category 3 or category 4 unfinished housing estate, listed in the schedule to the Local Government (Household Charge) Regulations 2012, is also entitled to a waiver in respect of that property.</p><p>  I am advised by the Agency that, as of 25 January 2013, 22,954 properties have been registered by applicants seeking a waiver. Each application for a Household Charge waiver is checked and verified by the Agency.  I am advised by the Agency that, as of 25 January 2013, there have been 1,394 unfinished housing estate waiver applications and 1,340 mortgage interest supplement waiver applications which have not qualified. Such applicants are informed that they do not qualify for a waiver, and therefore must make payment of the Charge.  I am also advised by the Agency that a total of 386 households have made partial direct debit payments and therefore have an outstanding amount due in respect of the Household Charge. </p></reply>

The EPA was established as a non-commercial and independent state-sponsored body.  A recent independent review of the EPA, available on my Department&#8217;s website, <i>www.environ.ie</i> , concluded that the EPA has the independence to arrive at informed and objective decisions and to undertake objective assessment and reporting on the state of the environment.  This independence is one of its key strengths and is well provided for in existing legislation, including in relation to the enforcement of licences and consents in individual cases.</p><p>  As highlighted in the 2011 Annual Report and Accounts of the Environmental Protection Agency and as stated publically elsewhere by the Agency, the EPA continues to fulfil its statutory obligations by following a broad enforcement strategy encompassing a range of activities.  The Report can be found on the Agency&#8217;s website,  , and sets out that in 2011 the Agency completed 169 audits and 658 inspections of waste and Integrated Pollution Prevention Control (IPPC) licensed sites; issued 870 notifications of non-compliance; held 122 meetings with licensees to address non-compliance issues; and, ultimately, brought 22 successful prosecutions in the District Court during the year. These prosecutions resulted in costs and fines totalling over &#8364;130,000.</p><p>  The Agency also continues to co-ordinate a national Environmental Enforcement Network.  Participants of the Network include the EPA, all local authorities, government departments, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the National Bureau for Criminal Investigations, the Northern Ireland Environment and Heritage Service, the Police Service of Northern Ireland, the Fisheries Boards, the Health Service Executive, the Revenue Commissioners, and the Director of Public Prosecutions.  The Network harnesses the collective resources and expertise available nationally to co-ordinate a consistent and more effective approach to the enforcement of environmental legislation in Ireland. </p><p>  The EPA Review also found that there is &#8220;widespread respect and regard for the Agency&#8217;s work, and its staff,&#8221; and that it provides &#8220;considerable benefit for Ireland&#8217;s environment, and for the health and well-being of its people.&#8221;  I am confident that the EPA, and its Director General, will continue appropriately to discharge its mandate to safeguard and improve Ireland&#8217;s environment. </p></reply>

The imposition of the levies will require primary legislation and I am committed to having the legislation published and enacted in the shortest timeframe possible.</p><p>  The Government also approved the establishment of a Resolution Board which will have full oversight of the operation of the remediation scheme to ensure that the public interest, and the particular interest of the affected homeowners, is well served.  The Resolution Board, which I am currently establishing, will, in conjunction with my Department, draw up the terms and conditions for the proposed remediation scheme.  The terms of the scheme will set out the relevant eligibility criteria for affected homeowners. </p><p>  It is envisaged that the Resolution Board will comprise a small number of persons with the range of technical skills necessary to oversee the successful operation of the remediation scheme.  Given the focussed nature of its particular role, there are no proposals to include a representative from Home bond or the Pyrite Action Group on the Board.  I have, however, recently appointed a Chairman who, with me, is keen for the Board to commence its work as soon as possible.</p></reply>

General purpose grants are my Department&rsquo;s contribution towards meeting the cost to local authorities of providing a reasonable level of services to their customers.  These grants continue to make a significant contribution to the revenue funding of local authorities.  I was pleased to announce general purpose grant allocations for 2013 totalling &euro;640m, a slight decrease of 1.7% on the initial allocation for 2012.  Meath County Council&rsquo;s 2013 allocation is some &euro;21.25m, a decrease of 2% on the 2012 allocation, whereas Navan County Council&rsquo;s allocation of &euro;472,699 represents an increase of 20.5% on its 2012 allocation.</p><p>Local authorities cost and income bases vary significantly from one another and calculating an appropriate distribution of these grants is complex.  General purpose grants from the Local Government Fund are structured to bring about equalisation over time; that is a position of balance where the financial needs of local authorities are met by their resources and they are able to provide an appropriate level of service to their customers.  In determining these grants a number of factors are taken into account including the overall funding available for this purpose, the estimated cost to each authority of providing a reasonable level of services to their customers, the income each authority should generate from local sources and the necessity to provide each authority with a baseline allocation that will support its financial stability.  Any system designed to align funding solely or mainly on a per capita basis would ignore important differences between local authority cost and income bases.</p><p>The most recent population information can be obtained from 2011 census data available on the Central Statistics Office&rsquo;s website at  <i> www.cso.ie. </i> The 2013 General purpose grant allocations are set out in the

Draft standards were published on 1 March 2012 together with an invitation for interested parties to make submissions as part of the consultation process. The invitation to participate in the consultation process clearly stated that it was not intended to reply to individual submissions.</p><p>  In total, 165 submissions were received from members of the public, political representatives, public authorities, environmental groups, professional organisations and the water services industry. The submissions were carefully considered by my Department and by the EPA and informed the finalising of standards which were given legal effect in the Water Services Acts 2007 and 2012 (Domestic Waste Water Treatment Systems) Regulations 2012, which I signed on 26 June 2012.  My Department is currently examining what amendments to the exempted development provisions of planning legislation may be necessary where the provision of improved on-site waste-water treatment and disposal systems arises as a result of inspections carried out under the 2012 legislation.  The necessary legislation will be in place in advance of inspections commencing this year.</p><p>  I recently announced my intention to introduce a grant scheme to provide financial assistance to households whose septic tanks and other domestic wastewater treatment systems require remediation or upgrading following inspection under the Water Services (Amendment) Act 2012. Eligibility for support under the scheme will be confined to householders who have complied with the legal obligation to register their treatment systems by 1 February 2013 . Only expenditure incurred directly by an eligible householder as a result of an inspection under the 2012 Act and the subsequent issue of an advisory notice under that legislation will qualify. Full details of the scheme will be set out in regulations which I will make in advance of inspections commencing. </p></reply>

Applications for refugee status in the State are determined by an independent process comprising the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal which make recommendations to the Minister on whether such status should be granted.   All applications for refugee status are considered on their individual merits on a case by case basis having regard to the subjective and objective elements of the claim.</p><p>  The person concerned has received copies of all documents in relation to his proceedings and final conclusions made by the Refugee Applications Commissioner. I am satisfied that the applications made by the person concerned has been fairly and comprehensively examined.  The person concerned is the subject of a Deportation Order signed on 28 June,  2004. He has been evading his deportation since 3 November, 2009 and as such he is committing an offence. Should he come to the notice of the Garda authorities, he would be liable to arrest and detention. He should, therefore, present himself to the Garda National Immigration Bureau without any further delay.</p><p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.  This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process. The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in cases where the response from the INIS is, in the Deputy&rsquo;s view, inadequate or too long awaited.</p></reply>

Overall, in line with the reduction in the number of new claims for asylum in recent years, there has been a significant reduction in the number of cases coming before the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.   Accordingly, the number of cases and fees paid in 2012 has decreased by approximately 80% over the 2009 levels.   The scale of fees paid to Members depends on a number of criteria such as whether it involves a substantive hearing, an accelerated appeal or a case under the Dublin Convention/Manifestly Unfounded process.  Within each of these categories, the scale of fees are tiered in accordance with the nature of the work involved such as for an oral hearing, cases of a husband and wife heard together or separate and so forth.  The amounts listed include some training costs, particularly in the earlier years and payments in any particular year may relate to work done in earlier years.</p><p>The Refugee Appeals Tribunal is an independent, statutory body, established and operating pursuant to the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended).  The business of the Tribunal is conducted in accordance with the provisions of the Act and in particular the Second Schedule therein.  In this regard my Department has been advised by the Chairperson of the Tribunal that the work of the Tribunal is assigned to Members commensurate with experience, expertise in particular areas of work and their availability. All Members are barristers or solicitors with at least 5 years experience and are appointed as Members of the Tribunal to act in a part-time capacity.</p><p>Due to the fall in asylum applications and the consequential fall in appeals lodged with the Tribunal in recent years, there has not been a requirement since I took office to appoint new members or to consider the re-appointment of Members whose 3 year term of office has expired. However, as the complement of Members currently stands at 13 (from a peak of 35 in 2008) and will be further reduced over the course of 2013 with the expiry of terms of office of current Members, I have decided that a Public Appointments Service (PAS) competition will be advertised shortly. Arising from this competition I propose to appoint suitably qualified candidates as and when the need arises. I should add that a separate PAS competition was recently advertised to fill the position of Chairperson.</p><p>  <b>Appendix 1:  The number of cases processed to completion by each Tribunal Member in

Local Garda Ethnic Liaison Officers (ELO) liaise with members of minority communities to reassure them of the Garda services available to them.  Regular contact is maintained with personnel from GRIDO resulting in Divisional Garda&iacute; being in a position to receive and communicate information on issues which may be raised by members of the migrant communities.  Trained ELOs interact with members of ethnic minorities on issues affecting the Garda organisation.  A successful multicultural open day was held at Mullingar Garda Station at the end of 2011. Contacts made from the open day have been maintained in order to ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to provide an excellent service to ethnic minority communities.</p><p>  The Garda authorities also advise that a text alert system is in operation in the area, which includes members of migrant communities.  Other relevant actions in this area include a crime prevention presentation, for the South Asian Community, which was held in July 2012. In addition, an intercultural coffee morning is due to be held in the Lios Na Greine Family Resource Centre in February 2013.  This event has been organised by the local Garda ELO in conjunction with local migrant community members.  Garda ELOs have visited primary and secondary schools and addressed pupils as part of the Garda Schools Programme. The Social Personal and Health Education Programme in schools specifically covers racism and ethnicity.  I am advised that these and similar activities are used as a means to strengthen relationships and build confidence between local Garda&iacute; and migrant communities.</p></reply>

It was to that end that I visited the asylum seeker accommodation centre at Hatch Hall, Hatch Street, Dublin 2 on 22 November last. This was my first visit to such a centre but I intend to visit at least one other later this year.</p><p>  I was shown around the centre in the company of centre management staff and officials from the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA), a functional unit of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department responsible for the accommodation of persons while their applications for international protection are being processed.  Towards the end of visit I met with several residents in the centre with whom I discussed a number of their concerns, mainly relating to the length of time spent in the direct provision system.</p><p>  Hatch Hall is one of 35 centres currently under contract to RIA, accommodating approximately 4,900 residents. The centres operate in accordance with the Government policy of direct provision. Under this system, RIA provides full board accommodation and ancillary services to asylum seekers while they await a final decision on their asylum and related applications. RIA also works with other State service providers, including the HSE, Department of Social Protection and the Department of Education, to ensure that the necessary ancillary services are provided to the residents.</p><p>  In relation to the broader asylum issues arising from my visit to the centre, particularly the complexity and length of the associated processes, it confirms to me that my efforts should remain concentrated on<b><font color="#000080"> </font></b>  speeding up the processing of applications, primarily by redeploying staff from the refugee determination bodies. The Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill, 2010, which I intend to republish, provides for the introduction of a single procedure to determine applications for protection and other reasons to remain in the State. This should substantially simplify and streamline the existing arrangements. This reorganisation of the protection application processing framework will remove the current multi-layered processes and provide applicants with a final decision on their applications in a more straightforward and timely fashion.</p><p>  Finally, I recently approved an initiative to put in place a panel with legal expertise who will assist INIS  in processing a cohort of repatriation cases, thus speeding up the overall process and reducing the time spent by persons in the direct provision system. I would expect to see significant dividends, in terms of cases finalised, from this initiative in the coming months.</p></reply>

The Deputy will also be aware that judges are, subject to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions.</p><p>  However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has informed me that the number of appeals awaiting hearing in the Court of Criminal Appeal is 162.  The average waiting time for an appeal is approximately 15 months from the time an appeal is entered on the list, with all papers lodged, to when the appeal is heard.  I am informed that the judiciary monitor waiting times and backlogs of court cases on an ongoing basis to ensure that delays are kept to a minimum.  The Courts Service works with the judiciary to ensure that all cases are dealt with and disposed of as speedily as possible.  The Service has been engaged in a modernisation programme including an end-to-end examination and reform of court processes and procedures to bring about efficiencies in the management of the courts and the services provided.</p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Court of Criminal Appeal consists of a Judge of the Supreme Court and two Judges of the High Court so any additional sittings would likely have implications for the Supreme Court which continues to experience lengthy waiting times.  Although considerable efforts are being made to manage this, the issue of capacity in the Supreme Court can only be fully resolved through the establishment of a Court of Appeal which can deal with civil cases.  This necessitates the holding of a Constitutional referendum on Article 34 to which the Government is committed and work has commenced in my Department in this regard.</p></reply>

The essential role of JPCs is to provide appropriate advice to the Garda&iacute; and local authorities and to support collaborative engagement among stakeholders in relation to local policing issues.  The Act provides that JPCs operate under guidelines issued by the Minister for Justice and Equality after consultation with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  The current guidelines were issued in September, 2008.</p><p>  The Programme for Government makes a commitment to build on existing community policing partnerships and forums to enhance trust between local communities and their Garda&iacute;.  In the spirit of that commitment I initiated a review of the operation of JPCs and I have published a discussion document to open the matter for wider consultation.  In the context of the present review I will be happy to consider all views on the functioning of JPCs and the Deputy is most welcome to contribute to the consultation process.  It is important to bear in mind, however, in considering any changes to the remit of the JPCs, that they are intended as a forum for engagement to promote more effective action by the various stakeholders and not as an additional administrative structure. In this regard An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na already has the power to object to the renewal of a licence under existing legislation, and as the Garda&iacute; are essential participants in the work of JPCs, it would seem that relevant views can be aired in the context of the existing JPC structures.</p></reply>

The Private Security Services Act 2004 (as amended) sets out the activities in the private security industry which are, or will be, subject to licensing. One of the security services prescribed in the primary legislation is that of 'installers of security equipment' which includes services such as Intruder Alarms, Access Control, and CCTV.</p><p>  The Authority has adopted a phased approach to the licensing of the industry and the licensing of installers of intruder alarms systems commenced in August 2006. More recently, since 1st October 2012, contractors providing security services in the Access Control and CCTV sectors require a licence from the Authority.  Contractors such as those in the Access Control and CCTV sectors are required to pay a licence fee to the Authority. The Authority is aware of the difficulties faced by the industry at this time and there has been ongoing contact between the Department and the Authority about the fee level. I expect to be in a position shortly to make an announcement about the matter.</p><p>  The Authority has, since its establishment, shown its competence in regulating the security industry. A wide range of stakeholders have been represented on the Board of the Authority to date and they have brought their knowledge of the industry to the policy formation process. The Authority is committed to consulting with all stakeholders and considers the opinions of those in the industry in its business planning. I am informed that there were two periods of public consultation prior to the introduction of licensing to the Access Control and CCTV which contributed to the formulation of licensing regulations.</p><p>  The Authority has extensive powers of enforcement under the legislation. I am informed by the Authority that it aims to ensure that all contractors are operating within the law and that it is in the process of boosting its inspection capabilities with a view to targeting unlicensed operators. Where there is sufficient evidence prosecution proceedings will be pursued against those operating outside the legislation.  The Deputy will also appreciate that tax clearance certification is part of the licensing process.</p></reply>

This figure represented approximately 4% of the overall prisoner population.  The Prison estate consists of 1 high security prison, Portlaoise Prison, and a total of 12 prisoners were granted Christmas temporary release from this institution.  In general the periods of release varied from a few hours (in some cases accompanied by another responsible person) up to 7 nights. All releases were subject to stringent conditions and any offender who breaks these conditions may be arrested and returned immediately to prison by the Garda&iacute;.</p><p>The table below outlines that nature of offences committed by those prisoners who were granted Christmas temporary release.</p><p><table><tr><th><div>Offence Group</div></th><th><div>Total number of prisoners </div></th></tr><tr><td><div>Homicide Offences</div></td><td><div>26</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Controlled Drug Offences</div></td><td><div>59</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Weapons and Explosives</div></td><td><div>10</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Damage to property and environment</div></td><td><div>6</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Public order and social code</div></td><td><div>3</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Road and traffic offences</div></td><td><div>5</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Government, Justice and Organised Crime offences</div></td><td><div>5</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Offences not elsewhere classified</div></td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Sexual Offences</div></td><td><div>2</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Attempts/Threats to murder</div></td><td><div>24</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Dangerous negligent acts</div></td><td><div>10</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Robbery, extortion and hijacking offences</div></td><td><div>9</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Burglary and related offences</div></td><td><div>15</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Theft and related offences</div></td><td><div>35</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Fraud, deception and related offences</div></td><td><div>16</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Overall total</div></td><td><div>226</div></td></tr></table><pli0>*  In 2010 the Irish Prison Service recategorised the offence groups under which prisoners&rsquo; convictions are recorded.  Statistics are now compiled using the same groups as those used by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Central Statistics Office, the Courts Service and the Probation Service.</pli0></p><p>The majority of prisoners released were nearing the end of their sentences and the overriding concern when considering the applications is the safety of the public. In addition to compassionate and humane considerations, other criteria taken into account included the nature and gravity of the offence, prior record on temporary release, behaviour while in custody and previous criminal history.</p><p>The majority of prisoners released were participating in Incentivised Regime at the enhanced level.  These incentivised regimes enable prisoners to progress through the system, in a way that helps them prepare for their eventual reintegration into society.  This involves engaging with the services and partaking in training and educational programmes.  The Incentivised Regimes Policy provides for a differentiation of privileges between prisoners according to their level of engagement with services and quality of behaviour.  The Victim Liaison Officer of the Irish Prison Service informs all registered victims when any form of temporary release if being granted to a prisoner.  Where prisoners granted temporary release fail to return, the details are passed to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  However, I can advise the Deputy that all 226 prisoners returned to custody after their respective periods of temporary release.</p></reply>

I also referred to the advice that the extraction of DNA profiles from bones that have been in water for a long period of time is extremely difficult as the sea has been found to cause extensive degrading of Nuclear DNA over time.

In accordance with this principle, the role of the Oireachtas has been to specify in law a maximum penalty and a court, having considered all the circumstances of the case, to impose an appropriate penalty up to that maximum.  The court is required to impose a sentence which is proportionate not only to the crime but to the individual offender, in that process identifying where on the sentencing range the particular case should lie and then applying any mitigating factors which may be present.</p><p>  There are, of course, a small number of situations where statute has created exceptions to this approach most notably by providing for mandatory sentences for murder and presumptive minimum sentences in the case of certain firearms and drug trafficking offences.  Except for exceptional circumstances, I am of the view that the Oireachtas should be cautious in prescribing mandatory sentences.  An important safeguard rests in the power of the Director of Public Prosecutions to apply to the Court of Criminal Appeal to review a sentence she regards as unduly lenient.</p><p>  The Deputy may be aware that the Law Reform Commission, after detailed study some years ago, recommended against the introduction of statutory sentencing guidelines but favoured non-statutory sentencing principles.  The Superior Courts have developed a substantial body of case law setting out general principles of sentencing.  Sentencing practice is also being developed by a steering committee of the judiciary which developed the Irish Sentencing Information System (ISIS) website, a pilot initiative designed to gather information about the range of sentences and other penalties that have been imposed for particular types of offences across court jurisdictions.  Information on over 1,000 cases is detailed on the website and I welcome the committee's recent announcement that two JobBridge interns are to be appointed shortly in order to recommence populating the online database with information on sentencing in the criminal courts.</p><p>  The Deputy may be aware that the ISIS committee also announced they are planning to recommence providing information on sentencing in relation to specific issues in which context an analysis has been published on rape sentencing prepared by the Judicial Researchers Office under the guidance of Mr. Justice Peter Charleton.  I understand that seminars are also planned, including one focusing on the work of the Sentencing Council in the UK.  Finally, as the Deputy may be aware, in September 2012, I announced a strategic review of penal policy. I have established a working group to carry out this review which will examine all aspects of penal policy and I expect the Group to report later this year.</p></reply>

This is necessary in order to ensure the continued viability of the RDF as outlined in the recommendations of the Value for Money Review of the Reserve Defence Force, which was published in November 2012.</p><p>  The High Level Implementation Group with responsibility for the re-organisation of the Permanent Defence Force is now implementing the re-organisation of the RDF. The military authorities have set out an implementation framework which sets out a two phased approach.  Phase 1 is ongoing and will provide for the introduction of new organisational structures by the end of March 2013. Members of the Reserve will be invited to apply for positions within the new Units and every effort will be made to facilitate existing members of the Reserve within the new organisation. During this transition to the new structures, Reserve training is being restricted to unarmed training. I have requested details of training hours by Brigade from the military authorities and I will forward these to the Deputy when they are available.</p><p>  In addition, Phase 1 also provides for the preparation of detailed administrative, training and operational plans. This includes planning for ceremonial events to mark the disestablishment of existing RDF Units and training plans for new Units. These will be in place when the new Units are established at the end of March 2013.  Members of the Reserve will be fully briefed when relevant plans are finalised.</p><p>  Phase 2 of the implementation process (the duration of which is from the 1st April to the 30th September 2013) will concentrate on capability development. Armed training for members of the Reserve will resume, co-ordinated PDF and RDF training will commence and annual training camps will be conducted over the period June to August 2013.  RDF recruitment will also be initiated in line with vacancies within the new establishment.</p><p>  In line with the recommendations of the Value for Money Review, the criteria that govern the classification of Reservists as effective or non-effective are currently being reviewed by the military authorities. This is necessary to ensure that only Reservists that are meeting required training targets are classed as effective. This will provide a more accurate indicator of Reserve capacity. Any proposed changes to these criteria will require Ministerial approval in the form of an amendment to Defence Force Regulation R5.  There will continue to be full consultation with the Representative Associations on all matters that fall within the scope of representation and regular bilateral meetings will continue over the coming months.</p></reply>

As in previous years, the RDF will participate in a number of parades throughout the country.  There is no requirement for specialised training to be carried out in advance of the parades, the basic foot and arm drill which is part of the induction training for members of the RDF is sufficient.  As is the practice, rehearsals will take place in advance of participation in the parades.  A major re-organisation of the RDF is currently being implemented and the RDF is currently transitioning to a new &ldquo;single force&rdquo; organisational structure.  RDF training is continuing, however, this transitional phase will provide for limited unarmed training only, except where RDF Military Ceremonial requires weapons for training and ceremonial events.</p></reply>

As it will take some time before we have achieved the current target of 32 doctors in the Defence Forces, alternative arrangements to address the ongoing shortfall are being developed by the Central Medical Unit of the Medical Corps.  Against this background, it has been necessary to identify alternative options for the provision of medical services to the Defence Forces, including the consideration of the outsourcing of some or all Defence Forces domestic medical services.  In this regard an integrated model for the provision of the required medical services, involving both the Medical Corps and outsourced service provision, is being progressed.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-01-29a.1229.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013012900076#WRAA02900"><p>Howth is one of 6 Fishery Harbour Centres operated by the State each of whose <i>primary</i> purpose is to provide facilities and services for the fishing industry and fisheries-related activities.  There has been significant capital investment in all of the Fishery Harbour Centres in recent years.  In parallel with fishing-related enhancements, there have been a number of developments at the Fishery Harbours that underpin their expanding use for leisure and marine tourism, as well as other maritime enterprises.  I am well aware that Howth in particular has a long tradition in these areas as well as in commercial fishing.</p><p>  As a consequence of the additional investment, the State is necessarily fully committed to maximising the return on its investment.  Furthermore, my Department is required to ensure that the Fishery Harbour Centres are run on a financially sound basis.  It is in those contexts that it is proposed to make a charge for the use of parking facilities provided within Howth Fishery Harbour Centre, in the same way that a charge is made for using any other of its facilities.</p><p><i>All</i> income generated by the Fishery Harbour Centres goes back into a ring-fenced Fishery Harbour Centres Fund that is used exclusively for the operating, management and development costs of the Fishery Harbours.  All of the day-to-day running costs, for example, Harbour Master and staff salaries, electricity and fuel costs, harbour cleaning and maintenance etc of each Fishery Harbour Centres are financed from the Fund.  It is the only source of income available to fund this expenditure, without which the Fishery Harbour Centres could not provide a service to their customers, the harbour users and the visiting public.  Income lodged to the Fishery Harbour Centres Fund is invested directly back into the Fishery Harbour Centres and can be used for no other purpose.</p><p>  The Rates &amp; Charges Order is the legal instrument that enables charges to be levied that provide the income necessary for the provision of the various services at the Fishery Harbours.  The rates and charges are set at a level sufficient to provide adequately for the costs involved while balancing the need to finance the management of the harbours with the needs of the various harbour customers.</p><p>  The introduction of parking charges at Howth Fishery Harbour Centre was originally examined some years ago in the context of a proposed Howth Traffic and Parking Management Plan, in conjunction with Fingal Council.  That project did not subsequently proceed.  There was widespread public consultation at that time and I am well aware of the views and concerns expressed at the time by local businesses and other interests, that are still being expressed today in relation to the new scheme.  However, in the current economic climate, it is essential that all of the State&#8217;s enterprises pay their way, and the State must necessarily be fully committed to maximising the return on its investment.</p><p>  Howth Fishery Harbour Centre is first and foremost a working fishery harbour.  As such, full access is required for commercial traffic servicing the fishing side and the various ancillary enterprises, with appropriate parking arrangements.  Other harbour users such as the yacht club and other social users also require reasonable access to parking facilities.  A significant number of parking spaces in the Fishery Harbour are currently being taken up by commuters using the DART service during the working week, when the DART station car park is full.  It is essential that the needs of all users are accommodated in a safe and secure facility.  However, it is generally acknowledged that traffic and parking management within the Fishery Harbour Centre itself has needs to be addressed, particularly in the light of concerns raised about safety and emergency access by the Coastguard, the Lifeboat service, and an G&aacute;rda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The introduction of pay parking is one of a number of measures being introduced to address those concerns.</p><p>  The current Rates and Charges Order SI 214/2012 provides for a charge for parking but no set charge has yet been fixed for Howth.  Given that there are approx 500 parking spaces within the Fishery Harbour Centre boundaries at present, it is clear that a significant source of revenue exists.  It is illogical that some harbour users would expect to continue to use such a facility free of charge given that the State is required to maintain that facility, and when other users, i.e. those users of the harbour who are already paying into the Fund for using the harbour facilities, are effectively paying for its upkeep.  The new parking arrangements will include pay and display parking for visitors, and a permit management system for the harbour&#8217;s business users.  Regular Harbour users will have noticed that all currently available parking spaces have been identified and marked recently.</p><p>  My Department has asked the Planning Department of Fingal Council for guidance on their requirements in relation to minimising the potential environmental and visual impacts of the pay and display machines and of any associated directional signage, and will be pleased to take account of any requirements and recommendations they may have.</p><p>  The additional revenues to be generated from pay parking at Howth Fishery Harbour Centre, which I expect will be significant when fully operational, will be re-invested in facilities and enhancements that would not otherwise have been possible given the current financial constraints.  I believe these improvements can only be of benefit to the marine and leisure tourism sectors and local economies in general.  In the longer term, I believe that both the Howth Fishery Harbour Centre users and Howth people in general will recognise the benefits that will accrue from this previously untapped resource.  I can assure the Deputy that the scheme for the new parking regime will seek to be fair to all of the users of the harbour while at the same time ensuring that everyone pays their fair share.</p></reply>

My Department has responsibility for the identification, health and welfare of animals kept for farming purposes and in this regard there are strict procedures in place relating to the identification of all farmed animal species, including equines. With regard to identification of equines, my Department has introduced enhanced rules governing equine identification through SI No 357 of 2011 and SI No 371 of 2012 which give effect to European Commission Regulation (EC) No 504/2008. The legislation requires horse owners to ensure that all horses have a passport and that foals be identified before 31 December of the year of birth or within six months of birth, whatever date is the later. Passports are issued by an approved Passport Issuing Organisation.</p><p>  All equines issued with a passport after 1 July 2009 must have a corresponding microchip implanted by a veterinarian. The microchip number is recorded on the passport and creates a link between the passport and the equine. The microchips are supplied by the Passport Issuing Organisation to the veterinarians and contain markers that are specific to the issuing body.  During the processing of the passports, the number on the microchip is recorded on the database of the Passport Issuing Organisation and the microchip implanted in the equine may be scanned and the number verified with the issuing organisation. When there is a change of ownership of an equine, there is a mechanism in place whereby this change is recorded on the passport and on the database of the Passport Issuing body.</p><p>  My Department also introduced new regulations on the registration of horse premises in January 2012 such that, from May 2012, anyone who is the owner/person in charge of any premises on which horses are kept is required to register the premises with the Department. The introduction of these regulations will play an important role in bringing greater accountability to horse issues and should be of assistance to the local authorities, the Gardai S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Department personnel in the years ahead.  My Department is also developing a central database of horses which will involve migration of selected data from Passport Issuing Organisations to the Department. The intention is that this database will be used to verify the authenticity of the passport for the equine presented at various events and locations. </p><p>  The operation of Local Authority Pounds is a matter for the respective Local Authorities. My Department makes a financial contribution to the activities carried out by Local Authorities under the Control of Horses Act, 1996, which provides extensive powers to Local Authorities, including the making of bye-laws for the control and welfare of stray or abandoned horses in a Local Authorities&rsquo; functional area. Officials of my Department have ongoing contact with Local Authorities to underline how enforcement of the Act can assist with controlling horses and reducing the emergence of horse welfare problems. This includes a requirement that Local Authorities ensure that horses reclaimed or re-homed under the Act are identified pursuant to the European Commission Regulation (EC) No 504/2008 and have microchip, passport (and horse licence if appropriate) prior to being reclaimed or re-homed. My Department has advised the Local Authorities, when re-homing horses, to heed the advice of the Farm Animal Welfare Advisory Council (which comprises representatives from a wide range of stakeholder organisations including farming, equine and welfare bodies) which advocates that where an owner can no longer provide for a horse, he or she should seek to dispose of the animal before its welfare is compromised - including consideration of the option of humane disposal where the horse cannot be sold/transferred to another responsible owner as such action will help prevent the emergence of long-term welfare problems.</p><p>  Other initiatives I have taken in the equine area include the progression of the Animal Health and Welfare Bill which, when adopted, will apply in a wide range of situations affecting the welfare of all animals, including horses.</p></reply>

The principal regulations which apply to meat are Regulations (EC) No. 853/2004 and 854/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council. These are implemented in Ireland under the European Communities (Food and Feed Hygiene) Regulations 2009, S.I No 432 of 2009. </p><p>  It is not illegal to trade in minced equine meat, provided this is done in compliance with the relevant legislative requirements. There is no definition of &lsquo;mechanically recovered meat&rsquo; in the EU food safety regulations but &lsquo;mechanically separated meat&rsquo; (MSM) is defined as &lsquo;the product obtained by removing meat from flesh-bearing bones after boning or from poultry carcasses, using mechanical means resulting in the loss or modification of the muscle fibre structure.&rsquo; Under TSE Regulations the production of MSM using bones from cattle, sheep or goats is prohibited.  On 26th January I confirmed that test results had been received which were positive for equine DNA in meat imported from another Member State for use in the production of burgers at the Silvercrest Foods plant. This represented a major breakthrough in the joint investigation by my Department and the FSAI into the source of equine DNA in beef burgers, in that it established a direct correlation between burgers in which a high level of equine DNA was detected and imported raw material product.</p><p>  Tests on samples taken from Irish food ingredients were negative for equine DNA and I am pleased that the integrity of Irish food has been maintained.  The current findings of the official investigation do not show any evidence that the company concerned deliberately used horsemeat in their production process. The authorities in the Member State concerned have been informed of the findings of the investigation.</p></reply>

No. 230 of 2006) and the Bass (Restriction on Sale) Regulations 2007 (S.I. No. 367 of 2007). The complete ban for the commercial fishing of sea bass applies to Irish fishing vessels in all areas.  These regulations were introduced as a co-ordinated set of measures with the Sea Bass Fishing Conservation bylaws. The by-laws impose a bag limit on anglers of two bass in any one period of 24 hours and a ban on angling for bass during the spawning season, from 15th May to 15th June in any given year. These measures have been in place since 1990 and were introduced arising from the dramatic decline of sea bass stocks in the 1970&rsquo;s.   Bass in Irish waters are a slow growing fish and, at a recruitment age of roughly 5 years, are late maturing fish. The distribution of bass around Europe is found mainly in southern waters, including the inshore waters of the south west of England and the English Channel.  It is farmed extensively in Mediterranean waters.  </p><p>  The Marine Institute carried out an annual bass survey between the years 1996 and 2007.  This survey validates previous research on the species and indicates that the stock of bass in Ireland&rsquo;s inshore waters remains greatly depleted since the 1960s and 1970s.   No reliable assessment is currently available for European sea bass in the north east Atlantic. ICES considers that a precautionary reduction of catches should be implemented.  ICES gave advice for European sea bass stocks in September 2012.  This advice states that commercial catches should be subject to a 20% reduction on landings in relation to the 2008-2010 average catch. ICES have also stated that management of sea bass fisheries need to take into account the distinctive characteristics and economic value of the different fisheries. Sea bass is of high social and economic value to large inshore fleets and to sea angling and recreational angling that contribute substantially to local communities.  </p><p>  There is a need to conduct scientific research on the biology and dynamics of sea bass in Irish waters.   The Marine Institute have secured funding to start a PhD project on sea bass that will focus on the stock structure of Irish sea bass (what is their relationship to English Channel and Bay of Biscay stocks) and on the movements of sea bass off the south coast and into the Celtic Sea.  This work will address clear knowledge gaps in the sea bass, but results will not be available until at least 2015. </p><p>  The EU Commission indicated last year that it was considering introducing Total Allowable Catches (TACs)  and quotas for seabass in specified fisheries management areas stretching from the North Sea down to waters off the coasts of Spain and Portugal for 2013.  The Commission did not proceed with that proposal.  The EU Commission had indicated that it proposed to use track record of landings of seabass by Member States fleets to establish each Member States shares of the TACs.  As Ireland has implemented a complete closure of the commercial seabass fishery since 1990, under this methodology it would not receive any quota.  I consider that it is unacceptable that the Irish fleet would not benefit from a share out of these fisheries because of the responsible approach taken to protect and rebuild the stock around  Ireland.  I made the case at the Fisheries Council and to the Commission that an alternative method of establishing access to the fisheries should be developed that allows Irish fishermen fishing opportunities for sustainable stocks of seabass in areas where the Irish fleet would operate.  The EU Commission has not yet advised if it intends to pursue a TAC and quota regime for seabass for 2014.  In that context, I will continue to press Ireland&rsquo;s case at EU Fisheries Council meetings where the topic is discussed.  I will consider management arrangements for seabass when and if Council decides on TACs and quotas for the relevant stocks.</p></reply>

The SCP is one of three service strands, which also includes the Home School Community Liaison and the Education Welfare Service, being integrated under the remit of the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB). The SCP is a key programme under the Department of Education and Skills' DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) action plan.</p><p>  I wish to inform the Deputy that &euro;26.456m is being allocated to the programme in 2013. The allocation is in line with the proposals in the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure for savings in the SCP for the years 2012-2014.  In September 2012, the Local Management Committee responsible for each SCP project was notified that a reduction on last year&rsquo;s allocation would apply for the coming academic cycle. The full year budget for the SCP was confirmed earlier than in previous years to assist local committees to effectively refine programmes and deliver targeted interventions within budget. </p><p>  Each Committee was requested to review its Retention Plan to support young people, who are at risk of educational disadvantage, to remain in education and to finalise a programme of supports to effectively target available resources to meet local needs. Projects were advised to examine all elements of expenditure and to seek to reduce costs and achieve efficiencies while prioritising evidence based services to support children&rsquo;s educational outcomes.  The NEWB, which is responsible for the operational management and direction of the SCP, has assisted each local project in the process of reviewing its planned programme. The NEWB continues to work closely with management committees, schools and local SCP co-ordinators to ensure student supports are tailored to meet local needs. </p><p>  The adjustment identified in CRE for 2013 and 2014 will be further considered in the context of a review of the programme to be undertaken in 2013. This review will address the potential to achieve greater consistency in programme delivery, administration and other costs amongst the 124 local SCP projects and related initiatives.  A core objective of the review will be to ensure that available funds are appropriately targeted to support those pupils most at risk of educational disadvantage and early school leaving.</p></reply>

A capital allocation of &#8364;3.25m for child care facilities is available to my Department in 2013, and I am currently considering how this allocation can best be utilised for the benefit of the child care sector.  Established child care services can apply to participate in three child care support programmes which are currently implemented by my Department.  These include two targeted child care support programmes - the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme and the Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programme - and the universal Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme.</p><p>  The CCS programme provides funding to community-based child care services to enable them to provide child care at reduced rates to low-income and disadvantaged parents.  This programme is currently closed to new applicants, unless the service applying is a position to replace an existing service which has opted out of the programme.  Both community and commercial child care providers can apply to participate in the CETS<b></b>programme, which provides &#8364;145 towards the weekly cost of full time child care places for approved F&Aacute;S and VEC trainees and students, and the ECCE programme, which provides one free  pre-school year to all eligible children in the year before commencing primary school.  It is expected that the new after-school programme, which was announced in Budget 2013, will be open to both community and commercial child care providers.</p></reply>

In effect, once an adoption takes place, all previous links to the birth family are severed and the adopted person is considered part of the adopted family. In the case of step-parent adoptions, it is therefore necessary for the birth mother to adopt her child as part of the adoption process.  I am currently examining this issue to see what options are available to address this issue.</p></reply>

These are the Adoption Authority of Ireland (AAI); the Family Support Agency (FSA); the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) and the Ombudsman for Children's Office (OCO).</p><p>  In July 2011, the Government decided that the Family Mediation Service should transfer from the Family Support Agency to the Legal Aid Board. This is in line with the Government&rsquo;s commitment to facilitate the use of mediation in family disputes in order to speed up the legal process, reduce costs and ameliorate the stress of contested court proceedings. On foot of the Government decision, the Family Support Agency established a transition project team to transfer 45 individuals, or 24.29 WTEs, in some 16 locations throughout the country and an annual allocation of almost &euro;3m to the Legal Aid Board. On 26th October 2011, the Minister for Justice and Equality signed the commencement order for Part 16 of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011 which gave effect to the transfer from 1st November 2011.  This transfer was noted in the DPER public service document referred to by the Deputy.</p><p>  I can inform the Deputy that the FSA is due to be merged with the new Child and Family Support Agency (CFSA) which will be established this year.  The National Educational Welfare Board is also due to be merged with the CFSA.  Legislation for the establishment of the CFSA is being prepared by my Department as a matter of priority.  It is anticipated that the Bill will be published and enacted in the course of this session and it is my intention that the CFSA will assume statutory responsibility for services for children and families in 2013.</p><p>  The potential benefits of merging the back office functions of the Ombudsman for Children's Office into the Ombudsman/Information Commissioner's Office also mentioned in the DPER public service reform document are currently being examined.  It should be noted that following enactment of the Child Care Amendment Act 2011 the Children's Act Advisory Board was subsequently dissolved by means of the commencement by the Minister of Health of Part 6 of the Child Amendment Act 2011.</p></reply>

A regulatory environment which supports and nurtures clinical research will benefit patients and also is essential for the growth of the pharmaceutical industry both in Ireland and in the EU in general.</p><p>  The medical devices proposals are also designed to strengthen the EU regulatory system in the area of medical devices.  The proposals are designed to ensure that all medical devices placed on the European market are safe for patients and to improve patient access to new innovative treatments.  Following significant patient safety issues across Europe relating to hip and breast implants, patient safety is a key concern.  There is, as the Deputy points out, a substantial and well established medical devices industry in Ireland and a strong and effective regulatory system is crucial for the continued success and development of this industry.</p><p>  My Department hopes to make significant progress in the negotiations of both of these proposals during the Irish Presidency of the EU Council.  My colleague, the Minister for Health, Dr James Reilly met with the rapporteurs for the proposals in the European Parliament earlier this month to personally assure them of Ireland's commitment to making progress during the Irish Presidency.</p></reply>

Ireland&#8217;s public health policy objective in relation to tobacco remains to promote and subsequently move towards a tobacco free society.  I am committed to moving us closer towards that objective.</p><p>  The Tobacco Policy Review Group will be reporting to me shortly.  The report of this group will build on our existing policies and legislation<i>.  </i>This group is examining a number of areas which need to be developed or enhanced in order to reduce smoking prevalence in Ireland.  The report will also examine how to develop our cessation services in order to support those people who want to stop smoking.  Of major concern to me is the number of young people who are still taking up the addiction.  Research has shown that 78% of Irish smokers started smoking before they reached the age of 18, evidence that smoking initiation is largely a childhood and teenage phenomenon.  The &quot;denormalisation&#8221; of smoking within our society is key tool in stopping our children and young people from doing so.  To achieve this we must make smoking less attractive to children and increase its social unacceptability.</p><p>  I understand that in order for such initiatives to be successful they must be supported by the public.  It is also important, however, that everyone in society recognises their role in effecting change in our lifestyle behaviours such as smoking for the benefit of everyone.</p></reply>

In this regard, the HSE provides a range of services to women who continue to suffer the effects of having had this procedure.  These services include the provision of medical cards, the availability of independent clinical advice and the organisation of individual pathways of care and the arrangement of appropriate follow-up.</p><p>  As the Deputy is aware, my Department has commissioned an independent research report in relation to the practice of symphysiotomy in Ireland.  The research included a consultation process involving patient groups, health professionals and in particular the women who have experienced symphysiotomy.  The researcher is currently finalising the report based on the consultation and it is also planned to have a peer review process.  It is hoped that the report will be published early in 2013.  The research report will inform the Department&rsquo;s overall consideration of this matter, including the consideration of any actions that may be required and possible legal implications.  It would be premature for me to make any other comments at this stage on what actions might be taken, prior to giving full consideration to the recommendations of the report.</p></reply>

These include clearly documented processes and timelines for the assessment of new medicines in as timely a fashion as possible.  In accordance with these procedures, the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE) conducts a Health Technology Assessment (HTA) which provides detailed information on the potential budget impact of the medicine.  It also assesses whether the medicine is cost effective at the price quoted by the company in question.</p><p>  The NCPE published its report on the cost-effectiveness of Kalydeco on the 21st January.  The report concluded that &ldquo;In view of the very high drug acquisition cost, the significant budget impact, the absence of long term clinical data and the fact that the company has failed to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of ivacaftor we cannot recommend reimbursement of ivacaftor at the submitted price of &euro;234,804 per patient per annum.  A mechanism such as a performance based risk sharing scheme and/or a significant reduction in price could facilitate access to ivacaftor treatment for cystic fibrosis patients with the G551D CFTR mutation&rdquo;.</p><p>  The NCPE report is an important input to assist decision making and will help inform the next stage of the process which involves further discussions with the manufacturer of the drug, in accordance with the aforementioned procedures agreed with the pharmaceutical industry.  The HSE assessment process is intended to arrive at a decision on the funding of Kalydeco that is clinically appropriate, fair, consistent and sustainable. e HSE understands that patients, the Cystic Fibrosis Association of Ireland and clinicians are very anxious that a decision be made as soon as possible.  No further comment is possible at this time as the decision making process is ongoing.</p></reply>

The salary level was set having regard to the norms for such programmes and the need to achieve significant savings on nurse agency and overtime expenditure.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has also agreed that participants in this initiative will not be counted for the purposes of the Health Sector Employment Ceiling.  The initiative therefore provides a valuable opportunity for a substantial number of recently-qualified nurses and midwives to work in Ireland at a time when job opportunities in the public service are, regrettably, very limited.</p><p>  A proportion of graduate nurses and midwives were employed on temporary, time-limited contracts in autumn 2012 to cover the period between the end of their Fourth-Year 36-week clinical placement and the commencement in January 2013 of the clinical placements of the next cohort of Fourth-Year students.  Such contracts are not intended to be of long duration.

I must also have regard to the aims of: avoiding overcompensation of registered undertakings or former undertakings, maintaining the sustainability of the market, having fair and open competition in the health insurance market and avoiding the Risk Equalisation Fund having a surplus or deficit from year to year.</p><p>  The HIA Reports are very detailed and include substantial market sensitive data.

This followed the refusal of planning permission in February 2012 for the hospital on the Mater campus, and subsequently the establishment of an independent Review Group to consider next steps (the &ldquo;Dolphin Group&rdquo;).  Following the Government decision on the location, the first priority has been to consider governance issues for this complex and hugely important project, given the need to ensure that this project proceeds securely to completion.  I intend to bring a Memorandum to Government on these issues shortly.  Pending this, preliminary work is underway in relation to the project in its new location, while a review of urgent care centre(s) configuration is underway and a time-limited review of Dublin maternity services configuration is to commence as soon as possible.  While a significant proportion of the work that was done for the project on the Mater site, including the internal configuration and adjacencies, will be transferable, a new design for the new site will be required before a planning application can be made.</p></reply>

I have emphasised to the HSE the high priority the Government and I attach to this issue.  In January 2012, a detailed plan for the achievement of compliance by NCHDs with the Working Time Directive was submitted to the EU Commission.  The plan affirmed Ireland's commitment to achieving compliance with the Directive over a three-year time period.  It committed to implementing the measures necessary, including: the implementation of new work patterns for medical staff, transfer of work undertaken by NCHDs to other grades, and the organisation of hospital services to support compliance.</p><p>  The Health Service Executive&rsquo;s Service Plan for 2013 specifically recognises the need to address the issue as a priority, stating that there will be a particular focus in the acute hospital service on the achievement of compliance with the European Working Time Directive amongst the non-consultant hospital doctor workforce, in line with the Implementation Plan submitted to the Commission in 2012.  The HSE is currently finalising its National Operational Plan to support the implementation of the National Service Plan 2013.  This will specify in greater detail the actions to be taken during the year in relation to EWTD compliance.  A key priority for the HSE in 2013 will be a further reduction of average weekly hours worked and also a reduction in the duration of shifts undertaken.</p><p>  S.I. No. 494 of 2004 European Communities (Organisation of Working Time) (Activities of Doctors in Training) Regulations 2004, which transposed the EU Working Time Directive for doctors in training, provides for: A maximum 48 hour average working week; A 30 minute rest break every 6 hours during period on-site on-call; 11 hours rest every 24 hours or equivalent compensatory rest before return to work; and 35 hours continuous rest per week or twice a fortnight or 59 hours continuous rest per fortnight.  The 2010 Contract of Employment for NCHDs, which these staff sign on appointment, reflects the above provisions.  The contract also provides that NCHDs shall not be required to work more than 24 consecutive hours on-site.  A related agreement between the HSE and the Irish Medical Organisation provides that the contract is subject to the requirements of the Directive.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-01-29a.1446.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/982" speakername="Kathleen Lynch" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013012900076#WREE00700"><p>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 668, 676 and 677 together.</p><p>  Primary legislation and resources will be required for the introduction of a statutory regulation system for home care services.  The question of possible changes to legislation, including regulation and inspection for Home Care services for older people is under consideration.  The Department is examining this matter at present, in the overall context of the licensing of Health Care providers.  Legislation is currently being prepared in this regard, taking into account the recommendations of Commission on Patient Safety and the Law Reform Commission.  Various options are being considered at present, including the complex legal issues involved.</p><p>  Currently the focus is for the Health Service Executive (HSE) to implement national guidelines on Home Care Packages while also developing additional guidelines in relation to the Home Help service and Quality Guidelines for Home Care Support Services.  The latter two sets of guidelines are the subject of negotiations between the HSE and SIPTU, under the auspices of the Labour Court.</p><p>  In addition, the HSE introduced in mid-2012, a Public Procurement Framework for Home Care services.  These measures have been designed to enhance service provision overall, including quality and safety, for HSE home care recipients.  Awarding of contracts is conditional upon vetting and other governance and quality assurance mechanisms.</p><p>  The policies, guidelines, best practice standards, including legislation, are outlined in Part 2 of the Service Arrangements between the HSE and service providers.  Currently, no national policy pertaining to the safe administration of medication within the disability sector, as applied to domestic settings, is included within Part 2 of the Service Arrangement.</p><p>  Personal Assistants do not have responsibility or authority to administer medication directly to the service users.  However, as PAs are directed by the service user, it is possible that under the service user's direction and in line with the service's &quot;Safe Administration of Medication&quot; policy, they may assist the service user in self-medication, i.e. opening a container / blister pack due to physical and sensory restrictions.</p><p>  The remit of Care Workers that provide home support/home help type services is limited to supporting clients and the families in daily activities and is a &quot;domestic&quot; role.  In these cases, the home support workers work alongside the family of the service user and do not have a role in the management of medication, which remains the responsibility of the family/primary carer.</p><p>  The HSE has a clear expectation that all service providers have a &quot;Safe Administration of Medication&quot; policy in place.  Some service providers have identified to the HSE that they are looking at developing broader medication management policies and &quot;upskilling&quot; their staff to allow for the safe administration of medication, as the service users currently need to be attended by a Nurse when direct administration of medication is required i.e. insulin injection or PRN medication.</p><p>  Currently most service providers have policies in place when medication is self-administered with the support / observation of the staff i.e. opening a container/blister pack due to physical and sensory restrictions.  With the de-congregation of services and the development of community based services that offer semi-independent living for clients with physical and sensory and/or intellectual disabilities, service providers are developing a range of staff supports that necessitate the development of &quot;Safe Administration of Medication&quot; policies for these staff grades.  In this context, service providers will need to ensure that training is put in place for all staff grades alongside appropriate supervision and audit process.</p><p>  There is significant learning to be gained from the safe administration of medication practice within community residential settings, alongside the best practice in place by service providers in domestic settings.  These practices will be reviewed by the HSE, as the specification for Home Support and PA Services is developed for the disability sector in the coming months.  </p><p>  Insofar as regulation of residential services for people with disabilities are concerned, I can confirm that the Health and Information and Quality Authority will shortly be submitting standards for this sector to my Department for approval and it is anticipated that these will be launched in February.  These standards will confirm that residential centres should have appropriate policies and procedures for medication management.  However, these standards will only apply to residential services which are provided by the HSE or other service providers.  They would not be applicable to people living in their own homes. Work is underway on the regulations required to bring the standards into law and discussions are taking place at the moment on the resources and staffing required by HIQA from 2013 onwards.  </p><p>  It is expected that the new regulatory system should be up and running by mid 2013.  </p></reply>

In view of their potential for abuse, it is proposed to place them under the control of the Misuse of Drugs Regulations by making it an offence to import anabolic steroids other than for medical purposes.  Draft Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Regulations are currently being prepared and will be submitted for the Government's approval.  Following this, it will be necessary to notify the proposed legislation to the EU Commission and Member States to complete the 3 month EU notification period under the Technical Standards Directive.</p></reply>

A range of community and other services are provided for children with a disability including those with autism by or on behalf of the HSE.  Significantly the HSE is currently engaged in a reconfiguration of existing therapy resources to geographic based teams for children and young people with disabilities including those with autism under its Progressing Disabilities Programme for Children and Young People (0-18 years).  This aims to increase the level of consistency and standardisation in the way both early intervention services and services for school-aged children with disabilities are delivered.</p><p>  A detailed action plan is being implemented with the following objectives:</p><p> - One clear pathway to services for all children with disabilities according to need</p><p> - Resources used to the greatest benefit for all children and families</p><p> - Health and education working together to support children to achieve their potential.</p><p>  In practical terms this means that health professionals and parents will know exactly where a child should be referred and how to refer them. Services may be provided at primary care level or by early intervention and school age disability teams, with access to specialist services, according to the child&rsquo;s needs.The reconfiguration of existing therapy resources aims to ensure that the resources available are used to best effect.

The HSE prioritises for treatment patients with special needs, high risk patients and those who have greater clinical needs.  A free oral examination every calendar year and free emergency dental treatment with a focus on relief of pain and sepsis are available to all eligible patients.  Eligible patients can also receive two fillings, all extractions and a number of complex treatments. Prior approval from the HSE Service Area Principal Dental Surgeon is required for complex treatments.  When a patient requires secondary and/or tertiary level services a treatment plan including an estimate of costs should be submitted to the Service Area Principal Dental Surgeon for prior approval. The HSE would require specific details of the individual case referred to by the Deputy in order to respond to the issue raised. If the Deputy wishes to provide me with such details I will ask the HSE to examine the matter.</p></reply>

Routine vaccination is not recommended for boys.  According to research carried out by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the burden of disease associated with HPV 16/18 in males is small, as it is related to some anogenital and head and neck cancers and the efficacy of vaccines for the prevention of these relatively rare cancers is not yet known.  Following an evaluation of the HPV vaccine in the Irish context, the National Immunisation Advisory Committee recommended that all girls of 12 years of age should be offered HPV vaccination.</p></reply>

Employees may seek support on occupational safety, health and welfare from staff in human resources, health and safety, health promotion, occupational health services, employee assistance and staff counselling services. The role of the staff in these areas is to provide relevant and timely advice, guidance and support to managers and employees on how to comply with their legislative duties and create a positive working environment that takes account of employee well-being and, where appropriate, they can also provide counselling to employees.  They also help to promote effective safety, health and welfare practices and to develop relevant training programmes.</p><p>  As part of a framework for understanding and addressing employee well-being and welfare priorities, additional support is provided to staff through the implementation of a range of HSE Policies and Procedures including <i>Prevention and Management of Stress in the Workplace; Preventing and Managing Critical Incident Stress in the Workplace; Rehabilitation of Employees back to work following illness or injury</i> and   <i>Employee Welfare and Well-being Strategy.</i></p></reply>

With this in mind, the current Programme for Government  includes a specific commitment to put the draft standards developed by the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) on a statutory footing and ensure that the services are inspected by HIQA. These draft standards outline what is expected of a provider of services and what a person with a disability, his or her family, and the public can expect to receive from residential care services.</p><p>  A public consultation process has recently been completed by HIQA on the draft standards document and it is now in the process of being finalised and submitted to the Board of the Authority. The final agreed standards will then be forwarded to my Department for approval with an anticipated publication date in February 2013. It is expected that the new regulatory system which will allow for a robust registration and inspection of Residential Centres should be up and running by mid 2013.  Work is also continuing in my Department on both the 'Registration and Inspection' regulations and the 'Care and Welfare' regulations required to bring the standards into law. These are being developed taking into account the lessons learned from similar regulations for nursing homes.  </p><p>  My Department has also been in active engagement with HIQA on the level of resources and staffing needed. 10 posts which will enable the Authority commence preparatory work for the registration and inspection regime have already been approved. My Department is continuing discussions with HIQA to determine the longer term staffing and resource requirements and it is expected that agreement on this element will be finalised shortly.  While the HIQA standards have yet to be put on a statutory footing, it is worth noting that compliance with the HIQA standards is already included in the Service Level Arrangements between the HSE and service providers in the disability sector.</p></reply>

The National Council for the Professional Development of Nursing and Midwifery was dissolved on the 31st December, 2011.  In relation to the Opticians Board, a Working Group was established in 2010 to provide legislatively for the subsumation of the Opticians Board into the Health and Social Care Professionals Council.  It is expected that the draft heads will be available during 2013 for Ministerial approval as part of the Health and Social Care Professionals (Amendment) Bill 2013 and rationalisation of the Opticians Board is expected during 2014.

In this regard, one service that is actively being progressed at present is paediatric congenital cardiac surgery.  There have been a number of meetings and teleconferences between the Department of Health and the Department of Health and Social Services and Public Safety, the Health Service Executive (HSE) and Northern Ireland Commissioning Services and Our Lady's Hospital Crumlin, and contacts are continuing with a view to determining as soon as possible how best an all-island service might be established and how soon this could be realised if it is determined, through consultation, to be the optimum solution.  A project team has also been established, comprising of the HSE, Our Lady's Hospital Crumlin and the Department of Health, to address potential service issues and requirements.  Our Lady's Hospital Crumlin, Dublin 12 has since 2009 been assisting the Belfast Health and Social Care Trust in providing Paediatric Congenital Cardiac Surgery Services to  patients from Northern Ireland.  Our Lady's Hospital Crumlin cared for 9 such patients in 2011 and 28 in 2012.</p><p>  I am considering how the new children's hospital might best contribute to an all-island health service for children. I have discussed this possibility with my colleague Minister Poots and further discussions have been held between our respective Departments in this regard. I am seeking to ensure the involvement of Northern Ireland members in the governance arrangements for both the building of the new hospital and the board which needs to be set up to help govern the existing Dublin children's hospitals and the new hospital in the longer term. I will consider what the model used in the Altnagelvin development can contribute in this regard. </p><p>  I am very much committed to working together with my Northern colleagues on issues of common concern and benefit. This is of particular relevance in the current time when both jurisdictions are implementing change and pushing forward  health reform.  Terms of Reference for engagement between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland on acute hospital issues are expected to be agreed shortly.</p></reply>

The NTPF is now fully aligned with the SDU and is targeting waiting lists strategically and incentivising hospitals to manage their waiting times proactively.  The NTPF capability is a core part of the SDU's performance-improvement role in holding public hospitals to account.</p><p>  Statutory responsibility for the collection, collation and validation of data on waiting times and numbers of persons waiting for hospital treatment rests with the NTPF.  The NTPF collects information on hospital in-patients and day case waiting times and has now taken over the reporting of outpatient waiting time data.  The collation and analysis of outpatient waiting time data in a standardised format will reveal the distribution of long waiters across all hospitals.  In the first instance, this will allow the SDU to target resources towards those patients who are waiting longest and ensure that they are seen and assessed.  A maximum waiting time target has now been set of 12 months for a first-time outpatient appointment by 30 November 2013.  In parallel with reducing the numbers of longest waiters, the SDU will also work with the HSE clinical programmes to reform the structure, organisation and delivery of outpatient services to ensure that the right patient is seen and assessed by the right health professional at the right time.</p></reply>

This is standardised for gender and age of the GP's panel.  One hundred percent of GPs have access to the website and the majority are active users.</p><p>   To further assist GPs, a snapshot of Benzodiazepine/'Z'  claims presented in community pharmacies for the month of November 2011 was generated in January 2012 and provided to each GMS doctor at the end of January 2012.  Three pieces of information were provided in the letter to all GMS GPs:</p><p> 1. the prescribing frequency standardised for gender/panel profile of benzodiazepines and &lsquo;Z&rsquo; medicines;                   </p><p> 2. the number of patients who were presenting prescriptions for periods more than three, six and12 months; and </p><p> 3. a pictorial representation of their individual prescribing against the national profile.</p><p>  This exercise was repeated during the year.  It is important that sufficient time is given between such reports to enable the GP to reflect and consider adjustment of practice where appropriate.  Individual GPs have generally been very supportive of the initiative to date.  In line with the policy to standardise the arrangements under the State drug schemes and ensure that GPs have a full involvement in their patients medications as whole, including their psychiatric drugs, clients who hold a medical card, in the former Eastern Regional Health Authority area, now attend their GP to get their outpatient prescription from psychiatric services written on a GMS prescription form.  This enables a more complete overview to be conducted prospectively but has complicated the trend analysis for 2011/2012.  Hospital in-patient prescribing is not captured by the information available through the Primary Care Reimbursement Service.</p></reply>

However, the cost of hiring a nurse full time would be greater than this when employers' PRSI and premium payments are factored in.  At 31 December 2012 there were 34,637 WTEs employed in the nursing staff category in the health service.  This figure includes categories such as public health nurses as well as nursing management staff.</p><p>  The Government has decided that the numbers employed across the public service must be reduced in order to meet its fiscal and budgetary targets.  The health sector must make its contribution to that reduction.  This policy requires that by the end of 2013, the health service achieves a work force of 98,955 whole-time equivalents (WTEs).  This figure is not broken down by staff category.  The HSE may continue to recruit nurses and midwives in exceptional circumstances where it has been established that there is an urgent service requirement and this can be accommodated within the budgetary and staff number limits in place.  Such recruitment is separate to and independent of the Graduate Employment Initiative recently launched.  Nursing staff appointed under that scheme will not be counted for the purposes of the health Employment Control Framework.

CervicalCheck aims to reduce the incidence of and mortality from cervical cancer by detecting changes in the cells of the cervix before they become cancerous.  It is a priority for the National Cancer Screening Service (NCSS) to ensure that its programmes are accessible to all eligible women in the population.  Some women experience challenges and barriers that hinder their access to screening services for different reasons including fear, anxiety, intellectual and physical disabilities, language barriers and literacy difficulties.  </p><p>  The NCSS has a comprehensive communications and screening promotion approach that aims to inform, educate and encourage women to participate in the CervicalCheck programme.  Communication includes public relations, advertising and screening promotion.  The NCSS has a team of screening promotion officers based in Cork, Dublin, Galway and Limerick who work on a national basis.  The overarching aim of screening promotion is to increase awareness.  The team has implemented specific initiatives to help overcome barriers and to encourage eligible women, particularly harder-to-reach women, to participate in CervicalCheck. </p></reply>

The on-going effort to reduce the tragedy of road deaths is working but such change has come about by the contributions of every single road user.  It has been a long journey but most of our citizens now recognise that it is irresponsible to drink drive.</p><p>  The current drink driving limits were introduced in October 2011.  They were not introduced on a whim or without any consideration of the issues involved.  A balance had to be stuck between the rights of the person and the rights of citizens to be kept safe.  The advice that I received was overwhelmingly in favour of reducing the drink driving limit to a lower, more moderate level for most drivers and an effective zero tolerance level for professional and novice drivers.  Even with these lower limits and changing attitudes, drink driving is still a primary cause of road collisions and the behaviour leads to many deaths and injuries as there is irrefutable evidence that any alcohol in the system can impair driving.  </p><p>  However, I do understand and appreciate that isolation can certainly exacerbate existing mental health problems but for the State to encourage the consumption of alcohol as a remedy for complex health issues, would be irresponsible in the extreme. Indeed, alcohol is a factor in a large number of suicides.  Issues relating to the health of rural communities and the need to support enrichment in rural life require a multifaceted approach by Government.  I am willing to work closely with my colleagues to address such issues from within my portfolio as Minister of Transport, Tourism and Sport but I cannot support, in the best interests and safety of all our citizens, a backward and regressive step in attitudes towards, and laws relating to, drink driving.</p></reply>

However, the power to decide the speed limit applying to individual roads within an area rests with the relevant road authority, i.e. City Council, County Council or County Borough Corporation, in consultation with the Garda Commissioner, and with the consent of the National Roads Authority in the case of national roads.  Under Section 9 of the Road Traffic Act, 1994, the relevant road authority may make bye-laws in respect of the application of certain speed limits to specified public roads in their administrative areas. Road safety is a major consideration in the application of speed limits and enforcement is a matter for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p><p>  My Department issued Guidelines for the Application of Special Speed Limits in January 2011 to all local authorities and the onus is on them to take those Guidelines into account in relation to special speed limits to be set for all roads in their area of responsibility. The purpose of these guidelines is to provide advice and guidance in relation to the making of speed limit bye-laws by county and city councils for the purpose of applying special speed limits. After taking the guidelines into account it is considered best practice for local authority officials to advise the elected members of their respective councils on what a suitable speed limit regime should be for different roads in their areas of responsibility. For new roads the local authority will have the relevant information on the speed for which the road was designed.

With the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, I intend to nominate a Chairperson designate to this position in the near future. The Chairperson designate will be required to appear before the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Transport and Communications to outline their suitability for the post and subsequent to their appearance, I will appoint them to the position.

In particular, I placed importance on having board members with legal, accountancy and maritime skills.  I was concerned that the terms of Ministerially nominated members of the outgoing board all expired during the course of 2012. As the Deputy will agree, this is unsatisfactory from a corporate governance perspective. Therefore I have sought to stagger the terms of the current board to ensure that, if necessary, there can be a regular turnover of board members.</p></reply>

I have received some correspondence on the issues referred to by the Deputy.  Contrary to the premise of the question, there was no decision taken by my Department regarding the capture of photographs for licence purposes under the new system.  The RSA is in charge of the new system, and was responsible both for designing the new system and for running the tender process for outsourced elements of that system. </p><p>  The new system involves three outsourced elements, a card production facility, a front office for engaging with the customer, and a back office to process applications.  All three are to be overseen by a &lsquo;centre of excellence&rsquo; based in the RSA itself.   The card licence is standardised across the European Union and therefore there must be consistency in the quality and standard of information used.  The photograph will be digital and will not be stuck on to the card in the way it is to the current paper licence.  The capture of the photograph is included in the fee for the licence.  As the system develops, the SAFE2 ID standard will be  implemented, at which point the only option will be the digital photo taken at the Front Office Network. In addition the new system will be convenient for customers as they will only have to pay one fee and make one trip to get their licence and photograph.</p></reply>

I understand that over 62% of all international travel reservations are made using the internet and that is why F&aacute;ilte Ireland has a suite of supports available to accommodation providers to assist them in using the internet.  The purpose of these supports, which are very popular with accommodation providers, is to allow them to take maximum advantage of the market exposure afforded by the internet to drive business, including through their own websites and through social media. </p><p>  The decision to use any particular booking engine or online travel agent is a commercial choice for the accommodation provider.  In this regard, accommodation providers need to take into account the commission rates on rooms sold and the market exposure and flow of business that a particular booking engine/online travel agent may deliver as against the cost of promoting their business directly. F&aacute;ilte Ireland does not promote any particular engine and merely provides the tools for businesses to make their own informed marketing and booking choice.  The provision of business supports to individual businesses is an operational matter for F&aacute;ilte Ireland and I have asked the agency to reply directly to the Deputy in regard to the specific circumstances outlined.

I anticipate that the Group will report to me shortly, and I will give careful consideration to any recommendations contained in their Report.  Section 9 of the Road Traffic Act, 2004, allows road authorities to make bye-laws which allow the application of special speed limits on public roads within in their administrative areas. To assist in setting special speed limits, my Department issued Guidelines for the Application of Special Speed Limits to all local authorities in January 2011 and the onus is on local authorities to take them into account in relation to any special speed limits which they set. </p></reply>

The 2003 EU Energy Tax Directive incorporated special derogations which allowed specific excise duty reliefs to be applied in a number of Member States below the EU minimum duty rate.  In the case of public transport services, these derogations included reduced rates to apply to fuel used for scheduled bus services.  While these derogations expired on 31 December 2006, Ireland, along with other Member States, sought retention of its derogations beyond that date.  However the European Commission refused all such requests.  The Finance Act 2008 provided the basis for the removal of these excise duty reliefs with effect from 1 November 2008. </p><p>  At that time, I understand some consideration was given to alternative support mechanisms that could be appropriate and could be done in a manner compatible with EU State Aid and other legal requirements.  However, introducing an alternative suitable mechanism was not considered possible in the economic circumstances at that time.  I understand the Minister for Finance has received a number of submissions from, and on behalf of, private coach operators seeking to have the auto-diesel excise duty relief for licensed road hauliers that was announced in the Budget extended to them. He has indicated that he will consider these proposals and the level of the rebate in the context of the Finance Bill. </p></reply>
