The funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 380,000 young people.  In 2015, funding of &euro;49.9 m was provided to my Department for these schemes.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to advise the Deputy that Budget 2016 has provided an additional &euro;1.1m in current youth funding to my Department bringing the total allocation for the youth services to &euro;51m in 2016. This additional funding will be used for programmes that target disadvantaged young people and to assist national youth organisations in their work to support local voluntary youth services.</p>  <p>  An additional &euro;2.25m in capital funding, also provided in Budget 2016, will be used to support small scale projects, including refurbishment, health and safety fit-outs and accessibility improvements in local youth services.</p>  <p>  In October, I announced a new &euro;600,000 Youth Employability Initiative, funded under the Dormant Account Funding Scheme. The initiative will provide grants to youth services for innovative programmes that target young people who are not in education, employment or training to improve their employability skills.</p>  <p>  Last week, I was pleased to allocate &euro;1.17m in &lsquo;once-off&rsquo; funding to assist youth projects that are experiencing budgetary difficulties as they approach the end of the year. The youth projects came to my Department's attention through engagement with the national youth organisations, youth officers in the Education and Training Boards, through representations and submissions received and through regular meetings with youth services in the course of the year. </p>  <p>  These additional  investments in the voluntary youth services in 2015 and 2016 have been widely welcomed by youth sector interests.</p></reply>

It will also fund the significant expansion of the ECCE Programme.</p>  <p>  At present, children qualify for the free pre-school provision under this Programme when they are within the qualifying age range which is 3 years and 2 months to 4 years and 7 months in the September of the relevant year.  The recent Budget decisions, mean that children can access the ECCE Programme from the time they are 3 years of age until they start primary school.  </p>  <p>  This extended provision, when fully rolled out, will mean that children will have access to free education - either in pre-school or primary school - from the age of three.  In addition, the number of children benefiting from free pre-school provision is expected to increase from around 67,000 to 127,000 in a given programme year.</p>  <p>  In order to provide the early years sector with the time to expand provision to meet the increased demand, a decision was made to introduce this new measure from September 2016.  This timeframe will allow pre-school providers to make any necessary infrastructural or service changes and to put in place extra staff resources to accommodate the additional demand. </p>  <p>  The Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) Programme is also implemented by my Department and  supports disadvantaged parents, parents in low paid employment and parents in training or education, by enabling those who qualify to avail of reduced childcare costs at participating community/not-for-profit childcare services. </p>  <p>  Due to economic constraints, Budget 2012 closed the CCS programme to new applications from community/not-for-profit childcare services wishing to enter the programme and to the expansion of services by existing providers. Under Budget 2016, I lifted these restrictions and provided &euro;16 million in additional funding to further expand the CCS programme, to include its roll-out to private childcare providers, in a targeted manner. This additional investment will create a further 8,000 places in areas identified as being in significant need of CCS provision. </p>  <p>  To meet the increased demand for childcare that will result from this very significant investment, Budget 2016 also provides funding for a number of measures to improve the quality of childcare and to build capacity in the sector. These measures include a restoration of capitation rates to pre-2012 levels for pre-school providers delivering the ECCE Programme, funding to upskilling the workforce and funding for the Early Years Capital Programme 2016.</p>  <p>  In addition, and in recognition of the significant barriers childcare presents to parents wanting to take up employment, education or training, and the complexities of working through the different childcare programmes funded by my Department, the Budget 2016 package also funded the establishment of a dedicated Project Team to develop a single Affordable Childcare Programme to provide working families with good quality childcare at a cost they can afford. Work on the Affordable Childcare Programme will begin immediately, so that it can be in place in 2017. This single programme will replace the existing CCS, along with the Training and Employment Childcare programmes, comprising the After-School Childcare, Childcare Education and Training Support, and Community Employment Childcare. It will provide a new simplified subsidy programme, available through both community/not-for-profit and private childcare providers. As more investment is made available over the coming years, it can be directed to families through this subsidised programme. The objective is to make childcare more affordable for more families.</p></reply>

This brought together the statutory functions and educational welfare programmes which had been under the remit of the then National Educational Welfare Board. These include the statutory Educational Welfare Officers service, the School Completion Programme and the Home School Community Liaison scheme.  The reorganisation of services is part of a new integrated response to meet the needs of children at risk of disadvantage, including educational disadvantage.</p><p>Tusla has a wide ranging remit in services to protect children, support families and secure good outcomes for children who are at risk of disadvantage including educational disadvantage. Tusla has strong cooperation arrangements in place with relevant Government departments and agencies to support this role. At national level, Tusla works as part of the Children and Young Peoples Policy Consortium, which comprises high level representation from Government departments and agencies to drive the  implementation of <i>Better Outcomes Brighter  Futures 2014-2020, the National Policy Framework for Children and Young People. </i>At local level, Tusla works with cross sectoral interests in the Children and Young Peoples Services Committees throughout the country.</p><p>In my view, Tusla&rsquo;s role, encompassing the key educational welfare programmes, along with its focus on child and family welfare, presents an opportunity to shape more effective policy and practice that will help to address educational disadvantage.</p><p>Tusla has taken a number of actions to strengthen the operation of its education welfare programmes, to integrate them at both national and local level, and to build strong links with relevant agencies and Government departments,  as part of a &lsquo;whole child&rsquo; approach to meeting the needs of children and their families.  Tusla works closely with my Department and with the Department of Education and Skills to achieve these aims. </p><p>My Department will participate in the Inter Departmental Group thatthe Minister for Education and Skills is establishing on the DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) programme. Tusla will have a key role in the work of the Group to deliver support in a &lsquo;joined up way&rsquo; and  secure improved outcomes for children at risk of educational disadvantage.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-12-02a.16.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015120200078#WRA01100"><p>The Report of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse (The Ryan Report) was published in 2009 and detailed disturbing and significant levels of historic abuse of Irish children who were placed, by the State, in residential institutions run by religious orders. The Government accepted all of the recommendations of the Ryan Report, and in response developed an Implementation Plan. The Implementation Plan set out a series of 99 actions which addressed the recommendations to improve services to children in care, in detention and at risk.</p>  <p>  The Government approved the Fourth and Final Monitoring Report of the Ryan Implementation Group which illustrated that the vast majority of the recommendations (i.e. 94 out of a total of 99), have been implemented or are being implemented on an ongoing basis.  The fourth and final report was laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on 13 March 2015.</p>  <p>  It should also be noted that the Monitoring Group, which authored the Report, welcomed the significant positive developments that have taken place over the lifetime of the Implementation Plan. While overall progress in relation to the actions in the Ryan Implementation Plan was good, it was noted that 5 of the 99 actions were not yet complete, namely actions 1, 65, 75, 76 and 96.  Actions 65, 75 and 76 relate to the Child and Family Agency (Tusla) as follows:</p>  <p> - Action 65 - a longitudinal study over ten years was to be undertaken which would follow young people who leave care, in order to map their transition into adulthood; </p>  <p> - Action 75 - a professionally managed national archive was to be developed as a central repository for the records for all children in care; and</p>  <p> - Action 76 - records created in non-statutory agencies should be secured in the national archive. </p>  <p>  These actions have not been implemented to date due to the resource implications and the challenging economic environment we faced.  In this regard, the Deputy will be aware that I have secured an allocation of funding of &euro;676m in 2016 for Tusla. This is an increase of &euro;38m over the 2015 provision and may give Tusla the opportunity to progress a number of valuable projects, including the Ryan actions. The Performance Statement issued to Tusla from my Department for 2016 references these projects, and my Department will engage with Tusla to explore options on how best to proceed in relation to these actions in the context of Tusla's business planning processes for 2016. </p>  <p>  The remaining actions, Nos 1 and 96, relate to the Department of Education and Skills and the Court Services, respectively.  I have asked to be kept informed of developments in this regard.</p>  <p>  In relation to all five outstanding recommendations I will continue to liaise with relevant Government colleagues and Tusla as regards implementation. I have undertaken to keep the Government informed of progress until full implementation is achieved, and I intend to revert to Government in early 2016 with an update in this regard.</p></reply>

From September 2016, I am expanding this Programme to allow children enrol in free pre-school from the time they are 3 years of age and to remain there until they start primary school.  This extended free pre-school provision was first recommended by the Expert Advisory Group on the Early Years Strategy in 2013. It was also one of a series of recommendations of the recent Inter-Departmental Group on Future Investment in Childcare, which I established in January last.  The Group consulted widely with a range of stakeholders, including the early years sector, during the course of its work. </p>  <p>  Under this extended Programme, there will be three opportunities for eligible children to enrol during the pre-school year: children who reach the age of 3 between April and August will have the opportunity to enrol in September; children who reach the age of 3 between September and December will have the opportunity to enrol in January; and children who reach the age of 3 between January and March will have the opportunity to enrol in April. As a result of this extension, the number of children benefiting from the Programme is expected to rise from around 67,000 to 127,000 in a given programme year. For the 2016/17 programme year, it is estimated that 89,500 children will be eligible to enrol in the Programme from September 2016, 22,000 from January 2017 and 15,500 from April 2017.</p>  <p>  In order to provide the early years sector with the time to build capacity to meet this increased demand, a decision was taken to introduce this new measure from September 2016. As the increased demand for Programme is not expected to peak until January and April 2017, this timeframe should allow pre-school providers to make any necessary infrastructural or service changes and to put in place extra staff resources to accommodate the additional demand. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that there is already additional capacity in the early years sector to cope with some of the increased demand. Indeed, the Annual Survey of Early Years Services, which was conducted in December 2014, estimates that there are more than 24,000 vacancies in early years services across the country with almost 13,000 of these vacancies in sessional services. I am also aware that every year a significant number of new pre-school providers apply to participate in this Programme. The increased demand for, and additional investment in, free pre-school provision going forward should encourage a greater numbers of applicants. </p>  <p>  The restoration of capitation rates to pre-2012 levels from September 2016 should also encourage a greater number of new applicants and encourage existing pre-school providers to expand.</p>  <p>  I am clear that more capacity will be required and that the implementation of this extended programme of free pre-school provision may pose a challenge for pre-school providers. Officials at my Department are already working closely with the City and County Childcare Committees and the Voluntary Childcare Organisations to develop a range of measures, which will assist with meeting this challenge. Further information on these measures will be available shortly.</p>  <p>  My Department has recently completed the development of an on-line management platform - the Programmes Implementation Platform  - to provide for the administration of a range of childcare programmes including the Early Childhood Care and Education Programme.  The objectives of this development are to reduce paperwork and duplication of effort, to simplify administration and to enhance the service experience of pre-school providers and the other stakeholders involved, including City or County Childcare Committees. The IT system also provides more efficient work practices, greater visibility and control of funds and assists greatly with prompt payment of pre-school providers.</p></reply>

Tusla will continue to provide such supports in the future. </p>  <p>  Respond informed me that it is not accepting any new referrals to the Centre. At the time of the meeting there were five families in residence at the Centre. Permanent accommodation had been secured for two of the families. The remaining three families residing at the Centre required to be housed.  The local housing authorities are best placed to address such needs.</p>  <p>  At the meeting, Respond outlined how it decided to build the Cuan &Aacute;lainn Centre on foot of its own needs analysis, which determined that the area did not need another domestic violence refuge, but there was a need for move-on accommodation for those using emergency refuges.</p>  <p>  In general, the Centre provides transitional housing for survivors of domestic violence after their emergency needs have been met. The majority of referrals to the Centre are from existing domestic violence refuges already funded by Tusla.</p>  <p>  Each of the families at the Centre has housing needs, and these are best provided through mainstream housing supports via local authorities.</p>  <p>  I advised Respond that I would contact my colleague, the Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government to establish what can be done to assist the families involved, particularly in light of the housing needs of the families who reside at the Cuan &Aacute;lainn Centre. I have done that and also asked Minister Kelly to ensure that there is further engagement by the relevant local authorities with Respond regarding the future of the service.</p>  <p>  I would also like to assure the Deputy that Tusla will continue to work closely with these families by providing appropriate community supports.</p></reply>

This process continues to highlight the need for ongoing improvements in the operation of the Oberstown campus.  However, it must be acknowledged that the HIQA report also outlines a number of clear improvements since the previous inspection.  These include for example: the commissioning of new residential units from March 2015; the employment of new residential care staff; the progress being made toward a new offending behaviour programme; significant improvements in handling of child protection concerns and complaints oversight, and  the focus on mental health needs of children under the Assessment, Consultation and Therapy Service.</p>  <p>  I accept that more work is necessary on a number of issues identified by HIQA, in particular that of single separation of children.  On this issue, the report found that management were actively engaging with staff teams on the use of single separation, and that the policy for authorisations of separation had significantly improved.  However, ongoing work is required to address the issues related to its use and this is reflected in the updated action plan which has been drawn up by the Oberstown campus and agreed with HIQA on foot of recommendations made in the inspection report.  I have also commissioned a review by my Department of the single separation policies in use across the range of children&rsquo;s residential care settings and this has recently commenced. </p>  <p>  The updated action plan identifies ongoing areas of improvement for the delivery of services on the campus to ensure the journey of a young person through Oberstown is seamless.  This incorporates areas such as care, education, health, offending behaviour and preparations for discharge.  A full time training manager has recently been appointed for the campus and an updated training plan is currently being delivered covering areas such as management of challenging behaviour, fire safety, crisis prevention and intervention, manual handling, child protection, safeguarding and first aid.  Further improvements in medication management and staff supervision are also being pursued. </p>  <p>  A further inspection was also carried out by HIQA in November and I understand that the initial feedback from this inspection has been broadly positive.</p>  <p>  I also wish to note that a comprehensive reform programme has been underway on the campus in recent years to provide improved facilities, in order to accommodate older children under the Government commitment to end the practice of detaining children in adult prison facilities.  The steps contained in the updated HIQA action plan will be implemented in parallel with this on-going reform programme.</p></reply>

My colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, has primary responsibility in the area of asylum and immigration, including direct provision.  My Department&rsquo;s policy responsibility for the refugee children arriving with their parents relates to providing family support and care and protection for any child where a concern is identified for their welfare and safety.</p>  <p>  Children living in Direct Provision are in the care of their parent(s). Where there are concerns about their welfare, safety or well-being this should be referred to Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, in line with Children First guidelines.  Tusla works closely with the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) of the Department of Justice and Equality, regarding issues which impact on the ongoing welfare and protection of children living in direct provision. Tusla has appointed identified lead social workers to liaise with managers of direct provision regarding support and information for newly arrived residents. There are a range of family support type provision, and early years education in direct provision centres. Additionally there are supports provided by the HSE and the Department of Social Protection. </p>  <p>  Separated Children Seeking Asylum are placed in the care of the State, with Tusla. Following a residential assessment, the  majority of separated children are placed in foster care and Tusla has a dedicated Social Work team to deal with this vulnerable cohort. The State is duty bound by international and domestic law to protect and provide for separated children in the same way as it does for children normally resident in the State. A social worker is allocated to each separated child and they have responsibility for the development and implementation of an individualised statutory care plan for the child. Tusla maintains the equity and equality of services to separated children vis a vis other children in state care and ensures that there is no differentiation of standard care provision, care practices, care priorities, standards or protocols. All foster care organisations and residential centres are inspected against national standards. </p>  <p>  In relation to minors arriving unaccompanied under the Irish Refugee Protection Programme, my Department and Tusla have been in contact with the Department of Justice and Equality  to ensure all support services are identified, and to ensure the necessary attention and support is given to their needs on their arrival into Ireland.</p></reply>

Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, within its national office, has a dedicated Quality Assurance Team. This team produces monthly, quarterly and annual reports in respect of Tusla's functions, and includes detailed reporting on key performance indicators. These reports give a good indication of the number of children and families in receipt of or requiring intervention.  The reports also provide statistical evidence of improvements to child welfare and protection services and highlights challenges and areas where further improvement is required.  The reports show the number of child welfare and protection referrals in the period, the numbers that have been screened and assessed and those cases that are awaiting an allocated social worker. </p>  <p>  Tusla also provides me with information on children in care, their placement type, care status and allocation of social worker.  Within my Department there is a Unit which scrutinises these reports and briefs me and senior officials on issues of note. This Unit also reviews and analyses HIQA and Tusla inspection reports of children's residential centres, special care centres, fostering and child protection services. The overview from these reports provides me with a level of assurance on the overall capacity of Tusla to identify and provide services to families and children at risk. Additional information is gleaned from the National Review Panel reports on individual cases, and investigations conducted by the Omudsman for Children. </p>  <p>  Additionally, my officials  frequently meet with Tusla to review the overall level of provision of service, including areas in need of improvement. I also meet with Tusla on a quarterly basis in this regard.

The project is supported in this work by my Department, the One Foundation and Atlantic Philanthropies.  </p>  <p>  The aims and objectives of the project are to:</p>  <p> - Provide information to the public on child care proceedings in the courts;</p>  <p> - Conduct research on these proceedings in order to promote debate and inform policy-makers;</p>  <p> - Make recommendations to address any short-comings in the child care system identified by the research;</p>  <p> - Assist in the implementation of these recommendations; and</p>  <p> - Promote confidence in the child care system.</p>  <p>  The project pursues its aims and objectives by attending the courts where child care cases are heard in order to report on those proceedings while protecting the anonymity of the children and their families.  The CCLRP publishes reports of child care cases for the public and all relevant stake-holders, collects and analyses data from the proceedings, publishes reports on the nature and outcomes of the child care proceedings and seeks to promote a public debate on the issues raised through seminars and conferences.  One such conference took place in April of this year in the form of an International Conference on Child Protection and the Law, which considered some of the findings up to that point, and heard from international contributors in relation to alternative models of care and child protection.</p>  <p>  Child care cases, heard mainly in the District Courts, involve applications by the Child and Family Agency for orders to protect children, including supervision orders, emergency and interim care orders and full care orders.  Under supervision orders, families receive help and supervision from the Agency; under care orders, the child is placed on either an interim or more permanent basis in care.  The cases are heard in camera in order to protect the privacy of the children and their families.  There are rarely written judgments in the District Court.</p>  <p>  To date, the project has published 11 volumes of case reports &ndash; four volumes each year in 2013 and 2014 and three so far in 2015, the most recent of which was published on 1 October, 2015 and which contained 37 case histories.  It has also published two interim reports, in November, 2013 and October, 2014.  As the Deputy will be aware, the final report was published on Monday last (30 November).</p>  <p>  Thus far, the project has highlighted variations in child care applications and outcomes, including by region, ethnicity and by family status.  These require further research to determine the reasons for the variations and to see how more targeted interventions can, where possible, ensure that the level of intervention is the most appropriate.</p>  <p>  Overall, the project will provide a measure of the effectiveness of current systems and policies in the area of child protection and that of court administration, and assist in identifying areas where corrective action may be required.  Ultimately, it will assist my Department in gaining a greater depth of knowledge and understanding of child care cases and will increase the evidence base on which future policy formulation is based.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be interested to learn that my Department will continue to fund the project until 2017.</p></reply>

The Government continues to work hard to house families living in hotel rooms and guest houses. </p><p>Play and recreation facilities are important to children and young people in all settings, including in the type of emergency accommodation referred to by the Deputy.

Tusla provides core funding to Family Resource Centres to cover the employment of two to three members of staff and some overhead costs. The Family Resource Centre Programme's funding for 2015 provided by Tusla was &euro;13.09 million.</p>  <p>  Family Resource Centres (FRCs) are front-line services rooted in the community they serve.  Acting as a focal point within their community, Family Resource Centres provide a holistic service of child, family and community support and advocacy to all children and families in their community. While Family Resource Centres operate an open-door policy and provide many services and development opportunities at a universal level, they also proactively target specific cohorts within their communities.  </p>  <p>  In addition to funding individual Family Resource Centres in 2015, Tusla also provided funding of &euro;60,000 to the Family Resource Centre National Forum (FRCNF) to assist it in providing support to Family Resource Centres around the country. The Agency fully appreciates and values the work of the Forum as a support network working with all the Family Resource Centres throughout Ireland.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, I announced a significant increase in the funding allocation to Tusla for next year. Tusla will have available to it some &euro;676 million in funding, representing an increase of &euro;38 million over 2015.</p>  <p>  The precise level of funding to be provided to Family Support Centres for next year will now be considered by Tusla in developing its Business Plan for 2016, which will be sent to me for consideration.</p>  <p>  The Government, since its establishment, has attached particular priority to supporting vulnerable children and families and the significant increase in funding being made available to Tusla next year represents further evidence of our delivery on this ambition.</p></reply>

This Group reported to Government in July this year, setting out a range of options for future investment to enhance affordability, increase the accessibility and improve the quality of early years and after-school childcare.  </p>  <p>  Several recommendations of the Group, which relate to after-school childcare, were considered as part of the Estimates process for the Budget and will be funded in 2016. These include a &euro;3 million capital fund, which will be provided to enable both community/not-for-profit and private providers to develop after-school childcare services using existing school and other accessible community facilities. Work will also begin on the development of Quality Standards for After-School Childcare, along with a consultation with children on their views about after-school childcare.</p>  <p>  These new developments add to the range of programmes implemented by my Department to assist parents in accessing quality and affordable after-school childcare. These include:</p>  <p> - The After-School Childcare (ASCC) programme that provides after-school care for primary school children of eligible parents for a period of 52 weeks.  Eligibility for the programme is determined by the Department of Social Protection.  The programme contributes &euro;40 per week for an after-school place or &euro;80 per week in situations where the childcare service provides a pick-up service that collects the child from school. The programme also provides a full day care rate of &euro;105 per week, for a maximum of 10 weeks, to cater for school holiday periods. In all cases, the maximum fee payable by parents is &euro;15 per week per child.</p>  <p> - The Community Employment Childcare (CEC) programme, which is targeted specifically at participants in the Community Employment (CE) schemes operated by the Department of Social Protection.  Under this programme, &euro;80 per week is provided for pre-school places for children up to the age of 5 and &euro;40 per week for after-school places for primary school children up to the age of 13, with a set charge of &euro;15 per week to the parent in either case. The programme also provides a part time day care rate of &euro;80 per week, for a maximum of 10 weeks, to cater for school holiday periods.  Places are approved for 50 weeks. Eligibility for the CEC programme is determined by the Department of Social Protection.</p>  <p> - The Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programme, which provides childcare places, including part-time and after-school places, to qualifying Solas or Education and Training Boards (ETB) trainees or students for the duration of their courses.  Eligibility for the CETS programme is determined by the Department of Education and Skills. </p>  <p> - The Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme provides funding to community childcare services to enable them to provide quality childcare, including after-school care, at reduced rates to disadvantaged and low income working parents.</p>  <p>  Progress has already been made to begin implementation of the specific measures related to after-school childcare that I announced as part of Budget 2016. For example:</p>  <p> - The City/County Childcare Committees and the Voluntary Childcare Organisations funded by my Department have already agreed to work collaboratively in 2016 to develop Quality Standards for After-School Childcare, </p>  <p> - The Citizen Participation Unit in my Department has agreed to undertake the consultation with children on their views about after-school childcare. This consultation process, which will inform the work on quality standards, will be undertaken in the first half of 2016, and</p>  <p> - The terms and conditions for the &euro;3 million capital fund, which will be provided to enable both community/not-for-profit and private providers to develop after-school childcare services, are currently being drafted. It is envisaged that this programme of capital funding will be announced in the first quarter of 2016.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Budget 2016 package also funded the establishment of a dedicated Project Team to develop a single Affordable Childcare Programme to provide working families with good quality childcare at a cost they can afford. Work on the Affordable Childcare Programme will begin immediately, so that it can be in place in 2017. This single programme will replace the existing programmes which support early years and after-school childcare.  It will provide a new simplified subsidy programme, available through both community/not-for-profit and private childcare providers.</p></reply>

Children under 16 who present as being homeless to emergency services are taken into care.  Children aged 16 and 17 may be taken into care, or provided a service under section 5 of the Child Care Act 1991 (accommodation for homeless children).  Young people who were formerly in the care of the State and presently in receipt of aftercare services have their accommodation needs identified as part of this support.</p><p>The accommodation needs of children who are in the care of their parents where the family is homeless are the responsibility of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and local authorities.</p><p>As the Deputy is aware, the statutory role of Tusla - the Child and Family Agency is to ensure the protection and welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care.  A child can only be received into the care of the Child and Family Agency where there are welfare or protection concerns.  Homelessness as part of a family group is not, in and of itself, a basis for seeking to receive a child into care. </p><p>In cases where there are welfare or protection concerns in relation to children in families presenting as homeless, the reporting of such concerns to the Child and Family Agency is governed by <i>Children First: National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children</i>(2011).  This national policy sets out the non-statutory child protection requirements which are in place for all sectors of society.  The Children First Act 2015, which has recently been passed into law, will place key elements of the Children First National Guidance on a statutory basis.  In parallel to the legislation, the existing <i>Children First: National Guidance</i>is currently being revised and updated. </p><p>As the Deputy will also be aware, on the 4th of December 2014, Minister Kelly hosted a special summit on homelessness to reaffirm the Government's commitment to end involuntary long-term homelessness, including that of families with children, by the end of 2016.  A number of actions arising from the summit were formalised into an action plan to address homelessness, and substantial progress has been made in implementing that plan.  Overall progress is overseen by the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy and Public Service Reform.  The plan and progress reports are available on the website of Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  Additionally, the local authorities collect data in relation to the number of dependants, as part of a family, who are homeless.</p><p>The December 2014 <i>Action Plan to Address Homelessness </i>includes a commitment for Tusla and Dublin City Council to coordinate operations to ensure that services are fully responsive to the particular protection and welfare needs that might arise for families in emergency accommodation.</p><p>Tusla has had meetings with Focus Ireland, the Department of Social Protection and Dublin City Council in relation to vulnerable families.  Additionally, I have been informed that Tusla and the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive are currently developing a joint protocol which includes guidance on working with families where child protection concerns arise within emergency homeless accommodation.  Significant progress has been made to date and there is a commitment to finalising a draft of the protocol for consultation as soon as possible.</p></reply>

It provides the overarching framework for the development and implementation of policy and services for children and young people. This is a whole of government framework, implementation of which is overseen by my Department.</p><p><i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures</i>set out a target of lifting over 70,000 children out of consistent poverty by 2020, a reduction of at least two-thirds on the 2011 level.The Department of Social Protection have the lead role in coordinating government strategies on child poverty and are the Sponsor of outcome 4 of <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures</i>- economic security and opportunity.  The Department of Social Protection also has lead responsibility for the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion. Its work is also informed by the European Commission Recommendation on &lsquo;Investing in children: Breaking the cycle of disadvantage&rsquo;.  The Department of Social Protection have identified child poverty as a key cross-sectoral priority to be addressed in 2015 and 2016 under the Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures structures.</p><p>To assist in this, the Advisory Council for <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Future,</i>which brings together key members of the community and voluntary sectors who work with and for children and young people, and the Department of Social Protection have co-convened a subgroup with officials from my Department and other relevant Departments to progress solutions to the issue of child poverty. This group has held two meetings in September and November 2015, and two more are planned for the near future.</p><p>Although the level of consistent poverty among children has fallen slightly from 11.7% to 11.2% between 2013 and 2014, the Government acknowledges the challenge in successfully achieving the child poverty target, but remains committed to meeting it. The timescale for achieving the target will be influenced by the pace of economic and employment growth.  However, we believe having an ambitious target and actively monitoring this will provide a roadmap towards which we can develop and implement a strong multi-dimensional policy response.</p><p>As part of this multi-dimensional approach and the importance accorded to the development of effective and quality focused services and support for children and young people, my Department in collaboration with the DSP will hold an EU Peer Review in February 2016 to explore innovative responses in policy and provision to address child poverty and disadvantage.  This event will involve ten Member States and the European Commission. </p><p>My Department continues to work closely with the Department of Social Protection supporting this mutli-dimensional approach to child poverty. There are also a number of areas of focus that support our response to child poverty within my Department.  My Department invests &euro;260 million annually on early childhood care and education and after-school support programmes which provide care to 100,000 children. A number of these programmes are targeted at those on lowest incomes. In addition in early 2015, I established an Inter-Departmental Group on Future Investment in Early Years and After-School Care and Education.  The work of the group was focused on identifying policy objectives to guide future investment in this area.  This report was published in July 2015 and informed the estimates process for Budget 2016.  Budget 2016 provides for an additional &euro;85 million investment in 2016.</p><p>My Department is also leading the implementation of the Area Based Childhood (ABC) Programme (2013-2017).  The ABC Programme is co-funded by my Department and The Atlantic Philanthropies and will have a total funding allocation of up to &euro;29.7 million.  The Area Based Childhood (ABC) Programme aims to  improve the outcomes for children, young people and existing service by drawing on best international practice to break the cycle of child poverty where it is most deeply entrenched.  It is overseen by an inter-departmental project team.</p><p>My Department also provides targeted support for disadvantaged, marginalised and at risk young people are provided through a range of schemes totalling &euro;49.93m of funding.  The purpose of recently published <i>National Youth Strategy 2015 - 2020</i>is to enable all young people aged 10 to 24 to realise their maximum potential with regard to the five national outcomes in <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures.</i>It is a universal strategy for all young people.  It has a particular focus on the needs of young people experiencing, or at risk of experiencing the poorest outcomes. </p><p>Finally, as part of my Department's response, Tusla, the Child and Family Agency is also responsible for the delivery of a range of services focusing on the welfare, protection and support for children, young people and their families which are key to supporting outcomes which assist in actively mitigating the impact of child poverty.</p></reply>

Prior to the introduction of the Early Childhood Care and Education Programme (ECCE) Programme in 2010, there was no minimum qualification for staff working in the early years sector. Under the ECCE programme, all pre-school leaders were required to hold a Level 5 qualification.  In addition, ECCE services could qualify for a higher capitation rate where all the pre-school leaders, in the ECCE room, held a Level 7 qualification, and all the pre-school assistants held a Level 5 qualification. This represented a major step forward in improving the quality of early years services.</p>  <p>  When the Early Years Quality Agenda was introduced in 2013, in order to further improve quality in pre-school services, one of the items to be progressed was the introduction of a requirement that all staff working with children in early years services should hold a qualification in early childhood care and education at a minimum of Level 5 on the National Qualifications Framework (NQF) or equivalent and that pre-school leaders in ECCE services would be required to hold a minimum Level 6 qualification, or equivalent.  These requirements will be fully introduced in 2016 following the publication of new Childcare Regulations. </p>  <p>  In order to support existing staff to achieve these minimum qualifications, the Government introduced a Learner Fund. &euro;3.5m has been provided under this Fund since 2014 and more than 3,000 staff have completed (or are currently completing training) to allow them to meet the minimum requirements. </p>  <p>  These initiatives and this investment have resulted in significant increases in the number of ECCE services under contract to deliver the ECCE Programme who now meet higher capitation criteria.</p>  <p> - In 2010, a total of 3,787 ECCE services were under contract to deliver the ECCE Programme. Of these: 82.0% met the basic capitation criteria, and 11.0% met the higher capitation criteria.</p>  <p> - In 2015, a total of 4,371 ECCE services are under contract to deliver the ECCE Programme. Of these: 72.0% meet the basic capitation criteria, and 28.0% met the higher capitation criteria.</p>  <p>  Additionally, according to the findings from the Annual Survey of Early Years Services undertaken by Pobal on my Department&rsquo;s behalf, there have also been significant increases in the number of staff in early years services who hold a qualification equal to or higher than NFQ Level 5 over the same time period:</p>  <p> - In 2010, 71.4% of staff had a qualification equal to or higher than NFQ Level 5, and</p>  <p> - In 2014, 86.8% of staff had a qualification equal to or higher than NFQ Level 5.</p>  <p>  Further funding to improve  the qualifications in the early years sector was secured as part of Budget 2016. This includes:</p>  <p> - &euro;1.5 million, which will be directed towards a Learner Fund in 2016. I will announce details of this Learner Fund shortly. </p>  <p> - &euro;1.5 million, which will fund the delivery of a 'Higher Education Programme for Inclusion Co-ordinators in Early Years Settings' as part of the model of supports I recently announced to ensure children with a disability can access and meaningfully participate in the ECCE Programme. This funding will meet the costs for the first intake of participants (up to 900 early years practitioners) who are expected to commence in this Programme in April 2016. It is envisaged that, over the next four years, at least 80 per cent of ECCE services will avail of this training fund, which will cost &euro;1.5 million per annum.</p>  <p>  In 2016, my Department will also continue to provide funding of &euro;13 million for City and County Childcare Committees and National Voluntary Childcare Organisations to support the valuable work of these bodies in supporting early years&rsquo; services around the country, through training, continuing professional development programmes, networking and cluster-type support groups.</p></reply>

Of these: 72.0% meet the basic capitation criteria, and 28.0% met the higher capitation criteria.</p>  <p>  Additionally, according to the findings from the Annual Survey of Early Years Services undertaken by Pobal on my Department&rsquo;s behalf, there have also been significant increases in the number of staff in early years services who hold a qualification equal to or higher than NFQ Level 5 over the same time period:</p>  <p>  - In 2010, 71.4% of staff had a qualification equal to or higher than NFQ Level 5, and</p>  <p>  - In 2014, 86.8% of staff had a qualification equal to or higher than NFQ Level 5.</p>  <p>  Further funding to improve  the qualifications and support the professionalisation of the early years sector was secured as part of Budget 2016. This includes:</p>  <p>  - &euro;1.5 million, which will be directed towards a Learner Fund in 2016. I will announce details of this Learner Fund shortly.</p>  <p>  - &euro;1.5 million, which will fund the delivery of a 'Higher Education Programme for Inclusion Co-ordinators in Early Years Settings' as part of the model of supports I recently announced to ensure children with a disability can access and meaningfully participate in the ECCE Programme. This funding will meet the costs for the first intake of participants (up to 900 early years practitioners) who are expected to commence in this Programme in April 2016. It is envisaged that, over the next four years, at least 80 per cent of ECCE services will avail of this training fund, which will cost &euro;1.5 million per annum.</p>  <p>  In 2016, my Department will also continue to provide funding of &euro;13 million for City and County Childcare Committees and National Voluntary Childcare Organisations to support the valuable work of these bodies in supporting early years&rsquo; services around the country, through training, continuing professional development programmes, networking and cluster-type support groups.</p></reply>

With this in mind, I requested that an Inter-Departmental Group, led by my Department be established, with a brief to bring forward recommendations to address this issue.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the Group concluded its work and the recommendations of this Group were fully accepted and funded by Government. I announced, as part of Budget 2016, the necessary funding to implement the new model of supports for children with a disability with costs for these supports estimated to be &euro;15m in 2016 and with full year costs estimated to be &euro;33m from 2017 onwards. This funding will be allocated on the basis of the needs of children and not on the basis of geographic location. Therefore, the proportion of this funding, which will be allocated to Donegal in any given Programme year cannot be determined.</p>  <p>  I believe that this Group has identified a practical, workable model for meeting the needs of children with a disability and the allocation of funding is clear evidence of the Government's commitment to supporting such children.</p>  <p>  Moving forward from funding to implementation, I am very pleased to say that, on 18 November last, the model of supports was launched by myself, together with my Government colleagues, Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan, TD, Minister for Education and Skills and Kathleen Lynch, TD, Minister of State at the Department of Health.</p>  <p>  When established, the new model will focus on the developmental level of children with disabilities, their functional ability and their needs. It will not focus on diagnosis, recognising that many children may not have a formal diagnosis at the time of presenting to pre-school. </p>  <p>  The model, when fully operational, will deliver seven levels of support to enable the full inclusion and meaningful participation of children with disabilities in the ECCE Programme. These supports move from universal (which will benefit all children), to highly targeted supports (which will benefit 1%-1.5% of children estimated to have very complex needs). Supports include: enhanced continuing professional development for early years practitioners; grants for equipment, appliances and minor alterations, increased capitation for certain children with very complex needs, as well as access to therapeutic intervention. </p>  <p>  The new model will take some time to be fully established as capacity needs to be built in the early years sector, but the planned front-loading and on-going investment will result in all children with a disability having their pre-school needs met. The implementation of all seven levels of supports is the next step in the process and in that regard, two groups have been established to oversee and implement the new model.</p>  <p>  The first group, the Cross Sectoral Implementation Group, will oversee and monitor implementation, while the second group, the Project Group, will implement the model for roll-out by September 2016, recognising that some elements will take somewhat longer to fully implement as capacity needs to be built into the system. </p>  <p>  In the meantime, the Deputy should be aware that currently the ECCE Programme makes special provision for children with a disability to access the ECCE programme. Measures include an exemption from the upper age limit for qualification where a child is developmentally delayed and would benefit from starting primary school at a later age.  In addition, children with special needs can apply to have the pre-school year split over two years on a pro-rata basis, for example availing of the Programme for 2 days a week in the first year and for 3 days a week in the second year and this will continue to be an option for parents.</p></reply>

HIQA's findings are mixed, by and large showing a committed staff dealing with young people, some of whom have serious emotional and behavioural difficulties. The age profile of children in residential centres has risen over the last number of years, and now approximately half the young people resident are aged 16 and 17 years. Some of these young people will have come into care recently, while others will have experienced the breakdown of other care placements, including foster care. In some instances the young person's behaviour will have triggered the breakdown, in other instances it may be a response to repeated disrupted relationships and poor self esteem.  I want to emphasise that unlike Special Care, children are not detained in residential centres, nor were they detained in High Support Centres either. </p>  <p>  The majority of children's residential centres are, de facto, providing high support care.  Across the country there are 160 centres, including private and community based caring for 337 children. There are, at a minimum, two staff on duty and, when needed, this number is increased.  This shows an average of 2 young people per centre, although of course the number of children in a centre will range from 1 to approximately 4.  98% of children in residential care have an allocated social worker (329). Young people placed in community based centres who have serious emotional and behavioural problems, and who are being considered for special care, are linked with the Assessment, Consultation and Therapy Service (ACTS) multidisciplinary therapeutic team.  Further specialist supports are also routinely made available as needed and many centres have specialist skill-sets, therapeutic modalities, or links with same, in their local communities to meet the varying need of the young people in their care. Tusla managers and staff are fully aware of the emotional and mental health needs of children in care.  While the term High Support is not currently used,  high support care is provided, through Tusla placements and also, privately commissioned residential and foster placements, with access to specialist psychological and psychotherapeutic play opportunities.</p>  <p>  I believe the Deputy's question refers to the inspection report published by HIQA on the 5th of November 2015, where a focused inspection was carried out on a children&rsquo;s residential centre in the Dublin Mid-Leinster region. This unannounced, themed inspection, focused solely on how the needs of children who display challenging behaviour are met. The HIQA inspection report found that of the seven standards inspected in the centre, only one was fully met, five required some aspect of improvement and significant risk was identified in one standard. This latter standard outlined the risk to the safety of the young people due to their behaviour when outside the centre. </p>  <p>  Inspectors  found that staff worked in partnership with the social work department, parents and other professionals to try to manage these risks; however their interventions  did not have the desired effect, at the time of the inspection, to stop dangerous behaviour by the young people. The report outlines how the staff and management of the centre demonstrated a real commitment to the young people in their care, despite their challenging behaviour. However, HIQA determined that the risk taking behaviour of the young people was such that other interventions should have been put in place. </p>  <p>  I am fully aware of the serious challenge faced by the Department and Tusla in working with this group of young people.  Reports from the National Review Panel provide sufficient evidence of the tragic outcome for some young people who take risks with their own lives and safety. In order to improve outcomes, Tusla has established a working group to reviewing strategy for alternative care, and two of my officials are members of the group. Separately, senior managers in Tusla and officials in my Department are in discussions about how best to meet the needs of some of these young people to secure their safety and future.</p></reply>

The needs of children in Direct Provision include education, child care such as preschool, medical and health issues. Tusla provides support services directly to families as well as advice on aspects of child raising in this country.</p>  <p>  Children living in Direct Provision are in the care of their parent(s). The Protection Process Working Group reported to the Minister for Justice and Equality recently. There were key findings and recommendations concerned with the development, welfare, protection and education of children. I continue to support the Minister for Justice and Equality in her drive to implement change in this area and improve the lives of those who need to avail of the protection process.</p>  <p>  Where there are concerns about the welfare, safety or well-being of a child in Direct Provision, these are reported to Tusla in accordance with Children First guidelines. Tusla has been working closely with the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) of the Department of Justice and Equality, which has responsibility for accommodation in the Direct Provision system, and on information sharing protocols. Tusla provides additional supports in some centres such as preschool, family support and advice. </p>  <p>  Tusla also has a role in providing care and protection for children seeking asylum who present without their parent or customary care giver under Tusla's Equity of Care Policy. These children are placed in the care of the State, with Tusla, and following a short period of residential assessment, are placed in foster care and, in a small number of cases, in residential care. Tusla has a dedicated Social Work team to deal with this vulnerable cohort and the State is duty bound by international and domestic law to protect and provide for separated children in the same way as it does for children normally resident in the State.</p></reply>

Illness Benefit and Family Income Supplement (FIS) were never eligible for the bonus in the past and similar arrangements apply this year.</p>  <p>  While the short-term Illness Benefit scheme is not eligible for the bonus, long-term illness/disability payments are eligible.  In this regard, persons who are permanently incapable of work may be eligible for the non-means tested Invalidity Pension (subject to satisfying the relevant medical criteria). Persons who are substantially restricted in undertaking suitable employment arising from a medical condition may be eligible for the means tested Disability Allowance (subject to the relevant medical criteria).

Participants on the scheme are expected to continue to make efforts to find full-time work.  There are currently 381 participants on the scheme with a budget of just under &euro;2 million for 2015.</p>  <p>  To qualify for the part-time job incentive scheme a person must be in receipt of jobseeker's allowance for at least 390 days.  In addition, a person must have been in receipt of a higher jobseeker's payment rate than the appropriate part-time job incentive supplement payable. The part-time job incentive supplement rate is &euro;119 per week for a single person and &euro;193.90 per week where an individual was getting an increase for a qualified adult.  There is no increase for qualified children.  </p>  <p>  I recently sought and received special sanction from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to extend the part time job incentive scheme to customers who have exited the one parent family payment due to the scheme reforms.  This sanction is specifically for former one-parent family payment recipients whose youngest child is aged 14 or over, who are working more than 3 days out of 7 and, as such would not be entitled to jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance. This particular extension to the scheme will be available to participants for one year giving them time to increase their hours to 19 per week and qualify for the family income supplement. </p>  <p>  Although the part-time job incentive scheme is a small non statutory scheme, it can provide assistance to long term unemployed who can only find part-time work and who fail the &lsquo;4 in 7&rsquo; jobseeker&rsquo;s rule or do not qualify for FIS. </p>  <p>  Any change to the qualifying criteria for the part-time job incentive scheme would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</p></reply>

This has led to an increase in the time being taken to process and issue arrears to successful applicants who were in receipt of another weekly social welfare payment during the period covered by the arrears.  The Department keeps waiting times for its various payments under constant review and, as far as possible, endeavours to minimise delays for customers.</p>  <p>  There are approximately 1500 disability allowance (DA) arrears currently awaiting action by a deciding officer.  This number should be taken in the context of the current average number of DA applications processed per week, which is approximately 630.</p>  <p>  Where an application for DA is being awarded and where no other social welfare payment was being received by the person in question since the date of the DA application, arrears issue immediately.  However, in the majority of cases, the DA customer has been receiving another weekly social welfare payment while they were awaiting a decision on their DA application.  In those cases, the amount paid to the person in question in the relevant period must be confirmed with the relevant Intreo office/scheme area so that the correct adjustment may be made to the arrears due.  In some cases, once adjustment is made for the overlapping payment, arrears may be quite small or there may not be any arrears due at all.  However, in such cases, it takes a number of weeks for the arrears to be finalised and issued.</p></reply>

The Regulations are under the remit of the Minister for Social Protection and prescribe the conditions for transfers to arrangements established outside the State. These are as follows:</p>  <p>  -  the trustees or PRSA provider have satisfied themselves that the retirement benefits to be provided under the overseas arrangement are relevant benefits by obtaining written confirmation to that effect from the trustees, custodians, managers or administrators of an overseas arrangement to which the transfer is to be made, and</p>  <p>  -  the trustees or PRSA provider have satisfied themselves that the overseas arrangement has been approved by an appropriate regulatory authority for the country concerned, and </p>  <p>  -  the trustees or PRSA provider have received from the member of the scheme or the PRSA contributor such information in such form as may for the time being be approved by the Pensions Authority.</p>  <p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that moving pension funds overseas in an effort to circumvent the requirements of Irish tax legislation may fall foul of the conditions under which the pension scheme was approved by  Revenue as an exempt approved scheme or the conditions under which a PRSA product received Revenue approval.  For this reason Revenue has additional requirements to ensure that such transfers are used to provide pension benefits. Prior to making any overseas transfer payments, the trustees or PRSA provider must be satisfied that:</p>  <p>  (a) the member has requested a transfer,</p>  <p>  (b) the overseas arrangement provides relevant benefits as defined by Section 770(1) of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, and</p>  <p>  (c) the overseas arrangement has been approved by the appropriate regulatory authority in the country concerned. </p>  <p>  In practice, the trustees or PRSA provider are required to obtain written confirmation to that effect from the administrator of the overseas arrangement to which the transfer is to be made. </p>  <p>  If the transfer is to another EU Member State, the overseas scheme must be operated or managed by an Institution for Occupational Retirement Provision (IORP), within the meaning of the EU Pensions Directive, and must be established in a Member State of the European Communities which has implemented the Directive in its national law. The scheme administrator must be resident in an EU Member State. A transfer which complies with the above requirements may be made without prior reference to Revenue. A transfer to a scheme which is not operated by an IORPS must be referred to Revenue in advance of the transfer taking place.</p>  <p>  If the transfer is to a country outside the EU, a transfer may not be made to a country other than the one in which the member is currently employed.</p>  <p>  All transfer payments to an arrangement for the provision of retirement benefits outside the State made from an approved occupational pension scheme or PRSA under the provisions of the Overseas Transfer Payments Regulations may be made to facilitate bona fide transactions only. A member of an Occupational Pension Scheme or a PRSA contributor who directs the trustees/PRSA provider to transfer assets to an overseas arrangement must sign a declaration to the effect that the transfer conforms to the requirements of the Regulations and Revenue transfer rules, is for bona fide reasons and is not primarily for the purpose of circumventing pension tax legislation and Revenue rules.</p>  <p>  No tax charge applies in respect of the actual transfer of occupational pension funds, and, providing the transfer complies with the Regulations and Revenue rules as set out above, the transfer may be made without further tax consequences. </p>  <p>  Section 787G (1) Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997 provides that a tax charge arises where the value of any assets in a PRSA is paid by the PRSA administrator to the PRSA holder or to any other persons. Exceptions to the application of this tax charge are contained in section 787G (3) TCA 1997. However, where a PRSA fund is transferred to an overseas arrangement, such a transfer is not covered by any of the exceptions listed under section 787G (3) TCA 1997.</p>  <p>  It is recognised that some conditions (such as the tax charge applying to PRSA transfers as outlined above) may be impacting on fund transfers being undertaken for legitimate reasons, particularly in the case of emigrants. These conditions are being reviewed. The ideal would be to ensure that overseas transfers of pension funds which are undertaken for legitimate reasons are facilitated as much as possible while also guarding against abuse of the arrangements. This is not always an easy balance to achieve. Nevertheless, it is hoped that some progress can be made in this area in the near future.</p></reply>

The tax treatment of separated spouses depends on the circumstances which apply in each case.  In broad terms the position with regard to the tax treatment of separated persons is as follows.</p>  <p>  While in general separated couples are treated for tax purposes as if unmarried, they may, where a legally binding maintenance arrangement is in place, elect to be treated for tax purposes as if the separation had not taken place.  However, the election to be treated for tax purposes as if still married is not a right of one spouse alone but rather is a joint election of both spouses.  </p>  <p>  The general position in the case of legally enforceable maintenance agreements is that, where the couple are treated for tax purposes as if unmarried, a tax deduction for maintenance payments for the benefit of his/her spouse is granted to the paying spouse, and the payments are taxable income in the hands of the receiving spouse. If an individual's sole income is from maintenance payments, this is taxed under the self-assessment system.  However, if the couple jointly elect to be treated for tax purposes as if the separation had not taken place, then the payer does not receive a tax deduction for the maintenance payments and the receiving spouse is not taxable on them.  </p>  <p>  On the other hand, non-legally binding maintenance payments are not taxable in the hands of the receiving spouse and the paying spouse cannot claim a tax deduction for them. </p>  <p>  Maintenance payments in respect of children are not taxable in the hands of the children or the receiving spouse, and the paying spouse cannot claim a tax deduction for the payments.  The effect of this is that the payments are treated the same way as if the taxpayer was providing for the child out of his/her after-tax income. This is in line with the tax treatment of all other parents, where the cost of maintaining their children is not tax deductible.</p>  <p>  The Finance Bill 2015 provides for a new tax credit known as the Earned Income Tax Credit.  The tax credit is available in respect of earned income other than earned income which already qualifies for the Employee (PAYE) Tax Credit. The credit will be given at 20% of qualifying earned income subject to a maximum credit of &euro;550 for 2016. </p>  <p>  The definition of earned income is set out in section 3 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  This includes income arising from the exercise of an office or employment and income arising from the carrying on of a trade or profession.</p>  <p>  Maintenance payments do not fall within the scope of the definition of earned income and, as such, will not be taken into account in determining an individual's entitlement to the Earned Income Tax Credit. The credit introduced in Budget 2016 is specifically targeted at active income, to support small business-owners across the country such as retailers, publicans, farmers and tradesmen who have an active trade or profession, and who do not have access to the PAYE credit.</p></reply>

The Government&rsquo;s efforts will be on achieving a step change in enterprise performance across the whole enterprise base.</p><p>Our enterprise development agencies provide financial and advisory supports to enterprises that export from Ireland, and/or have the potential to do so including foreign and Irish owned entities - supporting direct job creation and stimulating indirect job creation across the wider economy. </p><p>Enterprise 2025 sets out the sectors in which Ireland has comparative advantage and that contribute the greater proportion toward exports. These sectors account for a significant proportion of the enterprise agency client portfolio and include ICT (hardware and software), Health Lifesciences (that includes pharma, biopharma and medical technologies), International Financial Services, Internationally Traded Services, Engineering/Industrial Products and Agri-Food.  New areas of opportunity and untapped potential are highlighted in Enterprise 2025. The reality is that all sectors are evolving in response to market demands and enabled by technology developments &ndash; presenting considerable opportunities arising from convergence, new business models and new end market segments (such as smart ageing).</p><p>The agencies will contribute significantly to achieving the ambition for employment creation set out in Enterprise 2025. The enterprise agencies will each set annual targets in the context of the overall ambition.

When an applicant wishes to establish a plantation under the Afforestation Grant and Premium Scheme he applies to the Minister for approval under the Scheme. The contract under the Afforestation Grant and Premium Scheme is solely between the applicant and my Department.</p>  <p>  The applicant employs a forester to undertake afforestation work on his/her behalf and this includes submitting an accurate claim on the applicant&rsquo;s behalf. This forester is not a party to the contract under the Afforestation Grant and Premium Scheme. Similarly, the contract to undertake afforestation work and to prepare and submit claims is a separate contract between the owner and his/her forester. My Department is not a party to this contract; and any matter arising under it, such as potentially inadequate work (e.g. planting fewer trees than there should be, preparing an inaccurate claim, etc.), is a matter for the landowner and the forester to resolve. </p>  <p>  As the Department&rsquo;s contract under the Afforestation Grant and Premium Scheme is with the applicant, all money paid under the contract is to benefit the applicant. Under this contract the applicant gains a forestry plantation as an asset as a result of my Department&rsquo;s approval of a forestry establishment grant; thus s/he directly benefits from the grant payment.</p>  <p>  Any money paid by an applicant to the forester or forestry company is a matter between those parties. This includes where grants may be mandated by the client for direct payment to the forester. A mandate between the applicant and the forester is an instruction by the applicant to the Department to redirect his/her payment directly to the forester - the applicant is still the beneficiary under the Afforestation Scheme contract. This means that, while any debt arising under an Afforestation Scheme contract is a matter between the Minister and the applicant, any debt arising under any contract between the applicant and his/her forester is a matter between those parties.</p></reply>

There has been increasing concern about the growth in so called 'sham marriages' as evidenced by statistically improbable patterns of marriages including a large number of new notifications of intention to marry from males from the Indian sub-continent (i.e. Pakistan, India, Bangladesh) to females from EU countries, particularly Portugal and Eastern European countries.</p>  <p>  I am informed that, as a part of this ongoing operation, a large number of searches were conducted across the country on Wednesday 25 November involving over 200 members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which included a number of specialist units.  Over 40 searches were conducted of both business and residential premises across the country to gather evidence of suspected fraud offences related to the organised facilitation of marriages of convenience. This was a multi-agency approach involving the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS), the Department of Social Protection, the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement (ODCE), the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) and the Revenue Commissioners.  The focus of the operation is specifically targeted at those engaged in organised facilitation of sham marriages for financial gain as well as those who are seeking to gain illegal immigration status by engaging in such arranged marriages.  I am assured that all necessary enforcement measures will be taken where breaches of relevant legislation are identified.</p>  <p>  I am further informed by the Garda Authorities that a total of 11 people were arrested for a range of offences under the Immigration Acts and Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001.  In addition a large amount of computers, memory devices, phones and documents including false identity documents, driving licences, marriage certificates and a substantial quantity of cash were seized.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that Operation Vantage is ongoing and forms part of the overall response of my Department to prevent marriages of convenience from taking place. This includes a review of relevant applications by INIS with a view to revoking immigration permission which may have been obtained under false pretences.</p></reply>

This figure comprises 12,866 members, 978 reserve members, and 2,012 civilians as of 31 October. </p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the capacity to provide effective, visible policing throughout the country. The number of Garda&iacute; is crucial to this but, also of importance, is ensuring that the overall composition of the Garda workforce achieves the right balance between highly trained Garda&iacute; and professional, skilled civilian staff, and that the Service harnesses the energy and skills of volunteers through the Garda Reserve.</p>  <p>  The optimal number of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is a factor of a number of different considerations, including population size and composition, crime trends, the level of civilianisation, etc. Having said that, the Government is committed to on-going seamless recruitment into the future and as the Deputy will be aware, provision has been made in Budget 2016 for the recruitment of 600 new Garda&iacute; next year bringing to 1,150 the number of new Garda&iacute; that will be recruited since the reopening of the Garda College in Templemore in September 2014. So far 295 of those new recruits are fully attested and are on the ground in communities nationwide. It is expected that a further 395 will attest by the end of 2016 which, taking account of projected retirements, will bring Garda numbers to around the 13,000 mark.  I expect recruitment to continue at or around the current levels for the next number of years having regard to factors such as the level of retirements in any one year.</p>  <p>  In relation to civilian staff of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, they are employed in a wide range of management, administrative, technical and operational roles where they make an invaluable contribution to the delivery of effective policing services throughout the country. The increased budget allocation for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2016, in addition to providing for the recruitment of 600 new Garda&iacute;, provides for the recruitment of additional civilian experts, in particular to develop the Garda ICT investment programme. Having regard to international experience, I believe that there is undoubtedly value in exploring the opportunities for increasing the ratio of civilians to Garda&iacute;, and for releasing Garda&iacute; from administrative and other positions to front-line duties. The process which is currently ongoing to civilianise border control functions at Dublin airport and the transfer of these responsibilities from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department is an excellent example of this.  Further work in this area will be progressed in conjunction with the Garda Commissioner in the context of the report of the Garda Inspectorate of its review under the Haddington Road Agreement. The terms of reference of that review include all aspects of the operation and administration of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na including the structure, organisation and staffing of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the deployment of members and civilian staff to relevant and appropriate roles.</p>  <p>  Lastly, in relation to the capacity of the Garda College, I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that the Garda College provides a range of training and development courses to members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and all new recruits complete their initial 32 week training programme at the College.  The physical capacity of the College extends to 496 bedrooms, 16 Classrooms and 4 Lecture Theatres. The College has the capacity to accommodate the planned intake of 600 Garda Trainees next year.</p></reply>

It is understood from discussions with the Garda Commissioner that the current consolidation process is largely completed and there are no plans at present for further station closures in 2015 and 2016.  </p>  <p>  The Programme was based on a review of the Garda Station Network by Garda management which concluded in relation to certain stations, many of which were only open part-time and manned by a single Garda, that resources could be better deployed and more effectively used on the front line if those stations no longer had to be staffed and maintained.  In reaching these conclusions, Garda management reviewed all aspects of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na policing model, including the deployment of personnel, the utilisation of modern technologies and the overall operation of Garda stations.  The Programme supports the provision of a modern 21st century policing service for both urban and rural areas and allows front line Garda&iacute; to be managed and deployed with greater mobility, greater flexibility, and in a more focused fashion, particularly with regard to various targeted police operations.  As a result of the Programme, communities have benefited from increased Garda visibility and increased patrolling hours which has enabled  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deliver an improved policing service to the public. </p>  <p>  The Programme identified proposed savings of &euro;4,000 per annum on utilities and maintenance as a result of the closure of each station building giving rise to estimated total direct savings to the State of &euro;556,000 per annum.  While the direct savings are modest, it is important to recall that the primary objective of the Programme was to identify opportunities to introduce strategic reforms to enhance service delivery, increase efficiency and streamline practices within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  </p>  <p>  The Garda Stations which have been closed were returned to, and are now under the control of, the Office of Public Works (OPW).  The future use of such properties is a matter for the OPW as the owners of the properties.</p></reply>

As the Deputy will be aware, this Government has committed significant resources to the improvement of the prison estate. In keeping with our commitment to eliminate slopping out, as made in the Programme for Government, the focus of capital investment in prisons has been weighted towards achieving that goal.</p><p>All of the wings in Mountjoy Prison have been completely refurbished thereby facilitating the elimination of the practice of slopping out in the prison.  A completely new replacement prison in Cork is almost complete and will be operational in February 2016.</p><p>I recently announced that the public consultation process on planning proposals for a major development at Limerick Prison has commenced. The proposed development will see the replacement of both the A &amp;amp; B Wings with a new modern cell block designed to meet international standards and will end the practice of slopping out in Limerick Prison. The development will also include a new accommodation block for female prisoners. This represents a very significant investment in the justice sector in Limerick and when completed will provide a very high standard of accommodation for both prisoners and staff in Limerick Prison. The enabling works for the redevelopment of Limerick Prison are scheduled to begin in 2016 with the main construction phase to start in early 2017.  In addition, planning for a development at Portlaoise Prison that will bring slopping out to an end there is underway</p><p>When the new Cork prison opens next February, slopping out will have been ended across the entire of the prison estate except for the A wing at Limerick Prison and the E block at Portlaoise prison.  </p><p>I am advised by the Irish Prison Service  that while  numbers of prisoners housed on those wings will vary from day to day there is currently at a daily average of 50 prisoners in Limerick A wing and 34 in Portlaoise E block.

The roadmap was published on 21 October 2015.  As announced at that time, the Government has <i>inter alia</i>approved the drafting of the Equality/Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill to make a range of miscellaneous amendments to statute law necessary to enable ratification.  Work on the General Scheme of this Bill is underway, with a view to submission to Government very soon.</p><p>The Roadmap to Ratification is available on my Department&rsquo;s website. It sets out the considerable work currently underway to deal with outstanding barriers to Ireland&rsquo;s ratification, including legislation governing decision-making capacity, mental health legislation, the law governing the administration of electro-convulsive therapy (ECT), amendments to the criminal law, and the removal of archaic and offensive references across the statue book to persons being &ldquo;of unsound mind&rdquo;. Other issues to be addressed include the provision of reasonable accommodation, and ensuring that the Convention&rsquo;s requirements are met in relation to deprivation of liberty. These, along with other necessary amendments, will be addressed in the Equality/Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.</p></reply>

I am satisfied that Tusla takes its responsibility very seriously regarding the welfare of children in care and that there is a robust framework of regulations and standards, to ensure that children are placed in safe and caring settings.</p><p>The following table shows the total number of children in care broken down by the number in foster care and the number in residential care at the end 2014 and as at September 2015.<table><tr><th>-</th><th>No. of Children in Care</th><th>No. of Children in Foster Care</th><th>No. of Children in Residential Care</th></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>6,463</td><td>6,011</td><td>325</td></tr><tr><td>2015 (31/09/2015)</td><td>6,373</td><td>5,914</td><td>337</td></tr></table></p><p>All children in care should have an allocated social worker but it is important to note that if a child has not been allocated a social worker, the cases are reviewed regularly by the principal social worker and are managed by duty social work teams to ensure the necessary needs of the children are being met. Currently, 92% of children in care have an allocated social worker (5,880/6,373). The additional funding of &euro;38 million which I have allocated to Tusla for 2016, will give the Agency greater capacity to respond to ongoing demand.  These additional resources are intended to alleviate pressures being faced in the areas of unallocated cases, private residential and foster care, and domestic sexual and gender based violence services.</p><p>As the majority of children in care are in foster care family settings in the community, indicators of stability of the placement and participation in education are useful in monitoring the performance of Tusla in relation to overall welfare.  I am happy to say that Tusla has reported that the results for these indicators are positive and show that placement stability is very high and participation in education is on a par with the national participation rates.</p></reply>

The issue of mental health problems, including self harm in young people is a complex issue requiring inputs from a wide range of stakeholders including young people, parents, schools, the media, youth organisations and the Primary Care and Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) of the Health Service Executive.</p>  <p>  The Child and Family Agency, Tusla, works closely with other care providers including the HSE, in respect of access to primary care services, child and adolescent mental health services, disability and other services. Tusla and the HSE have in place both a Memorandum of Understanding and a Joint Protocol for inter-agency collaboration which underpins the provision of these services for children. The purpose of the Memorandum of Understanding is to set out the partnership agreement between the HSE and Tusla to continue pre-establishment levels of service across both organisations. The objective of the Joint Protocol is to specify a pathway and associated responsibilities for children and families whose needs cross between Health Service Divisions and Tusla. </p>  <p>  Tusla is also proposing to put in place a Service Level Agreement with the HSE to strengthen current arrangements and to ensure the provision of effective services for children and families. The Service Level Agreement will determine the quantum of service needed to meet the Agency's requirements. </p>  <p>  Children also have access to publicly funded child and adolescent mental health teams and primary care psychology services provided by the Health Service Executive. Additionally there are a number of services commissioned by social work departments around psychotherapeutic supports.</p>  <p>  Clinical psychology services are directly provided by Tusla within multi-disciplinary teams deployed by the Assessment, Consultation and Therapy Service (ACTS). Services provided include assessment and focused interventions for children and young people with complex clinical needs and high risk behaviours. They also provide support to other professionals in order to guide interventions to children and families.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that significant extra resources have been allocated to Tusla, the Child and Family Agency for 2016.

These include figures showing the number of referrals which are disaggregated by welfare concerns and abuse concerns. </p><p>Not all referrals will result in a need for a social work service or in a child being received into care and approximately 50% can be expected to proceed from preliminary enquiry to the initial assessment stage. The reasons for this include the duplication of referrals, the child being known to the service and receiving other services such as Meitheal or other Family Support, or that the referral was not appropriate for the agency. </p><p>The most recent validated figures for welfare concerns and abuse concerns at the end of first quarter of 2015, showed 4,770 abuse concern referrals and 6,223 welfare concern referrals. Of these referrals, 56% of abuse concerns and 44% of welfare concerns went forward to the initial assessment stage. The referrals of a child abuse concern were reported as: Physical (22%), Emotional (37%), Sexual (15%) and Neglect (26%).</p><p>The data collected by Tusla on referrals is collated, validated and published quarterly in arrears.

These contacts relate to a range of responsibilities that come within my remit and some bodies have multiple contacts with my Department in line with their respective areas of interest. </p><p>On an ongoing basis we have contacts with the State Bodies coming within remit of my Department, namely the Child and Family Agency and the Adoption Authority of Ireland.  We have contact with the Ombudsman for Children in the context of our relationship with that Office under its governing legislation.</p><p>The <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures</i>Advisory Council was established in November 2014 and includes representatives from key groups working in the areas of Early Years, Children and Youth, as well as independent experts and individuals nominated by me.  The Advisory Council provides the platform through which the NGO sector connects with and mobilises communities, families and individuals, and is an essential partner to implementation of the National Policy Framework for Children and Young People.</p><p>My Department works closely with youth sector interests in developing key initiatives such as the National Youth Strategy 2014-20, which I launched in October.  My Department maintains close contact with youth services throughout the country, and with the national and major regional youth organisations. Regular meetings are held to exchange information and the youth services actively work with my Department on the development of coordinated policies and services that meet young people&rsquo;s needs.  I, and officials of my Department have met, and continue to meet regularly, with youth organisations and groups.  My aim is to see how we can work together in a coordinated way to bring about the best possible outcomes for young people. </p><p>During the development of the Children First legislation, a number of round-table meetings were held with key stakeholders to brief them on the provisions of the Bill. The legislation was enacted on 19 November 2015. </p><p>My Department works with a wide range of non-government organisations in the development of policy and practice on children and young people&rsquo;s participation in decision-making.  The first  National Strategy on the Participation of Children and Young People in Decision making, 2015-2020  was developed following a consultative process involving  key groups, bodies and organisations dealing with the rights and well-being of children.  </p><p>Some specific topics involve contacts with particular groups.  For example:</p><p>- The Children's Rights Alliance in relation to policy matters arising under the United Nation Convention on the Rights of the Child, specifically the Third Optional Protocol to the UNCRC on a Communications Procedure;</p><p>- The ISPCC in relation to the Missing Children's Hotline which is now funded by my Department;</p><p>- Barnardos in relation to the provision of Guardian Ad Litem services under the Child Care Act 1991;</p><p>- The Children&rsquo;s Research Network for Ireland and Northern Ireland, established in 2010 to support the research community to better understand and improve the lives of children and young people, by creating and maintaining an inclusive, independent, non-profit network through which information, knowledge, experience, learning and skills can be shared.</p><p>The Children Detention Schools have service level agreements with certain organisations.  Empowering People in Care provides advice, support and individual advocacy services to children and young people in care, those preparing to leave care and those in aftercare.  The Youth Advocate Programmes organisation builds partnerships between vulnerable young people, their families and communities.  Their aim is to offer a community-based, strengths-focused, intensive support to selected young persons for up to six months on their discharge to aid re-integration into their community, particularly where the young person doesn't have other adequate supports in place.</p><p>The Early Years Policy Unit in my Department has ongoing interaction on a range of childcare related issues with the 31 City and County Childcare Committees and the 6 National Voluntary Childcare organisations that represent childcare providers and also advocate in relation to childcare issues.  The voluntary organisations include Barnardos, Early Childhood Ireland, Childminding Ireland, National Childhood Network (formally Border Counties Childcare Network), St. Nicholas Montessori and the Irish Steiner Waldorf Organisation. Contacts with any other organisations not mentioned above can take place at any time, either at my request or in response to requests from the organisations concerned.</p><p>The Adoption Policy Unit of my Department has contact with various voluntary groups, bodies and organisations dealing with the rights and wellbeing of children.  These include Treoir, International Adoption Association and other advocacy /representative organisations.</p></reply>

I am advised that the development project currently nearing completion in Oberstown includes a new purpose - built education, training and recreation facility which came into use in September last.  Along with the existing services already being provided, these new facilities will ensure sufficient age and ability appropriate facilities to support the delivery, by the Dublin and Dun Laoghaire Education and Training Board, of the necessary education and training services to young people in detention.</p>  <p>  In the children detention school system a range of rehabilitative supports is offered to every child as part of an overall programme, with the main emphasis placed on education and rehabilitation rather than on control and security.  A strong ethos of school attendance, education and training is also in place.  An individual management plan is put in place for each child which includes an assessment to determine the need for more specialist intervention from the Assessment, Consultation and Therapy Service (ACTS).  This is a national service provided by Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, that provides clinical services to children in detention and in special care, as well as short term interventions when the child returns to the community.  There are also a number of other therapeutic and education programmes delivered on the Oberstown campus which are aimed at addressing offending behaviour patterns by children and ensuring their reintegration into society with all relevant supports that may be available in the community on a child's release put in place.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may also wish to note that earlier community based interventions to divert young people from offending behaviour, such as the Garda Youth Diversions Projects and the Garda Diversion Programme are also in place in the community and come under the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-12-02a.294.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015120200082#WRE03500"><p>The most important step in addressing bullying, including cyberbullying, is for parents to talk to children about bullying whether it is through social media or not.  Data gathered from nine year old children as part of Growing Up in Ireland, the National Longitudinal Survey commissioned by my department,  showed that <font color="#212100"> </font>based on responses from their mothers, 24% of children had been victims of bullying in the past year.  This represents a significantly lower proportion than that reported by children themselves, which was reported at 40%, suggesting either that many parents are unaware that their child has experienced bullying in the previous year, or that they may have different perspectives about what constitutes bullying.</p><p>The Action Plan On Bullying: Report of the Anti-Bullying Working Group to the Minister for Education and Skills was published in January 2013 clearly recognised the necessity to tackle this issue in a holistic way which saw schools as pivotal, but placed the issue within a much wider social context.  The Plan sets out twelve actions aimed at helping to prevent and tackle all forms of bullying in primary and post-primary schools. The actions focus on support for schools, teacher training, research and awareness raising.  Good progress has been made in implementing the actions set out in the report.  New National Anti-Bullying Procedures for schools were published in September 2013 and are currently being implemented by all 4,000 primary and post primary schools in the country.  Training materials for parents, teachers and Boards of Management are also being developed and rolled out. Cyberbullying is just one aspect of bullying, but one given the rapid expansion of access to technology by young people has come much more sharply into focus.  The Stay Safe Programme, a personal safety skills programme for children is currently being updated to be available to schools during the 2015/2016 school year. The lessons on Bullying in the revised Stay Safe Programme relate to the types of Bullying Behaviour outlined in the definition of Bullying in the Anti-Bullying Procedures.</p><p>Schools are strengthening collaboration and interaction with youth services and promote the active participation by pupils in youth focused services within their local communities.  DCYA supports the National Youth Health Programme which is in partnership with the HSE and the National Youth Council of Ireland.  The programme's aims are to provide a broad-based, flexible health promotion/education support and training service to youth organisations and to all those working with young people in out-of-school settings, and includes programmes aimed at exploring bullying and cyberbullying with young people.  Young people being bullied, or indeed those engaging in bullying behaviour, will sometimes need support which goes beyond that can be provided by their immediate family.  Work is currently underway with primary care teams in the HSE to pilot 'social prescribing'.  Social prescribing creates a formal means of enabling primary care services to refer young people with social, emotional or practical needs which include experience of being bullied or showing bullying behaviour to a variety of holistic, local non-clinical services.</p><p>The Office for Internet Safety is an Executive Office of the Department of Justice and Equality has lead responsibility for internet safety in Ireland, particularly as it relates to children.  In the Department of Justice and Equality, the Office for Internet Safety (OIS) acts as the co-ordinator in Ireland for the EU Safer Internet Programme.  The OIS has a dedicated website which contains information and links on internet safety, it also has a series of booklets on internet safety issues which are available to parents and teachers.  In addition, it produces awareness raising materials for the Safer Internet Day which is held in February each year. In 2013 and 2014 these concentrated on the issue of cyberbullying.  As part of its work it holds an annual Safer Internet Day, which has included a rollout of a social marketing campaign specifically targeted at young people.  The resources produced by the Office for Internet Safety makes available free of charge, in hard and soft copy, information resources on combating cyberbullying and on general safety online.</p><p>The Law reform Commission is currently conducting a project on <i>Cyber-crime affecting personal safety, privacy and reputation, including cyber-bullying.</i>The project will include an analysis of the types of harmful behaviour involved in this area, in particular bullying, and the impact which cyber-bullying through social media has had.  The Commission&rsquo;s report and recommendations, when available, will also inform consideration of any future action by Government in this area.  </p><p>The Minister of  Communications established an Internet Content Governance Advisory Group under the chair of Dr. Brian O&rsquo;Neil in 2013 to ensure our national policy represents best practice in offering the same online protections to our citizens as those available in the offline world.  The Group&rsquo;s Report which was published in June, 2014 included wide ranging recommendations.  Many of these recommendations were administrative in nature, and are being implemented, a number of structural recommendations are currently under consideration.</p><p>The internet is a fluid, evolving environment, requiring policy makers, industry and relevant stakeholders to be flexible as they adapt to changing and emerging contexts.  Parents also have a very important role in talking to their children about these issues and becoming familiar with tools and resources that will enable their children to take advantage of the many great opportunities the internet offers in a safe and positive manner.  The internet does not now and will not stand still. But the work I have outlined will assist in shaping the governmental response, in the interests of all citizens.</p></reply>

Since 2007 the study has followed the progress of two groups of children: 8,000 9-year-olds and 10,000 9-month-olds across Ireland to collect a host of information to help improve our understanding of all aspects of children and their development.</p>  <p>  The Growing Up in Ireland Study has investigated depression and mood in the older child cohort and as the infant cohort ages, similar questions will be introduced. </p>  <p>  The 13 year old wave of data collection included a &lsquo;Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire&rsquo; (not a clinical measure of depression) and a Children&rsquo;s Self-Concept Scale for measuring the child&rsquo;s self-esteem.  The study found &lsquo;low mood&rsquo; to be substantially associated with relationships with family, school and peers. &lsquo;Low mood&rsquo; was strongly related to all aspects of self-esteem.</p>  <p>  These findings are summarised in the Growing Up in Ireland report: &lsquo;The Lives of 13-year-olds: Their Relationships, Feelings and Behaviours&rsquo;.  This report is available on the Growing Up in Ireland website. </p>  <p>  Phase Two of Growing Up in Ireland has recently commenced, with data being collected from 17 year olds.  This includes a range of questions regarding mental health.  One such question in the questionnaire asks specifically on how many days over the past week did the respondent feel depressed. </p>  <p>  Growing Up in Ireland is compliant with the Statistics Act, and so participant&rsquo;s anonymity is maintained and this data is used for statistical purposes only.  It is not used as an early-alert support.  However if completing the questionnaire brings issues to the surface a young person they will be provided with information about where they can seek help.  </p>  <p>  Growing Up in Ireland data is open to the public. Requests can be made through the Irish Social Science Data Archive in UCD, or through my Department.</p>  <p>  With reference to early alert and subsequent support, this falls under the remit of my colleague the Minister for Health.</p>  <p>  In the first instance, any parent who suspects his/her child may be suffering from mental health problems should bring their child to their local GP who will in turn refer the child to the appropriate Mental Health Services, Primary Care or approved Child and Adult team.</p>  <p>  The HSE Mental Health Division supports timely access to appropriate services to address the mental health needs of all children from a preventative care model and early intervention perspective.  It should be noted, however, that mental health problems are not the sole remit of Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS).  Depending on the nature and severity the health need, services may be provided by the Childcare services, at Primary Care or at CAMHS level. </p>  <p>  The HSE recently adopted a Standard Operating Procedure for both in-patient and community based CAMHS.  This should help to ensure that services are delivered consistently and transparently.  Most importantly, it will help to ensure that the care and treatment offered reflects the identified clinical needs of the child.</p></reply>

It identifies the five national outcomes towards which all of government, and indeed all of society, must work to achieve for children and young people.  These are that children and young people should be:</p><p>1. Active and healthy with physical and mental well-being;</p><p>2. Achieving full potential in all areas of learning and development;</p><p>3. Safe and protected from harm;</p><p>4. Enjoying economic security and opportunity;</p><p>5. Connected, respected and contributing to their world.</p><p>Based on these outcomes, <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures</i>sets out, centralises and coordinates key policy commitments for children and young people across Government, and commits to measuring progress against the outcomes.  It also establishes a robust implementation infrastructure to support implementation and monitoring and has improved coordination of policies and services for children and young people.</p></reply>

A key focus has been additional posts to strengthen Community Mental Health Teams for both adults and children.  This funding is also being used to enhance specialist community mental health services for older people with a mental illness, those with an intellectual disability and mental illness, the forensic mental health services, and suicide prevention initiatives. </p><p>Around 1,150 new posts have been approved since 2012 to 2014.  These posts facilitate the policy of moving away from traditional institutional based care to a patient-centred, flexible and community based mental health service where hospital admissions are greatly reduced, while still providing in-patient care when appropriate. As at end September:</p><p>- 400.5 or 96% of the 416 development posts for 2012 have started;</p><p>- 431 or 90% of the 477.5 development posts for 2013 have started;</p><p>- Of the 251 development posts for 2014, 103 have been recruited of which 97 had started by 30 September 2015, and a further 64.5 are at various stages of the recruitment process.</p><p>Following discussions between the Department of Health and the HSE around the allocation of the &euro;35 million provided for mental health in 2015, the priority areas to be further enhanced and developed have been agreed and approved.  Some of the funding will be used this year to improve safety and regulatory compliance of services, as well as funding enhanced service capacity, which was funded up to now through the use of time-related savings from previous years&rsquo; allocations.  A further &euro;35 million has been secured for mental health in 2016.  The details of the 2016 Budget will be finalised with the HSE in the context of approval of its 2016 National Service Plan, which will also outline the total amount of funding for all services, including, mental health services, in 2016.</p></reply>

Additional funding of &euro;12 million, was allocated by the Health Service Executive (HSE) to meet the needs of almost 1,400 young people who required continuing health-funded supports on leaving school or rehabilitative training (RT) this year, of which &euro;6 million was made available to provide services from September.</p>  <p>  Finding the resources and the physical capacity to meet the needs of a growing number of new service users every year is a challenging task.  When this year&rsquo;s support requirements were identified, the cost of meeting those needs in full exceeded the amount available and an additional &euro;1.5 million was added by the HSE to the overall allocation, making a total of &euro;13.5 million full-year costs available to meet those needs.  A further &euro;1.5 million once-off capital funding was also allocated by the HSE for the provision of suitable buildings, premises and accommodation.</p>  <p>  I understand from the HSE that by early July, 97% of all school-leavers in Community Healthcare Area 9 had been offered a placement from September which met their needs in full.  In relation to the individuals that had applied for a service from Gheel Autism Services, the HSE indicated in early July that there would be an allocation of &euro;708,000 made available to Gheel to provide the model of day service that they had developed and once off capital funding of &euro;80,000.  However, following extensive negotiations with Gheel during July and August, it was established that services for these individuals could not be delivered by Gheel within this allocation and that Gheel would not be a provider of services for these young people.</p>  <p>  Following these negotiations, the HSE initiated discussions in August with two alternative service providers, Praxis Care and Autism Initiatives, who already provide quality day services to young people with autism.  These providers have agreed to develop appropriate service responses for 21 young people.  Of these 21, two individuals have recently commenced with Praxis.  Home support services are being made available to the remaining 19 individuals as an interim arrangement and I understand from the HSE, that their new service will be in place by the end of March 2016 at the latest.</p>  <p>  Each Local Health Office area in the HSE has a dedicated Disability Manager to coordinate the delivery of services to people with disabilities.  It is open to this family to pursue the matter with the Disability Manager for their area who can be contacted at the HSE offices, Fujitsu House, Unit 100, 4th Floor, Lakeshore Drive, Airside Business Park, Swords, Co. Dublin, telephone 01-8953727.</p></reply>

In the rest of the English speaking world the titles of <i>physical therapist</i>and <i>physiotherapist</i>are interchangeable and their users are qualified physiotherapists.  In Ireland, however, the title is used by a number of practitioners who are not physiotherapists but who are competing with physiotherapists in the private sector in the provision of musculoskeletal therapies. </p><p>Earlier this year, having consulted with the Health and Social Care Professionals Council, I wrote to a number of relevant organisations regarding my proposal to protect the title of <i>physical therapist </i>as a variant of the title of <i>physiotherapist </i>and invited them to submit their views. The submissions are now being examined and I expect that I will make a decision on the matter before the end of the year that ensures public protection and appropriately addresses the legitimate concerns of all parties. </p></reply>

Patients are assessed by the HSE Orthodontic Service under the modified Index of Treatment Need. Patients with the greatest level of need i.e. Grade 5 or Grade 4 are provided with treatment by the HSE. Under EU Directive 201/24/EU, now commonly referred to as the Cross Border Directive (CBH), it is open to persons entitled to public patient healthcare in Ireland to choose to avail of that healthcare in another EU or EEA country or Switzerland.  Access to orthodontic care under the CBD may be availed of by patients who have been assessed as eligible under the modified Index of Treatment Need. </p>  <p>  The pilot scheme in the Dublin North East area (DNE), which involves up-skilling staff to work as orthodontic therapists is currently underway.  One member of the dental hygienist staff and one member of the dental nursing staff completed a one-year training course in September 2015. They are now working in the HSE under the supervision of specialist orthodontists. The scheme is currently undergoing an evaluation, which includes consideration of how the scheme is affecting waiting lists. Figures are currently being collated and early indications are positive. It is planned to extend the scheme nationally after the evaluation has been completed. </p>  <p>  As recruitment of staff in the Midlands is a service matter, this part of the question has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.  If you have not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days please contact my Private Office and they will follow up the matter with them.</p></reply>

That strategy is based on two key objectives: first, to see this citizen released by the Egyptian authorities so that he can return to his family and his studies in Ireland and secondly to provide consular support for his welfare while he remains in detention. </p>  <p>  In furtherance of these objectives, I have intensively engaged with the Egyptian authorities, including the Egyptian Minister for Foreign Affairs and Egypt&rsquo;s Ambassador to Ireland, and with EU and international partners, including High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Ms. Federica Mogherini.  The Taoiseach also raised the case in person on two occasions with Egyptian President al-Sisi.  The information we receive from all of these contacts is carefully considered and used in reviewing our approach to this case on a constant basis.</p>  <p>  Significant resources in Cairo and in Dublin continue to be deployed in the provision of comprehensive consular assistance to both the citizen and their family.  I would also note that Embassy officials visited this citizen in detention for the forty-eighth time on 23 November.  Irrespective of any views regarding the fairness or appropriateness of any arrest abroad, the reality is that where an Irish citizen is charged with an offence under the law of a foreign country, it is the foreign law that applies and it is the relevant foreign court which decides matters such as bail and release.</p>  <p>  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade continues to review its approach and retains the flexibility to adjust it as and when that may be required, but the Government&rsquo;s approach is guided at all times by the two key objectives set out above.</p></reply>

Where children with such needs have consequential care or learning support needs, additional Resource Teaching and/or care support is provided to schools to support their needs in school.  For pupils who require more specialised supports, special school and special class placements are also available.</p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), for allocating resource teaching and Special Needs Assistant (SNA) support, to schools to support children with special educational needs.  The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support, which is set out in my Department's Circular 0030/2014.</p>  <p>  Circular 0030/2014 sets out the policy of allocating SNA support for a newly enrolling Junior Infant who has a clear and obvious need for such support e.g. a child who has a significant additional care need arising from an intellectual, sensory or physical disability.  For those children where it is not yet clear whether difficulties will manifest in a classroom environment, the Circular states that, in general, it is expected that all primary school pupils having their first school experience will have been enrolled and will have commenced attending school before any application for SNA support will be made.  In relation to possible anticipated behavioural difficulties in particular, it is more appropriate to wait until the child begins school in order to see how they have been able to engage in the classroom.</p>  <p>  The Circular explains that provision of SNA support should not be considered as a first response for management of behaviour, and should only be provided where it is clear that behavioural management strategies have not been successful to date and where it is demonstrated how access to such support can assist with ongoing planning and intervention for the child.</p>  <p>  Responsibility for the management of behaviour in schools is a matter for individual schools.  Schools may seek advice from the National Educational Psychological Service, their Special Educational Needs Organiser, or from the National Behavioural Support Service as to how children with behavioural needs can best be supported in school.</p>  <p>  It is open to schools to contact their local SENO to discuss the SNA and resource teaching allocation process.  Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available the NCSE website www.ncse.ie.</p>  <p>  As this question relates to an application for support for an individual child, I will arrange to have the matter referred to the NCSE for their attention and direct reply to the Deputy.</p></reply>

Within the grant schemes, the level and extent of services provided is a matter for school management who, through the discretion afforded under the scheme, apply diverse arrangements for secretarial and/or caretaking services as resources permit.</p>  <p>  Where a school uses the grant funding to employ a Secretary and/or Caretaker, such staff are employees of the individual school.  My Department therefore does not have any role in determining the pay and conditions under which they are engaged.  These are matters to be agreed between the staff concerned and the school management, subject of course to any relevant statutory provisions.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the above, it was recently agreed that my Department would engage in an arbitration process regarding the pay of School Secretaries and Caretakers.

Due to concerns in relation to the fact that in some cases the higher non-EU fee was being charged to students who held EU/EEA/Swiss nationality but did not meet the residency clause for free fees, the Department requested higher education institutions to charge the more moderate EU fee to such students who have completed at least five academic years of study (primary or post-primary level) in Ireland/EU/EEA/Switzerland and commence their first undergraduate course of study in an approved institution here.  This position took effect from the academic year 2014/15. There are no plans to further amend this provision.</p></reply>

The Plan takes a comprehensive approach including increases in high-level graduate output, enhancing awareness of ICT as a career among students, maintaining a strong talent pool and promoting Ireland as a destination for ICT talent. Implementation of the plan is being overseen by a high-level steering group shared by the two departments and including representatives from industry and the education system, and delivery teams have been set up to progress areas of work set out under the plan.</p>  <p>  ICT graduate output from the higher education sector has increased significantly since the first ICT plan was published in 2011.</p>  <p>  In order to increase the number of mainstream ICT graduates, in 2014 the Higher Education Authority (HEA) introduced incentivised level 8 ICT places whereby higher education institutions were offered a top up grant of &euro;1,000 per additional place offered.</p>  <p>  The funding provided in 2014 and 2015 in respect of the additional Level 8 places is &euro;427,020 providing for an additional 200 places in 2014/15 and an additional partial payment of 30% towards the provision of 1,060 in 2015/16.  The data for registrations for 2015/16 will not be available until the new year and this will be used as the basis for further funding allocations for 2015/16.  My Department is working actively with all partners on progression of this initiative and is making plans in respect of 2016.</p>  <p>  Springboard+, which incorporates the ICT skills conversion programme, was introduced in 2011 and is providing free higher education places for jobseekers who wish to upskill or reskill in areas of identified skills needs. ICT is one of the key areas targeted and to date almost 11,500 people have taken an ICT course, at all levels of the National Framework of Qualifications.  Funding of the order of &euro;63.8m has been allocated for this ICT provision.  The Springboard programme is managed by the HEA on behalf of my Department and academic and employment outcomes for Springboard graduates are very strong.  Further information on outcomes is available in the trend analysis reports which are published on www.springboardcourses.ie.</p>  <p>  The Information Technology Investment Fund (ITIF) continues to be managed by the HEA, in response to Information and Communications Technology (ICT) skills needs as identified by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN).  The aim of the ITIF is to support student access to, and participation on, courses which would provide an opportunity to acquire new or additional Level 7 - 9 qualifications so as to enhance their employability in ICT areas.  Courses are required to contain significant levels of ICT content and areas of study include Business Informatics, Multimedia Technology, Software Design and Development, Bio-engineering, Telecommunications and Information Systems.</p>  <p>  Overall, I am confident that the quality of our ICT graduates remains very strong, and I would note that graduates are very well regarded by industry and remain in very high demand as they contribute to exciting developments in ICT in Ireland. </p></reply>

Details of the individual targets set for local authorities can be found on my Department&rsquo;s website at: <font color="#1F497D">.</font></p><p>The Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) is a social housing support introduced to cater for the accommodation needs of persons who are in receipt of long term rent supplement.  Persons normally must be in receipt of continuous rent supplement for a minimum period of 18 months, and be assessed as having a long term housing need.  The target number of households to be transferred from Rent Supplement to RAS over the period of the Strategy is 6,000, of which a national target of 2,000 has been set for 2015. </p><p>Under the Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme (SHCEP) units can be delivered in a variety of ways and local authorities are encouraged to explore and use all of these mechanisms.  These mechanisms include units purchased, leased or constructed by approved housing bodies and both multi-unit developments and individual units leased or acquired through rental arrangements directly by local authorities.  Units leased by local authorities or approved housing bodies can be for up to 20 years.  The accommodation provided is made available to persons on local authority waiting lists, persons with long term housing needs in receipt of rent supplement or persons who are homeless.  A target of 3,000 units has been set for delivery in 2015 under SHCEP. Local authorities together with approved housing bodies are working consistently to achieve targets under the SHCEP scheme.</p><p>The information requested in relation to progress against the targets set for RAS and SHCEP up to the end of October 2015 is set out in the table.</p><p>While the targets set out in the Strategy for delivery in 2015 are ambitious, I am confident that the investment that the Government is making in social housing supply is delivering real results.  Together, the RAS and SHCEP Schemes had met the social housing needs of an additional 2,501 households in the 10 months to end October this year.</p><p>Furthermore, I am committed to facilitating local authorities returning the maximum number of void social housing units to productive use as possible in 2015.  In addition to the original funding I provided for this purpose in 2015, and conscious of the impact of the pressures in the private rental market on delivery under the RAS and SHCEP schemes, I have increased the budget allocation in order deliver an estimated 2,500 void units back into productive use this year. <table><tr><th>-</th><th colspan="2">Transfers to RASJanuary - October 2015</th><th colspan="2">SHCEPJanuary - October 2015</th></tr><tr><td>Local Authority </td><td>RAS Final Targets </td><td>RAS Total Transfers </td><td>SHCEP (leasing) Final Targets </td><td>SHCEP Outputs to End October </td></tr><tr><td>Carlow CC </td><td>40 </td><td>36 </td><td>65 </td><td>5 </td></tr><tr><td>Cavan CC </td><td>53 </td><td>55 </td><td>25 </td><td>2 </td></tr><tr><td>Clare CC </td><td>57 </td><td>38 </td><td>75 </td><td>40 </td></tr><tr><td>Cork City Cl. </td><td>105 </td><td>71 </td><td>128 </td><td>25 </td></tr><tr><td>Cork CC </td><td>75 </td><td>21 </td><td>170 </td><td>86 </td></tr><tr><td>Donegal CC </td><td>46 </td><td>37 </td><td>65 </td><td>16 </td></tr><tr><td>Dublin City Cl. </td><td>110 </td><td>82 </td><td>425 </td><td>211 </td></tr><tr><td>South Dublin CC </td><td>165 </td><td>152 </td><td>200 </td><td>125 </td></tr><tr><td>Dun-Rathdown CC </td><td>75 </td><td>15 </td><td>75 </td><td>10 </td></tr><tr><td>Fingal CC </td><td>110 </td><td>60 </td><td>200 </td><td>30 </td></tr><tr><td>Galway City Cl. </td><td>20 </td><td>12 </td><td>90 </td><td>38 </td></tr><tr><td>Galway Co.

The scheme is administered by local community and voluntary groups with the support of my Department.

While it was not indicated that any other people would be attending the meeting, Deputy Ryan was, in fact, accompanied by two people who were part of a company that had bid in the tender process to establish a panel of preferred suppliers for the equipment needed for the supply and installation of personal monitored alarms, at what I am advised was ultimately a meeting of brief duration in respect of which minutes were not considered necessary.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the assessment of the tenders including the award of contracts under the procurement process concerned was carried out wholly separately by Pobal, an independent company, following a public advertisement on eTenders on 20 October 2014.
