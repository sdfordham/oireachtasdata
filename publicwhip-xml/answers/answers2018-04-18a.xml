The scheme leverages &euro;23 million exchequer funding (&euro;14 million from my Department and &euro;9 million from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine) using a guarantee structure to provide a &euro;300 million fund for lending to eligible businesses.  Participating finance providers are Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank, with AIB to follow in June.</p>  <p>  The scheme is open to eligible businesses with up to 499 employees, which can demonstrate that they are significantly exposed to the impact (or potential impact) of Brexit.  They must be a viable business, doing business in Ireland, and they must have a business plan demonstrating that they plan to innovate, change or adapt in response to Brexit.  </p>  <p>  As part of the launch of the scheme, my Department developed a Brexit Loan Scheme Information Pack for state agencies, TDs and Local Enterprise Offices to ensure that information on the scheme is easily available.  The Information Pack is also available through my Department&rsquo;s website.</p>  <p>  The scheme is operated by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI). As such, the SBCI will promote the Brexit Loan Scheme as part of its overall marketing plan for 2018.  This is likely to include a combination of radio, social media and business targeted press coverage.</p>  <p>  The agencies of my Department are also fully engaged in preparing for Brexit. Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s (EI) #PrepareforBrexit communications campaign, featuring the &lsquo;Brexit SME Scorecard&rsquo;, was launched in March 2017. The Scorecard is an interactive online platform which can be used by all Irish companies to self-assess their exposure to Brexit.  </p>  <p>  In terms of industry preparedness, 2,104 companies have engaged with the EI Brexit scorecard since April of last year, of whom 974 are non-clients.  The majority are in construction, engineering or other manufacturing, Software and ICT or other services. The results indicate that the level of preparedness is &lsquo;medium to low&rsquo; but improving.  The Brexit Scorecard overall average scores (out of 10) from completed reports of the last 6 months is 4.91 for EI clients and 4.08 for non EI clients.</p>  <p>  As part of awareness-raising activities, EI is rolling out regional Brexit Advisory clinics throughout the year and the Brexit Loan Scheme is being promoted through these events.  To date, clinics have been held in Letterkenny, Tralee, Portlaoise, Claremorris, Cootehill and Charleville. A Brexit two-day external consultancy support is also being rolled out to individual clients to help them develop a detailed sustainable growth plan.</p>  <p>  EI has also introduced a &lsquo;Be Prepared Grant&rsquo; which offers up to &euro;5,000 for exporting client companies to conduct further research and use external expertise to develop a Brexit Action Plan. </p>  <p>  The funding to the Local Enterprise Offices has been increased by 22% over the last two years and they, along with InterTrade Ireland, are offering a range of Brexit focused supports to companies, including those engaged in cross-border trade with Northern Ireland. InterTrade Ireland also provides vouchers to enable companies to get professional advice on Brexit, including likely tariffs, currency management, regulatory and customs issues, and movement of labour, goods and services.</p></reply>

The Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) play a critical role in supporting micro-enterprises in the start-up and expansion phases in every part of the country.  </p>  <p>   The LEOs can offer direct grant aid to micro-enterprises, that is those with ten employees or fewer, in the manufacturing and internationally traded services sector which, over time, have the potential to develop into strong export entities.  The LEOs also offer &lsquo;soft&rsquo; supports in the form of training and mentoring for anyone interested in starting or growing a business. In addition, the LEOs provide a &lsquo;signposting&rsquo; service for the micro-enterprise and SME sector in relation to other relevant State supports, for example: Enterprise Ireland, Revenue; the Department of Social Protection; Microfinance Ireland; Trading Online Vouchers, LEADER, and Education &amp;amp; Training Boards (ETBs).  </p>  <p>  A net total of 3,760 new jobs were delivered in 2017 by start-ups and small businesses from across the country that have been supported by the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs). </p>  <p>  This brings the total number of new jobs created by LEO-backed companies nationwide to 15,000 since the LEOs were set up in 2014.</p>  <p>  That is an increase of 10% on 2016 - and the fourth straight year of employment growth.</p>  <p>  Growth was evident in each area showing that each county has the potential to grow its own jobs if the right promotion, encouragement and supports are put in place.</p>  <p>  The Capital allocation made available and maintained in 2018 to the 31 LEOs is &euro;22.5m, which is an increase from &euro;18.5 from 2016. This is being used to fund LEO clients by way of financial assistance and a range of soft supports, for example for mentoring, training and innovation and for entrepreneurship initiatives such as Ireland&rsquo;s Best Young Entrepreneur Competition, known as the IBYE competition.</p>  <p>  The latest assessment of IBYE run by the LEOs for my Department indicate that 348 entrepreneurs won IBYE investment funding of between &euro;3,000 and &euro;50,000 from their Local Enterprise Offices and they now in turn have current annual sales of &euro;124 million and employ 2,217 people.</p>  <p>  In addition, the LEOs have also delivered specific Brexit initiatives for micro-enterprises, including: </p>  <p>  -  LEO Competitive Fund for Innovative Micro Enterprises: this new competitive initiative incentivised LEO clients to engage in innovation to develop New Product, Process or Markets. </p>  <p>  -  Technical Assistance Grants for Micro Export:  Financial assistance to support market diversification in qualifying businesses to develop new market opportunities. </p>  <p>  -  The LEO&rsquo;s developed a Lean4Micro offer for micro enterprise clients: Helping business clients adopt LEAN business practices to increase competitiveness. </p>  <p>  A new client portfolio management model will be rolled out this year nationally to the LEOs by Enterprise Ireland, which will support portfolio performance and potential. </p>  <p>  The LEOs also play a key role in the delivery nationally of four key objectives in the Action Plan for Rural Development including the &lsquo;Options Plus&rsquo; programme for improving off-farm income generation of farmers and to link farm families with a variety of learning opportunities provided by other agencies including the ETBs, LDCs, third level institutions and the Department of Social Protection.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-04-18a.19.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1272" speakername="Pat Breen" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018041800067#WRA01700"><p>Despite intense competition, the trajectory of Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness performance is positive. Improved competitiveness is reflected in strong employment growth across sectors and regions. On the major cost headings, such as labour, property and tax, the National Competitiveness Council has reported in recent years that Ireland is a relatively cost competitive location in which to do business. </p>  <p>  However, there is no room for complacency. In the period prior to the financial crash we did not pay sufficient attention to our cost base and let our international competitiveness erode. Nobody wants to repeat that. As the economy continues to grow, there is a role for both the public and private sectors to proactively manage the controllable portion of costs. As Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, my objective is to create the best possible environment for enterprise, entrepreneurship and investment across all regions. My colleague, the Minister for Finance, has responsibility for insurance regulation.</p>  <p>  On the cost of insurance for business, price inflation for insurance, particularly motor insurance, increased significantly in the period 2014 to 2016. The rate of increase eased in 2017 and the most recent CSO data for March 2018 shows insurance prices are now 5% lower than last year with motor insurance prices 13% lower.  The price of motor insurance has been falling every month since April 2017. </p>  <p>  While the CSO data shows greater price stability, I appreciate the figures represent an average and there may be enterprises and consumers still seeing increases.  The problem of rising insurance premiums for enterprise was the impetus for the establishment by the Minister for Finance of the Cost of Insurance Working Group in July 2016. The ongoing implementation of the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance, in parallel with the implementation of the Working Group's Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance, will make a difference to the pricing of insurance.  I am confident that the implementation of all the recommendations cumulatively, with the appropriate levels of commitment and cooperation from relevant stakeholders, will achieve the objectives of delivering fairer premiums for all and improving the cost of doing business.  </p></reply>

The &euro;23 million exchequer funding (&euro;14 million from my Department and &euro;9 million from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine) has been leveraged to provide a fund of up to &euro;300 million. Participating finance providers are the Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank with Allied Irish Bank following in June.</p>  <p>  The scheme features a two-stage application process.  First, businesses must apply to the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) to confirm their eligibility for the scheme. This application process requires businesses to use guidelines provided on the SBCI website to determine if they are eligible, and if so, to complete the eligibility form.  As part of the process, businesses must submit a business plan, demonstrating the means by which they intend to innovate, change or adapt to meet the challenges posed by Brexit. The SBCI assess the applications and successful applicants receive an eligibility reference number. </p>  <p>  Successful applicants can then apply for a loan under the scheme with one of the participating finance providers.   </p>  <p>  The Brexit Loan Scheme is designed to assist Irish SMEs in the short-term to deal with the challenges of Brexit, which include the pressures of increased market instability and currency volatility. The scheme is available to businesses that are demonstrably exposed to negative impacts (or potential impacts) arising as a result of Brexit. Businesses must fully meet the eligibility requirements, which include being viable, having a business development strategy and demonstrable exposure to Brexit. The scheme is open to both State Agency clients and businesses that do not have any relationship with State Agencies.

That is why, for example, additional financial resources have been provided to support the strategic response by our enterprise agencies, including IDA Ireland, to Brexit. The Government has also taken forward a number of well documented Brexit-related initiatives to help businesses prepare for the future.</p>  <p>  Brexit, or more particularly the response to the challenges it presents, has been especially significant in shaping IDA Ireland's strategy and operations. This includes the Agency's approach to regional development, finance, planning, marketing and promotional activities. </p>  <p>  I am very much conscious of the particular difficulties that Brexit could have for border counties and the need to offset those, wherever possible, with increased investment. With regard to Donegal, there are already 12 IDA Ireland client companies based in the County, employing nearly 3,400 people. The level of employment by multinationals in Donegal has actually increased by 52% since 2012 and the IDA is working hard, with both its existing client base there and prospective investors, to create even more jobs there. </p>  <p>  While foreign direct investment (FDI) is important to jobs growth in Donegal and elsewhere, we need to remember that it forms only one part of our efforts to generate economic growth in regional locations. Indigenous enterprise also, of course, plays a crucial role in creating employment opportunities. In 2017, for example, 3,552 people were employed in Enterprise Ireland (EI) supported companies in Donegal. In the period from 2015-2017 EI also paid &euro;4 million to client companies in the County to support them to innovate, improve competitiveness and to diversify their global footprint. Like the IDA, EI engages constantly with its clients in Donegal to help support their growth and potential expansion. </p>  <p>  Other bodies are working as well to help enterprises in Donegal both grow and plan for Brexit. The Local Enterprise Offices and InterTrade Ireland, for example, are both active in the border area. </p></reply>

The manufacturing and internationally traded services companies that Enterprise Ireland works with are a critical source of existing employment and job creation in every county in Ireland and are spread across a wide range of sectors. </p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Trade Missions and Events promote the capabilities of client companies to potential business partners and customers in international markets; a central element of the agency&rsquo;s strategy for 2017 -2020: Build Scale, Expand Reach.  In 2017 Enterprise Ireland ran 57 ministerial-led international trade events. </p>  <p>  On an annual basis, Enterprise Ireland publishes its schedule for Trade Missions and Events. This schedule is comprised of: </p>  <p>  - Trade Missions / Outward Missions;</p>  <p>  -  Trade  Visits / Fairs;</p>  <p>  - Client Knowledge Forums;</p>  <p>  - Inward Mission Events;</p>  <p>  - Market Study Visits</p>  <p>  The annual list of Trade Missions and Events is communicated to all client companies and is publicly available, including on the Enterprise Ireland website. </p>  <p>  On the 12th March 2018, Enterprise Ireland announced that it is set to undertake over 200 international and domestic trade events in 2018 to accelerate the number of Enterprise Ireland clients diversifying into new markets, beyond the UK and into the Eurozone and global markets. The number of trade events being undertaken represents a 50% increase on 2017, reflecting the challenge that Brexit poses for Irish businesses. 70 of these export focused trade events will be led by Government Ministers.</p>  <p>  At present, I have no plans to lead a trade mission to the United Arab Emirates or Saudi Arabia in 2018.  Later in the year, my Departmental officials will begin discussions with Enterprise Ireland with regard to the proposed ministerial trade mission list for 2019, for my subsequent approval.   As part of the implementation of the Agency's Trade Missions and Events Schedule for 2018, Enterprise Ireland is planning a trade mission to Saudi Arabia, UAE and Kuwait in early November.  This mission will focus on developing business opportunities for Irish companies in the ICT, Fintech, Food and Agritech and Engineering/Construction sectors.  It has been timed to coincide with the Gulf Food Manufacturing Exhibition in Dubai where Enterprise Ireland will support clients exhibiting on an Ireland stand.  Ministerial leadership of this Mission has yet to be determined.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland also ran an international trade event to the annual 'Arab Health' Exhibition in Dubai in January of this year, which was led by the Minister of State for Mental Health and Older People, Jim Daly T.D.  Arab Health is the largest healthcare exhibition and conference in the Middle East and North Africa region. The trade visit focused on maximising business opportunities for the 20 Enterprise Ireland clients exhibiting and participating.</p>  <p>  The primary focus of all trade missions is to encourage business-to-business links and encourage investment and employment opportunities.  To be effective in raising human rights issues with other countries we must do it in an appropriate way and at the right opportunity, so that our concerns are taken seriously and acted upon.  Ireland has always been at the forefront internationally in raising human rights issues through bilateral contacts and especially through the European Union and the United Nations. We will continue to be a strong advocate for higher global standards that improve human rights, and encourage the highest standards of business conduct and corporate social responsibility.</p></reply>

It contributes significantly to job creation, exports and investment, and the competitiveness of the indigenous enterprise base, and also to embedding the foreign direct investment base in Ireland. </p><p>It is clear that a strong interdependence exists therefore between science, technology and innovation policy and enterprise policy. My Department has developed its Innovation 2020 strategy and its Enterprise 2025 policy side by side. A critical objective for my Department and its agencies, including Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland, is delivering on the actions and commitments set out in Innovation 2020. </p><p>Enterprise Ireland plays a particularly important role in supporting indigenous enterprises in Ireland. Between 2014 and 2016 employment in Enterprise Ireland backed companies reached 200,000. In its new strategy 2017 - 2020, Building Scale, Expanding Reach, Enterprise Ireland is aiming to increase this further with a new target to create an additional 60,000 new jobs by 2020. The Strategy also aims to drive innovation in Irish enterprise to unprecedented levels through new supports to reach the target of &euro;1.25bn in R&amp;amp;D expenditure by its client companies per annum by 2020 (from &euro;0.92bn in 2016). </p><p>My Department also recognises that innovation is a critical element of regional economic sustainability. In order to show growth regional firms must be enabled to achieve sales outside their region.  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s innovation support programmes achieve a very strong regional balance. For example, 76% of Enterprise Ireland Innovation Partnership projects and 83% of Enterprise Ireland Technology Gateway Projects are delivered outside Dublin.  </p><p>Furthermore, the Enterprise Ireland Regional Enterprise Development Fund (REDF), launched in May 2017, is a &euro;60 million competitive fund (over two Calls) aimed at supporting significant regional initiatives that will build on sectoral strengths and improve enterprise capability across the regions.</p><p>While the main objective of IDA Ireland is to encourage investment into Ireland by foreign-owned companies, the area of research, development and innovation (RDI) is of key importance to the agency. IDA Ireland&rsquo;s strategy Winning FDI 2015-2019 outlines a plan to support clients in creating 80,000 new jobs and increase employment in the client portfolio to 209,000 by 2019. Support for RDI will be key to achieving these targets. </p><p>Research, development and innovation investments not only embed existing FDI operations and employment but pave the way for future investment, job creation and export growth. </p><p>Project 2040 launched in February aims to provide balanced regional development through two strands &ndash; the and the . </p><p>The National Development Plan published in February contains a number of Strategic Investment Priorities linked to innovation aimed at supporting and growing competitive and innovative regional enterprises. These include:  </p><p>- Strengthened SFI Research Centres and EI Technology Centres in higher education in all regions</p><p>- A &euro;500 million Disruptive Technologies Innovation Fund </p><p>- New regional &ldquo;Technology and Innovation Poles&rdquo;, led through the Institutes of Technologies</p><p>- Expansion of Advanced Manufacturing Supports, linking centres and capacity across all regions; and</p><p>-  Expanding IDA Regional Property Programme, to attract investment to regions</p><p>These investment priorities will be progressed over the lifetime of the Plan, subject to detailed appraisal, value for money tests, consultation with relevant stakeholders and agreement on timeframes.  As these aspects are developed further, details will be set out in the strategies of my Department and the enterprise agencies over the lifetime of the NDP.</p></reply>

A key objective of each of the 8 regional plans is to have a further 10 to 15 per cent at work in each region by 2020, with the unemployment rate of each region not more than one percentage point greater than the national average.</p>  <p>  The North-East/North-West Regional Action Plan for Jobs has been a key policy response for supporting employment growth in the Border region. Local Authorities, enterprise agencies, and other key public and private sector stakeholders across counties Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim, Cavan, Monaghan and Louth have been strongly involved in, and are key drivers of, the NE/NW Action Plan. </p>  <p>  The core objective of the NE/NW Action Plan is to have a further 28,000 at work in the region by 2020. In terms of impact, 12,000 more people are in employment in the Border region from Q1 2015 (baseline year) to Q2 2017, representing good progress towards the target of 28,000 jobs by 2020 as set out in the Regional Action Plan.</p>  <p>  Achievements in the North West under the Action Plan since 2015 include Bord Iascaigh Mhara developing a virtual R&amp;D centre to link research institutes with the seafood sector; the award of  INTERREG funding to the North West Greenways Network, and the selection of 12 participants from the North West for Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s New Frontiers programme in 2017.</p>  <p>  In December last year I announced &euro;30.5 million in funding to support enterprise capability in the regions, with 21 projects from all over the country receiving funding. This Regional Enterprise Development Fund (REDF) totalling &euro;60 million is being rolled out by Enterprise Ireland over the next 4 years to support collaborative and innovative projects that can sustain and add to employment at a national, regional and county level. On Monday 16th April last I launched the second Call under the fund, making available the remainder of the &euro;60 million. </p>  <p>  Three projects from the Border region were successful under Call 1 of the Fund collectively securing over &euro;2 million : a network of three Digital and Innovation Hubs (incl. in Co. Leitrim); a new Digital Innovation Hub and enterprise capacity building programme in Co. Donegal; and a Regional Food Centre of Excellence in Co. Monaghan. </p>  <p>  The enterprise agencies continue their work to contribute towards the ambitious targets set out in the Regional Action Plan. Enterprise Ireland recently announced a 4% employment growth in its client companies for the Border region, which now employ almost 11,500 people. On the FDI front, the number of IDA-backed jobs grew by 4% as a whole last year, with almost 12,500 people employed in IDA companies in the region. </p>  <p>  Through partnership between Enterprise Ireland and the Local Authorities, the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) have supported 586 companies in the North West with 2,616 employees and last year LEO client companies in the North West added 190 new employees in total. </p>  <p>  Building on the progress and momentum of collaboration achieved to date through the Regional Action Plans is my priority. On Monday the 16th April last I met with the Chairs of the Regional APJ committees and other regional stakeholders, and together we have started a process to refresh and refocus all the Regional Plans to ensure their relevance and impact out to 2020. I look forward to working further with the regional stakeholders in the North-West to ensure we deliver to the employment targets for 2020 set out under the Regional Plans.</p></reply>

However, at Q4 2017, the unemployment rate in the South East was 7.3%; which is still too high when compared with the State rate of 6.1%. We will maintain a focus on the South East to ensure that the employment environment continues to improve.</p>  <p>  Amongst the achievements in the South East under the Action Plan since 2015 are: the establishment of the South East Creative Corridor; the South East Micro Food Clustering Project; and enterprise networking through the BizFest initiative.</p>  <p>  In 2017, both Enterprise Ireland and IDA reported job increases in the South East of 4% and 9% respectively, the IDA figure being the largest increase of all regions in the State in this period. Through partnership between Enterprise Ireland and the Local Authorities, the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) support just under 1,300 micro and small enterprises in the South East with over 7,000 employees. Last year LEO client companies in the South East (incl. Co. Tipperary) added over 700 new employees in total. </p>  <p>  To support the ambition, goals, and implementation of the Regional Action Plans for Jobs, last May my Department launched the competitive &euro;60m Regional Enterprise Development Fund delivered through Enterprise Ireland. A total of 21 collaborative projects were successful under the first call, securing up to &euro;30.5 million in total. Two projects in the South East, InsurTech Network Centre at IT Carlow and the ThreeD additive manufacturing initiative at WIT, received funding under the first funding call. On Monday 16th April last I announced the opening of Call 2 under the Fund, which will allocate the remainder of the &euro;60 million, and I hope to see more successful projects coming through from the South East region.</p>  <p>  Building on the progress and momentum of collaboration achieved to date through the Regional Action Plans is my priority.

The finance offered under the scheme is easier to access, more competitively priced, and at more favourable terms than other current offerings.  </p>  <p>  A Technical Working Group on State Aid comprising representatives from DG Competition, DBEI, EI and DAFM was established in November 2017.  The objective of the Group is to scope and design schemes to support enterprises impacted by Brexit in line with current applicable State Aid rules.  Should issues arise that require an approach that does not fit within the existing State Aid rules, this will be raised as part of the Working Group discussions. </p>  <p>  A notified Rescue and Restructuring (R&amp;R) scheme was approved by the Commission in late November 2017. This scheme has been put in place as it is considered prudent to have contingency measures in place so that we can respond swiftly to changing circumstances as necessary.  Under the scheme, which will run until 2020, Enterprise Ireland can provide restructuring support to SMEs in severe financial difficulties.  </p>  <p>  As part of the deliberations of the Working Group on State Aid, it was agreed that my officials should extend the R&amp;R scheme to include temporary restructuring support for those SMEs who experience acute liquidity needs.  This extension, which has been notified to the Commission, will be a welcome addition to our suite of supports for businesses impacted by Brexit.  The temporary restructuring support, together with the rescue aid and the capital support under the Brexit Loan scheme should provide support to those SMEs who require stabilisation during transition.</p></reply>

It is a &euro;60 million competitive fund aimed at supporting significant regional initiatives that will build on sectoral strengths and improve enterprise capability across the regions. The REDF is intended to support the ambition, goals, and implementation of the Regional Action Plans for Jobs.</p>  <p>  The REDF is aimed at accelerating economic recovery in all regions of the country by delivering on the potential of local and regional enterprise strengths. The Fund will support significant collaborative and innovative regional initiatives to build on specific industry sectoral strengths and improve enterprise capability, thereby driving job creation. This will be achieved by co-financing the development and implementation of collaborative and innovative projects that can sustain and add to employment at a national, regional and county level. The Fund will help to ensure the benefits of our growing economy are felt in all regions.   </p>  <p>  REDF funding is being made available over the period 2017-2020 under two competitive calls. I have committed to ensuring that each region will benefit by at least &euro;2 million from the Fund once the required standard for projects is met under the evaluation criteria.</p>  <p>  The first call under the REDF concluded in August last year and in December 2017, I announced an allocation of &euro;30.5 million in funding across 21 successful projects from all over the country.</p>  <p>  On Monday 16th April, at a regional stakeholder event in Farmleigh, I announced the second competitive call under the Fund for the remainder of the &euro;60 million. </p>  <p>  Under the first call, one project from the West region received funding under Stream One of the Fund which was for major regional, multi-regional or national sectoral initiatives, attracting grants of &euro;2m up to &euro;5m per project. The project, BIA Innovator Campus, is a Galway based initiative to encourage food entrepreneurship and innovation. The centre is expected to create 360 jobs within 3 years in over 40 businesses while unlocking far reaching innovation ecosystem benefits.</p>  <p>  Under the Regional Action Plan for Jobs 2015-2017 for the West region, good progress is being made on job creation towards the target of 25,000 by 2020. There are 15,500 more people in employment in the region from Q1 2015 (baseline year) to Q2 2017.    The unemployment rate in the West at Q4 2017 stands at 5.9 percent, which is slightly lower than the national average for that period. My Department and enterprise agencies will maintain a continued focus on enterprise development and job creation in the region. The Second call under the REDF is an important initiative in this respect, and in addition, this year I am commencing a process in each of the regions including the West to refresh and refocus the Regional Action Plans for Jobs for the period to 2020.</p></reply>

Ireland moved from 16th to 6th in 2017 in the Institute for Management Development&rsquo;s World Competitiveness Yearbook.  In addition, the World Bank&rsquo;s most recent &ldquo;Doing Business 2018&rdquo; report shows Ireland is now ranked 17th out of 190 countries, an improvement of one place on last year.</p>  <p>  Our improved performance is reflected in strong employment growth across sectors and regions.  We have over 2.2 million people at work and our unemployment rate is down to 6.1%.  Agency supported companies now employ over 400,000 people throughout Ireland.  The strong performance of clients supported by the enterprise agencies in winning exports and investment, market share and job creation in the face of intense global competition is impressive and reflects the competitiveness of the environment in which to do business in Ireland. </p>  <p>  However, there is no room for complacency.  We need to continue to improve our competitiveness and remain vigilant to the very significant challenges in the external environment, particularly, Brexit.  In addition, the productivity performance of many of our Irish owned enterprises is weak and there are not enough enterprises engaging in innovation. </p>  <p>  Competition for FDI remains intense. Ireland has many strengths when it comes to attracting FDI scoring highly in terms of criteria including investment incentives, labour productivity and the adaptability and ability of talent.  While we have a proven track record in attracting and sustaining FDI, continued success cannot be taken for granted. Our capacity to continue winning such new investment, despite geopolitical changes and intense competition, will be aided by the underlying strengths of our FDI offering.</p>  <p>  As Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, my objective is to create the best possible environment for enterprise, entrepreneurship, innovation and investment across all regions.  The immediate challenge for Ireland is to ensure growth is sustainable, that enterprises are resilient and we continue to grow Irish enterprises and attract foreign direct investment. We are taking steps to ensure the economy is resilient at sectoral and firm level to deal with imminent competitiveness challenges and to build further on the progress we have made.  That is why we are continually examining how we can improve on factors that are crucial to fostering further investment here, including our cost base, infrastructure, the availability of talent and innovation.</p>  <p>  Enterprise 2025 Renewed - which I launched last month - placed an increased emphasis on developing our Irish owned enterprises.  There is a strong focus on taking action that will embed resilience in our enterprise base. We are placing a spotlight on innovation and on skills. Enterprise Ireland places a strong emphasis on competitiveness. It supports exporting enterprises with initiatives in Lean, RD&amp;I, and management development.  The Agency helps enterprises to take a strategic approach to understanding and responding to potential implications arising from Brexit and assists them to enter into new markets and diversify their export base.  The Local Enterprise Offices offer a suite of supports to enhance the competitiveness of small and micro enterprises. Initiatives include mentoring, innovation vouchers, Lean Start and access to a Brexit diagnostic and guidance.</p>  <p>  My officials and I, as well as the National Competitiveness Council, remain focused on competitiveness - an agenda that requires cross Government commitment to continue to develop and implement actions to enhance national competitiveness.</p></reply>

A key objective of each of the 8 regional plans is to have a further 10 to 15 per cent at work in each region by 2020, with the unemployment rate of each region not more than one percentage point greater than the national average.</p>  <p>  The West Regional Action Plan for Jobs has been a key policy response for supporting employment growth across Galway, Mayo and Roscommon, with public and private stakeholders currently engaged in driving the range of innovative and practical actions set out in the Plan.  </p>  <p>  The West Action Plan for Jobs has been embraced within the region and the efforts by stakeholders and businesses in the region are paying off: 15,500 more people are in employment in the West from Q1 2015 to Q2 2017, representing significant progress towards the 25,000 target for 2020 as set out in the plan. At the end of 2017, the unemployment rate for the West was 5.9% - below the State average of 6.1%.</p>  <p>  Actions under the Plan that have benefitted Galway City and County include the launch of a Women&rsquo;s Entrepreneurship project driven by GMIT; NUIG&rsquo;s new Springboard postgrad in Tech Innovation; and the delivery of a Business Plan to develop a Film Fund for the region.</p>  <p>  In 2017, both Enterprise Ireland and IDA reported job increases in Galway, with increases in the West at 7% and 5% respectively. The LEO in Galway supported 254 client companies in 2017, with 1,039 in employment, and recorded a net increase of 95 new jobs in micro-enterprises during the year.</p>  <p>  To support the ambition, goals, and implementation of the Regional Action Plans for Jobs, last May my Department launched the competitive &euro;60m Regional Enterprise Development Fund delivered through Enterprise Ireland. One project in the West secured funding under Stream One of the Fund which was for major regional, multi-regional or national sectoral initiatives, attracting grants of &euro;2m up to &euro;5m per project. The project, BIA Innovator Campus, is a Galway based initiative to encourage food entrepreneurship and innovation. The centre is expected to create 360 jobs within 3 years in over 40 businesses while unlocking far reaching innovation ecosystem benefits.</p>  <p>  Building on the progress and momentum of collaboration achieved to date through the Regional Action Plans is my priority. On Monday the 16th April last I met with the Chairs of the Regional APJ committees and other regional stakeholders, and together we have started a process to refresh and refocus all the Regional Plans to ensure their relevance and impact out to 2020. At the same event, I also announced the opening of the Second Call under the Regional Enterprise Development Fund which will make a further &euro;30 million in funding available for successful regional project proposals under a competitive process. </p>  <p>  I look forward to working further with the regional stakeholders in the West to ensure we deliver the employment targets for 2020 set out under the Regional Plans.</p></reply>

Real progress has been made towards that target over the first three years of this strategy, with half of all jobs created by IDA client companies since 2015 based outside Dublin. </p>  <p>  An important factor in attracting potential overseas investors to the regions is the availability of suitable commercial property across Ireland. That is because firms need to identify - before investing in an area - a site or facility in which they can operate from. A shortage of such sites and facilities in the regions has, however, arisen on account of a number of factors. The IDA therefore launched its Regional Property Programme (RPP) in 2015 to ensure there is a better supply of commercial properties outside of Dublin that could accommodate investment. As well as upgrading existing buildings and acquiring strategic sites suitable for FDI, this programme also includes the construction of nine new advance facilities around the country. Two such facilities were constructed and completed in Athlone and Waterford in 2014 and early 2015. Further buildings were completed last year in Sligo, Tralee and Castlebar, with more planned for Galway, Dundalk, Limerick, Athlone, Carlow and Waterford. I am confident that the RPP, which has already helped generate employment in the regions, will help secure further investment in the years ahead.</p>  <p>  More generally, the IDA always does its utmost to encourage its clients to invest in regional area. This includes through bringing firms on site visits outside of our main cities and highlighting to them the particular strengths or attributes of different parts of the country. The decision on where to locate, however, always rests with the business concerned. It is sometimes the case as well that these companies will only consider - because of a range of reasons - urban areas of scale for their investment. </p>  <p>  I want to nevertheless emphasise that the IDA will continue to do its utmost to encourage clients to locate in areas that are most in need of investment. I am determined that this approach will continue so that the positive benefits of FDI are increasingly felt all across Ireland.</p></reply>

The long-term response to Brexit is for companies to become more competitive, more innovative, and to diversify their export footprint into more markets.</p><p>In 2017 Enterprise Ireland (EI) supported 1,733 jobs across 69 businesses in Sligo, and 559 jobs across 25 businesses in Leitrim.</p><p>In the period 2015 - 2017 EI paid &euro;3.6 million to client companies in Sligo and Leitrim to support them to innovate, improve competitiveness and to diversify their global footprint.  </p><p>In response to Brexit, EI has introduced a range of new supports, streamlined others, and launched a Global Ambition communications campaign.</p><p>For client companies in Sligo and Leitrim, being prepared is crucial to ensuring resilience to emerging challenges. To promote awareness, and supported by a national Prepare For Brexit campaign, EI has:</p><p>- Developed and launched the Brexit SME Scorecard, an interactive online platform which can be used by all Irish companies to self-assess their exposure to Brexit under six businesspillars. To date over 2,000 companies have utilised this Scorecard. </p><p>- Designed and launched a &euro;5k Be Prepared Grant that helps to support the costs of SME clients to prepare a plan to mitigate risks and optimise opportunities arising from Brexit. </p><p>- Held a number of Brexit Advisory Clinics to encourage companies to examine their potential exposure to Brexit. </p><p>In 2018 EI is: </p><p>- Continuing to run regional Brexit Advisory Clinics to support companies to take immediate action to address their potential exposure. </p><p>- Providing an independent consultant to companies through the Act On Programme Initiative. This consultant will assist companies to identify specific actions they can take over a short periodto address some of the risks and opportunities caused by Brexit.</p><p>I launched the second round of the &euro;60 million Regional Enterprise Development Fund. The Fund will support collaborative projects that will boost the regions by supporting enterprise and creating jobs.</p><p>In addition, the North East/North West Action Plan for Jobs was launched in November 2015, and covers Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim, Cavan, Monaghan and Louth. Implementation of the Plan is overseen by a Regional Implementation Committee made up of representatives from the public and private sector. There are 12,000 more people in employment in the Border region from Q1 2015, the baseline year, to Q2 2017. This represents good progress towards the target of 28,000 more jobs by 2020. </p><p>Brexit supports from LEOs in every county include the LEO Brexit Mentor Programme which is supporting Owner/Managers identify key Brexit exposures and develop robust strategies to address issues and maximise potential opportunities. The LEOs are also providing Technical Assistance for Micro-Exporters (TAME), which is financial assistance to support market diversification in qualifying businesses to develop new and export market opportunities. The LEOS are also helping businesses adopt LEAN business practices to increase competitiveness and providing support for innovative developments in micro-enterprises by getting them investor ready. </p><p>InterTrade Ireland (ITI) is offering Brexit &lsquo;Start to Plan&rsquo; Vouchers and has established a Brexit Advisory Service to help businesses with practical advice, support and information on Brexit related issues.

This includes research and the development of supports to help ensure that businesses are prepared for potential difficulties arising as a result of the UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU. </p>  <p>  Research conducted on behalf of the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation in October of 2017 by B&amp;A  found that 16% of SMEs surveyed had formal contingency plans in place for Brexit. However, an additional 20% indicate that they have done some informal Brexit planning. The B&amp;A survey found that formal planning for Brexit was lowest among small businesses, while medium-sized businesses were better prepared. Among food businesses, one of the sectors most exposed to Brexit-related uncertainty, the proportion of businesses who indicate that they have a formal Brexit plan is closer to 26%.</p>  <p>  The Brexit Loan Scheme, launched on 28 March, encourages eligible businesses affected or potentially affected by Brexit to engage in formal planning. To this end, one of the requirements for applications for loans under the scheme is that businesses provide a business development plan, demonstrating that they plan to innovate, change or adapt in response to Brexit. </p>  <p>  The agencies of my Department are also fully engaged in preparing for Brexit. Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s (EI) #PrepareforBrexit communications campaign, featuring the &lsquo;Brexit SME Scorecard&rsquo;, was launched last March.  The Scorecard is an interactive online platform which can be used by all Irish companies to self-assess their exposure to Brexit.  </p>  <p>  As part of awareness-raising activities, EI is rolling out regional Brexit Advisory clinics throughout the year.

In Co. Wexford, 4,670 people were employed in the 122 Enterprise Ireland supported companies, 2,948 people were employed in the 18 IDA Ireland clients and the Local Enterprise Office supported 213 clients with 1,348 total jobs, a gross increase of 238 jobs on 2016.   </p>  <p>  The South East Action Plan for Jobs which launched in September 2015, aims to increase employment in the region by 10-15% over the period to 2020, resulting in the delivery of 25,000 jobs. The most recent comparable data shows that there are now over 16,000 more people in employment in the region from Q1 2015 to Q2 2017. </p>  <p>  On Monday, I launched the second call of the Regional Enterprise Development Fund. The first call under the Fund was announced in May 2017, with the results released in December. Twenty-one applicants representing all regions of the country secured a total of up to &euro;30.5m in financial support for a range of enterprise and capability development projects. The second call will fund projects with the balance of the &euro;60m remaining under the fund. </p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland is committed to developing regional employment growth &ndash; a fact reflected in the fact that 64% of jobs created by the agency in 2017 were outside Dublin. Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s focus for 2018 is to help clients, including those located in Wexford, to build on the strength of their 2017 performance by supporting them to innovate, be competitive and to diversify their global footprint -  key attributes required to be resilient to economic shocks, such as those emerging from any kind of Brexit. </p>  <p>  In the period 2015 - 2017 Enterprise Ireland paid &euro;5.3 million to client companies in Wexford to support companies to be innovative, improve competitiveness and to diversify their global footprint.  </p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Office (LEO) located in Wexford town is the &lsquo;first-stop-shop&rsquo; for providing advice and guidance, financial assistance and other supports for anyone that intends to start or grow a business in the county. LEO Wexford provides a &lsquo;signposting&rsquo; service in relation to all relevant state supports available through agencies such as Revenue, the Department of Social Protection, Education and Training Boards, Credit Review Office and Microfinance Ireland. </p>  <p>  IDA Ireland&rsquo;s strategy, Winning Foreign Direct Investment 2015-2019, sets out challenging targets in respect of the FDI sector for the period. Under the programme, IDA is targeting a minimum increase in investment of 30% to 40% in each region outside Dublin.</p></reply>

A key objective of each of the 8 regional plans is to have a further 10 to 15 per cent at work in each region by 2020, with the unemployment rate of each region not more than one percentage point greater than the national average.</p>  <p>  The eastern part of the Midlands is included under the Midlands Region Action Plan for Jobs. The Midlands Action Plan has been a key policy response for supporting employment growth in the Midlands, with public and private stakeholders currently engaged in driving the range of innovative and practical actions set out in the Plan.  </p>  <p>  The Plan has been embraced within the region and the efforts by stakeholders and businesses in the region are paying off: 9,500 more people are in employment in the Midlands from Q1 2015 (baseline year) to Q2 2017, representing significant progress towards the 14,000 target for 2020 as set out in the plan. However, at Q4 2017, the unemployment rate in the Midlands was 7.7%; which is still too high when compared with the State rate of 6.1%. We will maintain a focus on the Midlands to ensure that the employment environment continues to improve.</p>  <p>  The Midlands Action Plan for Jobs has been embraced within the region and the efforts by stakeholders and businesses in the region are paying off: 9,500 more people are in employment in the Midlands from Q1 2015 (baseline year) to Q2 2017, representing significant progress towards the 14,000 target for 2020 as set out in the plan.

Through partnership between Enterprise Ireland and the Local Authorities, the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) have 819 client companies in the Midlands employing 4,214 people; and last year those companies added 387 new employees in total. </p>  <p>  To support the ambition, goals, and implementation of the Regional Action Plans for Jobs, last May my Department launched the &euro;60m Regional Enterprise Development Fund. This competitive Fund is being rolled out by Enterprise Ireland over the next 4 years to support collaborative and innovative projects that can sustain and add to employment at a national, regional and county level. In December last year I announced an allocation of &euro;30.5 million under the first call under the Fund, with 21 projects from all over the country approved for funding. </p>  <p>  One project in the Midlands, Irish Manufacturing Research (IMR) CLG, was approved funding under Stream One of the first funding call, which supports major regional, multi-regional or national sectoral initiatives with grants of &euro;2 million up to &euro;5 million per project. The award  of funding to the IMR in Mullingar will develop a significant and important applied research and development capability in the areas of Collaborative Robotics and Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality, in partnership with manufacturing industries in the Midlands and elsewhere.</p>  <p>  I launched the second call under the REDF on Monday 16th April, which will allocate the remainder of the &euro;60 million, and I hope to see more successful projects coming through from the Midlands region.</p>  <p>  Building on the progress and momentum of collaboration achieved to date through the Regional Action Plans is my priority. On Monday last I also met with the Chairs of the Regional APJ committees and other regional stakeholders, and together we have started a process to refresh and refocus all Regional Plans to ensure their relevance and impact out to 2020. I look forward to working further with the regional stakeholders in the Midlands to ensure we deliver to the employment targets for 2020 set out under the Regional Plans.</p></reply>

A key objective of each of the 8 regional plans is to have a further 10 to 15 per cent at work in each region by 2020, with the unemployment rate of each region not more than one percentage point greater than the national average.</p>  <p>  The Plans are being monitored and driven in each region by Implementation Committees, comprising representatives from the business community, as well as the Local Authorities, Enterprise Agencies, and other public bodies in the region. Eight of the nine Implementation Committees, including the Mid-West, are industry led. </p>  <p>  Progress across the eight regions has been very positive since the launch of the initiative, with an increase in employment of 8.5% or 118,600 jobs in the regions outside of Dublin and 166,800 additional jobs nationwide, from Q1 2015 to Q2 2017. </p>  <p>  Good progress has been made in the Mid-West, and from Q1 2015 (baseline year) to Q2 2017, 16,600 more people are in employment in the region, as against the 2020 target of 23,000. Over the year to Q2 2017, 7,000 more people in employment in the Mid-West region. As of Q4 2017, the Mid West has a Q4 2017 unemployment rate of 6.6% which is 0.5 percentage points above the average for the State.</p>  <p>  As outlined in the Mid-West Regional Action Plan, the region has a strong product in the MICE (meetings, incentive, conference and exhibition), or business tourism sector, providing opportunities to capitalise on global growth in this sector. Limerick has a growing reputation as an option for international associations to meet, while the Mid West region as a whole has a strong corporate base which will help to attract more corporate meetings, in addition to experiences and products that lend themselves to securing a much larger part of the incentive business. The Shannon Region Conference &amp;amp; Sports Bureau is a very successful public / private partnership focused on the MICE sector and will aim to attract such events to the counties across the Mid West Region, using the strength and reputation of the aviation and aerospace, pharma, and MedTech sectors and academics at University of Limerick. </p>  <p>  The development of a mid-west conference and exhibition centre for the Mid-West is identified as a &lsquo;potential strategic area for job creation&rsquo; in the Regional Action Plan. While my Department has not had any discussions in relation to this, given the potential in the sector it is an area the Regional Action Plan Committee may wish to revisit in the context of their forthcoming review of their Regional Plan.  </p>  <p>  To support the ambition, goals, and implementation of the Regional Action Plans for Jobs, last May my Department launched the &euro;60m Regional Enterprise Development Fund. This competitive Fund is being rolled out by Enterprise Ireland over the next 4 years to support collaborative and innovative projects that can sustain and add to employment at a national, regional and county level. In December last year I announced an allocation of &euro;30.5 million under the first call under the Fund, with 21 projects from all over the country approved for funding. Two projects in the Mid-West region secured funding under the first call: the development of a state-of-the-art National Bio-economy Innovation &amp;amp; Piloting Facility at the former Lisheen Mine site in Tipperary; and Emerald Aero Cluster, comprising 14 indigenous manufacturing companies, brought together with the specific purpose of increasing Aerospace manufacturing export revenues for members and aerospace business.</p>  <p>  I launched the second call under the REDF on Monday 16th April, which will allocate the remainder of the &euro;60 million and I hope to see more successful projects coming through from the Mid-West. </p>  <p>  Building on the progress and momentum of collaboration achieved to date through the Regional Action Plans is my priority. On Monday last I also met with the Chairs of the Regional APJ committees and other regional stakeholders, and together we have started a process to refresh and refocus all Regional Plans to ensure their relevance and impact out to 2020. I look forward to working further with the regional stakeholders in the Mid-West to ensure we deliver the employment targets for 2020 set out under the Regional Plans.</p></reply>

The long-term response to Brexit is for companies to become more competitive, more innovative and to diversify their export footprint into more markets. </p>  <p>  I am confident that the agencies under my Department have the supports available to enable companies to consolidate market share within the UK, and also to become more resilient by broadening their sales to other international markets. Enterprise Ireland (EI) and the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) are actively supporting their clients to achieve this. My Department provided for additional monies in 2017 to enable EI and the LEOs to ramp up supports in light of Brexit to drive improvements in: </p>  <p>  - productivity, </p>  <p>  - innovation, </p>  <p>  - management capability and leadership skills.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland has launched several initiatives in response to Brexit, including:</p>  <p>  - Brexit Scorecard: This interactive online platform can be used by all Irish companies to self-assess their exposure to Brexit under six business pillars. Based on answers supplied by the user, the Scorecard generates an immediate report which contains suggested actions and resources, and information on events for companies to attend, to prepare for Brexit.</p>  <p>  - Be Prepared Grant: This grant offers SMEs a grant of up to &euro;5,000 to assist them in preparing an action plan for economic shocks such as Brexit. The grant can be used to help cover consultancy, travel and travel expenses associated with researching the direction of their action plan.</p>  <p>  - Brexit Advisory Clinics: Enterprise Ireland held four Brexit Advisory Clinics over the past few months in Portlaoise, Mayo, Cavan and Cork. The purpose of these Clinics is to support companies affected by Brexit to take immediate action to address their exposure. More dates will be announced soon.</p>  <p>  - Brexit 'Act On' Programme : A consultant spends time with EI client companies to discuss specific challenges and draw up a report with tailored recommendations that will help them address weaknesses and become more resilient. </p>  <p>  In addition, EI is implementing extensive trade mission and event schedules focussed on global and sectoral opportunities, further developing in-market expertise and networks, placing greater focus on identifying new sectoral opportunities and stimulating demand for Irish products and services through international marketing campaigns. In 2017, EI launched a new Eurozone Strategy to increase exports to Eurozone countries by 50% by 2020. </p>  <p>  The LEOs are supporting their clients by providing information, training and mentoring on Brexit related issues as well as advice on other sources of support. The suite of LEO Brexit supports available to micro and small businesses through the 31 LEOs nationwide include.</p>  <p>  InterTrade Ireland (ITI), has also been very active in assisting businesses address the challenges that Brexit may present for future cross-border commerce.  A series of information and awareness raising events have been underway in towns across both North and South over recent months. ITI is also rolling out a &lsquo;Start to Plan&rsquo; readiness voucher scheme, which enables companies to purchase specialist advice in areas such as customs, tax, tariff and non-tariff barriers, legal and labour mobility issues. </p>  <p>  Other initiatives that my Department are advancing include the &euro;300 million Brexit Loan Scheme, under which accessible finance is made available to businesses at favourable terms. In addition, this past Monday saw the launch of the second call of the Regional Enterprise Development Fund, which is aimed at supporting the development and implementation of collaborative and innovative projects that can sustain and add to employment at a national, regional and county level.  Twenty-one successful applicants representing all regions of the country have secured up to &euro;30.5m for their projects in the first competitive call.</p>  <p>  The work of my Department is focused on supporting businesses throughout the country to withstand current challenges and succeed into the future, therefore I feel that all our efforts will put Ireland in a strong position in case of a hard Brexit scenario.</p></reply>

Both towns are attractive destinations for foreign direct investment (FDI) given their track record in attracting multinational companies, the quality of their local infrastructure and their proximity to Dublin and the capital's transport hubs. I am therefore confident that we will be able to sustain and grow investment levels in the area. </p>  <p>  There is already a strong base of investment in Louth with 24 IDA client companies employing a total of 3,702 people. The Agency's client base has added 295 FDI further jobs there over the last year alone. The IDA itself is working hard to increase the number of multinational companies with operations in the County.</p>  <p>  The IDA's Regional Property Programme (RPP) remains an important tool through which investors can be encouraged to locate in areas outside of Dublin, including Louth. This programme includes the construction of nine new advance facilities around the country, one of which will be located in Dundalk. The Agency is currently selecting a contractor to commence this project, with completion of the building expected in 2019.   </p>  <p>  Another element of the RPP involves upgrades to existing business parks and I understand that the IDA has secured advance planning permission for a facility at Dundalk Science and Technology Park. This should help to attract further investment to the area.</p></reply>

(ASIL), the majority shareholders in Ardmore Studios Ltd, were seeking to exit, having been running the company for over 30 years. </p>  <p>   An extensive process was undertaken by IBI Corporate Finance to find a suitable buyer, with over 100 potential parties contacted.</p>  <p>  Ion Equity emerged as the successful bidder from that process and its acquisition vehicle, Olcott Entertainment Limited, which was recently incorporated by Ion Equity for this purpose, is now the new owner of Ardmore Studios.</p>  <p>  In relation to the sale price and other specific financial details, I am unable to reveal what are confidential details of Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s minority shareholding disposal transaction in what is a privately held company. This applies to the Ardmore transaction as it would to any other individual investment or share disposal of Enterprise Ireland where it is a minority shareholder in a privately held company. </p>  <p>  This principle of confidentiality reflects a statutory duty of confidentiality set out in section 16 of the Industrial Development (Enterprise Ireland) Act, 1998.  In this case, the parties also understood, at the time of the sale by Enterprise Ireland and other majority shareholder vendors, that, due to section 16 of the 1998 Act, the consideration and other financial aspects of the sale would not be revealed.  Disclosing such information, would be in breach of the high standards of confidentiality adhered to by Enterprise Ireland.</p>  <p>  What I can however confirm is that Enterprise Ireland negotiated the sale of its shareholding with the benefit of comprehensive due diligence undertaken by independent consultants and is satisfied that it realised full market value, and on a par with the other majority shareholders parties.  </p>  <p>  The Government had committed that the company would be sold as a going concern and that is what has happened while realising full commercial value for the shareholders selling the company, including Enterprise Ireland.</p></reply>

However, at Q4 2017, the unemployment rate in the Midlands was 7.7%; which is still too high when compared with the State rate of 6.1%.

Whilst this competition is increasingly intense, our country has a number of key strengths that continue to make us a highly attractive destination for FDI. These include our highly skilled workers, first-class education system and positive demographics. Our membership of the EU and Eurozone, pro-enterprise policy environment, and competitive corporation tax regime are other significant selling points. </p>  <p>  Taken together, these strengths help the IDA make a compelling case to prospective investors about the merits of investing in Ireland. They also help to explain our strong national performance in terms of FDI-driven investment and job creation. In 2017, for example, the IDA's client companies created over 19,500 new jobs across a range of sectors, bringing total employment at FDI firms to 210,000.</p>  <p>  Ireland clearly therefore does remain an attractive location for FDI. The Government is nevertheless conscious of our need to remain as competitive as possible. That is why it will continue to explore how to both reinforce existing strengths and find new ways of attracting job-rich investment to the country.</p></reply>

The annual changes which are calculated using these stock figures depend both on the number of jobs lost and jobs created over the period in question.</p><p>The data prior to Q3 2017 includes adjustments to the historic QNHS data series to take account of revisions to population estimates arising from the 2016 Census of Population. In addition, adjustments have been made to this historic data to enable comparability with the new LFS for key headline indicators &ndash; ILO employment status, NACE Rev2 Industrial classification, age and gender.</p><p>However as a result of changes to the questionnaire, the interview mode, the introduction of a new sample, data processing changes and other methodological enhancements there are changes in the levels of some series outside of these key indicators from Q3 2017 onwards. As a consequence, the series before and after the introduction of the new survey may not be directly comparable and this should be noted when examining annual and quarterly changes.</p><p>The table below shows the number of persons aged 15 years and over in employment in Q4 2015 - 2017 and the annual change in the years to Q4 2016 and Q4 2017.</p><p><b>Persons aged 15 years and over in employment (ILO) Q4 2015 - 2017 and annual changes to Q4 2016 and Q4 2017</b></p><p><b>'000</b><table><tr><th></th><th><div>Q4 15</div></th><th><div>Q4 16</div></th><th><div>Q4 17</div></th></tr><tr><td>In employment</td><td><div>2,085.0</div></td><td><div>2,164.2</div></td><td><div>2,231.0</div></td></tr><tr><td>Annual change to Q4 2016 and Q4 2017</td><td><div>n/a</div></td><td><div>79.2</div></td><td><div>66.8</div></td></tr></table></p><p>Source: Labour Force Survey (LFS), Central Statistics Office, Ireland.</p><p>n/a - Not applicable.</p><p>Data may be subject to future revision.</p><p>Data may be subject to sampling or other survey errors, which are greater in respect of smaller values or estimates of change.</p><p>Reference period: q4=Oct-Dec.</p><p>Note: A new Labour Force Survey (LFS) replaced the Quarterly National Household Survey (QNHS) in Q3 2017 and, as a result, care should be taken when comparing data from before and after this period.

CAR is the world&rsquo;s third most fragile state, with very significant humanitarian needs.  The United Nations estimates that 2.5 million people - more than half the population - require humanitarian assistance, 1.1 million people are moderately or severely food insecure.  More than 690,000 people are internally displaced, and over 546,000 people are seeking refuge in neighbouring countries.  In line with our long standing support to neglected and forgotten crises, Ireland has consistently contributed to the humanitarian response in CAR and has provided over &euro;25 million in humanitarian assistance since 2012, including over &euro;5.2m in 2017.  <i></i></p><p>Ireland also provides support to underfunded and forgotten crises through the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF), a large UN fund that is used for immediate humanitarian response at the onset of emergencies, in rapidly deteriorating situations, and in protracted crises that fail to attract sufficient resources. Ireland is the eighth largest donor to the CERF. </p><p>Ireland allocates an additional &euro;1 million per year to Concern for their work in CAR.  Concern is one of the few organisations still present in these communities offering multi-sectoral support to internally displaced people, returnees and vulnerable people. </p><p>Ireland supports the UN Multidimensional Integrated Stabilisation Mission in the Central African Republic (MINUSCA) which has been operational since 2014.  Ireland also supports the EU Military Training Mission (EUTM) CAR to implement security sector reform with the Central African Armed Forces (FACA).  The goal is to support the build-up of a modernised, effective, ethnically balanced and civilian controlled FACA.</p><p>In March this year, Ireland&rsquo;s representative to the Political and Security Committee of the European Union (EU PSC), Ambassador Noel White, travelled with other EU PSC Ambassadors for a joint field visit to CAR with the Ambassadors&rsquo; Peace and Security Council of the African Union (PSC AU). The EU and AU Ambassadors conveyed common messages on continued engagement and support to the efforts for reconciliation, state building, justice and peace and solidarity with the people of CAR. The mission reconfirmed the need for close EU-AU-UN cooperation in the country. </p><p>The EU and AU Ambassadors met with the President and the cabinet of ministers of CAR: they also met with the National Assembly, with the Special Representative of the United Nations Secretary General in CAR, as well as with the Force Commander of the UN mission - MINUSCA.  In addition, they also met with the panel of facilitators of the African Union&rsquo;s initiative for peace and reconciliation in CAR and had an informal meeting with representatives of civil society.  </p><p>Ireland will continue to monitor the situation and will ensure, with our EU and multilateral partners, to maintain the focus on preventing violence and addressing the humanitarian crisis.</p></reply>

For 2018, we have allocated just over &euro;707 million for Official Development Assistance (ODA), representing a significant investment on behalf of the Irish tax payer and a clear demonstration of our continued strong commitment to Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme. 2018 is also the third consecutive year we have increased allocations to the aid budget. Based on estimates in Budget 2018, it is anticipated this level of allocation will see ODA amount to approximately 0.3% of GNI in 2018.</p><p>The current Programme for Government sets out our ambition to meet the UN target of providing 0.7% of Gross National Income (GNI) to ODA, as resources permit.  Our goal is to reach the target by 2030, within the timeframe for delivering the UN Sustainable Development Goals.  Progress towards the 0.7% target will need to be made through sustained, managed increments, building on Ireland's recognised role as a reliable and effective partner in combatting global poverty and hunger, and providing humanitarian assistance to those most in need.  In order to prepare for the managed progression towards the UN target, a new White Paper on Irish overseas development assistance will be produced and published later this year.  Reaching the 0.7% target will involve significant increases to the ODA budget over the next decade and more.  These increases will focus on delivering real and sustainable results, be managed prudentially and effectively, and will require careful planning and consultation across a wide spectrum of stakeholders, including Government Departments, Irish Development NGOs and the public.  The White Paper process will give direction in this regard, as will the recent report by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Defence on Irish Aid.</p><p>The table sets out an indicative stepped scenario for meeting the UN target of spending 0.7% of GNI on ODA by 2030, with interim targets of 0.4% in 2022, 0.5% in 2026 and 0.6% in 2028 and delivering on the UN Target by 2030.  <table><tr><th>Year </th><th>Total ODA - In &euro; millions</th><th>ODA as a % of Projected GNI</th></tr><tr><td>2018</td><td>707.10</td><td>0.30%</td></tr><tr><td>2022</td><td>1,109.29</td><td>0.40%</td></tr><tr><td>2026</td><td>1,560.65</td><td>0.50%</td></tr><tr><td>2028</td><td>1,986.83</td><td>0.60%</td></tr><tr><td>2030</td><td>2,459.13</td><td>0.70%</td></tr></table></p></reply>

We had a warm and constructive meeting. Germany is a hugely influential EU member state. It is Ireland&rsquo;s fourth largest goods trading partner and our third most important tourism market. Having excellent working relations with Germany is a priority for us. Germany has been a consistent supporter of Ireland in the Brexit negotiations, something we greatly appreciate.Minister Maas and I discussed Brexit at some length and we had a very useful exchange on a number of international issues, including the Middle East Peace Process and EU relations with Africa, priority areas for both our countries.  </p><p>To coincide with the visit I published a Comprehensive Review of our bilateral relations with Germany. I commissioned the review last year.  The review process included our Embassy in Berlin, a number of Government Departments and State agencies, as well as the German authorities themselves, and the report, , makes 23 recommendations, including a proposal to open a new Consulate next year in Frankfurt. </p><p>The overarching message of the review is that notwithstanding the strength of our bilateral relationship, there is still scope to develop it further.I have, therefore, asked officials to start work immediately on the implementation of the recommendations.</p><p>Minister Maas and I agreed that formal consultations at State Secretary and Secretary General level should be held on a regular basis. While highly desirable in themselves, I see this formalised engagement as part of a wider, ongoing process of strengthening existing alliances in the European Union and building new ones.</p></reply>

We are fully committed to developing and enhancing this relationship over the coming years.  Additionally, we will work to secure the closest possible positive relationship between the UK and the European Union.  There are already a number of channels for ongoing dialogue and cooperation between the Irish and British Governments, which will continue after the UK leaves the European Union.  In this regard, the Good Friday Agreement provides for important institutional cooperation on an east-west basis through the British-Irish Inter-Governmental Conference (BIIGC) and the British Irish Council (BIC).  In addition, the British Irish Parliamentary Assembly (BIPA) brings together elected representatives from the Oireachtas, Westminster, the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the Scottish and Welsh devolved assemblies.  Additionally, in 2012, a process was established involving summits between the Taoiseach and the UK Prime Minister, supported by a Joint Work Programme managed at official level by the heads of all government departments in both London and Dublin.  </p>  <p>  These structures have shown their value and will continue to evolve in response to the changing circumstances.

This reversed the system under previous legislation whereby new bodies would have to be brought into the scope of the legislation by order. The 2014 Act extended the remit of the legislation, bringing the overall total to some 600 bodies comprehended by the Act.   </p>  <p>  Government policy has been that commercial state bodies should not, in general, be subject to Freedom of Information requirements, in view of their commercial role, mandate and responsibilities.  There is a serious concern that an uneven competitive playing field would be created in circumstances that commercial state bodies operating in a competitive market were subject to Freedom of Information but their privately-owned market competitors were not.  This could lead to a situation where FOI requests could be used to access information to disadvantage and erode the competitive position of the commercial State Body in the marketplace.  Such a move would be expected to have an adverse impact on the commercial position of the State Body in question, which would not be in the public interest or consistent with the need to safeguard the State&rsquo;s economic and financial interests.  </p>  <p>  However, during the progression of the FOI Bill 2014 through the Oireachtas the Government decided that certain State Companies which operate in a monopoly market should be no longer exempt from Freedom of information. The relevant State Companies which were subsequently comprehended by the Freedom of Information Act 2014 were: </p>  <p>  - Irish Rail,</p>  <p>  - ESB Networks,</p>  <p>  - Gas Networks Ireland,</p>  <p>  - EirGrid.</p></reply>

The Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2016 seeks to introduce a new requirement for a school to set out the characteristic spirit and general objectives of the school in their admission policy. </p>  <p>  A patronage process is run after it has been decided, based on demographic exercises, that a new school is required.  This patronage process is open to all patron bodies and prospective patrons. The preferences of parents  of children who reside in the school planning areas concerned for each patron, together with the extent of diversity currently available in these areas, are key to decisions in relation to the outcome of this process.  </p>  <p>  The Forum on Patronage and Pluralism in the Primary School Sector recognised that there are factors affecting  diversity in all primary schools. A follow-up paper to the Forum Report entitled Forum on Patronage and Pluralism in the Primary Sector: Progress to Date and Future Directions was published in  2014.  The paper outlines good practice and options for promoting diversity in all schools regardless of whether or not the school has a highly diverse student population.  This was informed by a public consultation held in 2013 that asked parents, in particular, to submit their views on how primary schools can make all children feel included and involved. This included issues such as how best to accommodate students of various belief systems and traditions and how schools have developed and implemented policies on marking religious celebrations and the display of religious symbols in the school.</p>  <p>  The paper is not prescriptive on how schools should address issues of diversity and inclusivity, but instead it encourages school authorities to engage in consultation with stakeholders and to review their policies and practices on an ongoing basis to ensure that they remain suitable for the school population that they serve.  It recognises that each school should arrive at solutions that suit its own particular context.  It also notes that this is an evolving situation and that practices may evolve over time as circumstances change.  The paper expressly welcomes feedback and views on this matter.</p>  <p>   The paper also outlines the results of the public consultation and encourages school authorities to take time to consider their policies and practices and to review whether they are taking the steps necessary to welcome all pupils and make them feel included.  </p></reply>

Some 11 applications have been received to date and I understand that a number of other applications are currently being readied for submission.</p>  <p>  4 applications under the scheme have been approved to date, with approved funding totalling almost &euro;120,000. A further 4 applications are under active consideration. The remaining 3 applications received to date have been returned to the applicants concerned, to enable them to provide the information necessary to qualify for grant-aid.</p>  <p>  Under the scheme, eligible community groups can apply for grant-aid of up to 60% of the total capital cost of a proposed CCTV system, up to a maximum grant of &euro;40,000. Successful applicants receive an up-front payment of 50% of approved funding upon approval of the grant, with the balance to be paid when the CCTV system is fully operational.</p>  <p>  It is worth pointing out that the scheme is modelled closely on the previous grant-aid scheme operated by Pobal on behalf of my Department between 2005 and 2013, under which some 45 Community-based CCTV systems were established operating in a mix of urban and rural environments.</p>  <p>  To make take-up of the scheme as easy as possible, both the application process and documentation were updated and streamlined to make them more user-friendly. Support and guidance is also available to interested groups from my Department. </p>  <p>  Further, and again in the interests of avoiding any obstacles, in developing the documentation, my Department consulted extensively with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner along with the Office of the Attorney General, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Pobal and the Local Government Management Association. </p>  <p>  Full details of the grant aid package including guidelines, application forms, code of practice and other relevant documentation are all available to download from my Department's website - www.justice.ie.</p>  <p>  I am very conscious of the value that communities, especially rural communities, place on CCTV as a means of deterring crime and assisting in the detection of offenders and I would encourage interested groups to avail of the scheme.  </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-04-18a.230.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1277" speakername="David Stanton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018041800071#WRE00400"><p>As the Deputy is aware, my Department is obliged to carry out a call for proposals process during 2018 in relation to the provision of Garda Youth Diversion Project (GYDP) services, to fully comply with requirements related to the co-funding of projects by the European Social Fund Programme for Employability, Inclusion and Learning 2014-2020.</p>  <p>  To ensure State-wide coverage of GYDP services for young people, (which does not exist at present), the intention is that, in general, service provision will be aligned with Garda Divisions or other appropriate local areas with a distinct community identity as may be agreed during a wide ranging consultation process which is currently ongoing. Issues of community identify and numbers of potential participants on GYDPs in the area will be key considerations here.</p>  <p>  The provision of GYDP services in all parts of the State has obvious advantages, particularly in terms of providing services for significant numbers of young people who cannot currently access them. In this regard, an independent evaluation report of the operation of an integrated approach to delivery of GYDP services within County Kerry, commissioned by my Department is expected to be finalised shortly. This report will help with the further development GYDP services in the context of the Call for Proposals.</p>  <p>  GYDPs deliver valuable services for young people who have committed a crime or may be at risk of offending as well as providing important support for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at local level. I can assure the Deputy that in the context of the Call for Proposals my Department is committed to ensuring continuity of service for participants on GYDPs and maintain a community driven approach to their operation, as well as minimising any disruption for workers and service providers. In this regard, and in line with the overall objective of providing GYDP services to all children and young persons who require them, I am advised that the Call for Proposals will require applicants to provide for continuity of GYDP services for young people currently participating in the service. Furthermore, the Call for Proposals process will facilitate existing service providers forming consortiums, which could apply to provide services under the new comprehensive approach that is being developed. </p>  <p>  GYDPs provide an effective and essential support to the operation of the statutory Garda Diversion Programme by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The principal focus of GYDPs is on young people who receive a Garda caution under the Diversion Programme for involvement in criminal or anti-social behaviour and are referred to a local GYDP (primary referrals). GYDPs also accommodate a certain proportion of young people who are considered to be at risk of involvement in offending or anti-social behaviour (secondary referrals).</p>  <p>  In relation to secondary referrals, it has to be considered if, in principle, it is appropriate to refer a child to a Garda project where no criminal act has been identified. For some, a better option might be referral to available mainstream youth services that could appropriately support them. That being said, it is accepted that referrals to GYDPs must take account of local needs and issues in relation to access and availability of mainstream youth services. Following the Call for Proposals process, GYDP services will still accommodate secondary referrals and the proportion of these may vary from area to area depending on identified local needs.</p>  <p>  My Department is very much aware of the range of concerns expressed in relation to the Call for Proposals process. I can assure the Deputy that careful consideration is being given to all issues raised by stakeholders involved in GYDPs, including those of independent service providers, as part of the extensive consultation process which is currently ongoing. This process includes arrangements for an extensive series of meetings with community based organisations and project workers which will facilitate closer communication and exchange of information in relation to these matters. In addition, the consultations will include arrangements to hear the views of young people, including participants or former participants on GYDPs.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that the new approach to GYDP provision which is being developed in preparation for the Call for Proposals will not reduce the level of service that already exists, or the importance of community involvement in its delivery. On the contrary, the intention is to build on, update and improve a very valuable service so that it is available to every child or young person in the country who requires it. This improvement to the service will have benefits for significant numbers of young people in the State who cannot currently access GYDP services. While certain aspects of the new service delivery approach have been determined, work is ongoing to complete the full details to be included in the Call for Proposals, which is expected to issue in the second quarter of this year.  I am convinced that community ownership and participation of the projects is an essential dimension that must be preserved and strengthened in the working out of this process.</p></reply>

The grant can be used to help cover consultancy, travel and travel expenses associated with researching the direction of their action plan.</p><p>- Brexit Advisory Clinics: Enterprise Ireland held four Brexit Advisory Clinics over the past few months in Portlaoise, Mayo, Cavan and Cork. The purpose of these Clinics is to support companies affected by Brexit to take immediate action to address their exposure. More dates will be announced soon.  </p><p>- Brexit Act On Programme: A consultant spends time with EI client companies to discuss specific challenges and draw up a report with tailored recommendations that will help them address weaknesses and become more resilient. </p><p>In addition, EI is implementing extensive trade mission and event schedules focused on global and sectoral opportunities, further developing in-market expertise and networks, placing greater focus on identifying new sectoral opportunities and stimulating demand for Irish products and services through international marketing campaigns.

IDA Ireland client companies in the Mid-West created 1,481 new jobs last year, an increase of 5% over the previous year, with total employment in overseas companies in the region now at 17,787 people across 128 client companies. </p>  <p>  Looking ahead, the IDA will continue to work with both existing and prospective clients to identify new opportunities for investment in the Mid-West. In doing so, the Agency will continue to highlight the region's strengths to overseas firms. These include the area's accessibility and the strong collaboration between industry there and Limerick's third level institutions, which has seen clusters of expertise develop in a number of sectors.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Agency is itself investing in property solutions to help drive the growth of foreign direct investment in the region. The IDA&rsquo;s &euro;150m regional property programme, launched in 2015, includes the construction of nine new advance facilities around the country, one of which will be located in Limerick. The completion of that facility in Limerick, which will help to attract further investment there, is expected next year.</p></reply>

In delivering on this, new supports have been introduced, others streamlined, and a <i>Global Ambition</i>campaign launched.</p><p>Enterprise Ireland recognises the importance of strengthening enterprise capability across all regions of the country.  On Monday, I launched the Second Call of the Regional Enterprise Development Fund.  The first call under the Fund was announced in May 2017, with the results released in December. Twenty-one applicants representing all regions of the country secured a total of up to &euro;30.5m in financial support for a range of enterprise and capability development projects.  The second call will fund projects with the balance of the &euro;60m remaining under the fund.  </p><p>2017 was also a good year for regional job growth in Ireland, with 64% of new jobs created being located outside Dublin.  It is important, however, not to become complacent and it is with this in mind that Enterprise Ireland will continue to implement its wider strategy contained in its <i>Build Scale, Expand Reach 2017-2020</i>report, which includes aims such as:</p><p>- Assisting clients to create 60,000 new jobs by 2020 while sustaining the existing record level of jobs; </p><p>- Growing the annual exports of client companies by &euro;5bn to &euro;26bn per annum;  </p><p>- Increasing the level of spend made by client companies in the Irish economy by &euro;4bn to &euro;27bn per annum by 2020; and  </p><p>- Inspiring more Irish owned companies to have global ambition.</p><p>The three Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) located in Cork (Cork City, Cork South and Cork North and West) are the &lsquo;first-stop-shop&rsquo; for advice and guidance, financial assistance and other supports for anyone that intends to start or grow a business in the country.  The LEOs operating in Cork have a total of 620 clients, employing 3,324 people.</p><p>IDA Ireland&rsquo;s strategy, Winning Foreign Direct Investment 2015-2019, sets out challenging targets in respect of the FDI sector for the period.  Under the programme, IDA is targeting a minimum increase in investment of 30% to 40% in each region outside Dublin.  </p></reply>

My Department is central to the Government wide effort to prepare Irish enterprises and our wider business ecosystem for Brexit. Steps already taken include Budget 2018 (and 2017), our Trade and Investment Strategy published in March 2017 and through the Action Plan for Jobs 2017 and 2018. </p><p>&ldquo;Building Stronger Business&rdquo; sets out work underway, and planned, by Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation (DBEI) and its Agencies in response to Brexit, including supports available to companies, to help them prepare for Brexit.

The Government is responding with supports to help make companies more resilient in the face of changes to come because of Brexit but also because of broader global challenges. We are focusing on deepening national and firm level competitiveness, fostering product, service and process innovation within companies and working with businesses to diversify their trade with the world.</p><p>The following is a list of supports available to Irish enterprises, especially those who are highly dependent on the UK market as the destination for their exports. These supports will help alleviate the impact of Brexit on their businesses:</p><p>&euro;300m Brexit Loan Scheme </p><p>In March 2018, the Government launched a new Brexit Loan Scheme for eligible businesses with up to 499 employees. Loan amounts range from &euro;25,000 up to &euro;1.5m, for terms of up to 3 years and a maximum interest rate of 4%. The Scheme will provide much-needed finance to eligible business impacted by the UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the European Union. It will make a real difference to firms, enabling them to adapt, change and innovate. This, in turn, will help them to become more competitive, a fundamental trait in any resilient business.</p><p>SME Scorecard Online Tool </p><p>Any business can quickly self-diagnose whether they are ready for Brexit. This Enterprise Ireland (EI) scorecard is a first step in developing a robust Brexit plan.

The Plan is stimulating job creation across the region, including Counties Cavan and Monaghan, by facilitating collaborative initiatives between the public and private sector, and through the provision of new competitive funds, awarded through Enterprise Ireland (EI) to support regional enterprise projects. The North East/North West Regional Action Plan for Jobs is a key policy response for supporting employment growth in the Border region.  The Plan is stimulating job creation across the region, including Counties Cavan and Monaghan, by facilitating collaborative initiatives between the public and private sector, and through the provision of new competitive funds, awarded through Enterprise Ireland (EI) to support regional enterprise projects.</p><p>The core objective of the Action Plan is to have a further 28,000 at work in the region by 2020. We are aiming to ensure the unemployment rate is within the 1% of the State average. </p><p>Sectors targeted as part of the plan include traditionally strong sectors for the region like agri-food, manufacturing/engineering and tourism.  The Local Authorities, enterprise agencies, and other key public and private sector stakeholders in Counties Cavan and Monaghan have been strongly involved in, and are key drivers of the Action Plan.</p><p>The third progress report on the implementation of the Action Plan, covering the period from June-December 2017, is being finalised and shows that good progress is being made.  The progress reports are available on www.regionalapj.ie.</p><p>Some 12,000 jobs were created in the Border region since the regional Action Plans for Jobs initiative was launched in January 2015 while the unemployment rate in the region has fallen since then and now stands at 6.5% according to the CSO.</p><p>Furthermore, Live Register numbers have fallen in County Cavan by 16.1% and in County Monaghan by 15.3% in the past 12 months.  There is of course always room for improvement but the latest CSO figures are testament to the Government&rsquo;s efforts to help create jobs and reduce unemployment.</p><p>In May 2017 Enterprise Ireland launched the Regional Enterprise Development Fund with funding of up to &euro;60m, designed to support the ambition, goals, and implementation of the Regional Action Plans for Jobs. The first call under this Fund concluded last August, with results announced on 11th December and 21 projects were successful, totalling &euro;30.5m in aggregate grant support.  The second call which was launched this past Monday, will fund projects from the remaining balance of the &euro;60m budget available.</p><p><i>Monaghan County Enterprise Fund</i>is one of the 21 collaborative projects that secured funding under Stream 3 which is designed to support Local &amp;amp; Community Enterprise Development Projects with grants of &euro;50,000 up to &euro;250,000 per project.  The project involves the development of a Regional Food Centre of Excellence and a range of Food Product development supports.</p><p>EI together with the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) play a critical role in driving and nurturing entrepreneurship all the way from an originating idea at local level, to taking-on global markets.  In 2017, EI paid &euro;2.5m to companies in Cavan and &euro;7.2m to companies in Monaghan.  </p><p>The LEOs in Cavan and Monaghan continue to provide its range of supports for the micro and small business sector in 2018 and beyond.  Capital allocations of &euro;565,001 and &euro;583,428 were made available to LEO Monaghan and LEO Cavan respectively in 2018 to fund investment in their clients by way of grants and a range of &ldquo;soft&rdquo; supports, such as training and mentoring.  This funding is supplemented by a further &euro;132,000 investment fund to both LEOs under the Ireland&rsquo;s Best Young Entrepreneur (IBYE) competition &ndash; a total of 32 (Monaghan) and 31 (Cavan) applications were received this year by the closing date at the end of September.</p><p>Both LEO Monaghan and LEO Cavan are also in partnership with the LEOs in Donegal, Leitrim and Sligo in a project that was awarded funding of &euro;175,000 in 2016 under the LEO Competitive Fund.  The programme &ndash; ACCELINVEST &ndash; aims at creating a clear pathway for export focused, investment-ready regional companies to progress from the LEO Network to Enterprise Ireland.  LEO Cavan is also a partner in 2 other competitive fund projects with the LEOs in Leitrim, Longford and Roscommon.  The LEOs concerned were awarded almost &euro;220,000 to collaborate on a Graduate Internship for Entrepreneurship Programme in their areas and an initiative aimed at encouraging shared learning, dynamic trade development and knowledge transfer in the creative sector.</p><p>2017 was the first year of EI&rsquo;s strategy, Build Scale, Expand Reach 2017 &ndash; 2020.  This Strategy is focused on:  </p><p>- Assisting clients to create 60,000 new jobs by 2020 while sustaining the existing record level of jobs; </p><p>- Growing the annual exports of client companies by &euro;5bn to &euro;26bn per annum; </p><p>- Increasing the level of spend made by client companies in the Irish economy by &euro;4bn to &euro;27bn per annum by 2020; and </p><p>- Inspiring more Irish owned companies to have global ambition.</p><p>I am committed to work closely with Enterprise Ireland to drive this Strategy, to ensure that it continues to support companies in urban and rural areas to start, innovate, increase our exports and remain competitive in international markets, now and into the future. In recent months, with the support of my Department, EI has launched new measures to strengthen the rural and regional economy and to provide quicker access to innovation funding for exporting companies. This includes the new &euro;60m Regional Enterprise Development Fund and a new fast-track Agile Innovation Fund. I launched the 2nd Call for the Regional Fund on Monday 16th April.</p><p>My priority, as Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, is to drive creation of high-quality and sustainable employment across Ireland, including in Cavan and Monaghan. We are making significant progress towards achieving our regional development targets, which include a 30% to 40% increase in FDI in the North East Region. There are 36 multinational companies based in this region, employing 5.007 staff.</p></reply>

In addition, the LEOs provide a &lsquo;signposting&rsquo; service for the micro-enterprise and SME sector in relation to other relevant State supports, for example: Revenue, the Department of Social Protection, Microfinance Ireland, Trading Online Vouchers, LEADER and Education &amp;amp; Training Boards (ETBs).  </p><p>As you may be aware Capital allocation made available and maintained in 2018 to the 31 LEOs is &euro;22.5m. This is an increase from &euro;18.5 in 2016 and is being used to fund LEO clients by way of financial assistance and a range of soft supports such as training and mentoring and initiatives such as Ireland&rsquo;s Best Young Entrepreneur Competition. </p><p>I am delighted that Government funding is being put to such an excellent cause through Ireland&rsquo;s Best Young Entrepreneur. The facts speak for themselves: including this year&rsquo;s applicants, over 5,500 18-35 year old&rsquo;s have applied for funding to develop their business ideas. New research now shows that the &euro;5m we invested in IBYE has supported over 2,200 jobs and &euro;124m in sales. </p><p>In addition, the LEOs have also delivered specific Brexit initiatives for micro-enterprises, including:</p><p>- LEO Competitive Fund for Innovative Micro Enterprises: - this new competitive initiative incentivised LEO clients to engage in innovation to develop New Product, Process or Markets.</p><p>- Technical Assistance Grants for Micro Export:  Financial assistance to support market diversification in qualifying businesses to develop new market opportunities. </p><p>- The LEO&rsquo;s developed a Lean4Micro offer for micro enterprise clients: Helping business clients adopt LEAN business practices to increase competitiveness. </p><p>A net total of 3,760 new jobs were delivered in 2017 by start-ups and small businesses from across the country that have been supported by the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs). </p><p>This brings the total number of new jobs created by LEO-backed companies nationwide to 15,000 since the LEOs were set up in 2014. </p><p>That is an increase of 10% on 2016 - and the fourth straight year of employment growth.</p><p>Growth was evident in each area showing that each county has the potential to grow its own jobs if the right promotion, encouragement and supports are put in place.</p><p>A new client portfolio management model will be rolled out nationally this year by Enterprise Ireland to the LEOs, which will support portfolio performance and potential. </p><p>The Regional Action Plans for Jobs are also designed to encourage all the players in each region to actively support enterprise creation. There are 8 Regional Action Plans and they are underpinned by the &euro;60m Regional Enterprise Development Fund which supports the establishment of enterprise creation initiatives such as incubators, co-working space, clustering etc. I launched the second call under the Fund on Monday 16 April 2018. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-04-18a.281.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1249" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018041800071#WRE05800"><p>Co-ordination of the whole-of-Government response to Brexit is being taken forward through the cross-Departmental coordination structures chaired by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. </p>  <p>  Contingency planning for a no-deal or worst-case outcome, bringing together the detailed work being undertaken by individual Ministers and their Departments on issues within their policy remit, is now well advanced. Its focus is on the immediate regulatory and operational challenges which would result from such an outcome. It assumes a trading relationship based on the default WTO rules, but also examines the possible effects on many other areas of concern. This work is therefore providing baseline scenarios for the impact of Brexit across all sectors, which can then be adapted as appropriate in light of developments in the EU-UK negotiations, including in regard to transition arrangements and the future relationship.   It also takes account of the planning being undertaken at EU level by the new Commission Preparedness Unit, which is issuing information notes aimed at different business sectors.</p>  <p>  The Government is already acting in order to get Ireland Brexit ready. Dedicated measures were announced in Budget 2018, including a new &euro;300m Brexit Loan Scheme for Business and a &euro;25m Brexit Response Loan Scheme for the agri-food sector as well as additional supports for capital investment in the food industry and Bord Bia marketing and promotion activities, amounting to over &euro;50m in total.  Additional capital expenditure allocation of &euro;4.3bn over four years will also allow the State and its agencies to properly plan major infrastructure projects while ensuring that communities and businesses can plan ahead. There was also increased funding provided to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade for the opening of six new diplomatic missions as part of Global Footprint 2025, which will contribute to helping our exporters find new markets. Our Government&rsquo;s enterprise agencies continue to work with companies, helping them to deal with Brexit &ndash; making them more competitive, diversifying market exposure, and up-skilling teams.</p>  <p>  Longer-term economic strategies will also be critically important in addressing the challenges of Brexit, notably Ireland 2040 &ndash;the National Development Plan. "Enterprise 2025 Renewed: Building resilience in the face of global challenges" was launched on the 9th of March and sets out Ireland&rsquo;s medium-term national enterprise strategy. We are also in active discussions with the European Investment Bank on a potential increase in investment in the country. </p>  <p>  Before the summer the Government will finalise a paper, building on that published in May 2017, on our approach to the negotiations and our latest assessment of the economic and sectoral challenges posed by Brexit and our responses to them.</p>  <p>  My own Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation (DBEI) plays a key role in implementing the Government&rsquo;s policies to stimulate the productive capacity of the economy and create an environment which supports job-creation and jobs maintenance. </p>  <p>  In relation to Brexit, our objective is to support firms to adapt to the challenges and opportunities Brexit presents by ensuring we have fit for purpose policies. Our strategy is to minimise risks and maximise opportunities by ensuring the growth and resilience of Irish enterprise post-Brexit working across four pillars which are:</p>  <p>  - Helping Firms to Compete;</p>  <p>  - Enabling Firms to Innovate;</p>  <p>  - Supporting Firms to Trade;</p>  <p>  - Negotiating for the Best Possible Outcome;</p>  <p>  Several important steps have already been taken to prepare our economy, including through a range of measures announced in Budgets 2017 and 2018, as well as commitments set out in APJ 2017 and 2018 and the targets included in the Trade, Tourism and Investment Strategy.</p>  <p>  From my Department&rsquo;s perspective, we are leveraging the expertise and enhancing the capacity of our Agencies to ensure that they are in the best possible position to address the needs of their clients in relation to competitiveness, innovation and trade diversification. This is being achieved through the provision of information, advice, training and other supports. </p>  <p>  Specific DBEI actions to date include:</p>  <p>  - We are developing proposals for a Longer-Term Business Investment Loan Scheme together with a new Business Advisory Hub service which would focus on business development to allow enterprises to position themselves for a post-Brexit environment. </p>  <p>  - The EU Commission has approved a &lsquo;rescue and restructuring&rsquo; scheme. The scheme can be drawn on in exceptional circumstance for a company severely affected by Brexit. </p>  <p>   With regard to industry specific responses my Department has already outlined our Brexit Response Plan in &ldquo;Building Stronger Business &ndash; Responding to Brexit by competing, innovating and trading&rdquo; published last November. This sets out our response to Brexit which supports all enterprise sectors. </p>  <p>  My Department also commissioned a report by Copenhagen Economics (CE) on the trade impacts of Brexit (published 21 February 2018) which indicates that 5 sectors account for 90% of the possible economic impact. These are Agri-food (beef, processed food and dairy), Chemicals &amp;amp; Pharma, Electrical Machinery, Wholesale &amp;amp; Retail and Air Transport. However, the impacts are felt in different ways and require different approaches. </p>  <p>  In the case of Agri-food, Retail and Air Transport the potential impacts will be felt at the firm level, and we are engaging intensively with those sectors. For Chemicals &amp;amp; Pharma as well as Electrical Machinery, small impacts at firm level have a significant impact on the economy given their overall contribution to GDP in this context broad based mitigation the Government is undertaking to make our economy more resilient may be more relevant to these sectors and individual support for companies is not necessarily what is needed. </p>  <p>  The Government has an extensive Plan of activity underway, to support the Agri-Food sector through initiatives by the Department of Agriculture, Food &amp;amp; the Marine, Bord Bia and Enterprise Ireland. In the case of Retail my own Department is working with the Retail Representative organisations through the Retail Consultation Forum, which I chair. </p>  <p>  The most effective mitigation measure the Government can undertake is to negotiate for the best possible outcome in the future relationship between the EU and the UK. This will benefit all sectors of the economy and the detail contained in the CE study will further help to inform our approach to the negotiations.</p></reply>

In order to meet this demand, the Government is committed to building and retaining a highly skilled indigenous workforce to serve the needs of the economy.</p>  <p>  This goal is set out under the framework of two overarching skills development strategies:</p>  <p>- Ireland&rsquo;s National Skills Strategy 2025, which sets out a vision of how Ireland can continue to develop relevant skills and ensure that the supply of skills is activated and effectively used; and</p>  <p>- Action Plan for Education, 2016-2019, which aims to make the Irish education and training system the best in Europe over the next decade</p>  <p>  The sophisticated skills architecture established in Ireland is key in identifying and responding to skills gaps as identified by enterprise and education and training providers.  It constitutes the following:</p>  <p>  National Skills Council (NSC): The NSC was established in 2017. It provides a mechanism for mediating demands on resources in a manner that facilitates prioritisation within the identified needs, while at the same time enhancing the education and training provider responses to identified skills needs and ensuring delivery on priorities. The Council draws on the work of the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN), the Skills and Labour Market Research Unit in SOLAS, and the Regional Skills Fora. </p>  <p>  Regional Skills Fora: A network of 9 Regional Skills Fora fostering close co-operation at regional level between education and training providers and regional enterprise. The Fora provide a cohesive education-led structure for employers and the further education and higher education system to work together in building the skills needs of their regions.</p>  <p>- Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN): The EGFSN is an independent, non-statutory body, which includes representatives from the business community, education and training providers, learner-support groups, trade unions, and a smaller number of Government Departments and agencies. It identifies the skills required by enterprise across occupations and sectors, as well as providing information to education and training providers to allow them to support the alignment of programmes with employers&rsquo; needs. My Department, in conjunction with SOLAS, provides the EGFSN with research and secretariat support.</p>  <p>  High level ICT skills have been a key concern of the EGFSN since 2013, when it undertook the study Addressing Future Demand for High-Level ICT Skills. This study included a demand forecast for such skills, both in the ICT sector and across other sectors of the economy, over the period 2013-2018. A related objective was how Ireland could retain and attract high-level ICT Skills to address immediate high level ICT skills recruitment needs. The findings and recommendations of this report were essential inputs into the development of the ICT Skills Action Plan 2014-2018. </p>  <p>  At official level, my Department has also been involved in the High Level Steering Group responsible for monitoring the implementation of the ICT Skills Action Plan. As the Department of Education and Skills looks to develop a new ICT Skills Action Plan for the coming years, the EGFSN is now engaged in a refresh of the demand forecast exercise undertaken in 2013, for the period 2017-2022. </p>  <p>  Through the agencies and initiatives mentioned above my Department and the Department of Education and Skills will continue to ensure that an adequate and appropriately skilled workforce remains readily available to meet the requirements of the high tech industry.</p></reply>

Eight Regional Action Plans for Jobs (RAPJs) were published by the Department between June 2015 and January 2016, aimed at raising employment levels in the regions and facilitating them to achieve their economic potential.</p>  <p>  The primary objective of these plans is to have a further 10 to 15 per cent at work in each region by 2020 and to ensure the unemployment rate of each region does not exceed the State average by more than one percentage point. </p>  <p>  The Plans, incorporating over 1,300 actions, are being monitored and driven in each region by Implementation Committees, comprising representatives from the business community, as well as the Local Authorities, Enterprise Agencies, and other public bodies in the region. Many of the actions set out in the RAPJs require active engagement with, and the development of networks within, the private sector. To drive this process, key industry figures have been appointed to act as Enterprise Champions within each Region. Indeed, eight of the nine Implementation Committees are industry led. </p>  <p>  Progress across the eight regions has been very positive since the launch of the initiative, with an increase in employment of 8.5% or 118,600 jobs in the regions outside of Dublin and 166,800 additional jobs nationwide, from Q1 2015 to Q2 2017. Importantly, the Plans have been embraced within the regions and implementation rates for actions within the First and Second Progress Reports are over 90% for each region. Final progress reports for the current iteration of the Regional Plans are in preparation and will be published in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  The enterprise agencies have recorded substantial progress in the past few years. Under the IDA &lsquo;Winning&rsquo; Strategy 2015-2019, the Agency is targeting a minimum 30% to 40% increase in the number of investments for each region outside Dublin in the period of the Strategy. These targets have been developed taking into account the key factors crucial to attracting and retaining FDI. </p>  <p>  Since the IDA &lsquo;Winning&rsquo; Strategy was launched in 2015, half of all new IDA backed jobs created, were outside Dublin. All regions saw increases in IDA employment in 2017, with the South East experiencing the highest growth at 9%. </p>  <p>  Similarly, every region saw increases in Enterprise Ireland-supported jobs in 2017, with 64% of new positions outside of Dublin. The West, Mid-West and North West saw the largest level of increases at 7%.</p>  <p>  Micro and small businesses supported by the Local Enterprise Offices are making a hugely important contribution to employment growth. An average of 3,750 new jobs were created in LEO supported companies in each of the last four years. </p>  <p>  To support the ambition, goals, and implementation of the Regional Action Plans for Jobs, last May my Department launched the &euro;60m Regional Enterprise Development Fund. This competitive Fund is being rolled out by Enterprise Ireland over the next 4 years to support collaborative and innovative projects that can sustain and add to employment at a national, regional and county level. In December last year I announced an allocation of &euro;30.5 million under the first call under the Fund, with 21 projects from all over the country approved for funding. </p>  <p>  I launched the second call under the REDF on Monday 16th April, which will allocate the remainder of the &euro;60 million, and I hope to see more successful projects coming through from all regions. I want to see all regions benefitting from this Fund and to this end, I am committed to ensuring that a minimum of &euro;2 million in funding will be allocated to each region once projects submitted meet the threshold of standard set by Enterprise Ireland under the Scheme. </p>  <p>  Building on the progress and momentum of collaboration achieved to date through the Regional Action Plans is my priority. On Monday last I also met with the Chairs of the Regional APJ committees and other regional stakeholders, and together we have started a process to refresh and refocus all Regional Plans to ensure their relevance and impact out to 2020. I look forward to working further with the regional stakeholders all over the country to ensure we deliver to the employment targets for 2020 set out under the Regional Plans.</p></reply>

This illustrates the commitment to innovation in firms, both new and existing and also the importance of Enterprise Ireland support in helping them to pursue their Innovation goals. </p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland encourages companies to engage with RDI by collaborating with Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) or by sourcing/licensing new technologies from HEIs which can provide a step change in their innovative capabilities.  At the same time Enterprise Ireland has supports in place to help companies maximise the funding they can receive from the European Union.  These supports all help new and existing companies to develop new and improved products and services which serve as the basis for sustainable economic growth and are detailed below.</p>  <p>  In Company RD&amp;I supports the development of new or substantially improved products, services or processes which will have a competitive advantage in their target market.  This enables companies to increase employment through sustainable and substantially increased sales.  The new Agile Innovation Fund was launched in Quarter 4 2017 and is already gaining huge interest from companies.  This Fund allows up to 50% in support for projects to a maximum total cost of &euro;300,000 and has fast track approval.</p></reply>

Nevertheless, multinational companies continue to invest and reinvest here with leading global firms from many sectors - including life sciences, ICT, engineering and digital media - all based in Ireland.  The contribution that these investments make to our wider economy is undoubtedly significant and the Government is working hard to ensure that the country remains a destination of choice for overseas firms. </p>  <p>  Ireland's strengths when it comes to attracting FDI are well documented.  These include our competitiveness, talented and productive workforce, favourable demographics and membership of the European Union. Our pro-enterprise business environment, and track record as a home to FDI, are also key factors. Reinforcing and sustaining these strengths is important to ensuring Ireland's continuing FDI competitiveness. </p>  <p>  The IDA's 2017 Annual Results provides evidence of our continuing capacity to attract FDI to Ireland. Total employment by overseas companies in Ireland has now surpassed 210,000 people - a record level - with the numbers of investments also increasing. We are also attracting more investment to the regions.</p></reply>

In 2017, Ireland moved from seventh to sixth in the IMD (Institute for Management Development) World Competitiveness Yearbook.  Most importantly, Ireland&rsquo;s improved competitiveness is reflected in the labour market.  The results from the Labour Force Survey in respect of Q4 2017 shows employment totalled 2,231,000, up 3.1% or 66,800 from the same quarter in 2016.  Employment increased in twelve of fourteen economic sectors over the year. </p>  <p>  While our competitiveness performance in recent years has been positive, Brexit brings into sharp focus the need for continued improvement in competitiveness.  The immediate challenge for Ireland is to ensure growth is sustainable, enterprises are resilient and our economy is internationally competitive.  As Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, my objective is to create the best possible environment for enterprise, entrepreneurship, innovation and investment across all regions.  Our enterprise policies are delivering but Brexit, international tax developments, US policy developments and technological advances present direct events that will have an impact on Ireland&rsquo;s prospects. </p>  <p>  Brexit has exposed how Irish export markets are geographically concentrated and the range of products and services exported has likewise become increasingly concentrated.  Our Brexit response has seen further company-led expansion into markets and a deepening of trade links with the world&rsquo;s leading and emerging economies.  My Department through Enterprise Ireland is actively supporting exporters, particularly SMEs to intensify their efforts to scale and diversify sustainably and to enhance the competitiveness of Irish exports.</p>  <p>  Through the implementation of Enterprise 2025 Renewed and the Action Plan for Jobs 2018 we have set out a range of short and long term measures to deepen resilience in Ireland&rsquo;s enterprise and enhance the competitiveness of Irish exports.</p></reply>

In order to meet this demand, the Government remains committed to building and retaining a highly skilled indigenous workforce. </p>  <p>  This goal is set out under the framework of two overarching skills development strategies:</p>  <p>  - Ireland&rsquo;s National Skills Strategy 2025, which sets out a vision of how Ireland can continue to develop relevant skills and ensure that the supply of skills is activated and effectively used; and</p>  <p>  - Action Plan for Education, 2016-2019, which aims to make the Irish education and training system the best in Europe over the next decade</p>  <p>  The sophisticated skills architecture established in Ireland is key in identifying and responding to skills gaps as identified by enterprise and education and training providers.  It constitutes the following:</p>  <p>  - National Skills Council (NSC): The NSC was established in 2017.  It provides a mechanism for mediating demands on resources in a manner that facilitates prioritisation within the identified needs, while at the same time enhancing the education and training provider responses to identified skills needs and ensuring delivery on priorities.  The Council draws on the work of the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN), the Skills and Labour Market Research Unit in SOLAS, and the Regional Skills Fora. </p>  <p>  - Regional Skills Fora: A network of 9 Regional Skills Fora fostering close co-operation at regional level between education and training providers and regional enterprise.  The Fora provide a cohesive education-led structure for employers and the further education and higher education system to work together in building the skills needs of their regions.</p>  <p>  - Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN): The EGFSN is an independent, non-statutory body, which includes representatives from the business community, education and training providers, learner-support groups, trade unions, and a smaller number of Government Departments and agencies.  It identifies the skills required by enterprise across occupations and sectors, as well as providing information to education and training providers to allow them to support the alignment of programmes with employers&rsquo; needs. My Department, in conjunction with SOLAS, provides the EGFSN with research and secretariat support.</p>  <p>  An example of the EGFSN&rsquo;s upcoming work on meeting the challenges of rapid innovation and its impact on the Irish workforce is the report on Skills for the Digital Economy. This report will emphasise the importance of the constant reskilling and upskilling of the workforce in creating a resilient economy.  The report will focus on how different roles and different sectors will be impacted by digitalisation and will develop a synopsis of approaches to upskilling the existing workforce. The report will add to the body of work completed by the EGFSN since its inception in relation to filling skills gaps using our current labour market.</p>  <p>  Further to this, a number of agencies and initiatives work in collaboration with my Department in order to ensure our workforce is equipped with the skills necessary to meet the growing demands of enterprise.</p>  <p>  - Springboard is an initiative under the Higher Education Authority that strategically targets funding of free higher education courses to engage jobseekers to upskill or reskill in areas where there are identified labour market skills shortages or employment opportunities. As of 2018 Springboard offers 208 free, part-time and intensive conversion courses in higher education from certificate, to degree, to post-graduate level.  All Springboard courses lead to qualifications in enterprise sectors which are growing and need skilled personnel, including ICT; manufacturing; international financial services; and key skills for enterprise to trade internationally.  </p>  <p>  - Skillnets is a state-funded, enterprise-led body established in 1999. Skillnets operates a number of specialised programmes which have played a significant role in addressing current and future skills needs in Ireland. For example, the Future Skills Needs Programme (FSNP) facilitates collaboration between enterprise, academic institutions and industry training providers to develop innovative new programmes that specifically address the future skills needs of businesses. Working in close collaboration with its networks, Skillnets ensure training interventions are relevant to the specific skills needs of participating firms, congruent with the ever-changing world of work, and meeting a high bar in terms of programme design and delivery. </p>  <p>  - SOLAS is an agency of the Department of Education and Skills established in 2013 under the Further Education and Training Act. SOLAS functions are to manage, co-ordinate and support the delivery of this integrated Further Education and Training by the Education and Training Boards (ETBs); to monitor delivery and provide funding based on reliable, good quality data and positive outcomes; and to promote Further Education and Training provision that is relevant to individual learner needs and national skills needs. This includes the needs of business and future skills requirements.  The work of SOLAS is vital in meeting future skills needs through the Irish talent pool. Under the Action Plan for Jobs 2018, SOLAS will support up to 6,200 apprenticeship registrations and 3,900 traineeship enrolments throughout this year. </p>  <p>  Through the agencies and initiatives mentioned above my Department and the Department of Education and Skills will continue to ensure that that an adequate and appropriately skilled workforce remains readily available to meet the innovative challenges of the workplace.</p></reply>

Whilst this competition is increasingly intense, our country has a number of key strengths that continue to make us a highly attractive destination for FDI. These include our highly skilled workers, first-class education system and positive demographics. Our membership of the EU and Eurozone, pro-enterprise policy environment, and competitive corporation tax regime are other significant selling points. </p>  <p>  Taken together, these strengths help the IDA make a compelling case to prospective investors about the merits of investing in Ireland. They also help to explain our strong national performance in terms of FDI-driven investment and job creation. In 2017, for example, the IDA's client companies created over 19,500 new jobs across a range of sectors, bringing total employment at FDI firms to 210,000.</p>  <p>  Ireland clearly therefore does remain an attractive location for FDI. The Government is nevertheless conscious of our need to remain as competitive as possible. That is why it will continue to explore how to both reinforce existing strengths and find new ways of attracting job-rich investment to the country.</p></reply>

The Act specifies the criteria for decisions on the reimbursement of medicines. </p>  <p>  The 2013 Act does not give the Minister for Health any powers in this regard.  The HSE does not require approval or consent from the Minister or Government when making a reimbursement decision.</p>  <p>  HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE). </p>  <p>  The NCPE conducts health technology assessments (HTAs) for the HSE, and makes recommendations on reimbursement to assist HSE decisions. The NCPE uses a decision framework to systematically assess whether a drug is cost-effective as a health intervention.</p>  <p>  As outlined in the IPHA agreement, and in line with the 2013 Act,  the HSE will decide, within 180 days of receiving the application (or a longer period if further information is sought from the company), to either:</p>  <p>  1. add the medicine to the reimbursement list or agree to reimburse it as a hospital medicine,</p>  <p>  2. refuse to reimburse the medicine. </p>  <p>  The HSE strives to reach a decision in as timely a manner as possible and within the 180 days. However, because of the significant monies involved, it must ensure that the best price is achieved, as these commitments are often multi-million euro investments on an on-going basis. Successful price negotiations also allow for further drugs to be approved within the finite budget available. </p>  <p>  I have been informed that the NCPE are currently conducting a health technology assessment on  Ocrelizumab for the treatment of adult patients with early primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) and for the treatment of adult patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS).</p>  <p>  I can confirm that I received a letter from Roche Products (Ireland) Ltd in December 2017 concerning Ocrelizumab, however as I have stated, the drug in question is being assessed in accordance with the statutory procedure in place. I am keen to engage with Industry and to explore ways in which new medicines might be more easily introduced in Ireland.  However, any innovative approaches that may be tabled must be compatible with the statutory provisions which are in place and must also recognise the fundamental pricing/funding issues in the context of finite Exchequer resources.</p>  <p>  My Department will be engaging with Industry over the coming months to explore avenues for securing more timely and affordable access to new medicines.</p></reply>

Since the closure of the Mobility Allowance, the Government has directed that the Health Service Executive should continue to pay an equivalent monthly payment of up to &euro;208.50 per month to the 4,133 people in receipt of the Mobility Allowance, on an interim basis, pending the establishment of a new Transport Support Scheme.</p>  <p>  The Government decided that the detailed preparatory work required for a new Transport Support Scheme and associated statutory provisions should be progressed by the Minister for Health.  The Programme for a Partnership Government acknowledges the ongoing drafting of primary legislation for a new Transport Support Scheme to assist those with a disability to meet their mobility costs. The Health (Transport Support) Bill is on the list of priority legislation for publication in the Spring/Summer session 2018. I can confirm that work on the policy proposals for the new Scheme is at an advanced stage. The proposals seek to ensure that: </p>  <p>  - There is a firm statutory basis to the Scheme's operation;</p>  <p>  - There is transparency and equity in the eligibility criteria attaching to the Scheme;</p>  <p>  - Resources are targeted at those with greatest needs; and</p>  <p>  - The Scheme is capable of being costed and is affordable on its introduction and on an ongoing basis.</p>  <p>  It is hoped to bring a General Scheme and Heads of Bill to Government shortly, seeking Government approval to the drafting of the Bill for the new Transport Support Payment.</p>  <p>  With regard to the Motorised Transport Grant, this scheme operated as a means-tested grant to assist persons with severe disabilities with the purchase or adaptation of a car, where that car was essential to retain employment. The maximum Motorised Transport Grant, which was payable once in any three-year period, was &euro;5,020.  Following closure of the scheme in February 2013,  no further Motorised Transport Grants have been payable.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers scheme operated by the Revenue Commissioners, remains in place. This scheme provides VRT and VAT relief, an exemption from road tax and a fuel grant to drivers and passengers with a disability, who qualify under the relevant criteria set out in governing regulations made by the Minister for Finance.  Specifically adapted vehicles driven by disabled persons are also exempt from payment of tolls on national toll roads and toll bridges. Transport Infrastructure Ireland has responsibility for this particular Scheme.</p>  <p>  There are improvements in access to a range of transport support schemes available to persons with disabilities in the State and on-going work is being carried out by Government Departments, agencies and transport providers to further improve access to public transport services. Under the National Disability Inclusion Strategy, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has responsibility for the continued development of accessibility and availability of public transport for people with a disability.</p></reply>

The Act specifies the criteria for decisions on the reimbursement of medicines.</p><p>In line with the 2013 Act, if a company would like a medicine to be reimbursed by the HSE pursuant to the Community Drugs scheme, the company must first submit an application to the HSE to have the new medicine added to the Reimbursement List.</p><p>As outlined in the IPHA agreement, and in line with the 2013 Act, the HSE will decide, within 180 days of receiving the application (or a longer period if further information is sought from the company), to either add the medicine to the reimbursement list or agree to reimburse it as a hospital medicine, or refuse to reimburse the medicine.</p><p>  HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE). </p><p>  The NCPE conducts health technology assessments (HTAs) for the HSE, and makes recommendations on reimbursement to assist HSE decisions. The NCPE uses a decision framework to systematically assess whether a drug is cost-effective as a health intervention.</p><p>  The HSE strives to reach a decision in as timely a manner as possible. However, because of the significant monies involved, it must ensure that the best price is achieved, as these commitments are often multi-million euro investments on an on-going basis. This can lead to a protracted deliberation process.</p><p>I have been informed that Ocrelizumab for the treatment of adult patients with early primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) and for the treatment of adult patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS) is currently undergoing a full pharmacoeconomic assessment by the NCPE.</p><p>I am keen to engage with Industry and to explore ways in which new medicines might be more easily introduced in Ireland.  However, any innovative approaches that may be tabled must be compatible with the statutory provisions which are in place and must also recognise the fundamental pricing/funding issues in the context of finite Exchequer resources.  </p><p>I have indicated willingness to meet with MS Ireland and my office is in contact with the organisation to arrange a mutually convenient date.</p></reply>

However, the HTA also found that using a combination of varenicline and NRT was the most effective pharmacological intervention and that people using this combination were over three and a half times more likely to quit than those who were in a control group and did not receive this treatment. </p>  <p>  Group behavioural therapy, individual counselling, intensive advice and telephone support were all found to be effective behavioural interventions with group therapy found to be the most effective of these interventions. The addition of a behavioural intervention to a pharmacological intervention improved the effectiveness of the intervention.</p>  <p>  The HTA recommended that smoking cessation services should seek to increase the uptake of varenicline, either alone or in combination with NRT, for smokers who want to use a pharmacological support. </p>  <p>   In relation to e-cigarettes and vaping, although the HTA found that results for e-cigarettes are promising, there is currently a lack of evidence to recommend their use as a smoking cessation aid and at present no e-cigarette product is licensed as a medicinal product in Ireland. The safety of e-cigarettes is an evolving area of research; while potentially safer than smoking, evidence on its long-term safety has yet to be established.  In the absence of additional evidence confirming the effectiveness of e-cigarettes, the HTA recommended that the HSE smoking cessation services should seek to increase the uptake of combination NRT treatment among those for whom varenicline is contraindicated, not tolerated or not preferred.  </p>  <p>  The results of the HTA are informing the development by the HSE, in conjunction with the National Clinical Effectiveness Committee, of national clinical guidelines. </p>  <p>  Current evidence-based means of quitting include behavioural support and pharmacotherapies.  The HSE provides and promotes these safe and evidence-based services, supports and aids to help people to quit.  The HSE recommends that those wishing to give up smoking uses its cessation services as the first port of call.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to monitor the emerging research on all products, so as to inform decisions around any future additional regulation in this area. </p></reply>

The Expert Group also concluded that a person&rsquo;s means should remain the main qualifier for a medical card.  This position remains unchanged.</p>  <p>  Medical card provision is based on financial assessment. In accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is determined by the HSE. The Act obliges the HSE to assess whether a person is unable, without due hardship, to arrange general practitioner services for himself or herself and his or her family, having regard to his or her overall financial position and reasonable expenditure and every application must be assessed on that basis. Under the legislation, having a particular illness, in itself, does not establish eligibility for a medical card and therefore, the medical conditions of applicants for this scheme are not monitored on that basis. Where the applicant's income is within the income guidelines, a medical card or GP visit card will be awarded. </p>  <p>  Every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to support applicants in applying for a medical card and, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines. It should be noted, in certain circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds his or her income threshold, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness. Social and medical issues are considered when determining whether undue hardship exists for an individual accessing general practitioner or other medical services. The HSE affords applicants the opportunity to furnish supporting information documentation to fully take account of all the relevant circumstances that may benefit them in the assessment, including medical evidence of cost and necessary expenses. </p></reply>

I want to ensure that existing GP services are retained and that general practice remains an attractive career option for newly-qualified GPs. </p>  <p>  The number of GPs on the specialist register continues to increase &ndash; up from 2,270 in 2010 to 3,637 in 2017 and there are now 2,485 GPs contracted to the HSE under the GMS scheme compared to 2,098 in 2008. It should be noted that as of 1 March there were only 23 GMS panels that do not have a permanent GP in place &ndash; a vacancy rate of less than 1%. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Government has also taken steps to expand GP training. In 2009, there were 120 GP training places and this year there are 194 GP training places available for the 2018 GP training intake. The Government is committed to further increasing this number to 259 places annually in future years. </p>  <p>  Further efforts undertaken in recent years to increase the number of practicing GPs include changes to the entry provisions to the GMS scheme to accommodate more flexible/shared GMS/GP contracts, and to the retirement provisions for GPs under the GMS scheme, allowing GPs to hold GMS contracts until their 72nd birthday, as well as the introduction of an enhanced supports package for rural GP practices. </p>  <p>  It is generally accepted that there is a need to modernise the current GMS contract and ensure that general practice benefits patients while providing for a viable and rewarding career for current and future GPs. The aim is to develop a contract which has a population health focus, providing in particular for health promotion and disease prevention and for the structured ongoing care of chronic conditions. </p>  <p>  Engagement with GP representatives on contractual issues will commence in the coming weeks. It is important that any new contract will result in service improvements across general practice benefiting both patients and GPs.</p></reply>

Local authorities have specific powers under sections 55 and 56 of the Act to require measures to be taken, or to take measures directly, to prevent or limit environmental pollution caused or likely to be caused by holding, recovery or disposal of waste, and to mitigate or remedy the effects on the environment of any such activity.   With regard to abandoned vehicles, Section 71 of the Waste Management Act, 1996 prohibits the abandonment of vehicles on any land, creates an offence in this regard and enables local authorities to enter on any land upon which vehicles have been abandoned to remove and store such abandoned vehicles. These vehicles may subsequently become the property of the authority, if not reclaimed by the registered owner within a period of four weeks.  A local authority may also seek reimbursement of the costs for the removal and storage of abandoned vehicles from the registered owners of such vehicles.</p>  <p>  In certain circumstances, an abandoned vehicle is also a matter for An Garda S&iacute;ochana as vehicles and may be removed under Road Traffic legislation.</p></reply>

Today, almost 7 out of 10 of the 2.3 million premises in Ireland have access to high speed broadband. Since this Government came into office almost 400,000 additional premises have access to high speed broadband. This will increase to nearly 8 out of 10 premises by the end of this year and by 2020, 9 out of 10 premises will have access to a high speed broadband connection. This is being achieved via a combination of commercial investment and a State led intervention.    The premises referred to by the Deputy is in an AMBER area on my Department&rsquo;s High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie. It is therefore included in the State Intervention Area under the NBP.</p>  <p>  With regards to the infrastructure deployment referred to by the Deputy, decisions made by private telecommunication operators relating to the rollout and siting of infrastructure to provide high speed broadband services throughout Ireland are undertaken on a commercial basis by competing service providers operating in a liberalised market. I have no statutory role or function to intervene in the commercial decisions of private operators, and therefore cannot direct operators regarding infrastructure installation or delivery of services. </p>  <p>  My Department is in a formal procurement process to select a company who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network in the State intervention area. That procurement process is now in its final stages.</p>  <p>  In the interim, practical initiatives will continue to be addressed through the work of the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce to address obstacles and improve connectivity in respect of existing and future mobile phone and broadband services. </p>  <p>  Under this Taskforce, engagement between telecommunications operators and local authorities through the Broadband Officers is continuing to strengthen.  These Broadband Officers are acting as single points of contact in local authorities for their communities.  The appointment of these officers is already reaping rewards in terms of ensuring a much greater degree of consistency in engagements with operators and clearing obstacles to developing infrastructure.  There is a link to a list of these local Broadband Officers on my Department's website.</p>  <p>   </p></reply>

In this regard, the European Commission established an <i>Independent High Level Group on Fake News and Online Disinformation</i>which reported in March 2018. The Report recognises the complexity of the issue and calls for a multi-stakeholder approach to drive greater transparency, fact-checking and media literacy in tackling online disinformation.  It also recognises the importance of diverse and sustainable sources of news media and of quality journalism in this regard. </p><p>The European Commission is currently preparing a Communication in respect of an EU approach to addressing online disinformation which is expected to issue in the coming weeks. </p><p>At  national level, the Government has established an interdepartmental group to consider the issues arising from recent experiences in other democratic countiries with regard to the use of social media by external, anonymous or hidden third parties. It will focus on the risks arising from disinformation spread by social media and other means, particularly in respect of safeguarding the integrity of electoral processes.  My Department is represented on that group which is chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach.  </p><p>The BAI has produced a media literacy policy to support users in acquiring the skills to better understand how media works and to determine the accuracy and fairness of the information they receive.  The BAI also supports the recently formed Irish Media Literacy Network which has 93 members, including online platforms. </p><p>I have stated on a number of occasions that one of the most effective means of tackling disinformation is to support the provision of impartial and independent news which is reliable and provides the necessary Irish perspective on news events and current affairs. In this regard, it is important to ensure that public service broadcasters are properly funded to support quality journalism and news services. We must also recognise the financial difficulty that all broadcasters are facing. This is why the Broadcasting (Amendment) Bill that I have proposed provides for the introduction of a new funding scheme to offer bursaries to journalists working in local or community radio stations.  The Broadcasting Bill also provides for measures that will enable a reduction in the burden of the broadcasting levy on all broadcasters, and for exempting  community broadcasters from the levy altogether. In addition, I have announced my intention to seek Government approval to amend section 41(2) of the Broadcasting Act, 2009 at Committee Stage of the Broadcasting (Amendment) Bill, in order to remove the hourly limit on advertising for commercial radio stations.  Together, these measures will contribute to mitigating the financial challenges faced by Irish broadcasters.</p></reply>

The continued use of the paper motor tax and NCT discs will also be kept under review in that context.</p></reply>

One of its more important functions is to act as the national anti-doping organisation (NADO) in Ireland.  To that end, it provides important services in the fight against the use of illegal performance substances in sport, including testing and education. Irish anti-doping efforts are internationally renowned to be of a high standard, as Sport Ireland continues to work to ensure that the integrity of sporting competitions is maintained and all clean athletes compete on a level playing field.</p>  <p>  In relation to the specific cases referred to by the Deputy, it is important to note that the awarding and rescinding of medals, whether immediately after competition or a number of years thereafter, is a matter for decision by the organisers of the events in question. The International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) is responsible for awarding and rescinding medals in the case of the World Championships in Athletics.  The IAAF's regional associations are responsible in cases of regional athletics championships.</p>  <p>  Minister Ross and I have made clear our dissatisfaction with the chaotic situation currently in the World Anti-Doping Agency. We believe it is essential to address the clear conflict of interest that arises from having sport policy decision makers involved in the anti-doping process. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has a clear conflict of interest and should have no influence or role in the affairs of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).  The status quo undermines the credibility of a system which is failing clean athletes, who dedicate their lives to sport and deserve a level playing field. We believe it is necessary for Governments to take concerted and collaborative action and we are in ongoing contact with our fellow sports ministers in this regard.</p></reply>

As Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, I have sought to maximise the resources available for this important work and the effectiveness in the deployment of these resources.</p>  <p>  From my Department&rsquo;s perspective Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, has a statutory duty under the Child Care Act 1991 to promote the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care and protection. Any child who resides in Ireland and who is not receiving adequate care and protection can be received into the care of the State if deemed to be the appropriate action required. Tusla is required under the 1991 Act to investigate allegations of abuse, including historical abuse, and to engage with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na where appropriate. Tusla has a key role in supporting some of the most vulnerable children and young people in State care. My Department provides funding for Tusla. In 2018 it has been allocated exchequer funding of &euro;757 million, representing an increase of &euro;44 million on 2017. Tusla provides a comprehensive range of services and supports for vulnerable children and families. These include child welfare and protection, including family support; educational welfare; pre-school inspection and domestic, sexual and gender-based violence. These services and supports are provided by Social Workers, Educational Welfare Officers, and Early Years Inspectors. The precise level of funding available to services for children is considered by Tusla in implementing its 2018 Business Plan, based on the Performance Statement. The Business Plan is available at - www.tusla.ie/uploads/content/Tusla_Business_Plan_2018.pdf.</p></reply>

It was introduced in June 2016 and is administered by Pobal on behalf of my Department. AIM is a child-centred model, involving seven levels of progressive support, moving from the universal to the targeted, based on the needs of the child and the pre-school setting.</p><p>  Level 7 of AIM provides additional assistance in the pre-school room where this is critical to ensuring a child&rsquo;s participation in the ECCE Programme.  In line with emerging best practice to support the integration and independence of children with a disability, AIM does not fund Special Needs Assistants (SNAs). Rather, it provides financial support to the pre-school provider, which can be used either to reduce the adult to child ratio in the pre-school room by reducing the number of children in the room or to buy in additional assistance to the pre-school room.  The latter is generally managed through a recruitment process if the pre-school does not have access to a staff member to fulfil this role as is the case for most smaller pre-schools.  Services who intend to use AIM Level 7 support to recruit an additional person for the pre-school room, or increase hours for existing staff, must ensure that such staff hold at least a major award in early childhood care and education at Level 5 on the National Framework of Qualifications or a qualification deemed to be equivalent.  The is in line with Child Care Act 1991 (Early Years Services) Regulations 2016 and recognises early years care and education as a specialised area within education.</p><p>These Regulations were amended to allow for an exemption to these qualification requirements for an employee of a registered pre-school provider receiving AIM Level 7 support where it has been deemed that specialised health support is required. In limited circumstances, an exemption may be granted by Pobal where it is considered that such specialist support is required and is critical to the child's meaningful participation in the ECCE programme. Such exemptions will primarily be for children with medically complex needs.  The pre-school provider would need to request an exemption during the appraisal process, or once funding has been approved prior to recruitment.</p><p>Neither Pobal nor my Department has a direct role in the recruitment of staff for pre-schools which are operated by either private or not for profit entities. While Pobal has noted a time lag for the draw down of some approved AIM Level 7 support, there are several reasons why a pre-school provider may not yet have received a Level 7 payment following approval of such support. For example, the pre-school may need to return or correct the necessary paperwork, the child&rsquo;s registration on the IT system used to administer Early Years funding may need to be amended, or the pre-school may be experiencing difficulty in recruiting staff. In the normal course of events, the recruitment process can take several weeks as the pre-school will have to advertise, review applications, interview candidates, carry out Garda vetting and agree a start date with the successful candidate.</p><p>Pobal has received feedback from 10 providers who reported some difficulty in implementing Level 7 support. This included issues around recruiting staff with the minimum qualification, difficulty in recruiting staff to work part-time hours and concerns around staff shortages in the wider pre-school sector. An End of Year One Review of AIM is currently underway which will include an online survey of a representative sample of pre-school practitioners. This may yield further information about recruitment under AIM Level 7.</p><p>Overall, in its first year, AIM provided 2,486 children with 4,760 varying degrees of support to ensure that they could fully participate in the ECCE programme. In the second year of AIM from September 2017 to date, AIM provided 3,795 children with 5,900 varying degrees of support to ensure that they could fully participate in the ECCE programme.</p><p>Where the 2017/2018 ECCE programme year is concerned, the following applications have been approved to date:</p><p>2,602 applications approved for Level 4 (Expert Early Years Educational Advice and Support)</p><p>Under Level 5 (Equipment and Minor Alterations), 255 applications for equipment have been approved and 34 applications for minor alterations have been approved. </p><p>Under Level 7 (Additional Assistance in the Pre-school Room), 2,196 new applications have been approved to date as well as 633 applications which rolled over from the 2016/2017 ECCE programme year.</p><p>The report of the End of Year One Review of AIM is expected in Quarter 2 of 2018.</p><p>With regard to recruitment and retention of staff in Early Years services, I am very much aware of the difficulties currently being experienced. It is clear that a major issue impacting on attrition and retention rates is the poor terms and conditions of the workforce. These relate to both pay and part time / part year contracts. </p><p>My Department and the Department of Education and Skills have committed to delivering a new workforce plan for the Early Years sector in 2018.  To support this work, the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs commissioned a skills forecasting model from Prospectus Consulting which will allow detailed analysis of skills needs for the sector at a national and regional level.  The model is currently being finalised and will feed into the second phase of the work.  The aim of the workforce plan is to examine the impact of a rapidly changing policy and practice landscape in the childcare sector in Ireland on future skills requirements so that Government can ensure that a high quality workforce is in place over the next decade. The ten year Early Years Strategy which I hope to publish later this year will also focus on how this issue can be addressed. </p><p>  Additional investment is required to address the pay and conditions issue. I have regularly spoken about the need to continue to invest both in the quality and affordability of childcare in this country, building on the 80% increase in investment Government has made over the last three budgets. Many efforts have already been made to begin to improve conditions. For example, from September 2018 capitation rates to childcare providers for the provision of the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme will increase by 7%. The increase in capitation is targeted at increasing the quality of care and education provided through ECCE, and in particular, supporting the recruitment and retention of high quality staff.</p></reply>

Local management had no option but to immediately suspend the outreach service.  My Department took immediate steps to minimise any inconvenience to customers. Other social protection services, such as jobseeker payments are dealt with by Drogheda Intreo Centre, and Ardee Branch Office.  Notices were posted directing CWS customers to the Drogheda Intreo Centre which is 15km away and on a main bus route. The CWS service there is available on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday each week, and from Ardee Health Centre on Tuesdays and Fridays. </p><p>Customers have been provided with a phone service staffed by experienced CWS personnel in Drogheda and Ardee. If a customer is unable to visit the centres, for example due to illness, arrangements can be made to conduct a home visit.</p><p>The Department is closely monitoring the impact of the closure. While it is early days, the new arrangements appear to be working quite well. No customer complaints have been received and feedback on the telephone service has been very positive. The majority of queries have been fully resolved over the phone and customers have been happy to have avoided otherwise unnecessary visits to the old clinic in Dunleer.  For example:</p><p>-  On 28<sup>th</sup>March, of the 6 calls received, 4 were for information, with only 2 customers requiring a meeting with the Designated Person (DP).</p><p>-  On 4<sup>th</sup>April, of the 6 calls received, 5 were for information, 1 required a meeting with the DP.</p><p>-  Week ended 13<sup>th</sup>April 7 calls received, 6 for information and 1 required a meeting with DP. </p><p>The HSE does not intend to renovate the premises in Dunleer but my Department is currently examining the feasibility of providing the CWS service from other premises in Dunleer as well as exploring other options to enhance the provision of CWS services across the County.</p><p>I trust that this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

It is based, therefore, on contributions under the PRSI system, and not to income tax collected under the PAYE system.  People with no such social insurance record may qualify for a means-tested State pension (non-contributory), paid at up to 95% of the maximum contributory rate.  Over 70% of such pensioners qualify for that pension at its maximum rate.</p><p>Awarding a maximum rate contributory rate pension to all pensioners with periods outside the PRSI system would effectively remove the pensions-related benefit of paying PRSI, and would also result in very considerable additional costs to the pension system, which would require either very significant cuts either in the rate of payment, or substantial increases in the PRSI and/or income tax paid by workers, or diversion of other expenditure.  Given that the main beneficiaries would be better off pensioners (who do not qualify for a non-contributory pension) and those who lose out would be people who either are solely dependent upon the State pension, or are working age people (who have higher rates of poverty than those aged over 66), this would be a regressive move, and also one which made the State pension system &ndash; which already faces significant sustainability challenges &ndash; unsustainable in the long term, endangering the future pensions of current workers who are paying for today&rsquo;s pensions in their PRSI and taxes.  I do not, therefore, propose to make the change suggested in the Deputy&rsquo;s question.</p><p>PRSI contributions can be credited to people in a number of contexts, for example when in receipt of a Jobseekers or Illness benefit payments. Where applicable, these may be used towards PRSI-based social protection payments, including the State pension contributory.  To qualify for a credit you must have worked and paid at least one PRSI contribution at PRSI Class A, B, C, D, E, or H and have paid or credited contributions in either of the last two completed tax years.  Not all credits are reckonable for a State pension (contributory). </p><p>A new Total Contributions Approach to determining the level of pay for recipients of the State Pension (contributory) affected by the 2012 rate band changes was agreed by the Government in January.  Under this approach a person who reached pension age after 1st September 2012 and has a 40 year record of paid and credited reckonable social insurance contributions, will qualify for a maximum contributory pension where they satisfy the other qualifying conditions for the scheme.  Up to 20 years of a new HomeCaring credit, and/or 10 years of other credits, for example when unemployed or ill, may be used, subject to the total number of credits not exceeding 20 years<b>.</b>So, for example, a person might receive a maximum pension based on 20 years paid PRSI contributions, 5 years jobseeker credits, and 15 years HomeCaring Credits, over a 50 year period.  Invalidity pensioners and, in most cases, Widows contributory pensioners will continue to generally qualify for a full pension.  Instructions for legislation to give effect to this change are currently being set out.  When drafted, the legislation will be brought forward at the next available opportunity.  </p><p>Plans for legislation to introduce a Total Contribution Approach for all new pensioners for 2020 onwards will be brought to Government following public consultation later this year. </p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

However, the delivery of more affordable homes, to buy or rent, is a major priority for Government, focusing in particular on those people on low to moderate incomes. Recognising that housing affordability is a major issue for some households, especially in areas such as Dublin, Cork and Galway, several important initiatives have already been implemented to stimulate housing supply at more affordable prices and rents.</p>  <p>  Rebuilding Ireland has prioritised supporting the supply of new and more affordable homes more generally through, inter alia, fast-track planning reforms and more flexible planning guidelines; &euro;200 million investment in enabling infrastructure to enable access to key development sites; the development of large-scale mixed-tenure projects on State lands; and the help-to-buy scheme to assist first-time buyers.  </p>  <p>  In Budget 2018, the Government removed significant obstacles to building more homes more quickly, by investing more in direct house-building by the State; removing the Capital Gains Tax incentive to hold on to residential land; escalating penalties for land hoarding; introducing a new &euro;25 million Serviced Sites fund and a second LIHAF infrastructural investment fund; and providing a new, more affordable finance vehicle for house building through Home Building Finance Ireland (HBFI).</p>  <p>  To help renters in the parts of the country where rents are highest and rising, the Government introduced Rent Pressure Zones (RPZs), where rents can only increase by a maximum of 4% annually for three years. Currently, the measure covers almost 57% of existing rental properties across the country, including 100% of rental properties in Dublin and Cork.</p>  <p>  As part of the review of Rebuilding Ireland, a further package of affordability measures was announced on 22 January 2018, with a new Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan, a new Affordable Purchase Scheme, and a focus on advancing cost rental projects. More recently, I published new planning guidelines last month to facilitate delivery of a broader mix of apartment types to meet contemporary housing demand, including in the emerging &lsquo;build to rent&rsquo; and &lsquo;shared accommodation&rsquo; sectors. </p>  <p>  While these actions are having an impact and will have a greater impact in time, I consider that a further package of targeted measures focused on addressing affordability is needed to enable low- to moderate-income households, that do not qualify for social housing supports, to purchase or rent homes, particularly in Dublin and other major urban areas.  This will include, but will not be limited to, the deployment of the aforementioned &euro;25 million Exchequer funding, over 2018 and 2019, to unlock local authority-owned lands specifically for affordable housing.  My Department is currently drawing up the criteria for access to this fund, taking account of broader policy on affordable housing, and will be seeking submissions from local authorities in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

This is a more targeted and responsive way to meet actual need identified rather than designating a specific percentage or number of new social housing builds that are fully wheelchair accessible.</p>  <p>  New buildings and extensions or material alterations to existing buildings must comply with the legal minimum performance standards set out in the Building Regulations 1997 - 2017.  In this context, the Building Regulations (Part M Amendment) Regulations 2010, and the accompanying Technical Guidance Document M &ndash; Access and Use (2010), which came into effect on 1 January 2012, set out the minimum statutory requirements that a building must achieve in respect of access. The TGDs are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at www.housing.gov.ie/housing/building-standards/tgd-part-d-materials-and-workmanship/technical-guidance-documents.</p>  <p>  The requirements of Part M aim to ensure that regardless of age, size or disability: </p>  <p>  -  new buildings other than dwellings are accessible and usable;</p>  <p>  -  extensions to existing buildings other than dwellings are, where practicable, accessible and useable;</p>  <p>  -  material alterations to existing buildings other than dwellings increase the accessibility and usability of existing buildings, where practicable;</p>  <p>  -  certain changes of use to existing buildings other than dwellings increase the accessibility and usability of existing buildings where practicable; and</p>  <p>  -  new dwellings are visitable.</p>  <p>  Part M of the Building Regulations aims to foster an inclusive approach to the design and construction of the built environment.  While the Part M requirements may be regarded as a statutory minimum level of provision, the accompanying technical guidance encourages building owners and designers to have regard to the design philosophy of universal design and to consider making additional provisions, where practicable and appropriate.</p>  <p>  Guidance on how to design, build and manage buildings and spaces so that they can be readily accessed and used by everyone, regardless of age, size, ability or disability  is available in 'Building for Everyone, A Universal Design Approach' , a National Disability Authority(NDA) publication , which may be accessed at www.nda.ie.</p></reply>

My Department stands ready to support such initiatives, subject to observance of all the normal value-for-money, procurement and wider legal aspects.</p><p>The current legal situation is that no local authority can compel owners of private land to hand over specified numbers of social houses through the development plan process, over and above the requirements of Part V of the Planning Act, or set objectives for delivery of same without the relevant costs and their attribution being agreed and determined through the appropriate processes.  It is therefore for the relevant parties using the array of social housing delivery mechanisms supported by my Department, including capital and current funded programmes delivered through the local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies, to realise the potential for this site, including enhanced social housing delivery.</p><p>I remain confident that a resolution will be reached in the short term to pave the way for the development of Poolbeg West SDZ in a manner which realises the much needed housing mix that it promises to deliver. Whatever the result of the hearing currently underway, I have assured the local community of my continued commitment to delivering the commitments regarding social and affordable housing that have been agreed.</p><p>As regards the release of records held by my Department in relation to the SDZ, as indicated above some of these are already publicly available as part of the process leading to the adoption of the SDZ planning scheme and, of course, my Department is a public body subject to the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act. </p></reply>
