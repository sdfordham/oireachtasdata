This projection is based on the HSE&rsquo;s analysis of recent trends and the impact of budgetary decisions.</p><p>  The medical card scheme is a demand led scheme. Persons who currently do not hold a medical card could become eligible due a change in circumstances either on a means or a discretionary basis. </p><p>  All medical card and GP visit card holders are subject to a periodic review to determine continuing eligibility.  The HSE will conduct reviews of eligibility in a risk-assessed manner in relation to approximately one million medical card holders during 2014. It is challenging to project precisely the potential changes in numbers eligible as the granting and retention of a medical card or GP visit card is subject to individual assessment and review which can result in renewal, change or removal of eligibility.</p><p>  As a consequence  of the multiplicity and complexity of factors, it is not possible to estimate the number of medical cards that may be awarded on a discretionary basis. </p></reply>

The Government's vision for primary care is the development of a single-tier system where access is based on medical need and not on ability to pay.</p><p>  As announced in the Budget, the Government has decided to commence the roll-out of universal GP services by providing all children under six years with access to a GP service without fees.  The Health (General Practitioner Service) Bill 2014 which will give effect to this initiative was published on 23 April 2014.  It is expected that the Bill will commence passage through this House in the next few weeks.</p><p>  The introduction of this service also requires a new contractual framework to be put in place between the HSE and individual general practitioners.  In this regard, a draft contract is currently the subject of a consultation process and over 250 submissions have been received. </p><p>  It has been well documented that there has been some negative reaction to the draft contract; however, I am pleased that the Irish Medical Organisation (IMO), the primary representative body for general practitioners, is supportive of Government policy to introduce GP care free at the point of access, albeit conditional on the provision of adequate resources and full and meaningful negotiations.</p><p>  I assured the IMO, when I addressed their national GP meeting on 26 April, that the Department and the HSE are fully prepared to engage meaningfully with them and are prepared to negotiate with them on all aspects of the scope and content of the proposed contract.  I have also explained that there will be an opportunity for input from the IMO on the fee structure.  I invited them to meet me along with officials from the Department and the HSE on a without prejudice basis to explore a potential framework for engagement.</p><p>  I am pleased to inform the House that the IMO accepted this invitation and we had a useful meeting on Friday last.  We have agreed to reconvene for further discussions this afternoon.</p><p>  I am confident that a process of open discussion has the potential to significantly enhance the draft contract for patients, GPs, the HSE and the Department, thus helping to progress our common goal of free GP care at the point of access.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-05-14a.20.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014051400069#WRA01900"><p>The Special Delivery Unit continues to support front line staff in our hospitals to make significant progress including at University Hospital Galway and all across the West North West Hospital Group, although significant challenges remain.  The SDU can confirm that:</p><p>- Each site has a documented unscheduled care improvement plan which is continually reviewed and updated;</p><p>- Key areas of system performance have been identified and are being progressed;</p><p>- Each plan involves a &lsquo;whole system&rsquo; approach, addressing review of referrals to the hospital, patient progress through the hospital and supports required to facilitate discharge; and</p><p>- The plans support the implementation of the National Clinical Programmes.</p><p>SDU officers regularly visit each hospital in this Group to ensure that appropriate performance improvement plans are being actively implemented.  In respect of unscheduled care, the overall goal is to ensure that each hospital meets the Government access target for Hospital &lsquo;Patient Experience Time&rsquo; (PET), which measures the time from arrival at the ED to departure.  95% of patients should have left the ED within 6 hours of arrival and 100% of patients should have departed within 9 hours of arrival.  Nationally, 65% of patients are seen within the 6 hour target and 79% of patients within the 9 hour target.  It should be noted that Mayo and Portiuncula Hospitals are among the highest performers in the country; in the latest national report Portiuncula was one of the only hospitals to meet the 9 hour target, with a 100% performance - which should be commended.  The SDU also continues to work with the West North West Hospital Group to improve its management of inpatient and day case waiting lists.</p><p><b><i>Letterkenny General Hospital</i></b></p><p>Letterkenny has traditionally been amongst the best performing hospitals in the country in terms of ED waiting times. In large part due to extraordinary circumstances arising from the flooding Letterkenny's waiting times in ED have deteriorated.</p><p>The following commentary summarises the key information for each site, including PET times.  </p><p><b>Table 1 &ndash; INMO Trolleys figures at 02/05/2014 &ndash; 30 Day Moving Average and Year to Date</b><table><tr><th>Hospital</th><th>30 DMA 2014</th><th>30DMA 2013</th><th>30 DMA %<br /><br />Change</th><th>YTD 2014</th><th>YTD 2013</th><th>YTD <br /><br />% Change </th></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td><div>15</div></td><td><div>17</div></td><td><div>-11.8%</div></td><td><div>1361</div></td><td><div>1435</div></td><td><div>-5.2%</div></td></tr><tr><td>Letterkenny</td><td><div>11</div></td><td><div>5</div></td><td><div>120%</div></td><td><div>671</div></td><td><div>297</div></td><td><div>125.9%</div></td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td><div>9</div></td><td><div>11</div></td><td><div>-18.2%</div></td><td><div>908</div></td><td><div>838</div></td><td><div>8.4%</div></td></tr><tr><td>Portiuncula</td><td><div>2</div></td><td><div>6</div></td><td><div>-66.7%</div></td><td><div>290</div></td><td><div>543</div></td><td><div>-46.6%</div></td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td><div>8</div></td><td><div>7</div></td><td><div>14.3%</div></td><td><div>804</div></td><td><div>474</div></td><td><div>69.6%</div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-05-14a.26.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014051400070#WRB00600"><p>I would like to thank the Deputy for her question. As I have not introduced any measures on the area to date, I assume the Deputy is referring to the recent announcement by the Health Service Executive that the use of e-cigarettes will no longer be permitted in any of its facilities or campuses. The ban commenced on 1 May, as part of the HSE&rsquo;s Tobacco Free Campus policy, which, in line with Tobacco Free Ireland, our national policy, aims to denormalise smoking and to protect the health of staff and patients.</p><p>The HSE has told me that the decision was taken because e-cigarettes pose a challenge to smoke-free campus enforcement and come with safety concerns for a healthcare environment. Taking into consideration the practical issues, the HSE has decided that e-cigarettes should be prohibited on campuses in the same way as tobacco products. However, the Executive has committed to reviewing this policy as new evidence becomes available.</p><p>Contrary to the Deputy&rsquo;s statement regarding smoking cessation aids, the majority of e-cigarettes are not presented by their manufacturers as a smoking cessation aid, and they are therefore not licensed as such.</p><p>A World Health Organisation Study Group Report concluded that the safety and extent of nicotine uptake from e-cigarettes has not been established and that not enough scientific evidence existed to validate the claim that the products were smoking cessation aids.  The Report also notes that the delivery of nicotine to the lung might be dangerous and that it was of global importance to address lung delivery in scientific studies.  Further research and clinical trials were recommended.</p><p>The European Tobacco Products Directive, which will come into force later this month, provide for the regulation of e-cigarettes.  The Tobacco Directive will:</p><p>- set mandatory safety and quality requirements e.g. on nicotine content, ingredients and devices, as well as refill mechanisms etc., for e-cigarettes,</p><p>- make health warnings and information leaflets obligatory,</p><p>- introduce notification requirements for manufacturers and importers of e-cigarettes</p><p>- impose stricter rules on advertising and monitoring of market developments.</p><p>In addition, it is my intention to introduce further regulation on e-cigarettes in the near future.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-05-14a.32.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014051400070#WRB01200"><p>The provisions of the European Working Time Directive (EWTD) encompass a number of measures to protect workers welfare and safety, including a maximum 48 hour working week - averaged over a reference period, daily and weekly rest periods and the granting of compensatory rest where the working day exceeds 13 hours. Under the Directive, the 48 hour average working week became a requirement for NCHDs  with effect from 1 August 2009. The Directive has been fully transposed into Irish law.</p><p>  I have emphasised to the HSE the importance of achieving EWTD compliance as soon as possible. The HSE has been working intensively to advance implementation of the Directive in respect of NCHDs and considerable progress has been made over the last 12 months. HSE data shows that average working hours for NCHDs in 2009 was 60 hours a week, 54 hours per week in 2012 and 51.4 hours in the second half of 2013.</p><p>  Intensive negotiations conducted at the Labour Relations Commission in September and October resulted in agreement on a joint approach, involving hospital management, the IMO and NCHDs to achieve EWTD compliance. The agreement focused in particular on steps to be taken in the period up to the NCHD rotation on 13 January 2014 to eliminate shifts in excess of 24 hours. In January and February this year progress made by acute hospitals on achieving compliance with the agreed maximum 24 hour shift target was assessed. That assessment showed that the majority of hospitals had made significant progress with over 90% compliance. Fines were imposed on 10 hospitals in March where progress was deemed unsatisfactory.</p><p>  NCHD recruitment and retention is required in order to facilitate the achievement of EWTD compliance. Achievement of full compliance will also require reorganisation of the delivery of certain services within Hospital Groups. The number of NCHDs in the public health system has increased by over 200 in recent years and now exceeds 4,900. However, there are international shortages of NCHDs in certain categories and specialties. There are also some hospitals to which it has been difficult to attract NCHDS, for a range of reasons including training opportunities and rural location. Where feasible consultant recruitment is being pursued as an alternative to the use of NCHDs.</p><p>  I set up the MacCraith Group to undertake a Strategic Review of Medical Training and Career structure last summer. Its work will support the attainment of EWTD compliance. The Group is to make recommendations aimed at improving the retention of medical graduates in the public health system, planning for future service needs and achieving the maximum benefit from investment in medical education and training.  It provided an Interim Report in December 2013 focusing on training and last month provided a further report covering career structures and pathways following training. The Group is to provide a final report, encompassing workforce planning, by the end of June 2014.</p></reply>

Under the legislation, having a particular illness or disability, in itself, does not establish eligibility for a medical card. </p><p>  All applications or reviews concerning medical and GP visit cards must be supported with a range of documentation.  This requirement is clearly outlined on the relevant forms and where such supporting documentation is not supplied, or is incomplete, the HSE will issue correspondence to the applicant, specifying the additional information required.</p><p>  All medical card and GP visit card holders are subject to a periodic review to determine continuing eligibility.  The HSE has a very structured review process and makes every effort to ensure on-going engagement with clients during this process. If the HSE is made aware that a person has special needs, assistance will be afforded to help that person complete the application whether at application stage or at review stage. The local health office can be contacted or LoCall 1890 252 919 to request this assistance.</p><p>  The HSE also makes every effort to provide a person with sufficient time to renew their eligibility. Each month, the HSE identifies those medical/GP visit cards that are scheduled for review within three months. The HSE has increased this notification time to four months in respect of those clients who were granted eligibility on the basis of discretion. This is to allow an additional month to ensure that all pertinent medical and other data is provided for inclusion in the assessment process. </p><p>  Persons are requested to return their completed review forms at least one month in advance of the due expiry date of their existing card. This is to allow the HSE sufficient time to carry out the review and/or to get back to the individuals, if the application is incomplete or requires any further details to be furnished. </p><p>  Where a review form is returned, but not fully completed by the expiry date, it is HSE policy to extend the eligibility of the client for a reasonable period of time until the review is carried out.   Medical card holders who genuinely engage with the HSE will not have their eligibility withdrawn before that review is complete. </p><p>  Where an applicant indicates on their review application that medical evidence has been previously submitted relating to a life-long medical condition, and this has been confirmed by the HSE, the HSE will not request further medical evidence in this regard. The applicant will, however, be required to submit all other up-to-date information material to a review assessment.</p><p>  Eligibility for a medical card only exists for so long as a person continues to meet the criteria set out in the Health Act. The HSE has an obligation to take measures to ensure that the medical card register is as accurate as possible.  One recognised auditing practice, which the HSE now carries out, is to undertake random reviews. The selection criteria on which such random reviews occur varies from time-to-time.  </p><p>  All card holders - irrespective of the basis on which the card was awarded &ndash; may be subject to a periodic review of eligibility.  Each medical card or a GP visit card includes a &ldquo;valid to&rdquo; date.  Notwithstanding the date printed on the card, the HSE reserves the right to review eligibility, at any time.</p><p>  GPs are advised three months in advance of the review dates of their patients&rsquo; GP visit cards/medical cards and, subsequently, the following month and the month after that, if the patient has not returned the review form by that time.   GPs have full electronic visibility of their medical card panel of patients and have the facility to allow temporary extension of eligibility for expiring cards where a sensitive renewal is appropriate. The temporary extension may also be allowed where they are aware that a person is still availing of services but there may be something that prevents them from carrying out a standard review.  </p><p>  Given that over 40% of the population, or about 2 million people, qualify for a medical card or GP visit card, the scale of the administration of the GMS scheme is significant. Over 700,000 individuals were assessed by the HSE in 2013. Well in excess of 95% of applications were processed within the target of 15 working days. </p></reply>

Price setting  for these products is likely to happen closer to the implementation date. The State will subsidise or partially subsidise the cost of insurance for individuals who qualify on income grounds. The price of UHI insurance policies will of course be influenced by policy decisions in relation to the package of services to be covered under UHI and the regulatory structures which will be put in place. In addition, I believe that reforms,  including the establishment of the Healthcare Pricing Office, the ongoing rollout of the Money Follows the Patient funding system and the successful implementation of the purchaser/provider split will have a positive impact on the cost of insurance policies under UHI.</p><p>  While the exact cost of insurance premiums for individuals will not be known until nearer the implementation date I have initiated a major costing exercise to estimate the likely cost of UHI both for the State and individuals and households. This a complex exercise which requires expert analytical support and input from a number of State agencies. I expect to have initial results from this exercise early in 2015.</p></reply>

The changes also provided for those over 70's medical card holders, whose income fell between the revised income limits and the preceding income limits, to  receive a GP visit card instead of a medical card in order to ensure that persons retained access to their GP. The income limits were set at &euro;600 per week for a single person and &euro;1,200 per week for a couple for an over -70s medical card and &euro;700 per week and &euro;1,400 per week, respectively,  for an  over-70s GP visit card. </p><p>  Changes announced under Budget 2014,  reducing the gross income limit for an over-70s medical card to &euro;500 per week for a single person and &euro;900 per for a couple, came into effect on 1st January 2014. It was estimated that this Budget 2014 change would affect about 35,000 out of a total of 350,000 over-70s medical card holders. The income limits for the over-70s GP visit card were not adjusted, in order to ensure that these persons retained access to their GP. </p><p>  In 2014, the HSE has written to about 53,000 over-70s persons advising them that their eligibility for a medical card is under review in line with the new income limits, based on data from the Department of Social Protection and the Revenue Commissioners. As recipients of review correspondence have a number of months in which to respond, the results from these reviews not yet available. </p><p>  It is not possible to project precisely potential card changes as the granting and retention of a medical card or GP visit card for a person over 70 years of age is subject to an individual assessment and review process in accordance with the guidelines.  A review of existing card holders can result in renewal, change or removal of eligibility as a result.</p></reply>

The increase in nursing hours available under the HRA equates to nearly 1,400 additional nurses.  Nearly 500 nurses and midwives have commenced employment in recent months on the graduate scheme, with over 200 others currently going through the recruitment process.  It is important also to note the link between nursing qualifications and safety and to recognise that nurse education levels are also linked to patient outcomes. The recent Lancet study showed that a 10% increase in the proportion of nurses holding a nursing degree is associated with a 7% decrease in the risk of death.  Ireland has invested significantly in nurse education since the Commission on Nursing in 1998. Approximately &euro;55 million is spent annually on nurses education and around 1,570 nurses enter the undergraduate programme each year. </p><p>  It has been necessary to reduce the numbers of staff employed in the public health service, including nursing, in order to contain health service costs. However, I recognise that there is a balance to be struck to meet both economic requirements and patient safety requirements. It is imperative that patient safety continues to be maintained in the context of these reductions and achieving this requires that relevant expertise is applied to the decision making process. It is for this reason that I have approved the establishment of a taskforce to develop a framework that will determine the staffing and skill mix requirements for the nursing workforce in a range of major specialities. The focus will be on the development of staffing and skill mix ranges which take account of a number of influencing factors. The taskforce will be chaired by the Chief Nursing Officer.</p></reply>

The Scheme covers the cost of the standard components of residential care which are:</p><p>- nursing and personal care appropriate to the level of care needs of the person,</p><p>- bed and board,</p><p>- basic aids and appliances necessary to assist a person with the activities of daily living, and</p><p>- laundry service.</p><p>In determining the services covered by the Scheme, it was considered very important that nursing home residents and taxpayers would be protected and would not end up paying for the same services twice.  For this reason, goods and services that are already available to individuals under an existing scheme are not covered by the Scheme.</p><p>A person's eligibility for other schemes, such as the Medical Card Scheme or the Drugs Payment Scheme, is unaffected by  participation in the Nursing Homes Support Scheme or residence in a nursing home.  Incontinence wear, where required, is provided free of charge by the HSE to all Nursing Homes Support Scheme residents that possess a Medical Card.  Individuals availing of the Scheme should not be charged any additional fee over and above the contribution which has been calculated by the HSE, except where they choose to obtain additional services over and above long-term residential care services.</p><p>Part 8 of the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2009, stipulates that the registered provider of the nursing home must agree a contract with each resident within one month of their admission.  This contract must include details of the services to be provided to that resident and the fees to be charged. Residents should not be charged fees which are not set out in the contract.  The HSE is not party to such contracts which are concluded between each resident and their nursing home.</p><p>The Nursing Homes Support Scheme is currently the subject of a review.  The terms of reference of this review are as follows:-</p><p>Taking account of Government policy, demographic trends and the fiscal situation</p><p>1. To examine the on-going sustainability of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme;</p><p>2 . To examine the overall cost of long-term residential care in public and private nursing homes and the effectiveness of the current methods of negotiating/setting prices;</p><p>3. Having regard to 1 and 2 above, to consider the balance of funding between long-term residential care and community based services;</p><p>4.  To consider the extension of the scheme to community based services and to other sectors (Disability and Mental Health);</p><p>5.  To make recommendations for the future operation and management of the Scheme.</p><p>Work on the Review is ongoing.  It is expected that the Review will be completed in the coming months and the Report will then be made publicly available.</p></reply>

Rather, it is attributable, in the main, to the fact that many people, who previously were marginally over the qualifying means thresholds, have subsequently been granted medical cards because they now fall under those means thresholds.  Of the discretionary cards in circulation in 2011, less than one-tenth have been found to be ineligible for a medical card on review.  </p><p>  Minister Reilly and I are conscious of the difficulties faced by the relatively small number of people who have been found to be ineligible.  At his request the HSE is currently examining how individuals, who are not entitled to a medical card, could still receive services that meet their needs.  This examination relates to all of the services and supports provided by the HSE and with regard to as much flexibility as is available and at a local level.  In addition, additional information will be provided and local information points will be established at major health centres around the country, where members of the public can obtain comprehensive information and support in accessing their full range of supports and entitlements from the Health Services. The objective is to maximise the supports available for patients and families. </p><p>  Appropriate notice is also being considered as part of this review for existing medical card holders who may no longer be eligible on renewal - but where serious medical conditions or profound disability continues to exist in the household.</p><p>  The clear intention is to maximise the supports that can be provided in each case to the fullest extent possible.  The HSE is seeking to find the best way to achieve this in order to ensure families will receive the support they need. </p></reply>

The Strategy will incorporate a review and evaluation of current services and therefore provide us with the opportunity to take stock of current services and identify how the quality and safety of care provided to women and their babies can be further improved.

Patient Experience Time (PET) refers to the length of time a patient spends in an ED from the time they are registered to the time they depart to, for example, home, an in-patient bed, or to an AMU, etc. </p><p>The Key Performance Indicator (KPI) identified in respect of unscheduled care in the HSE Service Plan is that 95% of Patients will have departed the ED within 6 hours of admission and 100% will have departed within 9 hours.  Nationally, in April 2014 67.5% of patients attending Emergency Departments were discharged home or admitted within 6 hours and 81.8% of patients attending Emergency Departments were discharged home or admitted within 9 hours.  The following table reflects the Patient Experience Time (PET) performance for patients attending the ED at Waterford Regional Hospital.<table><tr><th>Patient Experience Time</th><th>6 Hours</th><th>9 Hours</th></tr><tr><td>National Target</td><td>95%</td><td>100%</td></tr><tr><td>WRH -March 2013</td><td>73%</td><td>81.6%</td></tr><tr><td>WRH - March 2014</td><td>76%</td><td>81%</td></tr><tr><td>WRH -April 2014</td><td>78%</td><td>90%</td></tr></table></p><p>The Deputy may wish to note that Waterford Regional Hospital is working to achieve the national targets, and PET performance times at the Hospital are currently above the national average.</p></reply>

However, I am aware that some hospitals are having difficulties in filling certain consultant posts.  Last July I established a working group, chaired by Professor Brian MacCraith, to carry out a strategic review of medical training and career structure aimed, inter alia, at improving graduate retention in the public health system and planning for future service needs.</p><p>  To date, that working group has issued two reports.  The first report submitted in December focused on improving the training experience for trainees. The second report submitted to me at the end of April reviewed career structures and pathways following completion of specialist training.  A key recommendation is that health service management and medical organisations should commence, as a matter of urgency, an industrial relations engagement of short duration to address the barrier caused by the variation in pay rates between new entrant consultants and their established peers that have emerged since 2012.  This issue has been identified as being important in the recruitment of consultants.  It is anticipated that negotiations will begin shortly under the aegis of the Labour Relations Commission and aim to conclude by July.  The final report of the Group  is due to be submitted by the end of June.</p><p>  As the specific case raised by the Deputy is an operational matter it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.  Where recruitment difficulties arise agency and locum staff are typically used to ensure service provision.</p></reply>

Tax is not deducted 'at source' by the Department of Social Protection (DSP) on these payments.  Instead, the Revenue Commissioners receive the payment details from the DSP to enable the taxpayer's annual tax credits to be reduced to take into account the maternity benefit.  Thus individuals who pay their tax through the PAYE system, have their annual tax credits and standard rate cut-off point reduced by the amount of the maternity benefit payment they receive.  Employers are then advised of these changes and they arrange to deduct the additional tax required over the remainder of the tax year.</p><p>  The taxpayer in question was in receipt of maternity benefit from the Department of Social Protection and received a total of &euro;2,270.61 between 1 January and 6 March 2014.  Due to a technical error in Revenue, her employer received an incorrect tax credit certificate which the employer operated from the date the taxpayer recommenced work.  This had the effect of the employer deducting too much tax from the taxpayer.  Revenue has issued a corrected tax credit certificate and Revenue has been advised by the employer that her tax position will be corrected in her salary at the earliest opportunity.

This strategy will also underpin Budget 2015.</p><p>  As the Deputy may be aware, there a number of supports available for single parents both in the tax system and on the expenditure side.  For example, in the tax system there is the Single Person Child Carer Tax Credit.  The Department of Social Protection have a number of supports available for single parents such as Child Benefit, Family Income Supplement and the One-Parent Family Payment.  In addition, there are also a number supports available to students which are generally based on their parent's income such as the student support and maintenance grants and the Student Assistance Fund.</p></reply>

The legislation will ensure the protection of the CCMA or any replacement code in the future will continue to apply to mortgages which are sold to unregulated financial service providers.</p><p>  In  the interim the Government has always been clear that we fully expected that any purchaser of the IBRC mortgage portfolio would service the loan books in accordance with the CCMA.  The two purchasers of the residential mortgage loans to date, Loanstar and Oaktree, have both committed to servicing these books in accordance with the terms of the Central Bank's code of conduct on mortgage arrears, CCMA.  As the Deputy will be aware the Special Liquidators are legally obliged to oversee the liquidation of IBRC for the benefit of all creditors of the bank including the State.  As such I am not in a position to interfere in the sales process undertaken by the Special Liquidators as to do so would erode value for the creditors of IBRC including the State and the Irish taxpayer and it could leave the me open to legal challenges from other creditors.  In such circumstances it would not be appropriate for me to meet with individual borrowers of the bank.</p></reply>

This gives schools greater autonomy to determine how they deploy their teaching resources across the competing needs of the school. The surveys quoted by the Deputy focused on guidance counsellors and in particular on the time spent by them, in a one to one setting, giving career guidance and student counselling. It is important to note that guidance is a whole school activity and it does not just involve the guidance counsellor, therefore the implications of the survey are limited and taken predominantly from the Guidance Counsellors' perspective and less from a whole school perspective.</p><p>  The representative organisations for School Principals and school management developed a framework that assists schools on how best to manage the provision of guidance from within their staffing allocation. Wherever possible, group work and class based activity should be used to maximise the amount of time available for those pupils that are in most need of one to one support when and where necessary.</p><p>  While the school's guidance planning should involve and, where appropriate, be led by the guidance counsellor(s) in the first instance,  other members of school staff and management also have key roles to play. Parents and students must be seen as an essential part of the process. Through this process schools can, for example, consider the following options for maximising the use of their available resources for the provision of guidance:</p><p>- Optimise the delivery of personal educational, career and vocational guidance in class group settings</p><p>- Enable students to use directly the extensive range of guidance tools available through the internet from relevant websites (e.g. Qualifax, Careers Portal) </p><p>- Enable some of the curriculum elements of the planned guidance programme to be delivered through other teachers such as SPHE staff</p><p>- Maximise the role of the pastoral care team in schools</p><p>- Ensure that the guidance counsellor has 1:1 time towards meeting the counselling needs of students experiencing difficulties or crisis, and </p><p>- Refer students with particular difficulties to outside experts who are specialists in particular relevant areas</p><p>I am confident schools act in the best interest of students when determining how best to use the teaching resources available to them.</p></reply>

As the Deputy will be aware, the over-riding objective of Education capital expenditure is to meet the demographic challenge facing the education system, whereby total pupil enrolment in both primary and post-primary schools is expected to grow by around 107,000 additional pupils between 2012 and 2019 - over 70,000 at primary level and over 35,000 at post primary - and will continue to rise at post primary level to the year 2026, at least. A priority therefore for my Department is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places. My Department is not in a position to develop one school where this may negatively impact on other schools in the area.</p><p>  In the case of Sligo. it is projected that whilst overall pupil numbers across the 13 schools in the Sligo catchment area will be relatively stable up to 2019, it is anticipated that overall pupil enrolment numbers will decline thereafter. In terms of school accommodation, there is sufficient capacity available within existing schools to cater for the demand for school places. In that regard, an additional 8 classrooms catering for up to 224 pupils in the case of the school, in question, has the potential to have a significant impact on other schools in the same catchment area.  In light of the above, the school authority has been advised that my Department is not in a position to accede to the school's request in respect of an additional class of junior infants in September 2014.</p><p>  However to assess further the pupil enrolment trends in the Sligo area including information on school pre-enrolments for the 2014/2015 academic year, my Department will be contacting the Patron and school authorities of the 13 primary schools in the Sligo area. When this data has been obtained and reviewed, my Department will communicate further with the Patron and school authority in question.</p></reply>

CPD will be provided on a rolling basis as each new subject specification is implemented, throughout the duration of the implementation phases of A Framework for Junior Cycle.  A minimum of 4.5 days CPD will be available to all teachers of English and a minimum of 4 days CPD will be available to teachers of all other subjects.  Additional supplementary CPD in particular areas of interest will also be made available e.g. workshops on teaching film and drama for teachers of English. </p><p>  All schools will also have one day whole-school in-service per year for each year of the roll-out of the JCSA and approval is given for schools to close, subject to Board of Management approval, to facilitate this CPD for all staff.  The website www.juniorcycle.ie  is a collaboration between the NCCA and JCT and is an integral part of the support structures for schools and hosts information and materials aimed at supporting the implementation of the reformed Junior Cycle in schools.  The Government is investing heavily in measures to support teachers and schools as they implement the Junior Cycle Framework with up to &euro;4.8m being made available in 2014.  Actual expenditure for the year depends on a range of factors including level of attendance at CPD and uptake of substitution and so on. </p></reply>

The system that developed over the last eighty years had become unwieldy and complex and was no longer fit for purpose. Indeed, there was universal acceptance of the need for a root-and-branch reform of the existing structures.</p><p>My objective is to deliver a world-class workplace relations service which is simple to use, independent, effective, impartial, cost effective and provides for workable means of redress and enforcement, within a reasonable period of time.</p><p>A new two-tier Workplace Relations structure will be established comprising two statutorily independent bodies replacing the current five. We will have a new single body of first instance to be called the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) and a separate appeals body, which will effectively be an expanded Labour Court. </p><p>A significant amount of work has been completed on the preparation of the legislation which will give statutory effect to the new structures and associated processes. The Draft Scheme of the Workplace Relations Bill has been approved by Government for priority drafting. The Office of the Parliamentary Counsel has assigned resources to ensure the earliest possible publication of the Bill and drafting is at an advanced stage. I intend to publish the Bill during the current Spring/Summer Dail session with a view to having the new structures in place during 2014.</p><p>The legislation will provide for the services of the Equality Tribunal, the National Employment Rights Authority, the Labour Relations Commission and the first instance functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT) to come together under the remit of the Workplace Relations Commission.  The appellate functions of the EAT will be amalgamated into a reconfigured Labour Court.</p><p>Significant progress has also been achieved to date, in advance of the enabling legislation, insofar as the technological, structural, administrative and staffing changes required to underpin the Workplace Relations Reform Programme are concerned, including the following measures which have already been put in place:</p><p>-  Transfer of the Equality Tribunal into my Department to be part of the WRC,</p><p>-  Establishment of a Single Contact Portal (Workplace Relations Customer Service),</p><p>-  Launch of a single Workplace Relations Complaint Form and e-complaint facility, </p><p>-  Finalisation of a Staffing and Structures Plan, </p><p>-  Design and launch of a single Workplace Relations website, </p><p>-  Design and launch of a Single Adjudication and Appeals Decisions Database,</p><p>-  Establishment of an Early Resolution Service, </p><p>-  Finalisation of Adjudicator training and recruitment plans, and </p><p>-  Implementation of enhanced technologies and business processes, including the completion of the procurement phase in relation to the design and commissioning of a Customer Relationship Management Solution.  </p></reply>

The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer. There are currently approximately 77,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;344 million for 2014.   The Department continues to monitor trends in the private rental market to determine the impact on rent supplement recipients.  Following the most recent review of the private rental market revised maximum rent limits were introduced from Monday 17 June 2013 until 31 December 2014. Despite the overall pressures on the social protection budget, there were increases in the rent limits in Dublin, Galway, North Kildare and Bray areas.  </p><p>Any further changes to the rent limits would have to be considered in a budgetary context. A full rent limit review will be commenced shortly and will be completed in time to feed into the budgetary process.  </p><p>All prospective tenants, including those seeking to access rent supplement, are now finding it increasingly difficult to secure appropriate accommodation due to the reduced availability of rental properties. The market shows no sign of stabilising and increasing the maximum rent limits for rent supplement will not resolve the current difficulties, due to the reduced level of supply, and would result in further increases in rental costs for all persons renting including those on reduced incomes and students.  </p><p>The Community Welfare Services, including through its work in the Homeless Persons Unit and the Asylum Seekers &amp;amp; New Communities Unit, works closely with local authorities and other stakeholders to facilitate homeless persons to access private rented accommodation. This ensures that where possible, people are diverted away from homeless services and towards community-based supports.  Department officials have discretionary powers to award a supplement where it appears that the circumstances of the case so warrant and is of an exceptional nature.</p><p>In addition and in view of the current supply difficulties,<b></b>the Dublin local authorities are currently engaging with the Department in finalising a further interagency intervention system to identify vulnerable families who are in receipt of rent supplement and at risk of becoming homeless due to the imminent loss of their tenancy to ensure that the necessary supports can be put in place.  These cases will be assessed on an individual basis having regard to the individual circumstances and families requiring additional support will receive the necessary assistance, financial or otherwise. </p><p>The Department is represented on the Homelessness Implementation Team, chaired by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, which will ensure greater integration between the key agencies involved in the area of homelessness as recommended by the First Report of the Homelessness Oversight Group. </p><p>The Department&rsquo;s strategic policy direction is to return rent supplement to its original purpose of a short term income support. In July 2013 the Government approved the introduction of the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP). Under HAP, responsibility for recipients of rent supplement with a long-term housing need will transfer from the Department of Social Protection to local authorities. Officials in the Department are working closely with those in the lead Department of Environment, Community and Local Government, in piloting HAP in Limerick City and County Council with further roll out to a further six selected local authorities during the year. </p></reply>

FIS is designed to prevent child and family poverty and to offer a financial incentive to take-up employment as compared to social welfare payments.   Expenditure on FIS for 2014 is estimated to be of the order of &euro;280 million and it is currently paid to some 44,000 families in respect of some 97,000 children.</p><p>  A unique feature of FIS is that once the level of payment is determined, it continues to be payable at that rate for a period of 52 weeks, provided that the recipient remains in full-time employment, and regardless of whether there is a change in their financial circumstances, eg due to increase (or decrease) of earnings. The advantage of this feature is that recipients can be certain that they will receive a guaranteed level of income support throughout the 52 week period. This certainty is important to the success of the scheme as it provides a real incentive to workers with families to maximise their earnings opportunities. For those who experience a reduction in their earnings over the course of the year, the rate of payment will be reassessed at the end of the 52 weeks upon renewal of their FIS claim.</p><p>  There are two changes in circumstances in which the FIS payment can be revised during the year:</p><p>-   If a recipient starts to care for an additional child in the course of the 52 weeks. </p><p>-   If a recipient is getting a one-parent family payment and the payment is stopped because their youngest child reached the relevant age limit.</p><p>  The tax and social protection systems have an important part to play in creating jobs and reducing unemployment, which are the key challenges facing the Government. To this end, I established an Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare to harness expert opinion and experience on cost-effective proposals for improving employment incentives and poverty outcomes. The Group is currently examining working age supports, including FIS. I expect to receive the report of the Advisory Group in the coming months and look forward to considering its recommendations in relation to FIS and other in-work supports. </p></reply>

The terms of reference for this group were to review the current range of youth employment services in Ireland, to assess what measures are appropriate to deliver the Youth Guarantee in Ireland and to develop the implementation plan for approval of Government and transmission to the EU. </p><p>  In addition, in order to get non-governmental input into the Youth Guarantee implementation plan the Department of Social Protection held a YG stakeholders&rsquo; consultation forum in October.  The DSP invited further submissions from the bodies that attended.</p><p>  A number of submissions were received, including submissions from The National Youth Council of Ireland, Spunout.ie, Youthwork Ireland, Tipperary Regional Youth Service, Wexford Youth Action and the YMCA. These submissions will be taken into consideration during the rollout of the Youth Guarantee Process.</p><p>  In addition the Department retained the OECD to provide input and advice on the framing of the plan (the OECD is also providing assistance to a number of other countries).  As part of this process a delegation from the OECD met with stakeholders at the aforementioned forum as well as with a range of relevant public bodies.  Ultimately stakeholder feedback via the forum, submissions and bilateral meetings with the OECD has fed into the design of the national YG implementation plan. </p><p>  The Youth Guarantee Implementation plan specifically states that the National Youth Council of Ireland (NYCI) along with other national partners will be invited to participate in the delivery and/or review of the Youth Guarantee. </p><p>  The Ballymun Pilot Youth Guarantee scheme has strong involvement from the voluntary youth sector in its implementation.  The youth sector is represented on the both the National Steering Group (National Youth Council of Ireland) and the Local Implementation Group (Ballymun Regional Youth Resource).  The lessons learned from this pilot will feed into the national rollout of the Guarantee.</p><p>  As the Guarantee is rolled out, the specific local arrangements for involvement of partners, including youth organisations will be a matter for divisional and regional management in the Department of Social Protection.  In particular, where there are indications that any significant groups of young people will not be reached by the PES (Intreo office), alternative ways of reaching these young people through Youth Work approaches will be explored.</p></reply>

This will be achieved by providing:</p><p>- a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment, and </p><p>- a State-led intervention for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.</p><p>Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway and in some instances have been accelerated in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services. Commercial operators combined have either invested, or committed to invest, over &euro;2 billion in their Irish networks, delivering high speed broadband to homes and businesses. For example:</p><p>- Eircom is rolling out a &euro;400m investment in a Next Generation Access Fibre Network that offers speeds of up to 100Mbps. Service is already available to over 800,000 addresses, with planned coverage to reach 1.4m addresses by 2016. </p><p>- UPC has invested over &euro;500m in upgrading its cable network. Over 700,000 homes can already access minimum broadband speeds of 120Mbps and up to 200Mbps. Businesses can access speeds of 500Mbps. </p><p>- ESB is engaged in a new project allowing a fibre network to be rolled-out on its existing electricity infrastructure. It is understood that discussions between ESB and Vodafone to form a new Joint Venture Company are at an advanced stage. The company has initial plans to construct a fibre network directly to 450,000 premises outside of Dublin and it is expected that details will be announced over the coming weeks. </p><p>- Mobile operators have launched 4G high speed mobile broadband services following ComReg&rsquo;s multiband spectrum auction. There has also been continued investment by all operators in enhancing and broadening 3G services and network improvements. </p><p>- Fixed wireless operators are continuing to invest in high speed point-to-point wireless broadband. </p><p>- The broadcaster Sky has entered the broadband market, increasing choice for consumers.</p><p>Of the estimated 2.3m premises in Ireland, approximately 1.4m are expected to be served by these commercial next generation broadband services over the coming years. </p><p>This accelerated roll out of high speed services by the commercial sector means that the addressable area required by the State intervention has been reduced by 30% since the National Broadband Plan was launched. While the commercial developments are welcome the acceleration of investment is largely contained to cities and towns. The speeds that are available in these areas are demonstrably better than those that are available in more rural areas. </p><p>On 25 April, I signalled the Government's commitment to a major telecommunications network build-out to rural Ireland, with fibre as the foundation of its investment under the National Broadband Plan. This commitment is a clear expression of Government&rsquo;s determination to address the connectivity challenge in rural Ireland in a meaningful and sustainable way.</p><p>Central to the strategy will be a fibre build-out to locations in every county in the State identified as having no existing or planned enabling fibre network. It is intended that the fibre will be delivered directly to access points for homes and businesses, where service providers can utilise the fibre to provide high speed services to end users. The fibre build-out will also ensure that fibre is deployed to strategic locations on each route such as schools, business hubs and health facilities. The fibre build out will be part of an end-to-end strategy that will address all parts of Ireland that cannot access commercial high speed broadband services.</p><p>I have published a county-by-county list of towns and villages which have already been identified for a fibre build-out. This is an indicative list and is subject to the completion of the comprehensive mapping process currently underway. Further locations may be identified as this process continues. Similarly, it may be determined that some locations on the list will be addressed by the commercial sector and will therefore not require State intervention. Currently I envisage that a total of 39 areas in County Westmeath and 79 areas in County Tipperary will be included in the proposed fibre build-out. The list is available on my Department's website .</p><p>In tandem with the fibre build-out, the Strategy will include measures to respond to aggregated community demand for services, and the provision of access services in the most remote areas where fibre rollout may be insufficient to stimulate commercial investment or may be cost-prohibitive. </p><p>Intensive design work is ongoing in the Department with a view to publishing an end-to-end implementation strategy later this year, together with the outcome of the mapping exercise which will identify the areas that require intervention. A full public consultation will take place once the strategy is published and EU State Aids clearance will be required for the intervention strategy once finalised. It is expected that the detailed procurement process will take place in 2015 with a view to commencing construction of the fibre network and provision of services in the areas that require intervention as quickly as possible. </p><p>The EU Commission&rsquo;s guidelines on state aid for high speed broadband infrastructure preclude member states from intervening in regions in which private investors have demonstrated plans to roll out their own infrastructure within the following three years. In this regard it is noted that at least one network operator has published a programme to roll out 19 fibre-based broadband networks in County Westmeath and 43 such networks in County Tipperary, including Nenagh, by July 2016.</p><p>I fully share the concerns of local representatives about the quality of broadband in rural areas. I intend to ensure that rural Ireland enjoys similar opportunities to urban areas by ensuring an end-to end market intervention with fibre as a core component. In committing to a fibre build-out at the heart of this strategy, the Government is acknowledging that broadband is the key infrastructure of the 21st century.</p></reply>

I would point out that the Local Authority has a strong role to play in facilitating the roll-out of the necessary infrastructure to help enable service availability throughout the Country. In the case of County Kerry, I note that the County Development Plan recommends against siting a mast within 1km of dwellings. I understand that this is contributing to difficulties in providing good quality broadband and telecommunications services generally in the county. </p><p>The Government's National Broadband Plan which I subsequently published, commits to addressing barriers to deployment in order to maximise investment by the commercial sector and assist in enhancing the quality of services.

The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that Irish Water can collect charges from its customers in receipt of water services provided by it. The Act also provides that responsibility for the independent economic regulation of the water sector is assigned to the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and the CER has been given statutory responsibility for protecting the interests of customers. </p><p>  The Government has decided, following consideration of proposals in relation to the funding model for Irish Water and taking account of the work of the Inter-Departmental Working Group, which was established to advise the Government on the appropriate method for addressing affordability issues which may arise with the introduction of domestic water charges, to provide a free allowance of 30,000 litres of water supplied and waste water treated per annum for a primary residence on a public supply. The Government has also decided to provide for an additional free allowance to cover the normal usage of water services by every child in their primary residence based on the same qualifying conditions as child benefit, such that water charges will in effect only apply to adults in such households. The normal consumption is estimated at 38,000 litres annually per child of water supplied and waste water treated and so the allowance being provided will be up to 38,000 litres per annum. This level of consumption will be verified over time thr ough actual data from metering.   </p><p>  The Government has also decided that bills will be capped at the relevant assessed charge level for those customers with particular medical conditions which necessitate high water usage. Qualifying medical conditions will be set out, following consultation with the nister for Health and the Health Services Executive.   </p><p>I intend to use my powers under the Water Services (No.2) Act 2013 to issue a policy direction to the CER in relation to a number of matters relating to domestic water charges. In making its decision on the approval or otherwise of the first water charges plan, the CER will take into account the decisions made by the Government on the funding model for Irish Water and the policy direction issued.     </p><p>  I am not aware of any recommended daily minimum water usage for adults under a European health policy, but the Commission has suggested in a recent communication, that Member States, acting within their competences, should ensure access to a minimum water supply for all citizens, in accordance with World Health Organisation recommendations. The WHO recommendations indicate that 20-25 litres per person per day represents a minimum requirement (i.e. 7,300-9,125 litres per annum).</p></reply>

The Act also provides that the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) will be responsible for the economic regulation of Irish water and the charges to be levied by Irish Water will be subject to the approval of the CER. The CER has already undertaken public consultations on the development of the economic regulatory framework for water services and will be undertaking further consultations during 2014. Water charges will not commence until 1 October 2014 and the first bills will be issued by Irish Water to households from January 2015. </p><p>  Group Water Schemes that are supplied by way of a connection to the public water supply network will now become customers of Irish Water, having previously been customers of the relevant local authority. Group Water Schemes that have their own water sources will not be customers of Irish Water and will continue to operate as before.   </p><p>  My Department will remain responsible for the overall policy and funding, where appropriate, of the non-public water sector, including the group water sector. Over the past decade, substantial improvements have been made in the group water sector, reflected in improved infrastructure and management and leading to greater compliance with drinking water standards. This has been accomplished through a partnership approach between my Department, the local authorities and the group water sector itself, with the important involvement of the National Federation of Group Water Schemes. The co-operative approach will be maintained as the reform of water services provision is progressed.</p></reply>

Similarly, where an estate has not been completed to the standard outlined in the planning permission and the planning authority has not taken enforcement action within seven years of the expiry of the permission authorising the development, section 180 also provides that the planning authority must initiate taking in charge procedures if requested to do so by the owners of the units concerned.   The decision as to whether an estate should be taken in charge is ultimately one for the elected members of the planning authority.</p><p>  Section 180 was amended in the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2010 to provide that a local authority may take in charge an unfinished estate, at the request of the owners of the housing units, at any time after the expiration of the planning permission, in situations where enforcement actions have commenced or where the local authority considers that enforcement action will not result in the satisfactory completion of the estate by the developer. Planning authorities have also been empowered to take in charge part of an estate or some, but not all, of the facilities in an estate.   </p><p>  The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides for the transfer of responsibility for the provision of public water services from local authorities to Irish Water. In addition, it provides a mechanism whereby water services infrastructure may be transferred by Ministerial Order to Irish Water. Contrary to certain misunderstandings that may exist, there is no specific legal impediment to the taking in charge of water services infrastructure by local authorities. The potential to streamline this process for the future is currently under review. </p><p>  In Circular Letter PL 21/13 issued by my Department to planning authorities on 30 December 2013 in the light of the transfer of certain statutory water services functions from local authorities to Irish Water with effect from 1 January 2014, it was stated that legislative amendments to further clarify the existing provisions on the taking in charge of housing estates would be made in 2014. As part of this process, my Department will also consider, in consultation with local authorities, whether it is appropriate to make further amendments to section 180 of the Planning and Development Act in relation to the taking in charge provisions generally in the context of the forthcoming Planning Bill, for instance in relation to the time limits for the taking in charge of estates.</p><p>  In order to clarify the current up-to-date position with regard to the taking in charge of estates, my Department will shortly issue a further circular letter to planning authorities with a view to clearing up any misunderstandings that may exist in this regard.</p><p>  My Department has no responsibility for, or role to play in, the day to day management, maintenance or operation of water or waste water infrastructure. However, it is aware of problems with some water services infrastructure that was provided by developers and which is not connected to the public network. My Department is currently considering what long-term solutions might be appropriate in such cases.</p></reply>

The Water Services Act 2013 provided for the establishment of Irish Water as an independent subsidiary within the Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann Group and assigned the necessary powers to allow Irish Water to undertake the metering programme.</p><p>It was always anticipated that in the course of installing meters, pre-existing leaks and other latent defects due to the age or condition of the water pipes would be discovered. Accordingly, where a leak occurs, it is not necessarily the case that it was caused by Irish Water&rsquo;s contractors. Irish Water has confirmed to my Department that the company investigated the issue at question in consultation with the householder and it has been concluded that the cause of the leak is not in any way related to the meter installation. This information has been previously communicated to the householder following the investigations that took place.</p><p>The Government has decided to introduce a &ldquo;first fix free policy&rdquo; to assist householders who may have issues with leaks on their property. Under this scheme, Irish Water will deliver a scheme entitling every household to a free fix of the first leak on a customer&rsquo;s water supply pipe . Details of the scheme will be announced by Irish Water shortly.</p><p>It should also be noted that Irish Water has established a dedicated team to deal with representations and queries from public representatives. They may be contacted via email to or by telephone on 1890 278 278.</p></reply>

In this regard, my Department has outlined a number of options in keeping with the Building Control Act 2007 which may be pursued by CIAT with a view to progressing the registration of its Chartered Architectural Technologist members. In May 2013 CIAT presented a case for recognition of Chartered Architectural Technologists as a route to inclusion on the register of Building Surveyors maintained by the Society of Chartered Surveyors of Ireland in line with the Building Control Act 2007. The CIAT case is based on benchmarking the competence of Chartered Architectural Technologists against existing routes to registration as a Building Surveyor. In June 2013 CIAT presented a similar case in respect of inclusion on the register of Architects maintained by the Royal Institution of Architects of Ireland (RIAI) in line with Part 3 of the Building Control Act 2007.</p><p>  The SCSI and the RIAI, as the registration bodies for the relevant professions under the Act of 2007, and as the competent authorities in Ireland for the purposes of the EU Directive on the recognition of Professional Qualifications, are currently considering the cases put forward by CIAT .  Neither I nor my Department have any role in the assessment or validation of professional qualifications in this manner and cannot pre-empt the outcome in either case.  However, should the SCSI or the RIAI as appropriate determine that the competence of the Chartered Architectural Technologists is equivalent to the requirements for inclusion on either register, it would fall to me as Minister to bring forward relevant suitable amendments to the Building Control Act 2007.   </p><p>  It is also worth noting that depending on their personal circumstances, it may be open to Architectural Technologists, who possess the requisite experience and competence in the design of buildings, to seek inclusion on one of the statutory registers. </p><p>  I would therefore encourage those Architectural Technologists who consider they possess the requisite competence in the design of construction works to contact the SCSI or the RIAI in order to pursue registration so that they can avail of the many opportunities that will now be available to registered construction professionals as a consequence of the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014.</p></reply>

The  consolidation of the Defence Forces formations into a smaller number of locations is a key objective in the ongoing defence modernisation programme by becoming a more adaptable and flexible organisation. I am advised by the military authorities that the reorganisation has increased the opportunities for collective training and associated improved military capability. The reorganisation has not impacted on Defence Forces operations and all roles are being carried out in full. The closing and sale of surplus military properties has been very cost effective. For example, military personnel occupied on security and support functions within the four barracks closed on 30 March 2012 have been released for operational duties leading to an efficiency gain of around &euro;5 million per annum. In addition, there are direct cash savings of approximately &euro;1.3 million per annum arising from utilities, maintenance and security duty allowances in the four barracks. There are no plans for further Barrack closures.</p></reply>

As the Deputy may be aware, Ireland does not become party to treaties until it is first in a position to comply with the obligations imposed by them, including the amendment of domestic law as necessary.</p><p>  An interdepartmental committee on the Convention is reviewing the remaining legislative and administrative actions required to enable ratification.  As part of its work programme, the committee has identified issues to be considered by various Departments and examination of these issues is ongoing.  At the request of the committee, the National Disability Authority, the lead statutory agency for the sector, is also assisting in assessing remaining requirements for ratification to ensure that all outstanding issues will be comprehensively addressed.</p><p>  For my Department, one of the key requirements is the enactment of capacity legislation. The programme for Government contains a commitment to introduce a Bill in line with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill, published on 17 July 2013, provides a series of options to support people with impaired capacity to make decisions and exercise their basic rights in line with the principles of the UN Convention. It undertakes a comprehensive reform of existing legislation governing capacity. The Bill will go to Committee Stage shortly. The enactment of this legislation is one of the core elements of the remaining work to be completed to enable ratification by the State of the UN Convention.</p></reply>

Among the roles assigned to the Defence Forces is the provision of Aid to the Civil Power (ATCP).  In practice this means that they provide assistance to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when requested by the Garda&iacute; to do so.  It is a decision for the Garda authorities alone whether they should call on the Defence Forces for assistance. In this regard there is ongoing and close liaison between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces regarding national security matters.</p><p>  For obvious reasons I am not going to disclose operational matters related to the protection of national security.  It is the case however that on-going protest action in and around Shannon Airport has meant that measures have to be put in place to protect this vital part of our transport infrastructure.  Some of this protest action has, at times, potentially put lives at risk.  In the circumstances, the Garda authorities make the decision on whether to call in the Defence Forces for assistance based on their assessment of the threat posed to Shannon Airport and for the protection of passengers, staff and others in and around the airport.</p></reply>

That figure compared with 77  racist  incidents reported to the Council in the corresponding period in 2012.  The report also indicated that the majority of incidents involved verbal harassment (35%), written harassment (17%),  non-verbal harassment e.g offensive look or gesture (7%), discrimination and social inclusion (24%), property damage and racist graffiti (7%). Nine per cent of incidents involved physical violence.</p><p>  Ireland was one of the first states in the EU and, indeed, in the world in developing a National Action Plan Against Racism. When the National Action Plan Against Racism was launched in 2005, it was conceived as a four-year programme to run until the end of 2008. It was designed to provide strategic direction towards developing a more intercultural and inclusive society in Ireland and was also integration driven.  Under the Plan, support was provided towards the development of a number of national and local strategies promoting greater integration in our workplaces, in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the health service, in our education system, in the arts and sports sectors and within our local authorities.  The National Action Plan therefore continues to inform ongoing work.</p><p>  The Office for the Promotion of Migrant Integration in my Department maintains the Government's commitment and focus on anti-racism as a key aspect of integration, diversity management and broader national social policy. The Office continues to work with all the relevant sectors to further progress the integration and diversity management agenda. Many of the initiatives which were instigated through the National Action Plan against Racism 2005-2008 continue to be developed and progressed through the support and work of the Office.</p><p>  A  review of our approach to the integration of migrants was recently launched. This review is intended to provide the basis for a new and updated integration strategy in keeping with the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the integration of migrants and will embrace the issue of racism.  A consultation process was also commenced on 28 March 2014. A considerable number of submissions have already been received from stakeholders, a number of whom will be invited to engage directly with the Cross-Departmental Group on Integration charged with updating the integration strategy.  I expect that the Draft Integration Strategy, when developed, will include a strong anti-racism component.</p></reply>

This Regulation is generally referred to as the Dublin Regulation and establishes the criteria and mechanisms for determining the Member State responsible for examining an application for international protection lodged in one of the Member States by a third-country national or a stateless person.  The Regulation adopted in June 2013 is a recast of an earlier Regulation adopted in February 2003.  Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 118/2014 was adopted in January 2014 for the purpose of amending an earlier Regulation adopted in September 2003 laying down detailed rules for the application of the Dublin Regulation.</p><p>  In accordance with Article 288 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union these Regulations have general application and are binding in their entirety and directly applicable in all Member States including, in this case, Ireland.  The operation in Ireland of the Dublin Regulation is supported by the Refugee Act 1996 (Section 22) Order 2003 (S.I. No. 423 of 2003).  This Order deals primarily with the functions of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal and my Department in relation to the operation of the Dublin Regulation in Ireland.</p><p>  Consultations between my Department and the Office of the Attorney General are ongoing in relation to changes to the national regulatory framework to facilitate the smooth operation in Ireland of the recast Dublin Regulation.  It appears that the most likely outcome of these consultations is that it will be necessary to amend or replace the Order made under section 22 of the Refugee Act.  In any event, it is intended to maintain the key roles in the operation of the Dublin Regulation in Ireland which are currently assigned to the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal by the Order of 2003.</p><p>  Under section 6 of the Refugee Act the Refugee Applications Commissioner is independent in the exercise of his or her functions under the Act.  The Commissioner has informed my Department that, in respect of third-country nationals applying for asylum in Ireland, he is, for the time being, availing of the option provided by Article 17 of the recast Dublin Regulation to decide to examine such an application.  In these circumstances the Dublin Regulation provides that Ireland shall become the Member State responsible and shall assume the obligations associated with that responsibility.</p></reply>

Overall, almost 4,300 asylum seekers are accommodated in 34 centres under contract to RIA located in 16 counties within the State.</p><p>It is not clear from the Deputy's question as to whether there are specific issues of concern. If so, he is welcome to communicate them directly to RIA for investigation. In general, it is the policy of RIA to conduct at least three comprehensive unannounced inspections each year on each of the centres under contract to it. Two of these inspections are carried out by RIA staff and one is carried out by an independent assessor contracted by RIA.  All completed inspection reports on RIA centres, including Clondalkin, carried out since 1 October 2013, have been published on RIA's website - <i>www.ria.gov.ie</i>. This website also provides a range of information and statistics that the Deputy may find useful. Further, all centres are also open to inspection by Environmental Health Officers of the HSE and by other statutory bodies.</p><p>The Direct Provision system has been in place for 14 years and no system can remain static. RIA keeps the services provided at Clondalkin Towers and elsewhere under continuous review and  will seek to adapt and improve conditions in centres for the benefit of residents.</p></reply>

Vetting procedures in this country are in place to protect children and vulnerable adults.  As such they demand rigorous procedures to ensure their integrity and to maintain the highest level of confidence by the public and organisations availing of them.  A full vetting check is conducted for each new application received to ensure that the most recent data available is taken into account. The non-transferability and contemporaneous nature of the certificate protects against the risk of fraud or forgery and is a guarantee of the integrity of the vetting service. It also affords the registered organisation the facility to assess suitability based on the most up to date information available on the applicant. The Deputy will appreciate that the safety of children and vulnerable adults is the primary consideration and this must remain the case.</p><p>  There are certain limited circumstances where organisations can share a single vetting where this is agreed to by the vetting applicant. For example, persons involved in voluntary work may be doing work with more than one voluntary organisation at the same time, and may agree with the vetting applicant to share a single vetting disclosure. Similar arrangements arise in the health sector in regard to persons working as locums, agency nurses or other temporary employees in a number of different organisations, at the same time, or in the education sector where substitute teachers are on panels for substitute teaching in more than one school at the same time.</p><p>  Elements of the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 relating to the disclosure of convictions are under review at present.  It is intended to bring proposals before the Oireachtas to provide that certain old minor convictions will not be disclosed under the provisions of the 2012 Act.  However, very careful consideration would need to be given to any proposal to provide that a person who has been Garda vetted with one organisation can move to a different organisation without having to reapply for a new clearance from the Garda vetting section.</p><p>  This is because once there has been any significant time lapse between one employment and another, the original Garda Vetting Disclosure would not include information regarding any recent criminal convictions, and the second employer could not safely rely on it. Under the Data Protection Acts, any sensitive personal data which employers use in regard to their employees must be current, accurate and up-to-date.  Separately, employers would be exposed to civil liability if they knowingly recruited staff based on out-of-date criminal records information where the person in fact has a more recent criminal conviction.</p><p>  Should vetting be allowed to be portable for a period of two years that would mean that no conviction committed in that two year period would be disclosed.  Which, from a child protection perspective, would have obvious dangers.</p></reply>

There are no plans to change the current pension arrangements in the public service in general or in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in particular. In this regard it should be noted that the new single public service pension scheme was introduced in 2013.  I must also point out that over the course of our recovery from the economic crisis, the Government have consistently ensured that those who are most vulnerable are spared the effects of reductions in expenditure to the fullest extent possible. Indeed, in the most recent FEMPI legislation, those on pensions of less than &euro;32,500 did not have any further reductions imposed on them.</p></reply>

The Court of Justice of the European Union has clarified in a series of decisions in the context of EU Directive 2000/78/EC that national  rules on retirement ages may be set down if they are objectively and reasonably justified by a legitimate social policy aim.  While the wider issues of statutory retirement age and national policy on retirement are outside my brief,  it should be noted that an Interdepartmental Group on Working and Retirement, under the auspices of the Department of Social Protection, is considering  cross-cutting policy issues to support longer working with a view  to improving the sustainability and adequacy of pensions systems in which my Department is participating.   Any issues for equality legislation arising from the work of that group will also of course be considered.</p></reply>

Under the legislation, determination of an individual&rsquo;s eligibility for a medical card is the responsibility of the HSE. The 1970 Health Act obliges the HSE to assess whether a person is unable, without undue hardship, to arrange GP services for themselves and their family, having regard to their overall financial situation and reasonable expenditure. The legislation is clear that qualification for a medical card is means-tested. Medical cards are not awarded  - nor have they ever been - on the basis of a particular illness or disease. Medical cards are issued 'automatically'  - or irrespective of means  - even if an applicant is suffering from a serious medical condition or a life long condition. </p><p>  All medical card and GP visit card holders are subject to a periodic review of eligibility to determine continuing eligibility and the HSE has a very structured protocol in place for the review process and makes every effort to ensure on-going engagement with clients during this process. These reviews must be supported with a range of documentation and this requirement is clearly outlined on the application forms. As a result, where such supporting documentation is not supplied, or is incomplete, to enable the assessment of an application, in accordance with the National Assessment Guidelines, the HSE will issue correspondence to the applicant, specifying the additional information required to progress the assessment of their application. </p><p>  Persons that have been granted a medical card under the &lsquo;financial hardship&rsquo; provisions of the medical card scheme are required, when the subject of a review assessment, to submit all relevant and up-to-date details. This is necessary so that the HSE can make a correct determination of continuing eligibility. If the HSE is made aware that a person has a disability or special needs, assistance will be afforded to help that person complete the application and explain the support documentation they need to send, whether at application stage or at review stage. The local health office can be contacted or LoCall 1890 252 919 to request this assistance. </p><p>  The HSE also makes every effort to provide a person with sufficient time to renew their eligibility. Each month, the HSE analyses the Medical Card Register to identify those medical/GP visit cards that are scheduled for review within three months. A review notification will indicate the card holder should complete a self-assessment or request the card holder to return evidence of household income, assessable outgoings and medical circumstances to enable a full review assessment be conducted by the HSE.   The HSE has increased this notification time to four months in respect of those clients who were granted eligibility on the basis of discretion. This is to allow an additional month to ensure that all pertinent medical and other data is provided for inclusion in the assessment process. </p><p>  A reminder letter is issued a month later if the requested review form details have not been returned at that point. If a person does not return the review form within the time specified, continuing eligibility cannot be confirmed and the medical card cannot be reissued. In these circumstances, or where the review process establishes that a person no longer holds eligibility, the eligibility ceases. </p><p>  Persons are requested to return their completed review forms at least one month in advance of the due expiry date of their existing eligibility. This is to allow the HSE sufficient time to carry out the review and/or to get back to the individuals, if the application is incomplete or requires any further details to be furnished. </p><p>  Where a review form is returned, but not fully completed by the expiry date, it is HSE policy to extend the eligibility of the client for a reasonable period of time until the review is carried out and a final decision made on the person's continuing eligibility, once there is appropriate communication from the client. Medical card holders who genuinely engage with the review of their medical card eligibility will not have their eligibility withdrawn before that review is complete. </p><p>  Where an applicant indicates on their review application that medical evidence has been previously submitted relating to a life-long medical condition, and this has been confirmed by the HSE, the HSE will not request further medical evidence in this regard. The applicant will, however, be required to submit all other up-to-date information material to a review assessment.</p><p>  Eligibility for a medical card only exists for so long as a person continues to meet the criteria set out in the Health Act. The legislation requires a person to notify the HSE of any change in their circumstances, such as income, expenditure, medical or social issues, which disentitles them to a medical card. In practice, very few people do so. As a result, the HSE has an obligation to take measures to ensure that the medical card register is as accurate as possible and that its voted budget is being spent appropriately in the medical card scheme. One recognised auditing practice, which the HSE now carries out, is to undertake random reviews. The selection criteria on which such random reviews occur varies from time- to-time.  </p><p>  Therefore, all card holders - irrespective of the basis on which the card was awarded &ndash; may be subject to a periodic review of eligibility to determine continuing eligibility.  The Deputies will be aware, each person who has eligibility to a medical card or a GP visit card receives a plastic card on which a &ldquo;valid to&rdquo; date is printed.  This is the latest date that a review may be conducted in respect of that person.   Notwithstanding the &ldquo;valid to&rdquo; date printed on the card, the HSE reserves the right to review eligibility, at any time, and take appropriate action in circumstances where the cardholder does not establish that he/she continues to fulfil  the criteria for eligibility under the Medical Card / GP Visit Card National Assessment Guidelines.</p><p>  A person&rsquo;s GP is also kept informed of any review notifications of their patients. GPs are advised three months in advance of the review dates of their patients&rsquo; GP visit cards/medical cards and, subsequently, the following month and the month after that, if the patient has not returned the review form by that time.   </p><p>  GPs have full electronic visibility of the medical card panel of patients available to them and have the facility to electronically allow temporary extension of eligibility for expiring cards where a sensitive renewal is appropriate. The temporary extension may also be allowed where they are aware that a person is still availing of services but there may be something that prevents them from carrying out a standard review, e.g. a blind person with little family support.  </p><p>  Given that over 40% of the population, or about 2 million people, qualify for a medical card or GP visit card, the scale of the administration of the GMS scheme is significant. Over 700,000 individuals were assessed by the HSE in 2013. Well in excess of 95% of applications were processed within the target of 15 working days. I am satisfied that  both applications and reviews are undertaken in a facilitative manner and that every support is afforded by the HSE.</p><p>  The HSE is currently examining how individuals, who are not entitled to a medical card, could still receive services that meet their needs. This issue is being addressed in a manner that includes all of the services and supports provided by the HSE with as much flexibility as is available and at a local level. </p></reply>

The reasons encompass a range of factors including training, work environment, career opportunities, lifestyle and quality of life issues and remuneration. Last July I established a group under the chairmanship of Professor Brian MacCraith to carry out a strategic review of medical training and career structures. The Group is to make recommendations aimed at improving the retention of medical graduates in the public health system and planning for future service needs.  It provided an Interim Report in December 2013 focused on training. Last month the Group submitted its second report to me dealing with medical career structures and pathways following completion of specialist training. The final report of the Group will deal with workforce planning and this is due to be submitted by the end of June 2014. The work of the Group is fundamental to ensuring that consultant positions in the public health service are attractive to medical graduates. I have also emphasised to the HSE the importance of addressing the working hours of NCHDs and moving as quickly as possible to compliance with the provisions of the European Working Time Directive.</p><p>  A proportion of nurses have traditionally gone abroad following graduation. More recently, given the moratorium on recruitment, the numbers going abroad had increased. The Nurse Graduate Initiative was developed in order to achieve savings on agency costs and to provide an opportunity for a substantial number of recently-qualified nurses and midwives to work in Ireland for a two-year period. This Initiative gives recently graduated nurses the opportunity to gain valuable experience and additional skills at a time when job opportunities in the public service are limited, though nurses continue to be recruited to permanent posts where service demands require this. Nearly 500 nurses and midwives have commenced employment in recent months on the Initiative, with over 200 others currently going through the recruitment process.</p><p>  With regard to the numbers of nursing graduates required, a workforce planning exercise carried out in 2013 to forecast future staffing requirements as part of the Review of the Undergraduate Nursing and Midwifery Degree Programmes has indicated that the overall number of trainee nurses and midwives currently undertaking the programmes, 1,570 places in total, is considered to be sufficient to meet demand. With regard to medicine, in 2006, the Fottrell Report recommended an annual intake of 725 students into Irish medical schools based on the projected medical manpower needs of the health service. This target number has now been reached and sufficient intern posts are available to enable each graduate to register with the Medical Council of Ireland.</p><p>  The ability of the public service to attract and retain high quality frontline staff shapes the extent to which the HSE can maintain and develop the range of health services required.</p><p>  Where frontline staffing shortages exist, the HSE makes alternative arrangements to ensure service provision, including recourse to agency and locum cover. However, it is preferable that sufficient numbers of doctors, nurses and NCHDs are recruited to permanent posts to support the most efficient and effective delivery of services.</p></reply>

The Working Group will examine and make high-level recommendations relating to training and career pathways for doctors with a view to improving graduate retention in the public health system, planning for future service needs, and realising maximum benefit from investment in medical education and training.

However, it is Government policy to move to a consultant delivered service and there has been a significant increase in the number of consultants (Whole Time Equivalents) over the past decade. Under section 57 of the Health Act 2004, the procedure for the approval of consultant posts in the public system and the determination of the number and type of appointments, are matters for the HSE. Since the establishment of the HSE, the number increased by 723 from 1,947 in January 2005 to 2,670 in December 2013. However there are some specialties in which there is an international shortage and which have been traditionally difficult to fill, regardless of the salary scale. There are also some hospitals to which it has historically been difficult to attract applicants.</p><p>  Though the HSE has the capacity to recruit where it is necessary to do so in order to ensure patient safety and to support service delivery, there is evidence that there are, at present, difficulties in recruiting consultants. The ability of the public service to attract and retain consultants shapes the extent to which the HSE can maintain and develop the range of health services required. </p><p>  I am currently progressing measures to ensure that we will have an adequate supply of highly skilled consultants and NCHDs.

At a high level, data on national health expenditure can be compared and expressed as per capita expenditure, public versus private expenditure, as a percentage of GDP/GNP, or in terms of purchasing power parities (PPPs).  At the lower level of specific service areas, it is much more difficult to arrive at valid comparisons between countries.  The reason for this is that health systems differ widely in terms of structure, models of service delivery, and definitions of functions.  For example, what constitutes an outpatient service in one country may not have a direct comparison in another country.</p><p>  Recognising these difficulties, the international organisations, led by the OECD, have in recent years developed a new international standard for health accounting called the System of Health Accounts (SHA).  The SHA is designed to provide detailed and standardised information on expenditure according to a three way cross-classification.  The three axes are health service functions, health service providers, and health service funders.  The resulting data will cover both public and private expenditure and will be a valuable source for health service evaluation, planning and international benchmarking.</p><p>  Ireland is currently engaged in a major project to compile and submit national SHA data.  The project is jointly led by the Department of Health and the Central Statistics Office and will submit SHA data for 2013 by March, 2016.  An EU implementing regulation is in the process of being finalised which will make annual compilation of the SHA compulsory for all member states from 2016 onwards.</p></reply>

A significant reform programme is currently underway which will provide a clinically driven, nationally co-ordinated system, supported by improved technology.  In that regard, additional funding of &euro;3.6 million and 43 staff have been provided in the National Service Plan 2014.  Ongoing performance improvement projects include; the single national control system, to be completed in 2015; the Intermediate Care Service, for routine and non-emergency transfers, allowing emergency vehicles to focus on emergency situations; the move to on-duty rostering and the development of a national rostering system.</p><p>  I would also like to draw the Deputy's attention to three separate reviews of ambulance services currently underway.  HIQA is examining the governance arrangements for pre-hospital emergency services; the HSE and Dublin City Council have commissioned a joint review of Dublin ambulance services to determine the optimal and most cost-effective model of ambulance services delivery for the city; and the UK Association of Ambulance Chief Executives is undertaking a comprehensive capacity review of the NAS, to determine what level of resourcing, in terms of staff, vehicles, skills and distribution, is required to deliver a safe and effective service now and into the future.

My Department and the Health Insurance Authority (HIA) monitor the factors that contribute to costs on an ongoing basis.</p><p>  The health insurance market is challenged by factors such as an ageing population, a reduction in numbers holding private health insurance and constant pressures on claims costs.  In this regard, I appointed an independent chair to work with health insurers, the HIA and my own Department, to identify effective strategies for costs management.  Mr. Pat McLoughlin's first report, published at the end of December, made a number of important recommendations now being pursued by insurers, the HSE and my Department.  These recommendations include measures to control costs, greatly improve clinical audit, streamline claims processing and address fraud, waste and abuse in the industry.  Work on Phase II of Mr. McLoughlin's report is progressing well and will be completed as soon as possible.</p><p>  I am keen to create the best possible environment within which more people will want to obtain and retain private health insurance cover that is affordable, competitive and meets consumers' needs was we prepare to move to Universal Health Insurance.</p><p>  In particular, I want to encourage younger people to join as early as possible.  With this in mind, I will shortly be announcing important initiatives from 2015 in relation to Lifetime Community Rating and discounted rates for young adults.  Lifetime Community Rating is intended to encourage people to join health insurance schemes early and to retain their private health insurance cover.  Discounted rates for young adults are intended to help address the sharp increase in the cost of insurance faced by young people or their parents around the age of 21 years, when child and student discounts normally cease.  My Department is working on the legislative changes required to implement these measures and it is intended that these two initiatives will operate from 2015, allowing for an appropriate notice period for both customers and insurers.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-05-14a.534.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014051400094#WRAA00500"><p>As I have stated in the House on previous occasions, the prevention of Healthcare Associated Infections (HCAIs) and colonisation/infection of patients with antimicrobial-resistant organisms (AMR) such as MRSA is one of my priorities in protecting patient safety.  HCAIs represent a major cause of preventable harm and increased health care costs.</p><p>The prevalence of MRSA has dropped considerably in recent years.  There has been a decrease of 62.5% in reported cases of MRSA from 2006 to 2013.  However, there are concerns about the rates of resistance of other organisms as detailed in the EARS- Net Report referred to below.</p><p>The Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) collates information from hospitals on health care associated infections and antimicrobial resistant organisms such as MRSA, Clostridium difficile etc.   The most recent European Antimicrobial Surveillance System Report (EARS - Net) for Quarter 4, 2013 was published on March 27th.   The full Report is available at .</p><p>The HSE has implemented a number of national initiatives in the control and prevention of HCAIs for many years, including:</p><p>- SARI 2001-2010 (The Strategy for the Control of Antimicrobial Resistance in Ireland) which specifically outlined the national strategy for prevention of AMR and was launched by the Minister of Health in 2001.</p><p>- HSE &lsquo;Say No to Infection&rsquo; which focused on both HCAIs and AMR, launched in 2007</p><p>- The RCPI &amp;amp; HSE National Clinical Programme for the prevention and control of HCAIs and AMR which commenced in late 2010.</p><p>- Public reporting of HCAIs and AMR in Irish acute hospitals:</p><p>- HCAIs Prevalence Study 2006 and 2012</p><p>- S. aureus  bloodstream infection (reported quarterly since 2007) &ndash; this includes public reporting of MRSA rates per hospital</p><p>- Alcohol hand rub consumption (reported bi-annually since 2007)</p><p>- Antibiotic consumption (reported bi-annually since 2007)</p><p>- Hand hygiene compliance (reported bi-annually since 2011)</p><p>The overall aim of the National Clinical Programme for the prevention and control of HCAIs and AMR is that every health care worker and all parts of the health care system recognise that the prevention and control of HCAIs and AMR is a key element of clinical and non-clinical governance. Our health care systems have processes in place to ensure safe health care is reliably delivered irrespective of the health care setting.  The programme focuses on getting three basic practices right every time we care for our patients, these are hand hygiene, using antimicrobials appropriately (antimicrobial stewardship) &amp;amp; preventing medical device-related infections i.e., IV lines/drips, urinary catheters.  If the above three measures are applied consistently and reliably every time health care workers care for their patients/residents/client then a significant proportion of HCAIs, including that caused by AMR will be prevented.</p><p>While I welcome the reducing trend in reported rates of MRSA in Ireland, MRSA rates are comparably high with other countries.  We must systematically build our actions and processes to continue to reduce the prevalence of MRSA in Ireland.</p><p>In December last I launched and endorsed the second National Clinical Guideline, Prevention and Control Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).   This National Clinical Guideline provides practical guidance on prevention and control measures for MRSA to improve patient care, minimise patient morbidity and mortality and to help contain health care costs.  The guideline has been developed for all health care staff involved in the care of patients, residents or clients who may be at risk of or may have MRSA in acute hospitals, obstetrics and neonates, nursing homes/long stay residential units and the community.</p><p>I might add that I have ensured that Patient Safety has been made a priority within the HSE's Annual Service Plan through specific measures focused on quality and patient safety including HCAIs, Medication safety and implementation of Early Warning Score systems.  My officials meet the HSE each month on the Service Plan and patient safety is a standing item on that agenda.</p></reply>

This will be available on my Department&rsquo;s website -  www.dttas.ie</p><p>  The consultation covered all elements of aviation policy. The draft Policy takes account of all the submissions received.  When published, stakeholders will have an opportunity to provide further input before the publication of the final document later this year.</p><p>  This new policy will be designed to ensure that the right conditions exist for a flourishing aviation industry into the future. It will facilitate the expansion of the industry, help make it more competitive, tackle barriers to growth and facilitate the development of new air transport links.  Given that the country's largest airport is located in Fingal and the fact that there is a large cluster of aviation industries located around the airport, the new policy should over time have a positive economic impact in the area</p></reply>

However, it was concluded that it would be more appropriate to include such a provision in primary legislation.</p><p>  The measure was therefore included in Section 14(1) of the Taxi Regulation Act, 2013 which was commenced with effect from the 6th April 2014.  Consequently the industry has had an 18 month period longer than envisaged under the Taxi Regulation Review Report under which transfers were allowed to take place.</p><p>  It is not open to me to provide for a derogation from the requirements of primary legislation.</p><p>  In regard to the particular case raised by Deputy McGrath, I am advised that the NTA has been in contact with the person concerned and the process of completing the transfer of a taxi licence to her is expected to be concluded shortly.</p></reply>

While some inspectors have since been appointed with different backgrounds, there is a Labour Court decision which confines the posts to Public Health Nurses.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-05-14a.598.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1055" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014051400096#WRCC01700"><p>Firstly, I would like to acknowledge the importance of the services delivered by Darndale Belcamp Integrated Childcare Service Ltd. to some 260 children across the areas of Darndale, Belcamp and Moatview. In 2013 the Centre incurred expenditure of &euro;2.022 million and received funding amounting to &euro;1.960 million resulting in a deficit of &euro;62,000. The Centre employs approximately 100 staff, including Community Employment participants.  I understand that the Centre has been experiencing cash flow difficulties over recent weeks and that this has given rise to concerns regarding its future operation.  The Centre has been in discussions with the Child and Family Agency, as one of a number of state agencies which provides funding to support the provision of services at the Centre.  In order to alleviate the immediate cash flow difficulty the Agency prepaid funding due to the Centre in May and June.  I would expect that the Agency will be open to providing some further pre-payments to the Centre if this is of assistance.  </p><p>  The Chairperson of the Centre has also been in correspondence with my predecessor, Minister Fitzgerald, regarding the current difficulties.  Minister Fitzgerald advised, inter alia, that in her view the wider solution to the current difficulties would need to have regard to the overall provision of early years services in the area.  This is important as we need to ensure that all available resources to support these key services are maximised.  The Minister also expressed the view, with which I concur, that this will require some time and space.</p><p>  The Deputy will appreciate that I am still in the process of familiarising myself with the issues involved.  In this context, I have asked my officials to meet with the Child and Family Agency and with Pobal (which administers a number of childcare schemes on behalf of my Department) to explore all possible solutions to the current difficulties having regard to the overall provision of early years services.  I can assure the Deputy that this matter is being given priority attention.</p></reply>
